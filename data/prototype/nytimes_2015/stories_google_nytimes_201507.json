Now, as he and his team face a shifting landscape in which phones and apps are starting to rival computers and websites, he is in a race to make Google \u201cthe Google of Apps.\u201d", "Mr. Singhal\u2019s efforts were profiled in Thursday\u2019s New York Times.", "Following are excerpts from the interview, which has been condensed and edited:", "Conor Dougherty: Is the classic Google search box dying?", "Amit Singhal: Let\u2019s go back and figure out what\u2019s happening in the world because that\u2019s how I work. Mobile revolution is full force. Everyone is walking around with more computing powers in their pockets than my desktop had five years back. On top of that, this computing power is connected to the largest data centers on this earth, so fundamentally the computing on my device is infinite.", "So: Everyone is living on mobile devices. What\u2019s so different about mobile devices? And when you start thinking from first principles and simple physics and muscle movements, you start thinking, of course the screens are small, No. 1, typing is incredibly hard, that\u2019s No. 2, the device is always with you. No. 4: I live in apps. Eighty-five percent of user time is going in apps.", "Now, when you think about those four things, you have to rethink what search means pretty much from first principles again. And that\u2019s what we have been doing and actually we saw this coming five years back and we put all the machinery in place to get to where we are going.", "C.D.: When I go watch someone on a desktop, Google is their gateway to the entire Internet, and when I watch somebody use a phone, it\u2019s apps. So how do you deal with that?", "A.S.: We are in a phase where search on mobile is growing at a very, very healthy pace. We recently told the world that we get more mobile searches than desktop searches in 10 countries. So mobile search is growing at a very healthy pace.", "However, my job is not to just look at the trend today, my job is to look at what\u2019s beyond the horizon. And beyond the horizon there is so much more people can do on their devices that is not possible today. Take a simple example. If my restaurant review app does not cut a deal with a table reservation service, then while I\u2019m reading the reviews is there a way for me to book a table without having to pop out of there, cut and paste some text with me possibly or retype it, which is incredibly hard, into yet another app?", "On a mobile device when you are living in apps and whenever you need assistance or help, Google should be right there and with Now on Tap we will try to be there.", "C.D.: How much easier would your life be if apps didn\u2019t exist?", "A.S.: We don\u2019t really think of it this way.", "C.D.: Some people say we are moving to a \u201cpush\u201d world from a \u201cpull\u201d world, where you had to tell Google what you wanted.", "A.S.: This is covered under the third point I talked about \u2013 the device is always with me. And I just take it out and habitually unlock it, not having to pull something. And in those cases, push is a very fine paradigm.", "But is pull going to end? No. Absolutely not, because no matter how much we advance computer science it would be almost impossible to anticipate 100 percent of the time what you need. So you would have to pull things that you need.", "C.D.: One of the things that was powerful about Google the search engine is that it was the platform from which you accessed the web. And it feels like now you\u2019re trying to stitch several things together, like Gmails and browsing history that go to Google Now, to know more things about people.", "A.S.: I think of it as the web was the platform. Anyone could publish anything on that platform, there were no barriers to that. And Google was the intelligence layer on that, that allowed you to use that platform effectively. That intelligence is still needed. The platform has now moved to apps. But your need to find the best service for what you need to do has not gone away.", "C.D.: People are online so much now. How do you see through the noise? Sometimes people search for \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d because they want tickets and sometimes it\u2019s because they\u2019re at a dinner arguing over who played which boyfriend.", "A.S.: Context and probability. It\u2019s very simple. There is no rocket science here. Context is typically time of day, what kind of searches go up and down. And what is the probability that someone would want to know this thing about \u201cHunger Games\u201d or do this about \u201cHunger Games,\u201d watch the show and so on and so forth, versus learn about the actors.", "And we basically build our Knowledge Graph where we take the context-conditioned probability and we built our Knowledge Graph sorted by that. So, let\u2019s pick something.", "(Mr. Singhal pulls out his phone.)", "I\u2019m one of those weird guys who doesn\u2019t follow \u201cHunger Games.\u201d", "C.D.: My wife got me into it.", "A.S.: So apparently \u201cHunger Games\u201d right now actually means \u201cMockingjay.\u201d I know nothing about it, so I\u2019m reading from my Knowledge Graph. And it is part of the film series \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d \u2013 people want to know what are the other movies in the series, and people want to know who was in it. So Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson \u2013 oh, Liam Hemsworth I know. He\u2019s Thor!", "C.D.: Actually, it\u2019s his brother.", "A.S.: Clearly, now you\u2019re finding the inner geek in me. So here we go. We have sorted through the noise for you. Simple: Context plus probability.", "C.D.: It\u2019s hard not to be dazzled by all these inventions. But if you\u2019re a company that is used to owning our viewfinder to the Internet, but now all of a sudden there are all these things people do on their phones that you may not be able to see, I wonder if it puts you in a point where \u2013 this sounds crazy \u2013 but you almost have to remind people that Google exists.", "A.S.: First of all, on the web we built an amazing thing. It was so much more useful to the user so they came. It takes four letters \u2013 B-I-N-G \u2013 typed into Google to go to another place, right? But fundamentally you have to build something that does not get in the way of our users. It gives them what they are looking for in the most natural way. On desktop it was moving your cursor and typing a bunch of letters. On a mobile phone that paradigm has to become mobile, which means maybe talking to your phone, tapping on various objects. So the needs are still there.", "C.D.: How do you organize your team around these paradigms? Do you have like Old Google and New Google?", "A.S.: That never works. The way we do it is we basically have amazing people who have been running Google search for a very long time. And now we\u2019ve built all those smarts and algorithmic insights into this new interface. So algorithms and learnings that we have had for 15 years of running Google are actually coming in tremendously handy in building the future. Without those, we would be lost today."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/business/in-microsofts-nokia-debacle-a-view-of-an-industrys-feet-of-clay.html": ["Let\u2019s call it the $7.5 billion lesson.", "That\u2019s the amount Microsoft wrote off on Nokia\u2019s phone unit, which it bought a little over a year ago for what it said was $9.5 billion. Considering that the deal included $1.5 billion in cash, the write-off means Microsoft now values a business that once controlled 41 percent of the global handset market at just a small fraction of the purchase price.", "Thanks in large part to the huge accounting charge, Microsoft reported its largest quarterly loss ever last week ($3.2 billion). It was only the third loss in its history as a public company.", "\u201cIf you were talking about any other industry, this would be considered a catastrophe that\u2019s the equivalent to a natural disaster,\u201d said Horace Dediu, who spent eight years at Nokia during its heyday and is now at the San Francisco research firm Clayton Christensen Institute, which studies disruptive technologies.", "This being the technology business, Microsoft\u2019s still relatively new chief executive, Satya Nadella, gets credit for swiftly confronting reality and taking the hit to earnings. This may have been easier given that Mr. Nadella opposed the proposed deal in an initial poll of top Microsoft officials. But Steven A. Ballmer, his predecessor, was determined to push the deal through as a capstone to his long tenure as chief executive. Even after the deal was revised, and Mr. Nadella issued a public statement supporting it, two directors voted against it. Both have since left the board.", "Microsoft\u2019s spokesman, Frank X. Shaw, said it was normal for there to be internal debate over major acquisitions. Still, it\u2019s rare for there to be open board dissent once final terms of a deal have been struck.", "Microsoft is also in good company. Google abandoned its foray into smartphones when it sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo last year. But it has written off just $378 million related to the $12.5 billion Motorola acquisition. Amazon wrote off an even more modest $170 million last October, acknowledging that its Fire phone was a flop.", "\u201cWe try to learn from everything we do as we launch new opportunities,\u201d said Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer at the time, Thomas J. Szkutak, invoking the positive \u201clearning\u201d spin that technology companies typically put on failed ventures.", "But far more was at stake for Microsoft than for Google or Amazon, since the main point of the Nokia deal was to support Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, which, in turn, was a crucial element in Microsoft\u2019s \u201cmobile first\u201d strategy. Now both handset operating systems and hardware are pretty much global duopolies, with Google and Apple dominating software and Samsung and Apple dominating hardware. Microsoft has jettisoned the strategy.", "Microsoft\u2019s \u201cgrand scheme was to have a single platform that ran on PCs, laptops, tablets and phones, and to be able to sell applications that run Windows,\u201d said Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University who specializes in network economics and electronic commerce. \u201cThat failed.\u201d", "Mr. Dediu said it was hard to put all the blame on Microsoft, since so many others had met a similar fate. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t believe that such a catastrophe could occur this fast,\u201d he said. Microsoft \u201cjust couldn\u2019t imagine that a company that was once as strong and dominant as Nokia could have virtually no value.\u201d", "He compared the swift rise of Apple and the withering fortunes of Nokia, BlackBerry and other once-thriving manufacturers to the arrival of an infectious virus. \u201cWe tend to think the strong will survive,\u201d Mr. Dediu said. \u201cBut a virus is a very small thing that kills big things.\u201d", "He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say Microsoft was foolish and blame the chief executive. But when it happens to everyone, it\u2019s an extinction event. A whole bunch of companies were disrupted. And it happened in the blink of an eye.\u201d", "Even so, as lessons go, $7.5 billion is pretty steep tuition. When I asked Microsoft what it had gotten for its money, its spokesman, Mr. Shaw, agreed that the speed of the changes in the industry had taken the company by surprise. \u201cEverything always looks different with the benefit of hindsight,\u201d he said.", "Microsoft has now embarked on what Mr. Nadella said is no less than a \u201creinvention\u201d of the company. In an email to employees this month explaining the shift, Mr. Nadella said, \u201cWe are moving from a strategy to grow a stand-alone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem.\u201d", "Mr. Shaw stressed that Microsoft would continue to manufacture Windows phones and other products, and that it would introduce a new line of Lumia phones this fall. But they will be differentiated products tailored to narrower market segments, like business customers concerned about security.", "\u201cOne thing we learned is that if we offer differentiated products that focus on the things we do best, those products do well,\u201d Mr. Shaw said. \u201cInstead of just thinking about our products running on our devices, we\u2019re thinking about how we reach people, no matter what device they\u2019re using. Our goal is to bring them home to Windows, where they\u2019ll have a better, differentiated experience.\u201d", "As Mr. Nadella put it, \u201cOur reinvention will be centered on creating mobility of experiences across the entire device family, including phones.\u201d", "As a result, much is riding on Microsoft\u2019s new operating system, Windows 10, which it introduced this week.", "Perhaps most important, Mr. Shaw said Microsoft recognized a pressing need to innovate: \u201cIf you miss the first wave, you have to hang on and then drive or anticipate the next wave. We want to be part of the next wave of disruption.\u201d", "That, of course, is far easier said than done, especially since the next wave may already be upon us.", "Apple has already made a big splash with its Apple Watch, which the company has said is exceeding sales projections.", "Microsoft introduced its own wearable computing device, the Microsoft Band, last year, months before Apple. The Band offers many of the same features as the Apple Watch, at a lower price. It works with multiple operating systems, unlike the Apple Watch, which works only with iOS. While not an unqualified hit with tech writers (neither is the Apple Watch), the Band has garnered many positive reviews.", "Microsoft hasn\u2019t released any sales figures, but the Band seems to have barely dented consumer consciousness. It looks like a clunky fitness tracker, not a sleek high-end watch. The Apple Watch, by contrast, is already an instantly recognizable status symbol and fashion accessory.", "Microsoft said it never positioned the Band as a watch, and thus it shouldn\u2019t be compared with the Apple Watch. But given that the Apple Watch also serves as a fitness device, has Microsoft already missed the next wave, the shift from the pocket to the wrist?", "\u201cIt\u2019s a valid question,\u201d Mr. Dediu said. \u201cIt\u2019s not automatic that you can transition success from one platform to another.

Those gilded connections did not shield one of North Korea\u2019s most powerful men from the wrath of the young new leader, the 30-something Kim Jong-un, and for reasons that no one outside the inner sanctums of Pyongyang knows, Jang Song-thaek suffered a bloody downfall.", "On Dec. 12, 2013, two years after Kim took office, Jang, 67, was probably executed by firing squad, his death described in the official media as befitting \u201chuman scum,\u201d a man who was \u201cworse than a dog.\u201d There were rumors that he was actually thrown to a pack of attack dogs; these were later discounted.

But in a tweak of the conventional idea that North Korea is a monolith, the authors of \u201cNorth Korea Confidential,\u201d Daniel Tudor and James Pearson, both of whom have lived in South Korea, note that personal rivalries have long divided the North Korean elite, and that a shadowy body, the Organization and Guidance Department, may possess even more power than Kim. The exit of Jang, who was North Korea\u2019s most important conduit to its main benefactor, China, and who had built a patronage system of thousands of followers, was a sign, the authors say, of the deadly competition at the top of North Korea.", "The bankrupt nation that brandishes its nuclear weapons in the face of the United States is so opaque, and so cut off from the rest of the world, that reliable reporting about it is rare.

Tudor, a former correspondent for The Economist, and Pearson, a Reuters reporter, have pieced together their story from North Korean insiders, defectors, diplomats and traders, and from a careful reading of texts in English, Korean and Chinese. They focus on topics they can find out about: the changing lifestyles influenced, in part, by mobile phones; the thumb drives that have spread South Korean soaps to an appreciative audience; an economy that at the grass roots is somewhat privatized; the elite factions; and the gulag-like prison system. They have less to say about the military and nuclear weapons. Their book may lack the panache of Barbara Demick\u2019s \u201cNothing to Envy\u201d or the depth of Blaine Harden\u2019s \u201cThe Great Leader and the Fighter Pilot,\u201d two journalistic classics on North Korea.

Private trade keeps the population afloat, a way of life that emerged as a survival technique during the devastating famine of the 1990s and has blossomed since. Women are the dominant traders in society: They run kiosks, make and sell food, and operate small import-export businesses. Some rent their apartments by the hour to couples looking for some privacy. The preferred time is the afternoon, when the apartment owner\u2019s kids are at school and her husband is at work, and she can go for a walk for an hour or so. The authors write: \u201cThe process is very simple, but it acts as a reasonable summary of the people\u2019s adaptation to post-famine North Korea: It is illegal; it is informal; it corresponds to basic human needs; and it is 100\u202fpercent capitalist.\u201d", "One of the barriers to rigorous reporting on North Korea is the regime\u2019s prohibition on foreign journalists.

So far, the Republican National Committee, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker have already criticized him for his comments.", "After today, Republican commentators and campaigns will have far fewer reservations about attacking Mr. Trump.

They have thumbed their noses at Wall Street and its preoccupation with quarterly financial results and have thrown money at things as diverse as computer eyeglasses (Google Glass, which the company is no longer aiming at consumers) and driverless cars.", "When Eric Schmidt was brought on as chief executive, back in 2001, Mr. Brin told The San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a bit of chaperone, providing adult supervision.\u201d And when Mr. Schmidt stepped down 10 years later, he tweeted, \u201cDay-to-day adult supervision no longer needed!\u201d", "That may have been premature.", "Before the latest earnings announcement, Google shares had badly trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock average over the last two years, dropping over 7 percent compared with a gain of more than 10 percent for the S.&P. 500.

But her crisp, clear delivery, quick mastery of complicated issues and focus on \u201cdiscipline in expense management,\u201d as she put it at last week\u2019s news conference, drew an immediate chorus of raves from analysts.

That said, this preceded her arrival and clearly comes from Sergey, Larry and the board. But this is reinforced by their bringing in Ruth. She can parachute in and execute on that vision,\u201d he said.", "That a Wall Street veteran like Ms. Porat would join Google, which has cultivated its image as a Silicon Valley maverick despite its huge market capitalization (which now stands at $454 billion, second only to Apple\u2019s), came as a surprise to many in Silicon Valley.", "But Ms. Porat, 57, had an almost perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the job if Google was maturing and looking for more credibility with investors. Not only was she a chief financial officer and former head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s financial institutions group, but she had worked on many technology deals as a mergers and acquisitions specialist, including Google\u2019s initial public stock offering.

It\u2019s hard for Alex (Natalia Tena), an expatriate British photographer, to make a living in Barcelona, where they live. A lot of their friends have moved away. Sergi (David Verdaguer) is preparing for exams that will give him a full-time teaching license. They seem to be in their late 20s or early 30s, at the still young but not that young stage of life when career paths start to narrow and choices begin to seem newly consequential.", "Alex is offered a yearlong residency in Los Angeles, 10,000 kilometers from Barcelona, the kind of opportunity that is almost impossible to refuse. She doesn\u2019t want to refuse it, and Sergi doesn\u2019t want her to, and their separation is the subject of Carlos Marques-Marcet\u2019s astute, formally impressive film. The long-distance relationship is not an uncommon phenomenon in contemporary life or, for that matter, in modern movies.

Where was the picture taken? Why didn\u2019t she tell me she was going there?) Looking at zoomed-in satellite images of faraway cities can feel like a cheap and easy substitute for being there.", "As the days stretch into months (the film keeps count as we jump ahead at random intervals), Alex and Sergi discover the limits of these tools. The filmmaker, in contrast, makes ingenious use of them, finding novel ways of placing screens within his carefully composed shots. For a while it seems as if Google, Facebook and Skype must be the sponsors of \u201c10.000 km.\u201d But this isn\u2019t product placement; it\u2019s life as we know it. Those companies are collaborators, makers of images and enablers of feeling.", "The reality of our dependence on them is both beautiful and dreadful.

But there are other moments when the chance to see the face of a lover an ocean and a continent away feels like a miracle.", "The director\u2019s discipline is remarkable, and also a bit constricting. His camera splits its time between the velvety shadows of the Barcelona apartment and the spartan whiteness of Alex\u2019s place in Los Angeles. For the viewer, Alex and Sergi exist in isolation.

Every 10 years, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences surveys the astronomical community and produces a prioritized wish list for the next decade. This survey, which happens next in 2020, serves as a blueprint for Congress and NASA.", "AURA has done this before. Back in 1995, the organization put out a report, led by Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories, calling for a space telescope to succeed the Hubble. That became the James Webb Space Telescope, designed to look for the first stars and galaxies in the universe, and it is on target for launching in 2018, 23 years later.", "\u201cIn the modern era,\u201d Dr. Mountain said, \u201conly space scientists are this patient.\u201d", "But the cost of the Webb telescope swelled from an initial budget in 1996 of $1.6 billion to nearly $9 billion, acting like a wrecking ball to the rest of NASA\u2019s space science budget.

The sun, for example, is 10 billion times brighter than the Earth. The future space telescope would be equipped with an internal coronagraph, a disk that blocks light from the central star, making a dim planet more visible, and perhaps eventually a star shade that would float miles out in front of it to do the same thing. Investing in this light-suppression technology now might prevent the cost overruns that led to the Webb telescope\u2019s nearly being canceled a few years ago.", "Which raises the delicate issue of how much this would all cost.", "Lacking the kind of detailed design from which estimates could be reliably made, Dr. Mountain and his colleagues said only that it would qualify as what NASA calls a \u201cflagship mission,\u201d like Hubble. That puts it in the ballpark of $10 billion, the same as the cost of CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider, where the Higgs boson was discovered three years ago.", "I used to think $10 billion was a lot of money before TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the $700 billion bailout that saved the banks in 2008 and apparently has brought happy days back to Wall Street. Compared with this, the science budget is chump change, lunch money at a place like Goldman Sachs. But if you think this is not a bargain, you need look only as far as your pocket. Companies like Google and Apple have leveraged modest investments in computer science in the 1960s into trillions of dollars of economic activity. Not even Arthur C. Clarke, the vaunted author and space-age prophet, saw that coming.", "Which is to say that all that NASA money \u2014 whether for planetary probes or space station trips \u2014 is spent on Earth, on things that we like to say we want more of: high technology, education, a more skilled work force, jobs, pride in American and human innovation, not to mention greater cosmic awareness, a dose of perspective on our situation here among the stars.", "Even if we never discover even a single microbe anywhere else, the money spent on the search for life out there will make life better for those of us stuck here on Earth.", "There is nothing to be gained by delaying.

In the article, the 56-year-old Dr. Seuss himself revealed his formula \u2014 \u201clogical insanity\u201d \u2014 while the president of Random House, Bennett Cerf, was said to have called Geisel \u201cthe only genius on his list,\u201d which included, The New Yorker reminded its readers, William Faulkner.", "At the time that profile appeared, the pages of a nearly finished picture book called \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d were probably sitting in Dr. \u00adSeuss\u2019 files at his home in La Jolla, Calif. It was never released in Geisel\u2019s lifetime, but now, more than two decades after his death in 1991, \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d is being published. It\u2019s happy news \u2014 first, because the book is, if not top-flight Seuss, a very good example of his particular genius for distilling both the spirit of his times and the timeless mind-set of children. With its galloping anapests, cockamamie creatures and kids off on an everyday adventure that turns hallucinogenic, this late arrival will slip easily into the collection that changed how Americans learn to read \u2014 Dr. Seuss books like \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d which mowed down the teacher-\u00adapproved, intellectually inert Dick-and-Jane drivel that sucked the life out of early education in the 1950s. (They may as well all have been titled \u201cBunny, Bunny, Bunny,\u201d as Geisel wrote in \u201cHow Orlo Got His Book,\u201d a 1957 satirical piece published in the Book Review, in which he tried to wake Americans up to the urgent need to approach children\u2019s reading in a new way.) \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d will remind us, delightfully, that Dr. Seuss, over half a century ago, made learning to read an adventure, a club children would actually want to belong to. And, not least, he made reading aloud something parents, too, could reliably enjoy.", "But let\u2019s also welcome this book as another piece of evidence that we\u2019re still in shouting distance of a time, pre-\u00adTwitter, pre-Google Maps Street View, when there was some mystery around literary creation, a sense of something ultimately unknowable about authors and their daily lives, their habits, their intentions. Why did Geisel just about finish \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d and then not publish it? His widow, Audrey \u2014 who was not married to him at the time \u2014 has said that he must have simply forgotten about it in the flurry of projects. It\u2019s true that the window in which the book was almost certainly written, the years leading up to 1960, was packed with activity for Geisel, both creative and, increasingly, commercial. He and his first wife, Helen, were busy starting a new Random House imprint for children called Beginner Books (author guidelines included a list of preferred vocabulary and a ban on anything \u201ccute\u201d), which by 1960 was earning more than a million dollars a year. He was also working with a plastics company to manufacture a series of snap-together animals called the Dr. Seuss Zoo. But still: I\u2019m not buying that he \u2014 and Helen, who was intimately involved in all his work \u2014 simply forgot about it. I think there\u2019s a more interesting story here.", "First, though, the book itself: It features a round-faced brother and sister \u2014 his close-cropped hair is bristly on top, she has a long, wispy ponytail \u2014 who enter a pet store excited about the prospect of taking a new animal home. \u201cDad said we could get one./\u2009Dad said he would pay,\u201d the boy exclaims. Inside, they confront a head-\u00adspinning lineup of choices. Also, they don\u2019t have much time \u2014 their mother has told them to be home by noon. A few pages into their predicament and again toward the end, the words MAKE UP YOUR MIND charge across the top of a two-page spread, each held aloft by a different invented Seussian creature \u2014 \u00adfloppy-limbed, scruffy-coated, oddly proportioned, jubilantly weird. On one of those pages, the boy sums up the book\u2019s central point in a deceptively innocent lament: \u201cOh, boy! It is something to make a mind up!\u201d", "That sentiment was written many years before the psychologist Barry Schwartz\u2019s 2004 book \u201cThe Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less\u201d nailed the soul-exhaustion of late-capitalist culture and its frantically proliferating menus of options. But it will feel as fresh in 2015 as it would have in 1960, when that New Yorker profile ran 23 pages, many of them one skinny column of text flanked by ads \u2014 I counted 11 for perfumes alone. Casaque, Madame Rochas, R\u00e9plique, Shalimar, Tabu. .\u2008.\u2008. Mon Dieu, it is something to make a mind up!", "Our two little consumer-heroes would have been born, a quick calculation suggests, in the early Baby Boom years of healthy parental bank accounts that gave children access to the expanding options of American life. At the moment the book came into being, a pet store would have offered a fertile setting for the mild existential angst that underlies any Dr. Seuss book: What pet should they get?", "At first the children face the easy binary of dog and cat. But, not unlike some mid-20th-century New Yorker reader alerted to the possibility that there might be a better perfume out there, the siblings quickly realize that their pet options are much more numerous \u2014 worryingly so. There\u2019s not just dog and cat but kitten and puppy, and bird and fish. There are monkeys. There\u2019s even, yes, a bunny to consider, though Dr. Seuss (pointedly) uses the proper name of his old nursery-book nemesis: \u201c\u200a\u2018Look over there!\u2019\u200a/\u2009said my sister Kay./\u2009\u2018\u2009We can go home\u2009/\u2009With a rabbit today!\u2019\u200a\u201d", "Then the real problems start: What other amazing animals, unknown to the children, may exist? \u201cI might find a new one,\u201d the brother imagines, \u201ca fast kind of thing\u2009/ who would fly round my head\u2009/\u2009in a ring on a string!\u201d", "Fun, yes, but wouldn\u2019t that also be asking for trouble? He reels himself back in. \u201cOur house is so small,\u201d he admits. \u201cThis thing on a string\u2009/\u2009would bump, bump into the wall!\u201d Their mother \u2014 who, along with their father, remains offstage, as in virtually any story in which a child\u2019s imagination must take flight \u2014 \u201cwould not like that at all.\u201d She\u2019d probably prefer \u201ca tall pet that fits in a space that is small.\u201d This glorious fantasy creature has spindly, spiraling ostrich legs, big hairy paws and a supersized head plume, and we see it both standing like a friendly tower above the grinning boy and compactly folded under a desk, like some ingeniously designed piece of apartment furniture.", "The father, for his part, comes off as a downer too. The brother decides Dad might enjoy a gigantic, furry creature called a Yent, but a Yent would need a tent, and \u201chow do I know\u2009/\u2009he would pay for a tent?\u201d What about taking home \u201cone of each kind of pet\u201d? Forget it \u2014 \u201cDad would be mad.\u201d", "Just when deliberations appear to be breaking down, reason drifts in like a breeze from an open window. \u201cIf we do not choose,\u2009/\u2009we will end up with NONE,\u201d the children realize. The story ends with the brother buckling down and choosing, apparently without regret: \u201cI picked one out fast, and then that was that.\u201d There is a wonderful final image that will inevitably get children chattering: We see the brother and sister leaving the store with a basket, but we can\u2019t tell what kind of creature is inside \u2014 all we see are two eager, round eyes.", "Why, then, did Geisel leave this one in the drawer? The answer, I think, lies in the book \u201cOne Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish,\u201d one of Dr. Seuss\u2019 most popular, published in 1960 and featuring the same pair of siblings. (Fun fact: The brother also appears in the art Geisel provided for his 1957 Book Review piece, which suggests he began \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d shortly before or after that, using the character he had been developing.) And while Cathy Goldsmith, who was his art director toward the end of his life, places \u201cWhat Pet\u201d sometime between 1958 and 1962, I think it was finished before \u201cOne Fish\u201d was published in 1960. Reading \u201cWhat Pet\u201d and \u201cOne Fish\u201d together, it seems to me \u201cWhat Pet\u201d was a kind of warm-up for the more freewheeling and imaginatively rich \u2014 the slightly more classically Seussian \u2014 book. \u201cOne Fish\u201d has no plot, just a collection of escalating riffs on a brother and sister\u2019s life with a parade of hilarious, useful and entertaining imaginary creatures. It\u2019s as if Geisel took the Yent and the \u201ctall pet that fits in a space that is small\u201d in \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d and ran with them. He picked them up, grabbed the children, and ran right out of the depressingly mundane commercial world of the pet store, far away from all the nagging worries of Mother and Dad and making the right choice.", "Finding himself, in late middle age, inundated by all the new demands of his own success, he ran \u2014 my theory goes \u2014 away from the pressurized world of money and responsibility and back into the joyfully liberated territory of \u201cOne Fish Two Fish.\u201d Hello, Gack! \u201cAt our house\u2009/\u2009we play out back,\u201d the narrator declares. \u201cWe play a game\u2009/\u2009called Ring the Gack.\u201d It\u2019s a book that exists outside of time, and you wish it would never end. When it does, we get the massive, comforting Zeep, with its long sinuous tail and delicately pointed hooves: \u201cAnd now\u2009/\u2009good night./\u2009It is time to sleep./\u2009So we will sleep\u2009/\u2009with our pet Zeep.\u201d", "Geisel was known to be extremely self-critical, and while his books go down so easy that they risk seeming merely tossed off, his process was laborious. Each book went through many drafts; he once said he produced over a thousand pages in order to end up with 64. He would regularly dispatch any work that didn\u2019t meet his standards. But he didn\u2019t throw away \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d When it was discovered in 2013, in a box that Audrey Geisel had set aside after his death, it was in the final stages of preparation, with words typed on small squares of paper and taped in place on the artwork. To get that far with it, he must have thought it was a fine piece of work. But he didn\u2019t publish it, either. He didn\u2019t get on a plane to New York and personally march \u201cWhat Pet Should I Get?\u201d into Bennett Cerf\u2019s office, as was his custom with each finished manuscript. Instead, I think, he did something like this: He looked over the book, and he talked it over with Helen; he thought about how much fun he had had with all its crazy creatures, and he started playing around with another book that would let the sister and brother off the hook \u2014 let them forget about their pressing pet store errand and instead hang out all day long in the commerce-free, parent-free world of \u201cOne Fish.\u201d What he chose to do then with \u201cWhat Pet\u201d was not to choose. When you find yourself caught in the jaws of an overbearing consumer culture, that\u2019s a choice, too.", "WHAT PET SHOULD I GET?\nBy Dr. Seuss\n32 pp. Random House. $17.99.

To get to this type of an agreement, this has taken us the better part of a year.\u201d", "Driving the corporate push to purchase renewable energy, a good deal of it wind, is a combination of falling prices and greater pressure for companies to show action to fight climate change, as opposed to just setting targets. Nearly a quarter of the power purchase agreements for wind signed in 2014, according to the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group, were with nonutility customers.", "Part of the incentive was a need to show shareholders and customers direct action on climate change goals, said Herv\u00e9 Touati, a managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, where he focuses on the Business Renewables Center to help accelerate corporate renewable energy purchases.", "\u201cThe pressure is mounting,\u201d he said, and some measures \u2014 like energy efficiency \u2014 are not visible or fast enough to satisfy it.

In addition to helping meet sustainability goals, the cost of delivering renewable power has fallen and, once a plant is up and running, it is not subject to the same price fluctuations as other sources like oil or gas, said Kurt Adams, SunEdison\u2019s chief development officer.", "\u201cBeing able to procure a long-term, stable-priced energy source, that\u2019s just good business, and that\u2019s what we see a lot of corporates focused on these days,\u201d he said.", "For SunEdison, which announced on Monday that it was acquiring Vivint Solar, part of an aggressive expansion the company has undertaken in recent months, the agreement allows it to begin construction on the South Plains II wind farm in Texas, which will be able to generate 300 megawatts of power when it is completed."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/sports/basketball/for-frederic-weis-knicks-99-draft-choice-boos-marked-start-of-a-greater-struggle.html": ["LIMOGES, France \u2014 On the morning when Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Weis tried to kill himself, he dreamed about owning a beach house. A beach house had been Weis\u2019s dream for a long time. In France, in Spain, in Greece \u2014 wherever his career as a 7-foot-2 professional basketball player took him. He liked the sand, he liked the surf. A beach house was a good dream.", "But on that day, in January 2008, the dream did not make him smile. Weis got into his car in Bilbao, Spain, around 10 a.m. and began the drive here, to this small city in west-central France best known for its production of fine china. He was on his way to see his wife and son. About 90 minutes into the drive, Weis suddenly pulled over at a rest area near Biarritz, a French town not far from the border.", "He stopped the car, leaned back in his seat and, at 30 years old, considered all that had happened to him during his career. There were the early years playing in the French league. There was the night in 1999 when the Knicks made him a first-round draft pick. There was the disappointment of feeling as if the Knicks\u2019 coach, Jeff Van Gundy, did not actually want him. There was the vicious dunk from Vince Carter \u2014 just Google \u201cle dunk de la mort\u201d (Dunk of Death) if you have somehow missed it \u2014 that transformed him into an on-court victim.", "And there was, of course, the cold recognition of his personal reality: that the label affixed to him as an N.B.A. bust/cautionary tale \u2014 at least if the memory of Weis in the public reaction to the Knicks\u2019 recent drafting of the Latvian Kristaps Porzingis is any indication \u2014 will, almost surely, last forever.", "Weis thought about all this for a while. Then he thought about the beach house. Then he thought about his son, Enzo. Then he reached over, took out the box of sleeping pills he had brought with him and swallowed every single one.", "Unlike Porzingis, who heard firsthand the boos and catcalls from angry Knicks fans at Barclays Center just seconds after his name was called during last month\u2019s draft, Weis had no idea that he was immediately hated in New York. He found out he was drafted when his agent, Didier Rose, called him at a Paris hotel room in the middle of the night on July 1, 1999. (Weis was with the French national team preparing for a game.)", "Weis and his roommate had stayed up past curfew waiting for the phone to ring. When it did, Rose delivered the news by saying, \u201cFred, you got everything you wanted.\u201d", "Weis called his father and howled into the phone. He just assumed everyone was as ecstatic as he was.", "It was only weeks later, when Weis arrived in New York for a brief training camp with the Knicks\u2019 summer league team, that he learned most fans were angry the Knicks had drafted a mostly anonymous European big man as opposed to a more widely known American college player. (Many had wanted Ron Artest, who is from Queens.)", "Knicks officials alerted Weis to the discontent in a short, somewhat awkward meeting. According to Weis\u2019s wife, Celia, Weis was told, \u201cYou\u2019re not really the guy we were supposed to draft,\u201d and he was informed that \u201csome fans might not be so happy.\u201d", "Nonetheless, Ed Tapscott, the team\u2019s interim general manager, who had drafted Weis, told him the Knicks were excited to have him and looked forward to seeing him play in the summer league.", "Weis was excited, too. But his exuberance was quickly tempered after a few choppy interactions with Van Gundy, who did not seem pleased with Weis having been the team\u2019s draft choice. During phone calls with Celia, Weis described Van Gundy as having been \u201ccold\u201d to him and showing little interest in him. He told her a story about how Van Gundy had seen him wearing his watch just before practice \u2014 Weis was always a stickler for being on time \u2014 and berated him about whether he planned to wear it once workouts began.", "Van Gundy, in an interview, said he had no particular recollections about his interactions with Weis \u2014 there were few, he said, and all took place more than 15 years ago \u2014 but added that he had \u201cnothing bad to say about him.\u201d", "\u201cTo be honest, what stands out to me is that I remember him being an incredibly nice and sweet guy,\u201d Van Gundy said.", "With the Knicks\u2019 summer league team, Weis\u2019s play was limited and mostly unremarkable. The end of that summer league tournament, however, was the beginning of Weis\u2019s spiral. Weis could have signed the standard first-round draft pick contract with the Knicks \u2014 which would have required he stay with them \u2014 but he declined, choosing instead to play another year in France. That decision, which he later admitted regretting, was almost surely influenced by Rose, the agent, who also owned a piece of Weis\u2019s French team; Rose subsequently went to prison on charges related to financial impropriety and conflicts of interest.", "Weis never played for the Knicks again, in the summer league or otherwise. Explanations of why vary, but Weis said top Knicks executives never directly contacted him about returning. That may be a matter of semantics \u2014 the Knicks, like most teams, had a European scout keeping an eye on Weis (and other players) \u2014 but, from Weis\u2019s perspective, he believed he was not wanted. So he continued playing in Europe. At the 2000 Olympics \u2014 despite being dunked on by Carter \u2014 he generally played well as France won the silver medal. From 1997 to 2000, Weis played in four consecutive French league All-Star games.", "\u201cI never heard from them,\u201d Weis said. \u201cSo what was I supposed to do?\u201d", "From the Knicks\u2019 side, the belief was always that Weis was not truly motivated to ever come and play in the United States. Scott Layden replaced Tapscott as general manager in August 1999, and while it was clear he was not especially enamored of Weis, he did express curiosity about Weis\u2019s potential. The Knicks, according to team officials, would have liked to see Weis at least play in the summer league again, and a bevy of news reports from the summers of 2000 and 2001 include quotations from representatives of Weis claiming that Weis, for various reasons, would not return to the Knicks\u2019 summer league team. Weis claims that he had only loose associations with those agents and that they never accurately conveyed to him the Knicks\u2019 desires.", "Celia said that Weis was sad he never got to play with the Knicks \u2014 \u201cIt was something he very much wanted\u201d \u2014 but was nonetheless pragmatic about it.", "\u201cHe knew it was business,\u201d she said. She shrugged. \u201cIn a lot of ways, the truth is that all of that had nothing to do with what happened to him later.\u201d", "Troubles After a Son\u2019s Birth", "In 2002, three years after Weis was drafted, Enzo was born. Weis, always known as more of a gentle giant, was jubilant; being a father was something he had often said he felt he was born to do.", "But something was not right with Enzo. Outwardly, the boy seemed O.K., making baby sounds and even saying some distinguishable words as he neared his first birthday. It soon became clear, however, that Enzo was only mimicking sounds he was hearing others say and not actually learning how to communicate. His ability to focus \u2014 on a person or a task \u2014 was nonexistent. If the family tried to eat at a restaurant, Enzo would shriek and shout and shake.", "Weis was playing in Spain at the time, and a Spanish doctor ultimately declared that Enzo had a form of autism. Celia was devastated; Weis was despondent and, then, destructive.", "He began staying out late. Never much of a drinker before, Weis routinely closed down bars in Bilbao, often drinking as late as 5 a.m. He went out on weekends. He went out on weeknights. He went out on nights before games, and he went out on nights after them. When he and Celia separated in 2004 \u2014 she moved back to France with Enzo \u2014 Weis\u2019s nocturnal habits worsened.", "Off the court, he was erratic, moody and, as he admitted, \u201ctoo interested in doing all the bad things.\u201d On the court, he was sluggish and ineffective; during the 2004-5 season, he averaged fewer than 3 points and 16 minutes per game, both career lows for any season in which he played at least 30 games.", "Weis struggled to balance his emotions about Enzo with his need to continue playing basketball. He tried to visit Celia and Enzo as often as possible but could not hide his disappointment at not being able to do what other fathers did with their children. He could not take Enzo to the movies (films were too long for Enzo). He could not play board games. He could not do puzzles.", "Enzo liked basketball \u2014 he would go to Weis\u2019s games sometimes and sit in the stands for short stretches \u2014 but he could not play. On the court, when it was just the two of them and Weis was hoping for anything, just a shot or a pass, Enzo only ran, around and around, while his father held the ball.", "By January 2008, Weis hit bottom. Shortly after New Year\u2019s Day, he decided he wanted to \u201cstop it all,\u201d as he said. And so he took the box of sleeping pills, drove to the rest stop in Biarritz and closed his eyes.", "Recovery, Then Retirement", "About 10 hours after he swallowed the pills, Weis woke up. For several minutes, he was confused and could not figure out where he was or what had happened. Then he saw the empty box and felt what he described as a \u201csurprising\u201d relief. He had failed, and for once, this made him happy.", "\u201cIt was the luckiest I\u2019ve been in my life,\u201d he said.", "He picked up his phone and dialed Celia, who had been expecting him five hours earlier and had called, over and over, while he was unresponsive. When she answered, he told her what he had done and then waited \u2014 first as she wept and then, much longer, as she had a friend drive to Biarritz to pick Weis up.", "\u201cWhen he told me what had happened, I cannot say I was surprised,\u201d Celia said. \u201cBut I hoped that afterward would be different.\u201d", "It is never quite that simple. Yes, Weis\u2019s failed suicide attempt was the catalyst for a change in his behavior (he quit drinking, he said), and yes, he and Celia did begin a reconciliation that ended up sticking (the couple have been together ever since). Weis went on to play a few more seasons in Spain before finishing his career in France and retiring in 2011.", "But now, four years after retirement, 13 years after Enzo was born and 16 years after the Knicks drafted him, Weis still battles depression. Weis hides it well; he and Celia own a tobacco store and a bar in Limoges, and outwardly, Weis seems content.", "Certainly his basketball career \u2014 even the parts that never fully developed \u2014 is not a source of stress. During a recent interview at a brasserie in the center of town, he laughed often and frequently poked fun at himself, chuckling as he told the story of when he visited New York a few years back and was recognized by the passport officer at the airport.", "\u201cAren\u2019t you that guy the Knicks drafted?\u201d the officer asked, and, startled, Weis quickly crouched a bit lower. \u201cNo, no \u2014 that\u2019s my cousin,\u201d he replied as the officer quizzically waved him through.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know if he was a fan or not,\u201d Weis said as he recalled the exchange. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to get in any trouble.\u201d", "When it comes to Enzo, though, Weis still struggles. He speaks with obvious pride when he describes how Enzo, now 13, has improved his motor skills and his focus, but Celia said there are still so many mornings when she finds Weis lying in bed, grim-faced and morose. There are still so many times, too, when Weis has mood swings; one recent day at the store, Celia said, Weis lashed out at a customer who had come in and whistled since both Celia and Weis were in the back.", "\u201cWhat, am I your dog?\u201d Weis yelled before Celia calmed him down.", "\u201cI have asked him about seeing a therapist,\u201d Celia said, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t want to. He won\u2019t go. He says, \u2018Why do I need to talk about things to someone? I can talk about them to you.\u2019 \u201d", "Weis says he is fine. He has made peace with what his basketball career was and what it was not \u2014 \u201clife is not perfect, sometimes\u201d \u2014 and he is doing his best to deal with being a parent to an autistic child.", "\u201cI still dream about the beach house,\u201d he said in a wistful lilt, but it is different now. Now, he does not think about the beach house as a luxury item or a perk for a basketball superstar. Instead, he thinks of it as a haven \u2014 the only place, perhaps, where he can feel like a father giving something to his son.", "\u201cThe tides make Enzo happy,\u201d Weis explained, \u201cand so I want to take him there. I want to let him run out with the ocean because he loves it.\u201d", "Weis smiled.", "\u201cHe loves to feel like he is running on top of the water,\u201d he said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/25/business/media/donald-trumps-wealth-and-poll-numbers-complicate-news-medias-coverage.html": ["Since June 16, when Donald J.

If you want to see what the Internet looks like without moderators \u2026 well, I\u2019m not even going to tell you where to go, because we\u2019d all be raided by the F.B.I. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s immoderate.", "Moderators are, by definition, forces for stability and civility in the raucous digital realm. Or that is, they\u2019re supposed to be. Recently, the influential online message board Reddit was plunged into chaos by its army of volunteer moderators. It all started in early July, after Reddit abruptly fired an employee named Victoria Taylor. Taylor was well liked by Reddit\u2019s moderators. She was the liaison between the company and its hugely popular Ask Me Anything section, where celebrities and other notable people answer questions from the Reddit community. Although unpaid, the moderators of Ask Me Anything approach their task more seriously than many people do their day jobs. Upset by Taylor\u2019s disappearance, they shut down their entire forum, which gets millions of visits every day; this exploded into a sitewide protest, as dozens of other moderators locked down their forums as well. They wanted to give voice to their feeling, in one moderator\u2019s words, that the company\u2019s bosses \u2018\u2018do not respect the work that is put in by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who maintain the communities of the 9,656 active subreddits,\u2019\u2019 as the individual forums are called.", "The Reddit Revolt, as it came to be known, made headlines worldwide and made Reddit useless, at least temporarily. Much of the ire was aimed at Reddit\u2019s interim chief executive, Ellen Pao. A petition demanding Pao\u2019s resignation reached more than 200,000 signatures, and she was inundated with abuse on social media, some of it sexist and racist.", "A week later, Pao resigned. Pao\u2019s official reason was that Reddit\u2019s board asked for a level of growth she felt she could not deliver. (Reddit recently raised $50 million in venture capital.) Nevertheless, the companywide disruption revealed the extreme power of the site\u2019s moderators, and the unpredictability with which they wield it. At the height of the controversy, Reddit\u2019s chairman and co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, pleaded with moderators to reactivate their subreddits. He sounded rather like a zookeeper, trying to coax back into its cage the angry lion who had just devoured a park guest. There is nothing moderate about holding the 10th-most-visited website in America hostage over a personnel change. How could a site\u2019s moderators turn into its main source of volatility?", "The answer springs straight from the dominant business model online, in which everyone is trying to capture enormous traffic while employing as few people as possible. At Reddit, which Cond\u00e9 Nast purchased in 2006, then spun off in 2011, more and more work has been outsourced to unpaid moderators as the site and its traffic have grown. Many of the most popular subreddits have been created by their moderators, who retain effective control over them. The idea of \u2018\u2018moderating\u2019\u2019 presupposes an outside vision of what is and isn\u2019t acceptable in a conversation. But when moderators set their own rules, with no incentive to conform to anyone else\u2019s standard, they can look a lot less like custodians and a lot more like petty tyrants.", "Today Reddit is governed, insofar as it\u2019s governed at all, by a cabal of high-powered moderators who coordinate with administrators in private forums. The most influential of these forums, Modtalk, allows access only to moderators who oversee subreddits with a combined subscriber base of at least 25,000. A convoluted moderator culture has developed, full of intrigue and drama. Moderators are deposed after power struggles; the community is periodically wracked by allegations of payola and other schemes in which moderators game Reddit for personal gain. Moderators parse Reddit employees\u2019 every post to see if other moderators are in or out of favor with the company. When Ohanian made his first public comment during the Reddit Revolt, he first petitioned Modtalk, and only afterward spoke to the general masses.", "The moderator class has become so detached from its mediating role at Reddit that it no longer functions as a means of creating a harmonious community, let alone a profitable business. It has become an end in itself \u2014 a sort of moderatocracy in which the underlying logic of moderation has been turned on its head. Under the watch of its moderators, Reddit has become a haven for extremists: The Southern Poverty Law Center recently called it the new \u2018\u2018home on the Internet\u2019\u2019 for white supremacists, and it also functions as the central organizing point for the dubious \u2018\u2018men\u2019s rights\u2019\u2019 movement. For years, a moderator with the handle Violentacrez presided over an empire of execrable content on the site, including a hugely popular subreddit that shared sexualized photos of under-age girls, and another that glorified violence against women. (In 2012, when I wrote an article for Gawker outing Violent\u00adacrez\u2019s real identity as a programmer in Texas, other moderators rallied to defend him, going so far as to ban links to Gawker.) Any attempt to enforce real-world norms is rejected by the moderatocracy as impinging on their absolute authority over their miniature domains. Even before the revolt, Ellen Pao sparked much consternation by instituting an anti-harassment policy and banning a handful of subreddits with particularly vile content \u2014 Redditors nicknamed her Chairman Pao. Ohanian has excused Reddit\u2019s underbelly as an inevitable result of human nature. But Reddit has made a strategic choice to abdicate responsibility to the moderatocracy in exchange for the promise of meteoric growth, even if its new chief executive, Steve Huffman, recently vowed to crack down on the worst subreddits.", "History shows that things end poorly for companies that rely too heavily on moderatocracies. Probably the closest analogy to Reddit is AOL, which in the 1990s built a corps of thousands of volunteer \u2018\u2018community leaders\u2019\u2019 to moderate its chat rooms and forums. Those community leaders eventually revolted, too; some sued for back pay, and AOL was forced to settle for a reported $15 million in 2010. The tension is intrinsic: Unpaid moderators will always feel the company does not appreciate them enough for the free labor they donate. Eventually, the company will change in a way that upsets the moderators. A tiny spark can ignite the built-up resentment.", "So what will become of the moderatocracy? The hottest tech companies no longer want to run communities, with all their messy, unprofitable human drama. Instead, they want to make platforms: slick, frictionless, infinitely monetizable. Companies like Facebook and Google try to create the illusion that their platforms are moderated by algorithms, not people. They quietly employ huge teams of human moderators, working under strict nondisclosure agreements, and yet these platforms feel the same pressure as Reddit to expand faster than their human resources allow. So an increasing amount of what once was moderation now falls to normal users like you and me. We flag offensive photos on Facebook and frauds on Airbnb. We report the troll on Twitter, and when they are quickly suspended, we feel extremely gratified \u2014 and extremely powerful. The moderatocracy lives on inside us all."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/opinion/capitalism-for-the-rest-of-us.html": ["IN her most detailed economic policy address so far, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that she wanted \u201cto give workers the chance to share in the profits they help produce\u201d through a two-year tax credit that would encourage profit-sharing.

And yet some family-run businesses, and entrepreneurs who were concerned about the place of workers in an economy dominated by gigantic enterprises, sought to extend the benefits of capitalism to employees.

An exemplar was Southwest Airlines, which paid $355 million of its more than $1 billion in corporate profits last year to union and nonunion workers and managers, on top of salaries.", "Our research found that these programs, when combined with worker participation in solving problems, and increased training and job security, raise productivity and benefit workers. In every year, about half the winners in Fortune\u2019s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For have some type of broad-based profit or gain-sharing or stock ownership for regular workers. Google, Intel and Starbucks all have broad-based stock grants or options for their employees. Wegmans has profit-sharing. W. L. Gore, the maker of Gore-Tex, and Publix Super Markets, which operates in the Southeast, are owned by employee stock ownership plans, wherein a workers\u2019 trust typically borrows money to buy shares that are paid out of company revenues.", "Some scholars have worried that employee-share ownership is too risky when workers buy the stock with their wages or 401(k) retirement savings; Enron is the classic example.

We favor only ownership policies that emphasize grants of stock (as in the case of employee stock-ownership plans), restricted stock (which has to be held on to for a certain period of time, incentivizing workers to stay) or stock options.", "How do we achieve this? First, the notion needs more powerful advocates from business and politics, like Mrs. Clinton. In New Jersey, lawmakers are finalizing legislation to expand tax incentives for small-business owners to sell their businesses to their employees and managers; Iowa has adopted similar legislation.", "Second, we need to reform a little-known tax loophole, Section 162(m), of the Internal Revenue Code. In the early 1990s, in an attempt to reform executive pay, Congress changed that section to limit corporate income tax deductions to $1 million for the top five executive salaries, but allowed virtually unlimited deductions for a variety of top-executive performance-based pay, including equity and profit-sharing. Corporations, which have exploited this loophole to offer lavish compensation packages, should get these deductions only if they offer a profit-sharing or share-ownership plan to all employees.", "Finally, all levels of government \u2014 federal, state and local \u2014 should offer incentives to companies that implement profit-sharing and employee-share ownership. Such incentives should include tax breaks, tax incentives and preference in the awarding of government contracts.", "Spreading around profit-sharing and the ownership of capital is not the only answer to solving the challenge of soaring inequality in America, but it\u2019s a critical step that will help rather than hurt economic performance.

The main thrust of the paper, the part getting all the press, arises from the confluence of several recent developments in glaciology. First is the identification of a runaway condition in outflow glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet that makes the IPCC prediction for year-2100 sea level rise clearly obsolete. The other is the recognition that warming ocean temperatures at the grounding line for the glaciers is driving a really strong flow and thus melting response.", "Temperatures at this depth tend to have a paradoxical inverse relationship with surface temperatures, which can cool due to fresh meltwater input, trapping heat in the subsurface. This idea may also explain the mystery of why Heinrich events, collapses of the Laurentide ice sheet, always came at cold times in the D-O cycles. Analysis of sea level changes during Eemian time, the last interglacial, show changes of several meters in time scales of a century. If our ice sheets are going to change our sea level that much, from its current rate of melt, the melt rate would have to increase exponentially in the future. The way that could happen is if there is a positive feedback, such that melting begets faster melting, as opposed to a linear response where the melting rate is driven simply by temperature. The climate modeling results in this paper identify such a feedback.

Many customers were confused by the flurry of changes that were designed for so-called hybrid devices that doubled as PCs and tablets. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, said last year that the company \u201cgot a few places wrong in Windows 8.\u201d", "With Windows 10, Microsoft is offering something of a throwback to the earlier versions. The software also comes with an enticing price tag for users of Windows 7 and 8: free. But perhaps more than anything, there are a handful of new features that might make users consider making the switch.", "The Trusty Start Button", "Back is the classic Start button, the one-touch access to a main menu, including shortcuts to a user\u2019s list of apps and documents. As in old times, it can be opened with the click of a mouse or by pressing the Windows shortcut on a keyboard. (The Start button was still available in Windows 8, but some users were confused because it was hidden from sight.)", "Microsoft made efforts to modernize the Start menu with a fresh design. Clicking on the Start button brings up groups of tiles that can be tailored to your preferences. For example, I easily created a group of tiles labeled \u201cProductivity\u201d and pinned some of my most frequently used software for work, including apps for email, web browsing, Twitter, a calculator and Microsoft Word. Removing unwanted apps from the group is easy \u2014 you just choose to \u201cunpin\u201d the tile.", "For longtime Windows users, the more intimidating part to get used to will be tablet mode. With hybrid tablets, such as the Microsoft Surface, you can detach the keyboard from the screen and switch into a different software interface optimized for tablets. In tablet mode, apps consume the entire screen; the tiles of the Start section are enlarged to be easier to see and touch.", "Fortunately, interacting with Windows 10 on a touch screen is generally the same as with most modern touch-enabled devices.

In tests, Cortana generated mixed results. Asking Cortana to look up a place to eat nearby retrieved a list of Bing search results for the term \u201cFind me places to eat nearby,\u201d which included the website places-to-eat-near-me.com, as opposed to showing a list of restaurants. (By contrast, the same query on Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, brought up Yelp listings of popular restaurants within half a mile from me here in San Francisco.)", "On the other hand, Cortana did respond adequately to some other commands, like \u201cShow me showtimes for \u2018Trainwreck,\u2019 \u201d which loaded a schedule of movie theaters showing the movie nearby.", "A big hole in Cortana is the mobile phone experience. Cortana is built into Windows phones; the problem is, you probably don\u2019t own one. To date, Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone platform has 3.5 percent market share in the United States, according to Kantar Worldpanel.", "Microsoft says that Cortana will eventually be available as an app on devices running Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS mobile software. For now, though, Cortana will primarily live on computers and tablets, limiting its usefulness.", "It\u2019s difficult to imagine that while on the go, people will yank Windows tablets or computers out of their bags to ask Cortana to schedule calendar appointments or create reminders. In addition, the idea of using a voice assistant on a stationary computer in a typical office environment, where colleagues will overhear you over their cubicle walls yapping to Cortana, seems off-putting. As a result, in its current state, Cortana is a promising start, but it\u2019s far less useful than its direct rivals, Siri and Google\u2019s Now, which are widely available on smartphones worldwide.", "More Built-In Security", "Microsoft has made some bold promises about improvements to security in Windows 10. Chris Hallum, a senior product marketing manager for Microsoft, said in an interview that because of all the security enhancements in Windows 10, consumers and businesses won\u2019t have to install additional security software to protect their machines. \u201cWe include a full-fledged antivirus solution in Windows,\u201d he said.", "Microsoft has been including these deeper security features since Windows 8. But with Windows XP and Windows 7, far more popular versions of the software, it was practically a requirement to buy and install third-party antivirus software from McAfee or Norton, unless you wanted to be eaten alive by hackers.", "Mr. Hallum said Microsoft was taking a multifaceted approach to protecting user identities as well as blocking malicious software. For example, Microsoft Edge, the default browser in Windows 10, includes a feature called SmartScreen, which can identify malicious websites by scanning them for suspicious characteristics. The Edge browser also keeps some add-on software for the browser, like Adobe Flash, up-to-date to safeguard you from the latest vulnerabilities. Another feature, Windows Defender, can identify potentially harmful software you\u2019ve downloaded and warn you before you run it.", "Are you really safe not installing additional antivirus software? As we should all know by now, almost all computer systems have some vulnerability. Still, Charlie Miller, a security researcher, said Windows 10\u2019s security features should work as well as other antivirus software. He noted that Windows Defender had been a strong security program for some time.", "The Upgrade Process", "On Wednesday, Microsoft began releasing the operating system over the Internet in waves, starting with people who signed up to test early versions of the software as part of its \u201cinsiders\u201d program. Later, Windows 7 and Windows 8 users who receive alerts notifying them of the upgrade will be able to download it.", "At the time of my testing, ahead of the public release of Windows 10, I encountered a number of bugs. In one incident, Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser blocked me for an entire night from using Google Mail, after mistakenly identifying it as a malicious website \u2014 though the next morning I was able to log in. I also had a frustrating time trying to compose a document inside Google Docs, when the Edge browser occasionally failed to detect when I was hitting the space bar; Microsoft confirmed it would fix the issue shortly after release.", "Combine the early bugs with the spottiness of Cortana and the fact that third-party app developers are still updating their apps for Windows 10, and the operating system still has a little ways to go before it becomes a solid all-around upgrade. But the improvements to security, along with the familiar user interface, should be reasons to grab this upgrade sooner than later (especially if you\u2019re on Windows 7 and lacking up-to-date security tools). The upgrade will be free for up to a year \u2014 after that, Microsoft may begin charging for it.", "For would-be switchers, Microsoft offers a web tool where users can check if their apps are compatible with Windows 10 before making the switch.

Chaos reigned. There were too many drivers going after too few passengers \u2014 fares were slashed, tensions between fleets escalated, violence erupted. Some drivers working 20-hour days could not make enough money to support themselves. As a result, in 1937, the city devised the medallion system to limit the number of vehicle licenses.

But of course growth like that might never have occurred if the city\u2019s yellow-taxi system could respond to fluctuations of supply and demand. Instead, arcane aspects of state and local law and, crucially, the power wielded by wealthy and politically generous fleet owners \u2014 who don\u2019t want to see the creation of more medallions lest the value of theirs decline \u2014 make that virtually impossible.", "Let\u2019s leave aside that Uber, like Soul Cycle or the Hampton Jitney, has become an aspect of identity for many New Yorkers. \u201cUber\u201d is something you do; it\u2019s a verb; you \u201cUber\u201d to dinner at Barbuto, whereas in 2010 you would have said \u2014 how benighted the sound!\u2014 that you were going to \u201ctake a taxi.\u201d With Uber there is no grammatical intimation of remove.

Historically, this theory was used by governments to combat sources of community disruption \u2014 a raucous rock concert, for instance. Increasingly, though, government agencies have used nuisance suits to try to address public health issues, like suing gun companies for spreading handgun violence, according to Robert L.

Some of the paint was grubby and chipped. \u201cIs that acceptable? Look at that.

If they taste like cardboard, I won\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d", "His palate was satisfied, and the lawsuit, filed in Marin County Superior Court, caused an instant uproar. Mr. Joseph was widely pilloried on right-wing radio, which he felt helped his cause immeasurably. \u201cThey were hating the Oreo lawsuit so much that they were repeating, \u2018Trans fat, trans fat, trans fat,\u2019 creating awareness of the issue.\u201d", "Shortly after, Mr. Joseph dropped the lawsuit; Kraft told him it would abandon trans fats in the Oreo. Again, winning the suit became secondary to filing it.

Mr. Joseph took the position that the environmental groups, which wanted to outlaw plastic bags, were vastly overstating the harm they caused.", "With financial support from plastic bag companies, he filed a lawsuit that made it to the California Supreme Court and handed Mr. Joseph and his allies a mixed result. He lost on some key points, but scored one win: The court ruled that Mr. Joseph\u2019s organization had the right to file the suit on behalf of the public. Still, it was an instance in which Mr. Joseph arguably won a courtroom battle, but lost the war; more than 100 California cities have banned plastic bags.", "Mr. Joseph speaks eloquently on the legal theories of his case against the tech companies.

No, characterization is worse. No, dialogue is.\u201d Unsurprisingly, on those counts, \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d is sometimes a hot mess.", "But then there\u2019s the language. The \u00advoices that crowd the novel can easily be misread as merely mischievous or opaque.

This novel deals in many narrative modes \u2014 interview transcripts, emails, blog posts, book drafts replete with strikeouts \u2014 and is rich with clever neologisms. Cohen takes obvious delight bending the language as far as it will go. Sometimes it breaks, but these are noble failures. Comparisons to Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace have become de rigueur when discussing Cohen\u2019s work, but there\u2019s also a trace of Saul Bellow\u2019s stylistic exuberance in these pages.", "For example, here\u2019s Principal, the reclusive Internet overlord whose memoir the fictional Cohen has been hired to ghostwrite, on his Palo Alto youth (the \u201cwe\u201d is he \u2014 one of Principal\u2019s tics is to refer to himself in the plural):", "\u201cWe felt more as like hardware, mauve, taupe, beige, boxcolored, putting in an intense amount of interior hot effort only so that our exterior, our skin, would appear jointless, seamless, cold.

Our rebellion thing was that we were aware of it, our compatibility or adaptability thing was that we worked through that awareness, though both impulses might be genetic and if so in regard to work ethic it could be cur to examine dopamine levels in the striatum of the brain, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior insula.\u201d", "This paragraph is indicative of all that is best and worst in Cohen\u2019s style.

Your interest in \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d will depend on your enthusiasm for passages like these.", "Without the prose fireworks, however, \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d is a conventional piece of storytelling (Cohen is better with ideas than plot), a reminder that vital language can\u2019t do the job by itself.

What follows is a globe-trotting series of interviews, ranging from Dubai (a newly fashionable destination for novelists) to Paris to London and Berlin. The travels take place under the cover of local business, but in fact, Principal is on the move, trying to get his story told before the sinister forces arrayed against him intervene. These sinister forces include his own employee Kor Dienerowitz, an amoral executive forced on him by the money people; and Thor Ang Balk, a Julian Assange type who runs a site for leaked documents. Principal\u2019s big reveal, however, feels rather anticlimactic in the post-Snowden era.", "Cohen the character (the other is always Principal) can be an arch scold, and his share of the tale weighs down \u201cBook of Numbers.\u201d This might be the moment to declare a binding moratorium on New York novelists writing novels that feature New York novelists. The too-many \u00adpages devoted to agents, publishing deals, lunches, literary rivalries and the Frankfurt Book Fair (Adorno, anyone?) can be numbing.", "Yet the rich and substantial middle section, which combines Principal telling his story with Cohen\u2019s hapless attempts to write it, realizes the promise of \u201cBook of Numbers.\u201d Nothing less than the 40 years of the modern computing age are synthesized. It\u2019s here that Cohen\u2019s unruly style best serves the novel, where the very consciousness of the Internet, the joining of all worlds, is suggested by Principal\u2019s oracular insistence on the first person plural. It\u2019s a familiar enough story to anyone who has ever read a copy of Wired magazine \u2014 plucky start-ups, spit and chicken wire leading to untold \u00adfortunes \u2014 but Cohen beautifully takes us back through the early days when it was all new, when search engines were populated manually, at once brute force and bespoke. The early hand cataloging of websites performed by Tetration interns brings to mind the censuses that dominate the early chapters of another Book of Numbers \u2014 the fourth and strangest book of the Pentateuch, which concerns the 40 years the Israelites spent wandering in the desert.", "In contrast with Principal\u2019s \u00advividness, \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d fails most conspicuously in its depiction of its female \u00adcharacters. They are lifeless creations, especially the two central women: Rachel, the hectoring, soon-to-be ex-wife who publishes a familiar litany of male failings on her blog; and idealized Izdihar, the battered Arab bride with whom Cohen has an improbable and unpersuasive obsession. And, of course, there\u2019s a Jewish mother. (There\u2019s always a Jewish mother.) They are types; they serve purposes, move on and are forgotten. The remaining women are mostly assistants, servile and weepy.", "As God tests the endurance and faith of the Israelites, Cohen will test the \u00adcommitment of his readers. \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d contains disquisitions on Hinduism, Buddhism, primitive art, binary code, Gulf\u00adstream jets, firewalls, Russian prostitutes, daggers, shopping, pornography websites, the draft, punch cards, the census \u2014 and that\u2019s a small sampling. Cohen has bristled at characterizations of \u201cWitz,\u201d his prior 800-page novel, as a Jewish \u201cUlysses.\u201d But the comparison is instructive here. In absorbing the full cacophony of the broadband era and displaying less interest in physical place than head space, \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d can be read as a digital-age \u201cUlysses.\u201d (Cohen invites the parallel with Rachel\u2019s long, under\u00adpunctuated blog posts summoning the spirit of Molly Bloom.)", "It\u2019s notable that most everyone 20 years or older dies before the end of the biblical Book of Numbers; the tale is directed at the next generation to enter Israel. At times, \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d can feel too insistently young, as though Cohen is speaking only to those beside and behind him. For an older generation that remembers the elegant simplicity of Pong, \u201cBook of Numbers\u201d may feel like a long trek through the desert. Still, the dominant theme of searching is a resonant one for all ages. \u201cHe who insists on having the end before the beginning will still only have the beginning,\u201d Principal reminds us. And as Cohen himself observed in The London Review of Books, \u201cif German poetry was able to survive the German-language press (and two wars, and communism), the odds are that American fiction will survive Google.\u201d Equally, odds are that Joshua Cohen will be one of its prophets.", "BOOK OF NUMBERS\nBy Joshua Cohen\n580 pp. Random House. $28."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/your-money/swindlers-target-older-women-on-dating-websites.html": ["AT first, the constant attention seemed sweet and very special.", "Janet N.

A widely used set of equations describes the behavior of fluids like water, but there seems to be nothing in those equations, he told me, that prevents a wayward eddy from suddenly turning in on itself, tightening into an angry gyre, until the density of the energy at its core becomes infinite: a catastrophic \u2018\u2018singularity.\u2019\u2019 Someone tossing a penny into the fountain by the faculty center or skipping a stone at the Santa Monica beach could apparently set off a chain reaction that would take out Southern California.", "This doesn\u2019t tend to happen. And yet, Tao explained, nobody can say precisely why. It\u2019s a decades-\u00adold conundrum, and Tao has recently been working on an approach to a solution \u2014 one part fanciful, one part outright absurd, like some lost passage from \u2018\u2018Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland.\u2019\u2019", "Imagine, he said, that someone awfully clever could construct a machine out of pure water. It would be built not of rods and gears but from a pattern of interacting currents. As he talked, Tao carved shapes in the air with his hands, like a magician. Now imagine, he went on, that this machine were able to make a smaller, faster copy of itself, which could then make another, and so on, until one \u2018\u2018has infinite speed in a tiny space and blows up.\u2019\u2019 Tao was not proposing constructing such a machine \u2014 \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know how!\u2019\u2019 he said, laughing. It was merely a thought experiment, of the sort that Einstein used to develop the theory of special relativity. But, Tao explained, if he can show mathematically that there is nothing, in principle, preventing such a fiendish contraption from operating, then it would mean that water can, in fact, explode. And in the process, he will have also solved the Navier-\u00adStokes global regularity problem, which has become, since it emerged more than a century ago, one of the most important in all of mathematics.", "Tao, who is 40, sat at a desk by the window, papers lying in drifts at the margins. Thin and unassuming, he was dressed in Birkenstocks, a rumpled blue-gray polo shirt and jeans with the cuffs turned up. Behind him, a small almond couch faced a glyph-\u00adcovered blackboard running the length of the room. The couch had been pulled away from the wall to accommodate the beat-up Trek bike he rides to work. At the room\u2019s other end stood a fiberboard bookcase haphazardly piled with books, including \u2018\u2018Compactness and Contradiction\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Poincar\u00e9\u2019s Legacies, Part I,\u2019\u2019 two of the 16 volumes Tao has written since he was a teenager.", "Fame came early for Tao, who was born in South Australia. An old headline in his hometown paper, The Advertiser, reads: \u2018\u2018TINY TERENCE, 7, IS HIGH-SCHOOL WHIZ.\u2019\u2019 The clipping includes a photo of a diminutive Tao in 11th-grade math class, wearing a V-neck sweater over a white turtleneck, kneeling on his chair so he can reach a desk he is sharing with a girl more than twice his age. His teacher told the reporter that he hardly taught Tao anything, because Tao was always working two lessons ahead of the others. (Tao taught himself to read at age 2.)", "A few months later, halfway through the school year, Tao was moved up to 12th-grade math. Three years later, at age 10, Tao became the youngest person in history to win a medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad. He has since won many other prizes, including a MacArthur \u2018\u2018genius\u2019\u2019 grant and the Fields Medal, considered the Nobel Prize for mathematicians. Today, many regard Tao as the finest mathematician of his generation.", "That spring day in his office, reflecting on his career so far, Tao told me that his view of mathematics has utterly changed since childhood. \u2018\u2018When I was growing up, I knew I wanted to be a mathematician, but I had no idea what that entailed,\u2019\u2019 he said in a lilting Australian accent. \u2018\u2018I sort of imagined a committee would hand me problems to solve or something.\u2019\u2019 But it turned out that the work of real mathematicians bears little resemblance to the manipulations and memorization of the math student. Even those who experience great success through their college years may turn out not to have what it takes. The ancient art of mathematics, Tao has discovered, does not reward speed so much as patience, cunning and, perhaps most surprising of all, the sort of gift for collaboration and improvisation that characterizes the best jazz musicians. Tao now believes that his younger self, the prodigy who wowed the math world, wasn\u2019t truly doing math at all. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s as if your only experience with music were practicing scales or learning music theory,\u2019\u2019 he said, looking into light pouring from his window. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t learn the deeper meaning of the subject until much later.\u2019\u2019", "Possibly the greatest mathematician since antiquity was Carl Friedrich Gauss, a dour German born in the late 18th century. He did not get along with his own children and kept important results to himself, seeing them as unsuitable for public view. They were discovered among his papers after his death. Before and since, the annals of the field have teemed with variations on this misfit theme, from Isaac Newton, the loner with a savage temper; to John Nash, the \u2018\u2018beautiful mind\u2019\u2019 whose work shaped economics and even political science, but who was racked by paranoid delusions; to, more recently, \u00adGrigory Perelman, the Russian who conquered the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture alone, then refused the Fields Medal, and who also allowed his fingernails to grow until they curled.", "Tao, by contrast, is, as one colleague put it, \u2018\u2018super-normal.\u2019\u2019 He has a gentle, self-\u00addeprecating manner. He eschews job offers from prestigious East Coast institutions in favor of a relaxed, no-drama department in a place where he can enjoy the weather. In class, he conveys a sense that mathematics is fun. One of his students told me that he had recently joked with another about the many ways Tao defies all the Hollywood mad-\u00adgenius tropes. \u2018\u2018They will never make a movie about him,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He doesn\u2019t have a troubled life. He has a family, and they seem happy, and he\u2019s usually smiling.\u2019\u2019", "This can be traced to his own childhood, which he experienced as super-normal, even if, to outside eyes, it was anything but. Tao\u2019s family spent most of his early years living in the foothills south of Adelaide, in a brick split-\u00adlevel with views of Gulf St. Vincent. The home was designed by his father, Billy, a pediatrician who immigrated with Tao\u2019s mother, Grace, from Hong Kong in 1972, three years before Tao, the eldest of three, was born in 1975. The three boys \u2014 Nigel, Trevor and \u2018\u2018Terry,\u2019\u2019 as everyone calls him \u2014 often played together, and a favorite pastime was inventing board games. They typically appropriated a Scrabble board for a basic grid, then brought in Scrabble tiles, chess pieces, Chinese checkers, mah-jongg tiles and Dungeons & Dragons dice, according to Nigel, who now works for Google. For story lines, they frequently drew from video games coming out at the time, like Super Mario Bros., then added layers of complex, whimsical rules. (Trevor, a junior chess champion, was too good to beat, so the boys created a variation on that game as well: Each turn began with a die roll to determine which piece could be moved.) Tao was a voracious consumer of fantasy books like Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld series. When a class was boring, he doodled intricate maps of imaginary lands.", "By the spring of 1985, with a 9-year-old Tao splitting time between high school and nearby Flinders University, Billy and Grace took him on a three-week American tour to seek advice from top mathematicians and education experts. On the Baltimore campus of Johns Hopkins, they met with Julian Stanley, a Georgia-\u00adborn psychologist who founded the Center for Talented Youth there. Tao was one of the most talented math students Stanley ever tested \u2014 at 8 years old, Tao scored a 760 on the math portion of the SAT \u2014 but Stanley urged the couple to keep taking things slow and give their son\u2019s emotional and social skills time to develop.", "Even at a relatively deliberate pace, by age 17, Tao had finished a master\u2019s thesis (\u2018\u2018Convolution Operators Generated by Right-\u00adMonogenic and Harmonic Kernels\u2019\u2019) and moved to Princeton University to start on his Ph.D. Tao\u2019s application to the university included a letter from Paul Erdos, the revered Hungarian mathematician. \u2018\u2018I am sure he will develop into a first-rate mathematician and perhaps into a really great one,\u2019\u2019 read Erdos\u2019s brief, typewritten note. \u2018\u2018I recommend him in the highest possible terms.\u2019\u2019 Yet on arrival, it was Tao, the teenage prodigy, who was intimidated. During Tao\u2019s first year, Andrew Wiles, then a Princeton professor, announced that he proved Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, a legendary problem that had gone unsolved for more than three centuries. Tao\u2019s fellow graduate students spoke eloquently about mathematical fields of which he had barely heard.", "Tao became notorious for his nights haunting the graduate computer room to play the historical-\u00adsimulation game Civilization. (He now avoids computer games, he told me, because of what he calls a \u2018\u2018completist streak\u2019\u2019 that makes it hard to stop playing.) At a local comic-book store, Tao met a circle of friends who played \u2018\u2018Magic: The Gathering,\u2019\u2019 the intricate fantasy card game. This was Tao\u2019s first real experience hanging out with people his age, but there was also an element, he admitted, of escaping the pressures of Princeton. Gifted children often avoid challenges at which they might not excel. Before Tao went to Princeton, his grades had flagged at Flinders. In a course on quantum physics, the instructor told the class that the final would include an essay on the history of the field. Tao, then 12, blew off studying, and when he sat down for the exam, he was stunned to discover that the essay would count for half the grade. \u2018\u2018I remember crying,\u2019\u2019 Tao said, \u2018\u2018and the proctor had to escort me out.\u2019\u2019 He failed.", "At Princeton, crisis came in the form of the \u2018\u2018generals,\u2019\u2019 a wide-\u00adranging, arduous oral examination administered by three professors. While other students spent months working through problem sets and giving one another mock exams, Tao settled on his usual test-prep strategy: last-\u00adminute cramming. \u2018\u2018I went in and very quickly got out of my depth,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They were asking questions which I had no ability to answer.\u2019\u2019 Immediately after, Tao sat with his adviser, Elias Stein, and felt that he had let him down. Tao wasn\u2019t really trying, and the hardest part was yet to come.", "The true work of the mathematician is not experienced until the later parts of graduate school, when the student is challenged to create knowledge in the form of a novel proof. It is common to fill page after page with an attempt, the seasons turning, only to arrive precisely where you began, empty-handed \u2014 or to realize that a subtle flaw of logic doomed the whole enterprise from its outset. The steady state of mathematical research is to be completely stuck. It is a process that Charles Fefferman of Princeton, himself a onetime math prodigy turned Fields medalist, likens to \u2018\u2018playing chess with the devil.\u2019\u2019 The rules of the devil\u2019s game are special, though: The devil is vastly superior at chess, but, Fefferman explained, you may take back as many moves as you like, and the devil may not. You play a first game, and, of course, \u2018\u2018he crushes you.\u2019\u2019 So you take back moves and try something different, and he crushes you again, \u2018\u2018in much the same way.\u2019\u2019 If you are sufficiently wily, you will eventually discover a move that forces the devil to shift strategy; you still lose, but \u2014 aha! \u2014 you have your first clue.", "As a group, the people drawn to mathematics tend to value certainty and logic and a neatness of outcome, so this game becomes a special kind of torture. And yet this is what any \u00adwould-be mathematician must summon the courage to face down: weeks, months, years on a problem that may or may not even be possible to unlock. You find yourself sitting in a room without doors or windows, and you can shout and carry on all you want, but no one is listening.", "Within his field, Tao is best known for a proof about a remarkable set of numbers known as the primes. The primes are the whole numbers larger than 1 that can be divided evenly by only themselves and 1. Thus, the first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. The number 4 is not a prime because it divides evenly by 2; the number 9 fails because it can be divided by 3. Prime numbers are fundamental building blocks in mathematics. Like the chemical elements, they combine to form a universe. To a chemist, water is two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Similarly, in mathematics, the number 12 is composed of two \u2018\u2018atoms\u2019\u2019 of 2 and one \u2018\u2018atom\u2019\u2019 of 3 (12 = 2 x 2 x 3).", "The primes are elementary and, at the same time, mysterious. They are a result of simple logic, yet they seem to appear at random on the number line; you never know when the next one will occur. They are at once orderly and disorderly. They have been incorporated into mysticism and religious ritual and have inspired works of music and even an Italian novel, \u2018\u2018The Solitude of Prime Numbers.\u2019\u2019 It is easy to see why mathematicians consider the primes to be one of the universe\u2019s foundations. From counting, you can develop the concept of number, and then, quite naturally, the basic operations of arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. That is all you need to spot the primes \u2014 though, eerily, scientists have uncovered deep connections between primes and quantum mechanics that remain unexplained. Imagine that there is an advanced civilization of aliens around some distant star: They surely do not speak English, they may or may not have developed television, but we can be almost certain that their mathematicians have discovered the primes and puzzled over them.", "Tao\u2019s work is related to the twin-prime conjecture, which the French mathematician Alphonse de Polignac suggested in 1849. Go up the number line, circling the primes, and you may notice that sometimes a pair of primes is separated by just 2: 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19. These are the \u2018\u2018twin primes,\u2019\u2019 and as the journey along the number line continues, they occur less frequently: 2,237 and 2,239 are followed by 2,267 and 2,269; after 31,391 and 31,393, there isn\u2019t another pair until you reach 31,511 and 31,513. Euclid devised a simple, beautiful proof showing that there is an infinite number of primes. But what of the twin primes? As far as you go on the number line, will there always be another set of twins? The conjecture has roundly defeated all attempts at proving it.", "When mathematicians face a question they cannot answer, they sometimes devise a less stringent question, in the hope that solving it will provide insights. This is the path that Tao took in 2004, in collaboration with Ben Green of Oxford. Twins are two primes that are separated by exactly 2, but Green and Tao considered a looser definition, strings of primes separated by a constant, be it 2 or any other number. (For example, the primes 3, 7 and 11 are separated by the constant 4.) They sought to prove that no matter how long a string someone found, there would always be another longer string with a constant gap between its primes. That February, after some initial conversations, Green came to visit Tao at U.C.L.A., and in just two exhilarating months, they completed what is now known as the Green-Tao theorem. It could be a way point on the path to the twin-prime conjecture, and it forged deep connections between disparate areas of math, helping establish an interdisciplinary area called additive combinatorics. \u2018\u2018It opened a lot of new directions in research,\u2019\u2019 says Izabella Laba, a University of British Columbia mathematician who has worked with Tao. \u2018\u2018It gave a lot of people a lot of things to do.\u2019\u2019", "This sort of collaboration has been a hallmark of Tao\u2019s career. Most mathematicians tend to specialize, but Tao ranges widely, learning from others and then working with them to make discoveries. Markus Keel, a longtime collaborator and close friend, reaches to science fiction to explain Tao\u2019s ability to rapidly digest and employ mathematical ideas: Seeing Tao in action, Keel told me, reminds him of the scene in \u2018\u2018The Matrix\u2019\u2019 when Neo has martial arts downloaded into his brain and then, opening his eyes, declares, \u2018\u2018I know kung fu.\u2019\u2019 The citation for Tao\u2019s Fields Medal, awarded in 2006, is a litany of boundary hopping and notes particularly \u2018\u2018beautiful work\u2019\u2019 on Horn\u2019s conjecture, which Tao completed with a friend he had played foosball with in graduate school. It was a new area of mathematics for Tao, at a great remove from his known stamping grounds. \u2018\u2018This is akin,\u2019\u2019 the citation read, \u2018\u2018to a leading English-\u00adlanguage novelist suddenly producing the definitive Russian novel.\u2019\u2019", "The Green-Tao theorem on primes was a similar collaboration. Green is a specialist in an area called number theory, and Tao originally trained in an area called harmonic analysis. Yet, as they told me, the proof depended on the insights of many other mathematicians. In the game of devil\u2019s chess, players have no real hope if they haven\u2019t studied the winning games of the masters. A proof establishes facts that can be used in subsequent proofs, but it also offers a set of moves and strategies that forced the devil to submit \u2014 a devious way to pin one of his pieces or shut down a counterattack, or an endgame move that sacrifices a bishop to gain a winning position. Just as a chess player might examine variations of the Ruy Lopez and King\u2019s Indian Defense, a mathematician might study particularly clever applications of the Chinese remainder theorem or the sieve of Eratosthenes. The wise player has a vast repertoire to draw on, and the crafty player intuits the move that suits the moment.", "For their work, Tao and Green salvaged a crucial bit from an earlier proof done by others, which had been discarded as incorrect, and aimed at a different goal. Other maneuvers came from masterful proofs by Timothy Gowers of England and Endre Szemeredi of Hungary. Their work, in turn, relied on contributions from Erdos, Klaus Roth and Frank Ramsey, an Englishman who died at age 26 in 1930, and on and on, into history. Ask mathematicians about their experience of the craft, and most will talk about an intense feeling of intellectual camaraderie. \u2018\u2018A very central part of any mathematician\u2019s life is this sense of connection to other minds, alive today and going back to Pythagoras,\u2019\u2019 said Steven Strogatz, a professor of mathematics at Cornell University. \u2018\u2018We are having this conversation with each other going over the millennia.\u2019\u2019", "The Green-Tao theorem caught the mathematical community by surprise, because that problem was thought to be many years from succumbing to proof. On the day I visited Tao, we ate lunch on the outdoor patio of the midcentury-\u00admodern faculty center. Working on a modest plate of sushi, Tao told me that he and Green have continued to work around the margins of the twin-prime conjecture, as have others, with a lot of success recently. It is his sense, he said, that a proof is close at hand, more than a century and half after it was first articulated. \u2018\u2018Maybe 10 years,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "It was dinnertime when I headed to Tao\u2019s home, a white-and-tan five-\u00adbedroom on the western edge of campus. Tao was originally going to take his 12-year-old son, William, to a piano lesson, but William had received a callback for a Go-Gurt commercial. (He has already been in a Honda ad, in which he played the role of \u2018\u2018boy who sleeps contentedly in the back seat.\u2019\u2019) While Tao\u2019s wife, Laura, ferried William home, their daughter, Maddy, 4, finished her meal at an island in their spacious kitchen. She took a bite of her dessert \u2014 a cronut \u2014 and then clambered down her stool and began running from room to room, arms raised, squealing with delight.", "Tao has emerged as one of the field\u2019s great bridge-\u00adbuilders. At the time of his Fields Medal, he had already made discoveries with more than 30 different collaborators. Since then, he has also become a prolific math blogger with a decidedly non-\u00adGaussian ebullience: He celebrates the work of others, shares favorite tricks, documents his progress and delights at any corrections that follow in the comments. He has organized cooperative online efforts to work on problems. \u2018\u2018Terry is what a great 21st-\u00adcentury mathematician looks like,\u2019\u2019 Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who has collaborated with Tao, told me. He is \u2018\u2018part of a network, always communicating, always connecting what he is doing with what other people are doing.\u2019\u2019", "In my visit with Tao, I noticed only one way in which he conforms to the math-\u00adprofessor stereotype: an absent-mindedness that dates to his childhood. When he was a boy, he constantly lost books, even his book bag; he put clothes on backward or inside out, or he neglected to put on both socks. (This is why he wears Birkenstocks now. \u2018\u2018One less step,\u2019\u2019 he explained.) As he showed me around the house, his gait was a bit awkward, as if, at some level, he was just not that interested in walking. I asked to see his office, and he pointed out an unremarkable chamber off a back hallway. He doesn\u2019t get as much done there as he used to, he said; recently, he has been most productive on flights, when he has a block of hours away from email and all the people who hope for an audience with him.", "After William arrived home, with Laura trailing behind, we sat down for dinner: pork chops in tomato sauce, a recipe taken from a handwritten collection, its notebook cover emblazoned with a teddy bear, that Laura received as a gift from Tao\u2019s mother. William was gregarious. The Go-Gurt callback went well. (He eventually got the part.) William has some of his father\u2019s natural facility for mathematics \u2014 as a sixth grader, he took an online course in precalculus \u2014 but his real passions at the moment are writing, particularly fantasy, and acting, particularly improv. He was also heavy into Minecraft, though he was annoyed because he was having trouble updating his hacks. Once, he said, he and a friend tried to hack math itself by proving that 1 equals 0, but then realized that it is forbidden to divide by 0. Tao rolled his eyes.", "An effort to prove that 1 equals 0 is not likely to yield much fruit, it\u2019s true, but the hacker\u2019s mind-set can be extremely useful when doing math. Long ago, mathematicians invented a number that when multiplied by itself equals negative 1, an idea that seemed to break the basic rules of multiplication. It was so far outside what mathematicians were doing at the time that they called it \u2018\u2018imaginary.\u2019\u2019 Yet imaginary numbers proved a powerful invention, and modern physics and engineering could not function without them.", "Early encounters with math can be misleading. The subject seems to be about learning rules \u2014 how and when to apply ancient tricks to arrive at an answer. Four cookies remain in the cookie jar; the ball moves at 12.5 feet per second. Really, though, to be a mathematician is to experiment. Mathematical research is a fundamentally creative act. Lore has it that when David Hilbert, arguably the most influential mathematician of fin de si\u00e8cle Europe, heard that a colleague had left to pursue fiction, he quipped: \u2018\u2018He did not have enough imagination for mathematics.\u2019\u2019", "Math traffics in abstractions \u2014 the idea, for example, that two apples and two oranges have something in common \u2014 but much of Tao\u2019s work has a tangible aspect. He is drawn to waves of fluid or light, or things that can be counted, or geometries that you might hold in your mind. When a question does not initially appear in such a way, he strives to transform it. Early in his career, he struggled with a problem that involved waves rotating on top of one another. He wanted to come up with a moving coordinate system that would make things easier to see, something like a virtual Steadi\u00adcam. So he lay down on the floor and rolled back and forth, trying to see it in his mind\u2019s eye. \u2018\u2018My aunt caught me doing this,\u2019\u2019 Tao told me, laughing, \u2018\u2018and I couldn\u2019t explain what I was doing.\u2019\u2019", "Tao\u2019s most recent work in exploding water began when a professor from Kazakhstan claimed to have completed a Navier-\u00adStokes proof. After looking at it, Tao felt sure that the proof was incorrect, but he decided to take this intuition a step further and show that any proof using the professor\u2019s approach was sure to fail. While he was wading through the proof, asking colleagues for help in translating the explanatory text from the original Russian, he struck upon the notion of his imaginary, self-\u00adreplicating water contraption \u2014 drawing on ideas from engineering to make progress on a question in pure mathematics.", "The feat is as much psychological as mathematical. Many people think that substantial progress on Navier-\u00adStokes may be impossible, and years ago, Tao told me, he wrote a blog post concurring with this view. Now he has some small bit of hope. The twin-prime conjecture had the same feel, a sense of breaking through the wall of intimidation that has scared off many aspirants. Outside the world of mathematics, both Navier-\u00adStokes and the twin-prime conjecture are described as problems. But for Tao and others in the field, they are more like opponents. Tao\u2019s opponent has been known to taunt him, convincing him that he is overlooking the obvious, or to fight back, making quick escapes when none should be possible. Now the opponent appears to have revealed a weakness. But Tao said he has been here before, thinking he has found a way through the defenses, when in fact he was being led into an ambush. \u2018\u2018You learn to get suspicious,\u2019\u2019 Tao said. \u2018\u2018You learn to be on the lookout.\u2019\u2019", "This is the thrill of it, and the dread.

The game is afoot."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/magazine/the-economys-missing-metrics.html": ["Nearly every day, a few hundred federal workers, carefully spread around the United States by a rigorous statistical model, carry out a peculiar task on a special, secure tablet computer.

Over the course of the month, 80,000 prices are entered into tablets throughout the country, and the data flow to Washington for processing. Parsed and analyzed by economists, that information determines the official United States government inflation rate: arguably the most influential bit of data in the world, determining whether new factories are built, new employees hired.", "Inflation is just one of the many economic statistics that the federal government creates. There\u2019s unemployment, trade in goods and services, personal income, consumer spending, rental vacancy, new home construction and thousands more. These statistics are not objective facts of the world, like the standard boiling point of water or the mass of a stone; instead, their very measurement creates them. Slight shifts in the design of surveys or the assumptions about the answers can lead to quite different results.", "Because these assumptions are inherently debatable, the government often winds up publishing multiple versions of metrics. (Inflation has two distinct measures: personal consumption expenditures, known as P.C.E., and the Consumer Price Index, known as C.P.I. Unemployment has six, numbered U1 through U6, to reflect different interpretations of what \u2018\u2018unemployed\u2019\u2019 actually means.) Our federal economic statistics are a remarkable resource: enormous, rigorous, essential. Together, they help us understand how the economy is working and whom it is, and isn\u2019t, working for.", "But in the decades to come, as we try to understand whether the American dream is deceased or merely slumbering, our statistics could get so much better. Because they rely on fixed definitions \u2014 created decades ago \u2014 of the phenomena they\u2019re charged with measuring, they do a poor job of capturing the ways in which people\u2019s economic lives are changing. The statistics are all but useless at measuring the change in general welfare created by new technologies, like Google Search, that make once tiresome tasks far easier to complete (at the cost of adding a whole universe of time-wasting distractions). In measuring employment, the stats are built around a model of full-time, fixed jobs in fixed locations; they struggle to keep track of Uber-like companies that employ people for brief gigs with no central workplace. Entrepreneurship, too, is measured quite crudely: It\u2019s impossible, just looking at the new-firm stats, to distinguish the creation of Facebook from the opening of a small deli in Dubuque. Definitions of occupations are rigid and often archaic. Manufacturing work, for example, is broken down into dozens of discrete subcategories \u2014 tool grinders, sewing-machine operators, tire builders, woodworking-machine setters \u2014 while all \u2018\u2018software developers\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018web developers\u2019\u2019 are organized into single catchall groups. You could learn a lot about the wages and employment patterns of adhesive-bonding-machine operators (18,210 workers in 2014, median wage $16.28 per hour). But you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any guidance on whether you\u2019d make more money learning the Ruby on Rails computer-programming framework instead of developing your graphic-design skills.", "Most of our economic statistics date to World War II. When Franklin D. Roosevelt first assumed the presidency, he asked his advisers how the economy was doing, and they responded with anecdotes: rail cars running half empty in Chicago, say, or department stores lagging in customers. Other than inflation, which had been measured since 1913, there were no reliable ways to judge economic strength over time. Spurred by F.D.R., the federal government sought to quantify the economy, creating a dozen different offices of economists and statisticians in the Departments of Labor, Commerce and Agriculture; the Federal Reserve; and several other agencies. The politicians wanted simple, straightforward answers to their economic questions. But the economists knew their answers were inherently subjective. They debated what the statistics should measure \u2014 arguments that weren\u2019t resolvable with data because the data expressed the values and assumptions used in gathering them.", "The most important thinker in these debates was Simon Kuznets, an immigrant from Russia. He was an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent nonprofit that has served, since 1920, as the semiofficial host of fundamental discussion about the best way to measure an economy. Kuznets believed that economic statistics should be an essential part of a democracy: that they could hold our leaders accountable, by demonstrating whether the government was making life better or worse. Kuznets argued \u2014 as, incidentally, most economists do \u2014 that measures like employment and inflation are substitutes for what really matters: our quality of life, as each person defines it for himself. We measure money and other practical things because we don\u2019t know how to measure happiness or fulfillment precisely.", "In the 1930s, at the N.B.E.R., Kuznets amassed whatever data he could from industry sources and others and built the first comprehensive statistical model of an economy. Kuznets is seen around the world as the founding father of gross domestic product, and of national accounts more generally. But he didn\u2019t like that honorific. In his 1971 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Kuznets denigrated his accomplishment. He pointed out that government data doesn\u2019t measure what really matters. It has no metric for \u2018\u2018pollution and other negative results of mass production.\u2019\u2019 It doesn\u2019t tell us if the country\u2019s people have more mobility and freedom, more time to spend with family or to pursue pleasures or passions that don\u2019t generate income. Throughout his career, Kuznets argued that military armaments should be heavily discounted in G.D.P. measures, because, by design, they destroy the world rather than build it up.", "He sounded, at times, like a starry-eyed hippie. And that is certainly how he was viewed by the bureaucrats who set up our national accounting systems during the 1940s. They didn\u2019t know how to value a mother\u2019s ability to raise her children or what price to put on a pristine river or a mountaintop. They built our statistics around numbers they could gather, like the scale of industrial output, or the number of hours that a sample of American workers had spent on the job. Kuznets won the intellectual war, but he lost the practical battle. I\u2019m fairly sure most economists, today, would prefer economic statistics that capture more fundamental measures of well-being. Instead, the government measures the numbers it always has instead of the ones that matter most to us.", "It\u2019s hard to blame the 1940s bureaucrats, who didn\u2019t have electronic calculators, let alone computers. They could accommodate only so much data, so they built a system based on sporadic sampling and crude approximations of human happiness. Now, though, we have the potential to build a truly Kuznetsian system. Americans have access to devices that can know where they are at all times, what they\u2019re doing, how fast their hearts are beating, how much sleep they\u2019re getting, how much time they\u2019re spending at work or with family or out on a lake. This sort of data is being collected \u2014 with or without our knowledge \u2014 by tech companies: Google, Fitbit, Withings and countless more. These companies want to profit from this information. But an anonymized sample of all these kinds of data, combined with other, more traditional economic metrics, could create a whole new public system for economic statistics.", "The cost would be trivial in the context of an economy where a single statistic can cause billions to change hands in an instant. It is hard to think of any government investment that would have a greater impact than creating robust ways to measure the quality of our lives. We are in the early stages of an election period in which there will be significant, competing claims about the best ways to manage a modern economy.

Then, in June of that year, an American U.A.V. fired a missile in South Waziristan. Two children were killed, as were several adults, one of them a mujahid called Nek Muhammad. More strikes followed the next year, and by 2008 the strikes were frequent and the death toll high, in the thousands. The results of the strikes followed the pattern established from the first one: Many of the people killed were innocent of wrongdoing.", "In the public mind, drones had rightly come to be seen as ominous machines tracking their hapless victims, harbingers of sudden death. But drones are gaining other, no less accurate meanings. They can be any size, and they can resemble planes or helicopters, or both, or neither. Someday they could deliver our packages or even come to play a role in commuter transportation. But the key expansion in the public understanding of drones is in the realm of popular photography.", "A view from a great height is irresistible. It is twinned with the ancient dream of flight. For millenniums, we have imaginatively soared above our material circumstances and dramatized this desire in tales from Icarus to Superman. Things look different from way up there. What was invisible before becomes visible: how one part of the landscape relates to another, how nature and infrastructure unfold. But with the acquisition of this panoptic view comes the loss of much that could be seen at close range. The face of the beloved is but one invisible detail among many.", "When the French photographer Nadar leaned out of a hot-air balloon in 1858 and made a series of images of Paris, it was the beginning of a new age. Our eyes were carried aloft. Cities began to appear in photographic portraits that echoed maps, but with all the latest and truest information included. In 1860, James Wallace Black and Samuel Archer King made \u2018\u2018Boston, as the Eagle and Wild Goose See It.\u2019\u2019 And in 1906, George R. Lawrence, deploying a complicated rig of kites, created enormous photographic panoramas of San Francisco right after the earthquake. Lawrence\u2019s photographs gave the traumatized city a measure of its catastrophe. Three years later, Wilbur Wright piloted the plane from which the first moving picture was shot. In the century that followed, aerial photography was used in archaeology, advertising, surveillance and mapping. This precipitous rate of innovation also resulted in the technology that allows drones to fix their stares on those we deem enemies.

The drones do not fly when the skies are gray.\u2019\u2019 Houtryve attached a camera to a small drone and traveled around the United States, making aerial photographs of the sorts of events that have been associated with intentional or erroneous drone strikes: funerals, weddings, groups of people at play, in prayer or during exercise. His images show Americans in the course of their daily lives, photographed from a great height, in bright sun that throws their distorted shadows far ahead of them, presenting them as unindividuated, vulnerable and human. Houtryve makes it clear that the people in Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia or Afghanistan who are killed by American drones are also just like this. With simple, vivid means, Houtryve brings the war home.", "Houtryve\u2019s work has been published in magazines and, meticulously printed in large format, displayed in galleries. But there are other photographs made by or about drones that you encounter almost solely online. Two of these projects, very different from each other in effect and intent, happen to have settled on an identical name: Dronestagram. One, hosted at the website www.dronestagr.am, invites submissions from aerial-photography enthusiasts who are using small, commercially available or homemade drones to take photos or make videos. The site runs a photography contest, sponsored in part by National Geographic, and the winning images tend to be pretty, brightly colored landscapes of the kind that might end up on calendars or tourist brochures. Photoshopped, wide-angled and hectically spectacular, the photos are popular, garnering thousands of likes. But mostly they lack the element of formal provocation or conceptual rupture on which memorable images depend.", "The other project that shares the name Dronestagram was created a little earlier, in 2012, by the computer artist James Bridle. He scours the news media for information about drone strikes and presents those events in capsule written form, accompanying them with a Google satellite image of the location or vicinity of the strike. In Bridle\u2019s project, which he presents on Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram, we see a landscape directly from above, with buildings visible in plan form, set in brown or green surroundings. These are places where people died, whether they were suspected terrorists or bystanders. The images \u2014 sober, descriptive, clinical \u2014 are undramatic and sufficient. They make explicit the continuity between reconnaissance and attack and also embed the grim promise that it\u2019s not over. There are more strikes to come.", "The two Dronestagrams, the sanguine and the melancholic, add to our ever increasing archive of possible landscapes. Imagine all those pictures stitched together into a single image. In this ideal aerial view, neither the pervasive violence nor the sometimes cloying prettiness would be visible. Conquest and sentimentality would both be irrelevant. In other words, the image might be like the \u2018\u2018blue marble\u2019\u2019 photograph of Earth, taken from the Apollo 17 spacecraft in 1972. It is our world, serene and self-contained, seen in one glance. It is not a view that excites us into plans for bombing our enemies, for it includes us as well.

He was a tyrant, they said, who, after 14 years of marriage, wouldn\u2019t let their sister, Rana, 31, have her own mobile phone. He isolated her from friends and family, guarding her jealously. Although Diyaa and Rana were both from Qaraqosh, the largest Christian city in Iraq, they didn\u2019t know each other before their families arranged their marriage. It hadn\u2019t gone especially well. Rana was childless, and according to the brothers, Diyaa was cheap.

Until last summer, this was a flourishing city of 50,000, in Iraq\u2019s breadbasket. Wheat fields and chicken and cattle farms surrounded a town filled with coffee shops, bars, barbers, gyms and other trappings of modern life.", "Then, last June, ISIS took Mosul, less than 20 miles west. The militants painted a red Arabic \u2018\u2018n,\u2019\u2019 for Nasrane, a slur, on Christian homes. They took over the municipal water supply, which feeds much of the Nineveh Plain. Many residents who managed to escape fled to Qaraqosh, bringing with them tales of summary executions and mass beheadings. The people of Qaraqosh feared that ISIS would continue to extend the group\u2019s self-styled caliphate, which now stretches from Turkey\u2019s border with Syria to south of Fallujah in Iraq, an area roughly the size of Indiana.", "In the weeks before advancing on Qaraqosh, ISIS cut the city\u2019s water. As the wells dried up, some left and others talked about where they might go. In July, reports that ISIS was about to take Qaraqosh sent thousands fleeing, but ISIS didn\u2019t arrive, and within a couple of days, most people returned. Diyaa refused to leave. He was sure ISIS wouldn\u2019t take the town.", "A week later, the Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, whom the Iraqi government had charged with defending Qaraqosh, retreated. (\u2018\u2018We didn\u2019t have the weapons to stop them,\u2019\u2019 Jabbar Yawar, the secretary general of the peshmerga, said later.) The city was defenseless; the Kurds had not allowed the people of the Nineveh Plain to arm themselves and had rounded up their weapons months earlier. Tens of thousands jammed into cars and fled along the narrow highway leading to the relative safety of Erbil, the Kurdish capital of Northern Iraq, 50 miles away.", "Piling 10 family members into a Toyota pickup, Rana\u2019s brothers ran, too. From the road, they called Diyaa repeatedly, pleading with him to escape with Rana. \u2018\u2018She can\u2019t go,\u2019\u2019 Diyaa told one of Rana\u2019s brothers, as the brother later recounted to me. \u2018\u2018ISIS isn\u2019t coming.

One man passed out drunk in his backyard and woke the next morning to ISIS taking the town.", "As Diyaa and Rana hid in their basement, ISIS broke into stores and looted them. Over the next two weeks, militants rooted out most of the residents cowering in their homes, searching house to house. The armed men roamed Qaraqosh on foot and in pickups. They marked the walls of farms and businesses \u2018\u2018Property of the Islamic State.\u2019\u2019 ISIS now held not just Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest city, but also Ramadi and Fallujah. (During the Iraq War, the fighting in these three places accounted for 30 percent of U.S. casualties.) In Qaraqosh, as in Mosul, ISIS offered residents a choice: They could either convert or pay the jizya, the head tax levied against all \u2018\u2018People of the Book\u2019\u2019: Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews. If they refused, they would be killed, raped or enslaved, their wealth taken as spoils of war.", "No one came for Diyaa and Rana. ISIS hadn\u2019t bothered to search inside their ramshackle house. Then, on the evening of Aug. 21, word spread that ISIS was willing to offer what they call \u2018\u2018exile and hardship\u2019\u2019 to the last people in Qaraqosh. They would be cast out of their homes with nothing, but at least they would survive. A kindly local mullah was going door to door with the good news. Hoping to save Diyaa and Rana, their neighbors told him where they were hiding.", "Diyaa and Rana readied themselves to leave. The last residents of Qaraqosh were to report the next morning to the local medical center, to receive \u2018\u2018checkups\u2019\u2019 before being deported from the Islamic State. Everyone knew the checkups were really body searches to prevent residents from taking valuables out of Qaraqosh. Before ISIS let residents go \u2014 if they let them go \u2014 it was very likely they would steal everything they had, as residents heard they had done elsewhere.", "Diyaa and Rana called their families to let them know what was happening. \u2018\u2018Take nothing with you,\u2019\u2019 her brothers told Diyaa. But Diyaa, as usual, didn\u2019t listen. He stuffed Rana\u2019s clothes with money, gold, passports and their identity papers. Although she was terrified of being caught \u2014 she could be beheaded for taking goods from the Islamic State \u2014 Rana didn\u2019t protest; she didn\u2019t dare. According to her brothers, Diyaa could be violent. (Diyaa\u2019s brother Nimrod disputed this, just as he does Diyaa\u2019s alleged cheapness.)", "At 7 the next morning, Diyaa and Rana made the five-minute walk from their home to Qaraqosh Medical Center Branch No. 2, a yellow building with red-and-green trim next to the city\u2019s only mosque. As the crowd gathered, Diyaa phoned both his family and hers. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re standing in front of the medical center right now,\u2019\u2019 he said, as his brother-in-law recalled it. \u2018\u2018There are buses and cars here.

By 9 a.m., ISIS had separated men from women. Seated in the crowd, the local ISIS emir, Saeed Abbas, surveyed the female prisoners. His eyes lit on Aida Hana Noah, 43, who was holding her 3-year-old daughter, Christina. Noah said she felt his gaze and gripped Christina closer. For two weeks, she\u2019d been at home with her daughter and her husband, Khadr Azzou Abada, 65. He was blind, and Aida decided that the journey north would be too hard for him. So she sent her 25-year-old son with her three other children, who ranged in age from 10 to 13, to safety.

Some of the captives realized what ISIS was doing, survivors told me later, dividing the young and healthy from the older and weak. One, Talal Abdul Ghani, placed a final call to his family before the fighters confiscated his phone. He had been publicly whipped for refusing to convert to Islam, as his sisters, who fled from other towns, later recounted. \u2018\u2018Let me talk to everybody,\u2019\u2019 he wept. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think they\u2019re letting me go.\u2019\u2019 It was the last time they heard from him.", "No one was sure where either bus was going.

One fighter reassured her, saying, \u2018\u2018These others will follow.\u2019\u2019 Sahar, Aida and her blind husband, Khadr, boarded the first bus. The driver, a man they didn\u2019t know, walked down the aisle. Without a word, he took Christina from her mother\u2019s arms. \u2018\u2018Please, in the name of God, give her back,\u2019\u2019 Aida pleaded. The driver carried Christina into the medical center. Then he returned without the child. As the people in the bus prayed to leave town, Aida kept begging for Christina. Finally, the driver went inside again. He came back empty-handed.", "Aida has told this story before with slight variations. As she, her husband and another witness recounted it to me, she was pleading for her daughter when the emir himself appeared, flanked by two fighters. He was holding Christina against his chest.

Many of the 40-odd people on it began to weep. \u2018\u2018We cried for Christina and ourselves,\u2019\u2019 Sahar said. The bus took a sharp right toward the Khazir River that marked an edge of the land ISIS had seized. Several minutes later, the driver stopped and ordered everyone off.", "Led by a shepherd who had traveled this path with his flock, the sick and elderly descended and began to walk to the Khazir River. The journey took 12 hours.", "The second bus \u2014 the one filled with the young and healthy \u2014 headed north, too. But instead of turning east, it turned west, toward Mosul. Among its captives was Diyaa. Rana wasn\u2019t with him. She had been bundled into a third vehicle, a new four-wheel drive, along with an 18-year-old girl named Rita, who\u2019d come to Qaraqosh to help her elderly father flee.", "The women were driven to Mosul, where, the next day, Rana\u2019s captor called her brothers. \u2018\u2018If you come near her, I\u2019ll blow the house up. I\u2019m wearing a suicide vest,\u2019\u2019 he said. Then he passed the phone to Rana, who whispered, in Syriac, the story of what happened to her. Her brothers were afraid to ask any questions lest her answers make trouble for her.

Christianity arrived during the first century, according to Eusebius, an early church historian who claimed to have translated letters between Jesus and a Mesopotamian king. Tradition holds that Thomas, one of the Twelve Apostles, sent Thaddeus, an early Jewish convert, to Mesopotamia to preach the Gospel.", "As Christianity grew, it coexisted alongside older traditions \u2014 Judaism, Zoroastrianism and the monotheism of the Druze, Yazidis and Mandeans, among others \u2014 all of which survive in the region, though in vastly diminished form. From Greece to Egypt, this was the eastern half of Christendom, a fractious community divided by doctrinal differences that persist today: various Catholic churches (those who look to Rome for guidance, and those who don\u2019t); the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox (those who believe Jesus has two natures, human and divine, and those who believe he was solely divine); and the Assyrian Church of the East, which is neither Catholic nor Orthodox.", "When the first Islamic armies arrived from the Arabian Peninsula during the seventh century, the Assyrian Church of the East was sending missionaries to China, India and Mongolia. The shift from Christianity to Islam happened gradually. Much as the worship of Eastern cults largely gave way to Christianity, Christianity gave way to Islam. Under Islamic rule, Eastern Christians lived as protected people, dhimmi: They were subservient and had to pay the jizya, but were often allowed to observe practices forbidden by Islam, including eating pork and drinking alcohol. Muslim rulers tended to be more tolerant of minorities than their Christian counterparts, and for 1,500 years, different religions thrived side by side.", "One hundred years ago, the fall of the Ottoman Empire and World War I ushered in the greatest period of violence against Christians in the region. The genocide waged by the Young Turks in the name of nationalism, not religion, left at least two million Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks dead. Nearly all were Christian. Among those who survived, many of the better educated left for the West. Others settled in Iraq and Syria, where they were protected by the military dictators who courted these often economically powerful minorities.", "From 1910 to 2010, the percentage of the Middle Eastern population that was Christian \u2014 in countries like Egypt, Israel, Palestine and Jordan \u2014 continued to decline; once 14 percent of the population, Christians now make up roughly 4 percent. (In Iran and Turkey, they\u2019re all but gone.) In Lebanon, the only country in the region where Christians hold significant political power, their numbers have shrunk over the past century, to 34 percent from 78 percent of the population. Low birthrates have contributed to this decline, as well as hostile political environments and economic crisis. Fear is also a driver. The rise of extremist groups, as well as the perception that their communities are vanishing, causes people to leave.", "For more than a decade, extremists have targeted Christians and other minorities, who often serve as stand-ins for the West. This was especially true in Iraq after the U.S. invasion, which caused hundreds of thousands to flee. \u2018\u2018Since 2003, we\u2019ve lost priests, bishops and more than 60 churches were bombed,\u2019\u2019 Bashar Warda, the Chaldean Catholic archbishop of Erbil, said. With the fall of Saddam Hussein, Christians began to leave Iraq in large numbers, and the population shrank to less than 500,000 today from as many as 1.5 million in 2003.", "The Arab Spring only made things worse. As dictators like Mubarak in Egypt and Qaddafi in Libya were toppled, their longstanding protection of minorities also ended. Now, ISIS is looking to eradicate Christians and other minorities altogether. The group twists the early history of Christians in the region \u2014 their subjugation by the sword \u2014 to legitimize its millenarian enterprise. Recently, ISIS posted videos delineating the second-class status of Christians in the caliphate. Those unwilling to pay the jizya tax or to convert would be destroyed, the narrator warned, as the videos culminated in the now-\u00adinfamous scenes of Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians in Libya being marched onto the beach and beheaded, their blood running into the surf.", "The future of Christianity in the region of its birth is now uncertain. \u2018\u2018How much longer can we flee before we and other minorities become a story in a history book?\u2019\u2019 says Nuri Kino, a journalist and founder of the advocacy group Demand for Action. According to a Pew study, Christians face religious persecution in more countries than any other religious group. \u2018\u2018ISIL has put a spotlight on the issue,\u2019\u2019 says Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, whose parents are from the region and who advocates on behalf of Eastern Christians. \u2018\u2018Christianity is under an existential threat.\u2019\u2019", "One of the main pipelines for Christians fleeing the Middle East runs through Lebanon. This spring, thousands of Christians from villages in northeastern Syria along the Khabur River found shelter in Lebanon as they fled an ISIS assault in which 230 people were seized for ransom. This wasn\u2019t the first time that members of this tight-knit community had been driven from their homes. Many of these villagers were descendants of those who, in 1933, fled Iraq after a massacre of Assyrian Christians left 3,000 dead in one day.", "On a recent Saturday, 50 of these refugees gathered for a funeral at the Assyrian Church of the East in Beirut, which sits on the steep slope of Mount Lebanon, not far from a BMW-Mini Cooper dealership and a Miss Virgin Jeans shop. The priest, the Rev. Sargon Zoumaya, buttoned his black cassock over a blue clerical shirt as he prepared to officiate over the burial of Benjamin Ishaya, who arrived just months before, displaced from one of the villages ISIS attacked. (He had died of complications following a head wound inflicted by a jihadist.)", "\u2018\u2018We\u2019re afraid our whole society will vanish,\u2019\u2019 said Zoumaya, who left his Khabur River village more than a decade ago to study in Lebanon. He picked up his prayer book and headed downstairs to the parish house. The church was helping to care for 1,500 Syrian families. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s too much pressure on us, more than we can handle,\u2019\u2019 he said. The families didn\u2019t want to live in the notoriously overcrowded Lebanese refugee camps that had filled with one-and-a-half million Syrians fleeing the civil war. They no longer wanted to live among Muslims. Instead they crammed into apartments with exorbitant rents that the church subsidized as best it could.", "Inside the church, men and women sat in two separate circles. A young woman passed out Turkish coffee in paper cups. Waves of keening rose from the ring of women, led by Ishaya\u2019s widow. Wearing an olive green suit, she sat at the head of the open coffin, weeping, as women touched her husband\u2019s body. Nearby, her son, Bassam Ishaya, nursed two broken feet. He\u2019d been trying to support his family by repairing couches until one dropped on him. The Ishaya family left Syria with nothing. ISIS, Bassam said, told them they \u2018\u2018either had to pay the jizya, convert or be killed.\u2019\u2019 He pointed to a blue crucifix tattoo on his right arm. \u2018\u2018Because of this, I had to wear long sleeves,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "To escape, the Ishayas were airlifted from Al-Hasakah, a town in northeastern Syria, which had been under the joint control of the Assad government and the Kurds but has since largely fallen to ISIS, and flown 400 miles to Damascus. From there, they drove to the Lebanese border. Syrian Air charged $180 for the flights; Assad\u2019s government charged $50 a person, the refugees at the funeral said.", "Since the civil war broke out in Syria in 2011, Assad has allowed Christians to leave the country. Nearly a third of Syria\u2019s Christians, about 600,000, have found themselves with no choice but to flee the country, driven out by extremist groups like the Nusra Front and now ISIS. \u2018\u2018As president, he made the sheep and the wolf walk together,\u2019\u2019 Bassam said. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t care if he stays or goes, we just want security.\u2019\u2019 Assad has used the rise of ISIS to solidify his own support among those who remain, sowing the same fear among them that he tries to spread in the West: that he is the only thing standing in the way of an ISIS takeover. This argument has been largely effective. As Samy Gemayel, leader of the Kataeb party in Lebanon, said: \u2018\u2018When Christians saw Christians being beheaded, those who saw Assad as the enemy chose the lesser of two evils. Assad was the diet version of ISIS.\u2019\u2019", "Like most of the refugees in the parish house, Bassam wasn\u2019t planning on returning to Syria. He was searching for a way to the West. His brother Yussef moved to Chicago two years earlier. He didn\u2019t have a job yet, but his wife worked at Walmart. Maybe they would help. He wanted to leave like everyone else, although it would hasten the end of Christianity in Syria. No one would go home after what ISIS had done. \u2018\u2018Christians will all leave,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018What can I do? I have four kids, I can\u2019t leave them here to die.\u2019\u2019", "After his father\u2019s coffin was sealed, Bassam and the rest of the male mourners filed out. As the women looked on, the men filled waiting cars and drove, past a cement factory, to a nearby graveyard. Zoumaya swung a censer of frankincense along the narrow pathway. But neither the smoke nor the wilting rose bushes could mask the reek of corpses. Behind the priest, Bassam hobbled on crutches. The mourners lifted the coffin into a wall of doors, which resembled the shelving units in a morgue. This was a pauper\u2019s grave. Since the family couldn\u2019t afford the fee, the church paid $500 to place the coffin here. In a few months, the body would be quietly burned, although cremation is anathema to Eastern Christian doctrine. The ashes would take up less space in this overcrowded city of the dead.", "\u2018\u2018We ran from the war only to die in the street,\u2019\u2019 one mourner said.", "Later, Zoumaya talked of his family members, who were among the 230 captured by ISIS. At noon, on the day ISIS arrived in his wife\u2019s village, Zoumaya called his father-in-law to check in.", "\u2018\u2018This is ISIS,\u2019\u2019 said the man who answered.", "\u2018\u2018Please let my family go,\u2019\u2019 the priest begged. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve done nothing to you. They\u2019re not fighting.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018These people belong to us now,\u2019\u2019 the man said. \u2018\u2018Who is this calling?\u2019\u2019", "Zoumaya hung up. He feared what ISIS might do if they knew who he was. But this was not the end of his communication with them; they sent him photographs via WhatsApp. He pulled out his phone to show them. Here was a jihadi on a motorcycle, grinning in front of the charred grocery store that belonged to his father. Here was a photo, before ISIS arrived, of a 3-month-old\u2019s baptism. Here was a snapshot of the family dressed up for Somikka, Assyrian Halloween, during which adults don frightening costumes to scare children into fasting for Lent.", "\u2018\u2018All these people are missing,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "ISIS wants $23 million for these captives, $100,000 each, a sum no one can pay.", "This spring the U.N. Security Council met to discuss the plight of Iraq\u2019s religious minorities. \u2018\u2018If we attend to minority rights only after slaughter has begun, then we have already failed,\u2019\u2019 Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for Human Rights, said. After the conference ended, there was mounting anger at American inaction. Although the airstrikes were effective, since October 2013, the United States has given just $416 million in humanitarian aid, which falls far short of what is needed. \u2018\u2018Americans and the West were telling us they came to bring democracy, freedom and prosperity,\u2019\u2019 Louis Sako, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch of Babylon who addressed the Security Council, wrote to me in a recent email. \u2018\u2018What we are living is anarchy, war, death and the plight of three million refugees.\u2019\u2019", "Of the 3.1 million displaced Iraqis, 85 percent are Sunnis. No one has suffered more at the hands of ISIS than fellow Muslims. Other religious minorities have been affected as well and in large numbers: the Yazidis, who were trapped on Mount Sinjar in Northern Iraq last summer, as ISIS threatened them with genocide; as well as Shia Turkmen; Shabak; Kaka\u2019i; and the Mandeans, who follow John the Baptist. \u2018\u2018Everyone has seen the forced conversions, crucifixions and beheadings,\u2019\u2019 David Saperstein, the United States ambassador at large for religious freedom, said. \u2018\u2018To see these communities, primarily Christians, but also the Yazidis and others, persecuted in such large numbers is deeply alarming.\u2019\u2019", "It has been nearly impossible for two U.S. presidents \u2014 Bush, a conservative evangelical; and Obama, a progressive liberal \u2014 to address the plight of Christians explicitly for fear of appearing to play into the crusader and \u2018\u2018clash of civilizations\u2019\u2019 narratives the West is accused of embracing. In 2007, when Al Qaeda was kidnapping and killing priests in Mosul, Nina Shea, who was then a U.S. commissioner for religious freedom, says she approached the secretary of state at the time, Condoleezza Rice, who told her the United States didn\u2019t intervene in \u2018\u2018sectarian\u2019\u2019 issues. Rice now says that protecting religious freedom in Iraq was a priority both for her and for the Bush administration. But the targeted violence and mass Christian exodus remained unaddressed. \u2018\u2018One of the blind spots of the Bush administration was the inability to grapple with this as a direct byproduct of the invasion,\u2019\u2019 says Timothy Shah, the associate director of Georgetown University\u2019s Religious Freedom Project.", "More recently, the White House has been criticized for eschewing the term \u2018\u2018Christian\u2019\u2019 altogether. The issue of Christian persecution is politically charged; the Christian right has long used the idea that Christianity is imperiled to rally its base. When ISIS massacred Egyptian Copts in Libya this winter, the State Department came under fire for referring to the victims merely as \u2018\u2018Egyptian citizens.\u2019\u2019 Daniel Philpott, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, says, \u2018\u2018When ISIS is no longer said to have religious motivations nor the minorities it attacks to have religious identities, the Obama administration\u2019s caution about religion becomes excessive.\u2019\u2019", "Last fall, Obama did refer to Christians and other religious minorities by name in a speech, saying, \u2018\u2018we cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands.\u2019\u2019 When ISIS threatened to eradicate the Yazidis, \u2018\u2018it was the United States that stepped in to beat back the militants,\u2019\u2019 Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the National Security Council, says. In northeastern Syria, where ISIS is still launching attacks against Assyrian Christian villages, the U.S. military recently come to their aid, Baskey added. Refugees are a thornier issue. Of the more than 122,000 Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States, nearly 40 percent already belong to oppressed minorities. Admitting more would be difficult. \u2018\u2018There are limits to what the international community can do,\u2019\u2019 Saperstein said.", "Eshoo, the Democratic congresswoman, is working to establish priority refugee status for minorities who want to leave Iraq. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a hair ball,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018The average time for admittance to the United States is more than 16 months, and that\u2019s too long. Many will die.\u2019\u2019 But it can be difficult to rally widespread support. The Middle East\u2019s Christians often favor Palestine over Israel. And because support of Israel is central to the Christian Right \u2014 Israel must be occupied by the Jews before Jesus can return \u2014 this stance distances Eastern Christians from a powerful lobby that might otherwise champion their cause. Recently, Ted Cruz admonished an audience of Middle Eastern Christians at an In Defense of Christians event in Washington, telling them that Christians \u2018\u2018have no better ally than the Jewish state.\u2019\u2019 Cruz was booed.", "The fate of Christians in the Middle East isn\u2019t simply a matter of religion; it is also integral to what kinds of societies will flourish as the region\u2019s map fractures. In Lebanon, for example, where Christians have always played a powerful role in government, they increasingly serve as a buffer between Sunni and Shia. For nearly 70 years, Lebanon was a proxy battleground for the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Across the region, that conflict is now secondary to the shifting tectonic plates of the Sunni-Shia divide, which threatens terrible bloodshed.", "Earlier this year, Lebanon closed its borders to almost everyone escaping the war in Syria but made an exception for Christians fleeing ISIS. When the extremists attacked the villages along the Khabur River, the interior minister, Nouhad Machnouk, ordered the official in charge of the border to allow Christians to enter the country. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t put this in writing,\u2019\u2019 the border official said. Machnouk replied, \u2018\u2018O.K., say it aloud, word by word.\u2019\u2019", "Machnouk told me this story on a recent evening. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re paying much, much, much more than others,\u2019\u2019 in both Syria and Iraq, he said. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not Sunni and not Shia, but they\u2019re paying more than both.\u2019\u2019 We sat in his airy office, housed in a former art school from the Ottoman era. It was decorated with his private collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including a carved basalt head with finely wrought curls. For the minister, a moderate Sunni, sheltering Christians is as much a sociopolitical imperative as a moral one.", "In Lebanon, the tension between Sunni and Shia plays out in a system of political patronage, which has split the Christian community into two rival political parties, both born of the country\u2019s 15-year-long civil war. The pro-Saudi Future movement, which consists of mainly Sunnis, supports the Christian leader Samir Geagea, who lives atop Mount Lebanon behind three check points, two X-ray machines and a set of steel doors. Hezbollah, which is Shia and backed by Iran, has been openly allied since 2006 with the Free Patriotic Movement (F.P.M.), a Christian Party headed by Michel Aoun. For Hezbollah, Christians offer an opportunity to forge an alliance with a fellow minority. (Of the world\u2019s one and a half billion Muslims, only 10 to 20 percent are Shia.)", "\u2018\u2018It\u2019s a political game,\u2019\u2019 Alain Aoun, a member of Parliament for the F.P.M. and Michel Aoun\u2019s nephew, told me. The emergence of ISIS has strengthened the alliance. \u2018\u2018The Christians are happy to have anyone who can fight against I.S.\u2019\u2019 Hezbollah has paid young Christian men from Lebanon\u2019s impoverished Bekaa Valley a one-time $500 to $2,000 fee to fight ISIS.", "\u2018\u2018Christians here are making the same calculation that Obama does,\u2019\u2019 Hanin Ghaddar, the managing editor of NOW, a news website in Lebanon, said, referring to Obama\u2019s willingness to support Iran as a bulwark against Sunni extremism. For many Christians in the Middle East, a Shia alliance offers a hope of survival, however slim. Ghaddar, an independent Shia, says that it is uncertain how these tenuous allegiances will play out. This spring, pro-Iranian forces of Hezbollah were battling Sunni extremists in Syria. No one knew who would prevail. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re waiting for the snow to melt.\u2019\u2019", "The front line against ISIS in Northern Iraq is marked by an earthen berm that runs for hundreds of miles over the Nineveh Plain. A string of Christian towns now stands empty, and the Kurdish forces occupy what, for thousands of years, was Assyrian, Chaldean and Syriac land. In one, Telskuf, seized by ISIS last year, the main square is overgrown with brambles and thistles. It was once a thriving market town. Every Thursday, hundreds came to buy clothes, honey and vegetables. Telskuf was home to 7,000 people; now only three remain.", "The Nineveh Plain Forces, a 500-member Assyrian Christian militia, patrols the town. The N.P.F. is one of five Assyrian militias formed during the past year after the rout of ISIS. It shares a double aim with two other militias, Dwekh Nawsha, an all-volunteer force of around 100, and the Nineveh Plains Protection Units, a battalion of more than 300: to help liberate Christian lands from ISIS and to protect their people, possibly as part of a nascent national guard, when they return home. The two other militias are the Syriac Military Council, which is fighting alongside the Kurds in northeastern Syria, and the Babylonian Brigades, which operate under Iraq\u2019s Shia-dominated militias.", "A few of these militias are aided by a handful of American, Canadian and British citizens, who, frustrated with their governments\u2019 lack of response to ISIS, have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight on their own. Some come in the name of fellow Christians. Some come to relive their roles in the United States invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 or to make amends for them. One American named Matthew VanDyke, the founder of Sons of Liberty International, a security company, has provided free training for the N.P.U. and is now about to work with a second militia, Dwekh Nawsha. VanDyke, who is 36, traveled to Libya in 2011 to fight against Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s forces; he was captured and spent 166 days in solitary confinement before escaping and returning to combat. He has no formal military training, but since last fall, he has brought American veterans to Iraq to help the N.P.U., including James Halterman, a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, who found the group on the Internet after watching a segment about Westerners fighting ISIS on Fox News. The United States government does not support groups like VanDyke\u2019s. \u2018\u2018Americans who have traveled to Iraq to fight are not part of U.S. efforts in the region,\u2019\u2019 Joseph Pennington, the consul general in Erbil, says. \u2018\u2018We wish they would not come here.\u2019\u2019", "In Iraq, the militias operate at the front only with the approval of the Kurdish peshmerga, who are using the fight against ISIS to expand their territory into the Nineveh Plain, long a disputed territory between Arabs and Kurds. Even to travel 1,000 yards between bases and forward posts, the Christian militias must ask the Kurds for permission. The Kurds are looking to integrate all the Christian militias into their force; they have succeeded with the N.P.F. and two others. But the N.P.U. remains wary. They fear that the Kurds are using the Christian cause to seize territory for a greater Kurdistan. And because the Kurdish forces abandoned them as ISIS approached, the militias want the right to protect their own people. For now, they make do with the help they can find. Romeo Hakari, the head of the N.P.F., said, \u2018\u2018We want U.S. trainers, but we can\u2019t even afford to buy weapons.\u2019\u2019 After his militia purchased 20 AK-47s in an open market in Erbil, the Kurds gave them 100 more.", "Other than a daily mortar or two launched by ISIS from a village a mile and a half away, the area the N.P.U. patrolled was a sleepy target. After coalition airstrikes pushed ISIS out of Telskuf last summer, the group retreated about a mile and a half to the southwest. Beyond a bulldozed trench and a line of burlap sandbags littered with sunflower-seed shells, 12 black flags fluttered over a village. Three weeks earlier, at 4:20 a.m., two suicide bombers carrying a ladder to place over the trench attacked this forward post. The suicide attack was foiled after the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS launched airstrikes, which killed 13 ISIS fighters, Manaf Yussef, a Kurdish security official in charge of this front, said. \u2018\u2018Without airstrikes, we\u2019d lose,\u2019\u2019 he said. Minutes later, a high whistle signaled an incoming ISIS shell, which set fire to a nearby wheat field. The land is sere due to a drought.", "As a column of smoke from the daily ISIS shell billowed into the blue sky, five Assyrian fighters belonging to the Nineveh Plain Forces went from house to house to evacuate the last residents of Telskuf \u2014 three old women. When the N.P.F. commander, Safaa Khamro, pushed open the door of the first house, Christina Jibbo Kakhosh began to cry. She was 91.", "\u2018\u2018I have no running water,\u2019\u2019 she said. Less than four feet tall, she peered up at Khamro through bottle-thick glasses.", "\u2018\u2018I fixed it for you yesterday,\u2019\u2019 Khamro said.", "\u2018\u2018I forgot,\u2019\u2019 she said. She shuffled back inside and beckoned him to follow. Her refrigerator was flung open; because there was no electricity, it served as a pantry. A half-eaten jar of tahini, a lighter and a pair of scissors sat on a table in front of the mattress on which she slept. When she heard her visitors were American, she said: \u2018\u2018Three of my children are in America. Only one has called me.\u2019\u2019", "Khamro tried to persuade her to come to a house near the base where she would be safer. \u2018\u2018It has satellite TV,\u2019\u2019 he said. She packed a small satchel and left with the patrol. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s my uncle\u2019s house,\u2019\u2019 one Assyrian fighter said as he passed a padlocked gate. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s in Australia now.\u2019\u2019 The patrol passed St. Jacob\u2019s Church, where ISIS fighters had destroyed a porcelain statue of Jesus, which was now missing its face. An icon of a martyr having his fingers cut off by Tamerlane, who massacred tens of thousands of Assyrian Christians during the 14th century, hung on the wall.", "Nearby, the N.P.F. had replaced the cross that ISIS fighters filmed themselves hurling down. Khamro was a politician in Telskuf before ISIS invaded. He owned one of the 480 now-shuttered shops, a boutique that sold women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothes. He\u2019d sent his wife and children to Al Qosh, 10 miles to the north, a safer Christian city.", "Khamro turned off the main drag and into a warren of overgrown pathways. He stopped before a chicken-wire awning, calling out \u2018\u2018Auntie\u2019\u2019 to Kamala Karim Shaya, who sat on her front stoop, a kerchief tied over her thick white ponytail. When she learned that Khamro had come to move her out of her clay home, she began to scream: \u2018\u2018Even if my father stands up in his grave, I will not leave this house. No, no, no, no, no, never, never, never,\u2019\u2019 she shouted. Khamro, who refused to move her by force, had no choice but to pass on.", "Even if ISIS is defeated, the fate of religious minorities in Syria and Iraq remains bleak. Unless minorities are given some measure of security, those who can leave are likely to do so. Nina Shea of the Hudson Institute, a conservative policy center, says that the situation has grown so dire that Iraqi Christians must either be allowed full residency in Kurdistan, including the right to work, or helped to leave. Others argue that it is essential that minorities have their own autonomous region. Exile is a death knell for these communities, activists say. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve been here as an ethnicity for 6,000 years and as Christians for 1,700 years,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Srood Maqdasy, a member of the Kurdish Parliament. \u2018\u2018We have our own culture, language and tradition. If we live within other communities, all of this will be dissolved within two generations.\u2019\u2019", "The practical solution, according to many Assyrian Christians, is to establish a safe haven on the Nineveh Plain. \u2018\u2018If the West could take in so many refugees and the U.N.H.C.R. handle an operation like that, then we wouldn\u2019t ask for a permanent solution,\u2019\u2019 says Nuri Kino, of A Demand for Action. \u2018\u2018But the most realistic option is returning home.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018We don\u2019t have time to wait for solutions,\u2019\u2019 said the Rev. Emanuel Youkhana, the head of Christian Aid Program Northern Iraq. \u2018\u2018For the first time in 2,000 years, there are no church services in Mosul. The West comes up with one solution by granting visas to a few hundred people. What about a few hundred thousand?\u2019\u2019 If Iraq devolves into three regions \u2014 Sunnis, Shia and Kurds \u2014 there could be a fourth for minorities. \u2018\u2018Iraq is a forced marriage between Sunni, Shia, Kurds and Christians, and it failed,\u2019\u2019 Youkhana said. \u2018\u2018Even I, as a priest, favor divorce.\u2019\u2019", "Proponents say a safe haven wouldn\u2019t require an international force or a no-fly zone, neither of which is likely to find much support in the United States or among its allies. U.S. policy does play a role. When Congress was asked to approve $1.6 billion in aid for Iraqi forces fighting ISIS \u2014 the Iraqi Army, the Kurds and the Sunni tribes \u2014 it amended the bill to explicitly include local forces on the Nineveh Plain, but also passed legislation directing the State Department to implement a safe haven there. Ultimately, however, the responsibility lies with the Iraqis. Pennington, the consul general, said, \u2018\u2018The creation of a safe haven in the Nineveh Province would be an idea for the Iraqi Parliament in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution.\u2019\u2019", "Tarek Mitri, a former Lebanese minister and a former special representative to the U.N. secretary general for Libya, says that his impression in speaking to officials in the White House \u2018\u2018is that Obama is in a withdrawal mood. He thinks that he was elected to withdraw from Afghanistan and Iraq and to make a deal with Iran. If this is the mood, then we shouldn\u2019t expect much or ask much from the Americans.\u2019\u2019 Baskey, of the National Security Council, counters that \u2018\u2018rather than withdrawing, the president and this administration have, in fact, remained deeply engaged, building and leading a coalition of some 60 nations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\u2019\u2019", "The last time Rana, one of the women taken by ISIS from Qaraqosh, was able to speak to her family by phone was in September. She told them what had befallen Rita and Christina. Rita had been given as a slave to a powerful member of ISIS; Christina was given to a family to be raised as a Muslim.", "Rana said little about her own circumstances, and her family didn\u2019t ask. To be honest, they weren\u2019t sure they wanted to know what ISIS had done to her.", "For months now, the phone Rana used has been switched off. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s word they\u2019re still alive,\u2019\u2019 Rabee Mano, 36, a refugee from Qaraqosh who runs an underground railroad out of the Islamic State, told me one recent evening over beer and kebabs. \u2018\u2018She\u2019s been \u2018married\u2019 to a powerful guy in ISIS,\u2019\u2019 he added, as he sat in the garden at the Social Academic Center in Ankawa, a Christian suburb of Erbil. At the next table, three gleeful men poured straight vodka into plastic cups. Over the past year, Ankawa has swelled by 60,000 as refugees have poured in.", "For nearly a year, Mano has been trying to buy freedom for Rana, Rita and Christina from ISIS. Through his network of contacts, a greedy ISIS member, friends in Arab villages and a brave taxi driver, Mano has paid to free 45 people. The haggling is made easier by the fact that ISIS members frequently trade women among themselves, so the buying and selling of people doesn\u2019t raise suspicion. This work has cost him $10,000, which he raised by opening a carwash. He sent $800 to a member of ISIS, saying he would send more when the women and the child made it to safety. But the man had done nothing of what he promised.", "Before Mano fled his hometown last August, he dealt in commercial real estate. \u2018\u2018You can see my buildings from Google Earth,\u2019\u2019 he said. At the picnic table, he pulled an expired Arizona driver\u2019s license from his wallet. It was a temporary license from 2011, the year he came to the United States and tried to buy 48 apartments. The deal fell through, so he went home; now his passport had expired. He lost about $1.5 million, he said.", "He longed to return to the Nineveh Plain. \u2018\u2018Even though all of my money is in the garbage, I\u2019ll be O.K. if we get this safe haven,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it takes too long, we\u2019ll be annihilated.\u2019\u2019 It was all he thought about. \u2018\u2018Are we going home or not?\u2019\u2019 he asked. \u2018\u2018This safe haven is the last chance we have, or Christianity will be finished in Iraq.\u2019\u2019", "Earlier, a text message came in from Mosul. One of his contacts was having trouble locating a woman named Nabila, who was ready to be smuggled to safety. Mano had instructed her to hang a black cloth in her window so that her rescuer could find the right house. But the wind had blown the cloth to the ground, and now her would-be rescuer couldn\u2019t tell where she was being held. They would have to try again. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll tell her to hang a blanket,\u2019\u2019 Mano said.

It\u2019s the world\u2019s third-largest company based on market capitalization (after Apple and Google) and earned $4.9 billion in its latest quarter, even with a downturn in oil prices.", "But Exxon is doing more than just allowing employees to march in support of gay rights under the company\u2019s banner. This year, after decades of resistance, Exxon formally amended its anti-discrimination policy to include sexual orientation and gender identity.", "In October, the company will for the first time be an official sponsor of the Out and Equal Workplace Summit, a conference dedicated to \u201cworkplace equality inclusive of all sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions.\u201d Last year, it recruited new employees at the Reaching Out M.B.A. job fair, an annual event for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students enrolled in M.B.A. programs. Exxon is hardly a pioneer when it comes to gay rights, and it still lags far behind most major American corporations. Some of the recent changes were imposed on the company by federal law and Supreme Court decisions. Others, like endorsing employee participation in a gay pride parade, seem aimed at recruiting and retaining talented employees.", "\u201cLike other major oil companies, Exxon is increasingly a technology company,\u201d said Steve Coll, author of \u201cPrivate Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power\u201d and dean of the Columbia University School of Journalism. \u201cThey need to attract and retain the top scientific and engineering talent.

Chris Martin, a refining and supply operations manager in public affairs based in Houston, told me this week. Mr. Martin is president of Pride, the company\u2019s resource group for lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people, often referred to as L.G.B.T. \u201cI think what\u2019s changed is that we\u2019ve been able to show there\u2019s a business advantage to the company,\u201d especially in recruiting.", "Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, said the company had no comment.", "Now that gay Americans have gained the right to serve in the military and to marry, the workplace remains one of the last battlegrounds for gay rights advocates. There\u2019s no federal law prohibiting discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Twenty-nine states, including Texas, where Exxon has its headquarters, don\u2019t prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, and 32 states fail to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, according to the Human Rights Campaign.", "For Mr. Martin, 54, an electrical engineering graduate and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps veteran who started working for Mobil at its New York City headquarters 27 years ago, progress at Exxon has been a long time coming. He helped negotiate Mobil\u2019s gay-inclusive policies, so it was especially disheartening when Exxon rescinded them.", "Gay rights advocates at the company \u201cpretty much went underground\u201d after that, he said, until he and other gay employees sought approval for a company-sanctioned gay employees organization in 2006, soon after Rex W. Tillerson succeeded Lee Raymond as the company\u2019s chief executive.", "The blunt-spoken Mr. Raymond was chief executive when Exxon rescinded the Mobil protections, and he repeatedly brushed the issue aside at shareholder meetings. But even with a new and potentially more open-minded chief executive, it took over a year of discussions. The company clearly didn\u2019t want an attention-getting activist group in the mold of Act Up, which used confrontational public protests and street theater to draw attention to the plight of AIDS victims. \u201cWe stressed that we were interested in collaborative advocacy,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cThat was always our plan.\u201d", "Exxon approved the formation of Pride in August 2008. Today the group has eight chapters and over 700 members (out of more than 83,000 employees worldwide), although it\u2019s not certain how many are themselves lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, since all groups at the company are open to all employees. Members can also choose to be blind-copied on emails and other announcements so their identities aren\u2019t disclosed. But Mr. Martin said the number of members choosing that option has now dwindled to about a dozen.", "Like all affinity groups at Exxon, the group has a company executive who acts as an adviser, or sponsor. Pride\u2019s sponsor is Bryan Milton, president of Exxon Mobil Global Services. Though Mr. Milton isn\u2019t gay, Mr. Martin credits him with helping raise the group\u2019s profile within the upper ranks of Exxon. Pride also has an advisory council of four higher-ranking executives, all of them openly gay.", "Progress has been incremental, but it seems to have accelerated since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 ruling in United States v. Windsor, which struck down the Defense of Marriage act barring same-sex partners from federal marital benefits. In September, Exxon extended marital benefits to same-sex spouses in the United States, and noted that it did the same in 30 countries where same-sex marriages were recognized.", "Last July, President Obama signed an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and in late January, Exxon quietly followed suit for all employees in the United States.", "Exxon has long maintained that such policies are unnecessary because the company is a meritocracy and doesn\u2019t discriminate against anybody. As Ken Cohen, an Exxon vice president for public affairs, put it in a blog post last year: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for large companies such as Exxon to be the target of political campaigns, which has been the case with efforts by a small number of very vocal advocates of the L.G.B.T. community.\u201d Nonetheless, he wrote, \u201cLet us be absolutely clear: Exxon does not discriminate, will not discriminate, and has not discriminated against members of the L.G.B.T. community. Period.\u201d", "Since I first wrote about the issue in 2013, several current and former gay employees have told me they agree with that claim. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced any discrimination that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an issue.\u201d He feels the public perception that the company is anti-gay \u201cis very unfair, and we know it\u2019s not true.\u201d", "Still, Exxon retains a conservative and meritocratic culture, in which singling out any group is seen as a potentially dangerous step on the road to affirmative action. And the company has long prided itself on resisting pressure from outside activists, whether the topic be social issues or global warming. Even with its latest more inclusive policies, it\u2019s far behind the 366 businesses with 100 percent ratings at the top of the Human Rights Campaign equality index, such as Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Pfizer.", "Exxon \u201chas been the subject of every pressure campaign the world could conceive of,\u201d said Mr. Coll. \u201cSo their initial reaction is always to put up a moat defense and resist.\u201d He noted, too, that Exxon is heir to the old Standard Oil culture, \u201cwhich drew no distinction between ardent Protestantism and business principles.\u201d Exxon meetings often began with a prayer as recently as the 1980s, he said.", "The energy giant was \u201cthe last of the Fortune 10\u201d to ban anti-gay discrimination in the workplace, and \u201cone of the slowest of the Fortune 500,\u201d said Cece Cox, chief executive of Resource Center in Dallas, who has met with Exxon executives at its headquarters in Irving, Tex., to press gay rights issues.", "\u201cBut I guess that makes it all the more remarkable,\u201d said Ms. Cox. \u201cI\u2019m certainly glad they\u2019re taking the steps they\u2019re taking.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/your-money/hairless-head-in-a-clueless-photo-booth.html": ["In May, the Haggler needed two passport photos. Through an Internet search, he found a nearby Walgreens, the drugstore chain for people who really miss the music of Foreigner and REO Speedwagon.

Among them: Center your face to a line running down the middle of a screen. Other hints included \u201cDo not wear a hat.\u201d", "What could go wrong?", "The machine snapped a photo, and a few minutes later, a pair of identical images emerged from a slot.

A minute later, he had matching photos of his entire head.", "Huh? This baffled the Haggler for at least three seconds. Then he noticed a difference between that guy\u2019s head and the Haggler\u2019s.", "It was covered with hair. The Haggler\u2019s, on the other hand, is not. In fact, a hair contest between a Formica countertop and the Haggler\u2019s head would end in a tie. You think the Haggler wears that fedora as a tribute to Sam Spade? O.K., that\u2019s part of it.

For the record, the store charged him for only one set of photographs, $12.99, since the others were unusable.", "The Haggler left the store unsure why and how a machine could commit so blatant an act of pate-related discrimination. He wrote to a Walgreens spokesman, Phil Caruso, who promised to forward the name and contact information of the company that made the photo booth.", "Twelve days later, the Haggler had heard nothing.", "\u201cHave you been raptured?\u201d the Haggler asked, in an email.

According to the World Bank, unemployment in Gaza is at 43 percent, the highest in the world. Youth unemployment is more than 60 percent. Few ever obtain the necessary permits to travel through the territory\u2019s tightly controlled borders and almost 80 percent of the population depends on aid. Following last summer\u2019s 50-day war, in which 2,000 Palestinians and 70 Israelis were killed, rubble still fills the streets and infrastructure is in shambles. Critics of the stalled reconstruction efforts complain that not a single home has been rebuilt.

Last summer\u2019s war raised the specter of even more setbacks, with many entrepreneurs deeply affected by the fighting. Hassan\u2019s home was destroyed. Some entrepreneurs lost loved ones. But during periods of ceasefire, Hassan says he and others still gathered at the space, determined to move forward.", "Last December, the group averted a threat of closing by launching an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign.

Of course, most of my patients come to their first session already knowing something about me via Google: what I look like, where I was born, my professional affiliations. Some dig deeper and discover something about my personal life, my musical background or my service in the Israeli army. That preliminary knowledge contributes to a fantasy about who their future therapist is and what their analysis is going to be like.", "Still, most patients do not disclose their online research in the first session.

Scaring and confusing the therapist is a useful way to make sure that she is unable to think, and therefore unable to know the patient. What would have happened if I had been able to do so? Would I have been capable of putting things together, making connections, discovering who he really was? What would I, or he, find out that Guy needed desperately not to know?", "The British analyst Wilfred Bion writes in his paper \u201cAttacks on Linking\u201d about the ways in which people try to avoid knowing anything that is too much for them to tolerate, to evade the painful truths of their lives.

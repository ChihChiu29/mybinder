Wladimir Palant, a 20-something developer who was annoyed with intrusive ads online, created it as an open-source project and quickly built it up with the help of volunteers who also wanted to make the internet faster, less cluttered and safer from malware.", "Mr. Palant wanted publishers to make ads that did not \u201cdegrade\u201d internet users with interruption and animation, he wrote on his blog in 2007. As Adblock Plus surged in popularity, he was able to turn it into a full-time job, increasing its staff to three employees in 2011 and housing it under a company named Eyeo GmbH in Germany. Its motto: \u201cWe want to make the internet better for everyone. Purging bad ads is a good start.\u201d", "But shortly after that, in 2011, Adblock Plus was altered and became a tool that, instead of blocking bad ads, allowed ads it deemed \u201cacceptable\u201d to be seen, often for a price \u2014 a controversial move that has positioned it as a gatekeeper between advertisers and its huge user base.", "Now, with a staff of about 70, the company has moved even deeper into that business with an automated online advertising service that will allow more websites to place ads deemed \u201cacceptable\u201d in front of Adblock Plus users. It is a coveted group for advertisers and publishers: Users are often relatively young, well educated, tech-savvy and hard to reach. But the introduction of the service last week ignited a backlash among consumers, who accused Adblock Plus of veering from its purpose.", "\u201cIt\u2019s just the words we use for it that are confusing people,\u201d Ben Williams, director of communications and operations at Eyeo, said in an interview. \u201cWe are called Adblock Plus, and for branding reasons, we are not going to call ourselves something different. But if we could, we would call ourselves something like \u2018web customizer,\u2019 because that\u2019s really what we want to do for our users.\u201d", "Users of Adblock Plus are a \u201cvaluable segment,\u201d he added, that has \u201csaid they don\u2019t want intrusive ads and are demanding to be reached in a different way.\u201d", "The new platform will essentially allow publishers to choose from ads that Adblock Plus deems acceptable. They can then display these ads on their sites. In explaining the service on its website, Adblock Plus said it would help publishers make money when an Adblock Plus user saw that \u201cpreapproved\u201d ad instead of a blocked space, adding that it had \u201cbeen waiting years for the ad industry to do something consumer-friendly, but also industry-friendly.\u201d", "Many consumers reacted with vitriol online. \u201cYou either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,\u201d one Reddit user wrote in a thread of nearly 2,000 comments discussing the change. Reviews for Adblock Plus in Google Chrome, which routinely yield five stars, showed a flood of one- and two-star reviews after the announcement.", "\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThe internet police?\u201d", "Adblock Plus has long had a list of criteria for what constitutes an acceptable ad. As per its rules, ads must be clearly identified and placed so they do not \u201cdisrupt the user\u2019s natural reading flow,\u201d for example, and they cannot pop up, animate or contain images that enlarge.", "For several years, companies have been able to reach Adblock Plus users by creating ads that adhere to these guidelines and by undergoing a vetting process. The Adblock Plus website says it takes about 10 working days for ads to be deemed acceptable, or \u201cwhitelisted.\u201d (The company says its new service will make that process almost instantaneous.)", "The vetting includes an application, outreach from Eyeo, a signed agreement and a proposal posted to an open community message board. Adblock Plus explained that such efforts, along with monitoring individual ads and providing technical support, require funding beyond donations. Before it began whitelisting ads, Adblock Plus accepted donations and funding to become a company, although it does not disclose its financial details.", "Adblock Plus says it charges only large entities, which it defines as those that increase their ad impressions by 10 million or more a month once they have access to Adblock Plus users. And Adblock Plus typically takes a 30 percent cut of the money brought in by those ads that would otherwise not be seen by its user base. One example is ads that say \u201cSponsored Links by Taboola\u201d that often appear at the bottom of websites. According to the Adblock Plus forums, Taboola, a content-marketing company, has been accepted by Adblock Plus, to the consternation of some users.", "Adblock Plus says it ends up charging only 10 percent of its whitelisted publishers, those that reach the impressions threshold, and does not take a cut from the other 90 percent.", "Regardless, over the last few years, this toll has infuriated publishers and advertisers who do not want to pay Adblock Plus but are keen to reach its audience. As of June, Adblock Plus accounted for about 60 percent of the 220 million ad blockers installed on desktop browsers, according to PageFair, a start-up based in Dublin that develops software to fight ad blockers.", "The new ad platform is alarming because it \u201callows them to do this at scale,\u201d said John Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at the advertising giant WPP\u2019s GroupM.", "\u201cIt scares me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me uncomfortable that Adblock Plus would be the arbiters of what is good and what is not good.\u201d", "Adblock Plus, which teamed up with the advertising-technology company ComboTag to create its new platform, also attracted criticism last week after Adblock Plus announced that, as was reported by The Wall Street Journal, the new venture planned to use ad platforms operated by Google and AppNexus, a major automated online ad tech firm. Both companies, which represent the biggest advertising marketplaces, were swift to deny involvement with Adblock Plus, and both terminated ComboTag\u2019s account with them.", "\u201cWe have no involvement in their program, and this is not a business we want to be part of,\u201d Google said in a statement. The chief executive of AppNexus, Brian O\u2019Kelley, said in a blog post that it had not and would not allow ComboTag to \u201cuse our platform to monetize Eyeo and AdBlocker Plus.\u201d", "\u201cWe found that surprising, but we didn\u2019t find it in the least disheartening because it\u2019s an open system, and we built this to not be dependent on anyone on the demand side, and we fully expect to continue,\u201d Mr. Williams, of Eyeo, said. He added that 1,000 publishers signed up on its webpage to test the beta version of its platform.", "\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s just that people haven\u2019t quite wrapped their heads around exactly what our value proposition is,\u201d he added.", "Google was among the companies and trade groups that last week announced their participation in a new organization called the Coalition for Better Ads.

That LP got heavy play in our house, and in a lot of other houses. It was the first classical recording to sell more than a million copies. \u00adCliburn\u2019s 1961 album \u201cMy Favorite Chopin\u201d was on the Billboard classical best-seller list for months.", "But by the time Cliff was growing up, Cliburn played less and less, and the \u00adcritics complained more and more. They said his repertoire was limited, his \u00adtechnique was superficial and he was not \u00admaturing as an artist. In 1986, Donal Henahan wrote in this newspaper: \u201cThere must be many young music listeners to whom Van Cliburn is merely a name in \u00adAmerican history, like John Philip Sousa.\u201d Nowadays, he\u2019s not even much of a name. The first time I did a search of \u201cVan Cliburn,\u201d Google shot back the primordial did-you-mean \u00adquestion: Van Claiborne?", "So one of Cliff\u2019s challenges is to present a basic biography of this \u201cman-child who was old when young and young when old.\u201d Cliburn\u2019s story \u2014 how he rocketed to fame by winning the first \u00adInternational Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow at age 23 \u2014 has been told before, in 16 excellent pages toward the beginning of Joseph Horowitz\u2019s \u201cThe Ivory Trade\u201d (1990) and in Howard Reich\u2019s \u201cVan \u00adCliburn\u201d (1993). But their emphasis was more on the music than on diplomacy and the Cold War. By the time Cliburn arrived in Moscow in the spring of 1958, the United States had countered the Soviets\u2019 Sputnik 1 and 2 with Explorer 1, but the psychological damage had been done. There was a space race as well as an arms race.", "As for the piano race, everyone assumed a Russian would win, probably 29-year-old Lev Vlassenko. But Cliburn captivated the crowds and caused a problem for the judges: Could they award him the gold medal? As Cliff writes, \u201cin a system where all decisions went through the party, there was only one way to avoid blame: Refer it upward.\u201d One of the \u00adjudges, the pianist Emil Gilels, went to the culture minister, who went to Khrushchev, who did not interfere. If the young American is the best, he said, go right ahead, give him the prize. Cliburn remains the only American pianist who has won the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky Competition.", "Cliff argues that \u201ca powerful new weapon exploded across the Soviet Union\u201d when Cliburn sat down at the piano \u2014 \u201clove: one man\u2019s love for music, which ignited an impassioned love affair between him and an entire nation.\u201d It was anything but illicit. Max Frankel, who as a New York Times correspondent was a witness to Cliburn\u2019s triumph, wrote later that \u201cthe Soviet public celebrated Cliburn not only for his artistry but for his nationality; affection for him was a safe expression of affection for America.\u201d", "Like so many subtitles, Cliff\u2019s (\u201cThe Van Cliburn Story \u2014 How One Man and His Piano Transformed the Cold War\u201d) oversimplifies a more nuanced account. Cliff did not turn up evidence that Cliburn ever passed secret diplomatic \u00addispatches back and forth; as he writes, Cliburn may have been \u201ccourted by presidents and Politburo members,\u201d but he was also \u201cwatched by the F.B.I. and K.G.B.\u201d", "Mostly Cliburn served as a relief valve, easing the pressures his audiences felt. He did so again in 1987, when Mikhail Gorbachev went to Washington for arms-control talks with President Ronald Reagan. After a particularly difficult day, Cliburn played at the White House. When he struck up the Russian melody \u201cMoscow Nights\u201d as an encore \u2014 Raisa \u00adGorbachev wanted to hear the Tchaikovsky concerto, but there was no orchestra \u2014 Cliff writes that the evening \u201cturned into a full-throated singalong.\u201d Everyone went to bed in a much better mood."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/asia/china-united-states-presidential-election.html": ["As Election Day approaches in the United States, the Chinese are paying closer attention to the selection of the next president.", "Government censorship, the language barrier and an unfamiliarity with American political conventions have left many Chinese confused about the process.

If users somehow think to hover the cursor over the symbol (in the website version), they get a semi-explanation that does not reveal that hotels pay for this privilege.", "Booking.com notes that hotels in this category must meet certain minimum standards, including solid review scores and few customer complaints.

When I sorted hotels by user ratings, it came up 381st of 383 in the city. It does, however, have a thumbs up.", "Leslie Cafferty, a spokeswoman for Booking, attributed its high visibility to its excellent conversion rate.", "Expedia also allows hotels to pay a higher commission in exchange for better placement in search results.

That in particular includes lidar and high-definition digital maps that will help automated cars distinguish between overhead signs and an obstacle such as a tractor-trailer. Neither of those technologies are available with Tesla\u2019s system.", "\u201cWe believe lidar and a high-definition map are required,\u201d Mr. Nair said.", "During Monday\u2019s demonstrations, while Ford engineers sat in the driver\u2019s seat with hands off the steering wheel and feet off the pedals, the cars piloted themselves over a short, 10-minute loop, stopping when necessary for pedestrians, stop lights and intersections.", "During this reporter\u2019s demonstration ride, the Fusion came to a stop at a crosswalk. After a group of pedestrians had passed, the car began to edge forward but then hit its brakes again. Well off to the left, perhaps 10 feet from the crosswalk, a straggler was hurrying to catch up to the group. The car\u2019s lidar had spotted the man and the car sensed he was likely to dart into the road \u2014 and he did.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the benefit of lidar,\u201d said James McBride, a Ford engineer. Since radar looks forward, it might not notice a potential obstacle like a pedestrian entering from the side. But lidar scans across a wide field of vision, and is capable of picking up key details of an object, not just its shape, Mr. McBride said.", "\u201cLidar can make out the fingers on a pedestrian\u2019s hand,\u201d he said.", "Google, too, is incorporating lidar into its self-driving cars.", "The Ford cars used in the demonstration were outfitted with bulky lidar systems mounted on their roofs. Within about a month, though, the company plans to assemble self-driving Fusions with two lidar units that will be slightly larger than hockey pucks.", "Ford expects its experimental fleet of self-driving cars to grow to 30 by the end of the year, and it expects to have three times that number by the end of 2017.", "By 2021, the company has vowed to start production of a driverless car, with no steering wheel, and have it in use by a ride-hailing company in an Uber-like service.", "Uber is developing its own self-driving cars and is starting a pilot project soon in Pittsburgh in which the vehicles will pick up real passengers, with an engineer in the front seat in case something goes wrong.

The Federal Election Commission, for example, investigated the way Robert Murray, chief executive of Murray Energy, had solicited political donations from his employees through emails and internal videos. Some employees told The New Republic that they felt pressured to donate, fearing that not to do so might risk their jobs.The Federal Election Commission, ultimately, found Mr. Murray hadn\u2019t broken any laws.", "Still, the risks \u2013 and complex set of election laws \u2013 make political fund-raising a complicated endeavor for those in the corner office. \u201cThe potentially coercive effect of an employer\u2019s solicitation counsels in favor of avoiding the situation altogether,\u201d said Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm. \u201cThe logical alternative \u2014 having a very strong and clear disclaimer \u2014 doesn\u2019t really work, since many employees might not believe the disclaimer, no matter how strongly it is worded.\u201d", "Tony Fratto, a former deputy assistant to President George W.

Perhaps because of the lingering negative memories of the financial crisis or perhaps because this presidential election has turned so decidedly nasty, many executives have stayed on the sideline. In June, Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, canceled an event at his home for Donald Trump after it was reported to be causing a firestorm among Intel employees and peers in Silicon Valley that felt Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were damaging to the industry.

With the trial, a handful of test vehicles \u2014 Ford Fusions at first \u2014 will roam the streets, each car coming with a human safety engineer who has undergone training to reassure riders that the process is safe.", "During my ride, most of which I spent as a passenger in Boron 6\u2019s back seat, my safety engineer proved his worth. At various moments, he had to take over the wheel and turn through intersections where locals are known to speed. When a truck driver backed out into the road illegally, he put his foot on the brake, immediately taking control of the car.", "If the safety engineer felt unsafe, he could at any time smack down a big red button in the center console \u2014 suspiciously similar to a seat ejector switch from a James Bond film \u2014 to disengage from self-driving mode. To turn the self-driving feature back on, he need only press a sleek steel button next to an embossed nameplate stamped on the console.", "If I felt unsafe as a passenger, I could also request that the driver take over the vehicle, or press a button on a screen facing the back seat that would end the ride. I also monitored the infrared environment the car had rendered from the screen, a 3-D world updating in real time, and took a selfie from a camera built into the console. After the ride, Uber texts to passengers an animated GIF of the 3-D modeled route taken, along with the selfie.", "But for most of the ride, I felt safe. In self-driving mode, turns and stops were near seamless, and I often had to check in with my driver to see whether he or the computer was steering the car.

It stayed exactly at the speed limit \u2014 25 miles per hour where we drove \u2014 even when there was no traffic around. At one stoplight, the car waited for the green signal before turning right. The human drivers behind us were not pleased.", "As my ride in Boron 6 wound down \u2014 in total, I traveled roughly 20 miles in the vehicle \u2014 it was hard not to feel like a celebrity, or perhaps more like a Martian. Other motorists gawked, and a boy on a Razor scooter gaped at me from a corner, waving to his mother to come look.", "This future has been a long time coming. Advertising for self-driving cars goes at least as far back as the 1950s, with images of families in cars huddled around game boards in the back seat, playing dominoes. Some of the people involved in the Uber project have spent their entire careers working toward a day like Wednesday.", "But how they will get rich from it remains unclear. Much of Uber\u2019s success has been based on the premise that people could share their idle cars with the public by driving during their spare time. A self-driving car obviates the need for human drivers, a clear source of tension among Uber drivers today. Company executives said self-driving cars would be only one part of Uber\u2019s business in the future, with a mix of drivers and autonomous vehicles.", "And Uber isn\u2019t the first to place big bets on self-driving cars, with Google, Apple, Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Infiniti all offering or developing autonomous features for vehicles.

When the company announced its autonomous car pilot last month, the tests were expected to roll out with Volvo XC90s, sport utility vehicles that would be modified in partnership with the automaker. Uber now says the XC90s are expected to hit the road by the end of the year, but it offered no explanation for the delay, and Volvo did not respond to a request for comment.", "All of these companies face an uncertain regulatory environment for driverless vehicles that could impede the rollouts of the cars across the country.", "There will be delays and bugs, such as the one I encountered my first time behind the wheel when the self-driving car didn\u2019t drive itself.

The wealth of sensors and recording equipment will see what happens \u2014 warts and all \u2014 \u201cso we can learn more about what makes drivers and riders comfortable and safe,\u201d said Emily Duff Bartel, a product manager at the Advanced Technologies Center.", "For me, it took about 10 minutes of troubleshooting to work through the glitches, but Boron 6 eventually turned on and started driving itself.

The highlight of mine was a reply-all-apocalypse that struck The New York Times. Someone accidentally sent an email to the whole company (it was about travel deals), and then reporters stationed all over the planet started emailing back to ask to be removed from the list. For about 10 minutes on Thursday, the paper of record ground to a halt. It was fabulous.", "Mike: I briefly considered trolling everyone on the list, but did not want to end up memorialized on some internet gossip rag.

Mark Zuckerberg was traveling the globe this week to talk about Facebook\u2019s commitment to connectivity and world peace and whatever other stuff billionaires say.

The firm was founded in 2009 as a new kind of V.C. Rather than just give start-ups money, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, storied tech entrepreneurs, would also help companies with hiring, communications and other functions that young firms need. The model has been widely copied and hailed as game-changing, and A16Z, as the firm is known, is now recognized as one of the Valley\u2019s elite investors.", "But apparently its returns don\u2019t match its reputation. The Journal said other top V.C.s had made a lot more money for their investors. Two funds raised by Sequoia Capital last decade have returned eight times their investors\u2019 money, and its 2010 fund is up 5.5 times. Benchmark\u2019s 2011 fund has rung up returns of 11 times\u2019 investors\u2019 money. A16Z, by comparison, is at around two times its investors\u2019 money so far. That\u2019s better than a lot of other venture firms, but not earth-shattering.", "Mike: For what it\u2019s worth, A16Z got one of its partners to write a very long takedown where they use a lot of math to explain why The Journal is wrong.", "I think the Journal story is ultimately a small stain on the firm\u2019s reputation, but it won\u2019t deter the firm from raising another giant fund in another year or two. And, um, entrepreneurs will probably still accept the millions of dollars that A16Z wants to give them. So this is more about pride than it is dollars. And if there\u2019s one way to get under a venture capitalist\u2019s skin, it\u2019s to ding their egos. (Same goes for me, too.)", "Farhad: Finally, let\u2019s talk Apple, which is in the news for a couple reasons. First, it\u2019s holding an event next week to introduce a new iPhone and a new Apple Watch. Second, it was hit with a $14.5 billion tax bill in Europe, after officials at the European Commission concluded that Ireland had unfairly given the company a tax break.

So, here\u2019s my take on Apple. The vast majority of Apple events these days are boring in the sense that many of the new features leak in advance and, even if they don\u2019t, it all seems incremental compared to the jump from BlackBerrys and flip phones to the iPhone.", "That said, boring doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be meaningful changes. Take Touch ID. When it came out, people weren\u2019t losing their mind over it, but I think it\u2019s significantly improved the iPhone experience and it\u2019s allowed for things like Apple Pay.

Saying goodbye to the headphone jack is already controversial. And I\u2019m sure it will spawn hot takes aplenty. I\u2019m curious to see how Apple walks the tightrope to justify why the jack needs to go away.", "Mike: I had the hottest take ever over this, as it may literally make me take my cellular service elsewhere and switch to Android. I can\u2019t imagine a life without my cheap, crummy headphones.", "Dai: Ultimately, the collective yawn over the new iPhones is troubling for Apple. It reminds me of when I used to cover consumer electronics in Japan. A few years after televisions shifted from bubble-butt to flat, the \u201cnew innovations\u201d from Sony, Panasonic and others couldn\u2019t move the needle. Your new TV is 20 percent thinner and 10 percent brighter? It has better audio and comes equipped with Wi-Fi?

I make the worst investments.", "Farhad: I pretty much agree with Dai, except I do think there\u2019s one more revolutionary feature left for smartphones \u2014 it\u2019s just that nobody has figured out how to achieve it yet. I\u2019m talking about much longer battery life, something like twice or longer than we get now. Until some company delivers that, most smartphone innovations will be incremental rather than revolutionary, because for most people, battery life is the only major problem with the current crop of phones. In all other ways, they work pretty miraculously.", "Mike: I think Samsung tried to do that and it literally exploded in their face.", "Farhad: Oh man, I think I just said too much about my love of smartphones.", "Mike: Anyway, thanks for coming in, Dai, and welcome to the tech team.

Here\u2019s an excerpt:", "At any given time, there are about 200,000 vessels publicly broadcasting their location at sea through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). Their signals are picked up by dozens of satellites and thousands of terrestrial receivers. Global Fishing Watch runs this information \u2014 more than 22 million points of information per day \u2014 through machine learning classifiers to determine the type of ship (e.g., cargo, tug, sail, fishing), what kind of fishing gear (longline, purse seine, trawl) they\u2019re using and where they\u2019re fishing based on their movement patterns. To do this, our research partners and fishery experts have manually classified thousands of vessel tracks as training data to \u201cteach\u201d our algorithms what fishing looks like. We then apply that learning to the entire dataset \u2014 37 billion points over the last 4.5 years \u2014 enabling anyone to see the individual tracks and fishing activity of every vessel along with its name and flag state\u2026.", "This data can help inform sustainable policy and identify suspicious behaviors for further investigation. By understanding what areas of the ocean are being heavily fished, agencies and governments can make important decisions about how much fishing should be allowed in any given area. Often, fish populations are so depleted that the only way to ensure they are replenished is to create \u201cno take areas\u201d where fishing is not allowed. Our hope is that this new technology can help governments and other organizations make decisions about which areas need protection and monitor if policies are respected\u2026.", "We\u2019ve also developed a Global Fishing Watch Research Program with 10 leading institutions from around the world.

From a technology perspective, satellites were just beginning to collect vessel positions over the open ocean, and the \u201cglobal coverage\u201d was spotty. There has been tremendous growth in machine learning with applications in new fields. Policy and regulatory frameworks have evolved, with the United States, European Union, and other nations and Regional Fishery Management Organizations now requiring that vessels broadcast their positions. Market forces and import laws are beginning to demand transparency and traceability, both as a positive differentiator and for risk management.

It also allows them to see the amount of time spent actually fishing as opposed to something else such as transiting or hanging at anchor.", "\u201cWe\u2019re very much aware of the differences of the gear types, and we\u2019ve tailor made our algorithms for that so we can really tell what is happening out there,\u201d says Kristina Boerder, one of our academic partners and an author on the paper. \u201cBecause all three algorithms were developed in one place to fit into the same framework, it is the first opportunity to run these analyses all together.\u201d\u2026", "To develop their tools, Kristina and her team analyzed satellite-based AIS tracks from 2011 to Oct 2015. They looked at characteristics such as speed, changes in direction, how a vessel moves, and how long it engages in certain types of movement. Some characteristics were more important than others in identifying each type of gear. So in order to automate the identification process, they had to take a different approach for each fishing method.", "For trawlers, they applied a machine learning approach. They fed a computer thousands of examples of trawling vessel tracks (millions of individual AIS signals) and asked the computer to identify patterns among those tracks. Having established the set of rules to define trawler patterns, the computer could then apply those rules to unidentified tracks and pick out trawling behavior.", "Purse seiner behavior is distinct in that vessels move very quickly in a circle around a school of fish to set the net, then move very slowly for a period of time, drifting as they haul up their nets. For these vessels, the researchers applied a filtering process by which, step-by-step, the computer eliminated behavior that did not fit with the behavior of pulling up the net. By re-evaluating after each filter, and applying the next level of elimination, the algorithm narrowed in on purse seine fishing events with 97 percent accuracy.", "Longliners posed a slightly different challenge because speed was not as relevant to longlining as it was to the other two gear types. In this case, the researchers used a data mining technique and applied methodology from land-based ecologists who study animal movements. Other work has shown that human fishing activity resembles that of animals searching for and hunting prey. \u201cIf an animal spends a lot of time in one confined area,\u201d Kristina says, \u201cthere has to be something of interest there\u2014they could be sleeping, or foraging, or hiding.\u201d Longliners offer the same clues by spending a lot of time traveling back and forth over the same territory as they set and retrieve their lines and hooks.", "Kristina says the team fed AIS signals into their computer and asked the computer to mine the data and pull out tracks that met a certain set of expectations for what longliner fishing behavior over time and space looked like. Evaluating each vessel track, the computer took note when a vessel began to behave according to the expectations given. It then applied the next level of expectations, highlighting tracks that met those, and re-evaluated again. This is the first time an automated process has been developed to identify fishing activity of longliners.", "The new Dalhousie algorithms can be a game changer for fisheries management and conservation, especially in combination with Global Fishing Watch\u2019s list of individual fishing vessels, which helps identify the species of fish being harvested. Knowing where and when a given species is being taken from the ocean allows for a much better assessment of fisheries management on a global scale.", "In my \u201cbend, stretch, reach, teach\u201d mantra, this new platform comes under the heading \u201creveal\u201d \u2014 and shows how the fast-growing capacity to impose transparency (as with palm oil or Volkswagen) stands to fast-forward environmental progress.", "Learn more about the Our Ocean meeting here and here\u2019s Julie Hirschfeld Davis\u2019s story on President Obama\u2019s declaration of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.", "~~\n* Updated at asterisk."], "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/09/16/business/16reuters-india-protests-bengaluru.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/09/02/technology/02reuters-google-smartphone.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/09/27/technology/27reuters-google-india.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/09/07/us/ap-us-apple-event-glance.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/fashion/weddings/rachael-dorman-peter-janowski.html": ["Rachael Elizabeth Dorman and Peter Alexander Janowski were married Sept. 17.

(\u201cUpstate,\u201d in this instance, may not quite do it justice; Potsdam is 30 miles from the Canadian border, at least 3\u00bd hours from Albany and truly impossible to quickly get to from \u2026 basically, anywhere.)", "The victim was a child \u2014 12-year-old Garrett Phillips \u2014 and the authorities were alleging an ugly motive: Prosecutors said that the accused, Oral Nicholas Hillary, had strangled the boy because his mother, a local beauty named Tandy Cyrus, had broken off a relationship, saying her son didn\u2019t care for him. But there was another wrinkle, too: Mr. Hillary was black; Garrett was white, as is his mother and most of St. Lawrence County, the rural region where all three lived. And Mr. Hillary thought the color of his skin had led, in part, to his arrest after a long, often-stalled investigation. He and his supporters blamed an overzealous district attorney, Mary Rain, with some looming ethical and professional issues, who had run and won election on a promise of focusing on the case (and campaigning with Garrett\u2019s mother).", "At first glance, the case seemed juicy, stippled with suggestions of romantic obsession, racial tension and questionable pursuit of justice: The police had admitted that they had little, if any, hard evidence linking Mr. Hillary to the crime. Moreover, Mr. Hillary seemed an unlikely suspect: A U.S. Army veteran and a former tank gunner, he was a Jamaican immigrant who had won a national championship as a collegiate soccer player and earned a head coaching job at Clarkson University by the time he was in his mid-30s. He has five children and a mild-mannered demeanor, more soccer dad than psycho killer.", "But \u2014 and this would be the first of many buts \u2014 the prosecution also pointed out that there were some serious wobbles in his alibi, which leaned on his daughter and a good friend (not exactly impartial observers, they note), and a common-sense, if knotty, question at the heart of the case: If Nick Hillary didn\u2019t do it, then whodunit?", "Murder cases and mysteries are manna for journalists, combining reporters\u2019 natural curiosity with the type of intrigue that makes readers, well, want to read.

And such a surfeit doesn\u2019t provide any sense of certainty, either of the outcome of the trial, or \u2014 more troubling, sometimes \u2014 the truth.", "That early tip from Winerip led to a lengthy dive on my part into the case last fall: doing complete interviews with the major players (including Mr. Hillary), reviewing hundreds of pages of documents and assembling a massive \u2014 and massively too long \u2014 11,000-word first draft. My artful editor, Dean Chang, managed to halve that, but delays in the trial delayed the story. And as the months passed I continued Nick Hillary reporting \u2014 mastering the drive to Potsdam, with its lottery number route (9 to 87 to 28 to 30 to 3 to 56) \u2014 while still working on a host of other stories, including other trials involving another gruesome topic: Albany\u2019s ethics problem.", "Juggling topics comes with a reporter\u2019s territory, but the oddity \u2014 and uncertainty \u2014 of the Hillary story was a constant source of stress: If the case were to be dismissed, for example, before we published, all that work \u2014 all those miles \u2014 would be for nought. In early March, though, with another possible trial date looming, our investigation of the Garrett Phillips case was published on the front page.", "But it left hanging the question that readers \u2014 and this reporter \u2014 wanted to have answered: What happened in the end? It would take months to learn more, during which time I bore back into Albany, all the time checking my Google alerts for word of developments out of Potsdam (or Canton, the St. Lawrence county seat where the trial is being held). As the fifth anniversary of the crime approached and a September trial date codified, it seemed that justice would be served; it just wouldn\u2019t be served hot.", "The case against Nick Hillary, which finally began with opening arguments a week ago Monday, is a perfect example of a circumstantial argument: The state doesn\u2019t have fingerprints, DNA or any solid forensic evidence at all linking Mr. Hillary to the crime. There\u2019s video that suggests he may have followed Garrett, there are accounts of his obsession, there are questions about whether he sometimes lied to investigators.

So choosing how to evaluate the evidence and how to weigh its importance is a constant calculation and, to be honest, an inexact one.", "The same goes for testimony offered by witnesses.

Others \u2014 including Mr. Hillary and those on his side \u2014 have said on several occasions that they can\u2019t recall details about events in the days around, and on the day of, the murder.

It is hard not to be moved in such moments, and finding the balance between sympathy and serious analysis of what\u2019s being alleged \u2014 particularly for a father, like me, of an 11-year-old boy \u2014 is complicated.", "As this suggests, there are also undeniable emotional issues at play, in large part because of the subject matter: Garrett Phillips was murdered, in cold blood, with someone\u2019s hands. He was a good kid, by all accounts: rambunctious, funny and all-too-alive. To die in such a way is unfathomable, as is the pain suffered by the family Garrett left behind.", "That family \u2014 grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and Ms. Cyrus herself \u2014 is certain that Mr. Hillary is the killer. But they have been wary of a press corps that they feel has sided with Mr. Hillary\u2019s claim of racial bias, and generally do not speak to reporters. The prosecution has also declined to comment, citing a gag order on discussing evidence set by a judge in 2015.", "The prosecution hasn\u2019t had an easy time, in part because of self-inflicted wounds, such as a revelation that it had failed to provide the defense with a statement from an inmate who placed another suspect at the crime scene, forcing an apology from Mr. Fitzpatrick.", "The defense has held daily post-court briefings with the media \u2014 a large and growing contingent as the case continues to draw attention. Mr. Hillary attends those briefings, standing alongside his team, usually unsmiling but also seemingly unafraid. He doesn\u2019t comment much, but when he does he sometimes repeats his mantra that he is \u201c100 percent innocent.\u201d", "There is only one person who actually has to decide whether this is true: Judge Felix J. Catena, who is overseeing the bench trial. (Mr. Hillary opted for this after jury selection had begun and 10 white jurors had been selected.) The defense rested on Wednesday, a day after the prosecution. Closing arguments are due Thursday, though no decision is expected until next week.", "But leaving the case behind isn\u2019t so easy. It nags the mind, even when the trial is done for the day. It has divided people in St. Lawrence County \u2014 some ardently believe that Mr. Hillary is guilty, others that he stands wrongly accused. The rift is so deep here that I\u2019ve taken to saying that, no matter the verdict, the case will never really be solved for some people.

The Anti-Defamation League\u2019s first director of technology and society, she\u2019ll be working with tech companies to combat online harassment. The magnitude of her task became clear as soon as the A.D.L. announced her hire earlier this month, when she was deluged with anti-Semitic and sexist attacks. In a recent interview, Ms. Heller talked about what companies can do to stop online abuse and how her personal experiences have informed her, and offered advice for others dealing with harassment online.", "How did the Anti-Defamation League decide they needed to hire someone to work with tech companies against harassment?", "People wanted a focus on tech and combating online hate for years, but recently there\u2019s been an increase in online hate. A good personal example of this is that they put out a press release announcing my position and they made an announcement on Twitter as well. Within minutes of A.D.L. announcing this position, I opened up my Twitter feed and I found hateful symbols, I found echoes and swastikas and green frogs and people discussing my death. Within hours it became enhanced with statements of Holocaust denial, and within days it\u2019s become ad hominem attacks based on Jewish stereotypes and misogyny. At this point it\u2019s not surprising anymore that this occurs, but the speed of it, and the ferocity of it \u2014 that I think is shocking.", "There were two events that people at A.D.L. really took notice of. There was Julia Ioffe\u2019s piece about Melania Trump, that resulted in an online and offline campaign of hatred directed against her, and there was a coordinated campaign by white supremacist groups which resulted in death threats and really severe online abuse. Additionally, Jonathan Weisman of The New York Times tweeted a piece about the election and he got similar threats and online abuse. A.D.L. was very concerned that this kind of toxic environment would prompt self-censorship by journalists and really impact public discourse long after the election.", "How much is the Trump campaign to blame for the recent rise in online harassment?", "A.D.L. is a nonprofit organization, therefore we do not support any particular political party and we do not endorse or reject candidates for office. That said, A.D.L.\u2019s work encompasses fighting bigotry of all kinds, and we encourage all candidates to call out hate. We\u2019ve been on record engaging with members of the Trump campaign, trying to encourage them to emphasize that hate has no place in the public sphere.", "What are social networks already doing to fight harassment? What could they be doing better?", "A.D.L. is actually an inaugural member of the Twitter Trust and Safety Council which looks at issues of cyber hate. A.D.L. issued best practices that were supposed to counter online hate in 2014 and they were endorsed by Facebook and Google and Microsoft and Twitter.", "I\u2019ve seen an increased emphasis on companies developing technology that helps to identify greater percentages of problematic content proactively, but I think the problem there is the mind-boggling volume. It\u2019s not really realistic to assume that a filter or artificial intelligence would be able to review and eliminate hate in real time.", "I think there\u2019s a few things the companies can do when they\u2019re faced with this onslaught. First they need to communicate outrage. They have a corporate voice, and they can use this to say that cyber hate is really contrary to their vision of connecting all people. They can ensure that their terms of service and their community guidelines are clear, and more than this they can really improve enforcement and do it transparently. They can offer simplified and user-friendly mechanisms for flagging this content. Going beyond companies, people in Silicon Valley and beyond can promote counter-speech initiatives, grassroots responses or having public persons who are willing to speak out and be a voice for tolerance.", "You experienced online harassment in law school. How did your personal experience shape your thinking on this issue?", "It was instrumental in making me realize that this issue should be a priority. The reason I went to law school is that I wanted to focus on accountability for crimes that targeted people based on their race or their ethnicity or their gender. When I became a victim of cyber harassment, I really felt what it was like to be targeted online for my gender and my race and my ethnicity, and more than that I felt how terrifying it can feel to be threatened and how powerless this type of abuse can make you feel, especially when it\u2019s coming from anonymous sources.", "What advice would you give to people who are going through online harassment?", "First, I\u2019d say you\u2019re not alone. Part of the power that the harassers have is they like to make people feel isolated, and sometimes part of the ongoing harm of these kind of crimes is that you feel like there\u2019s no meaningful way for you to fight back, there\u2019s no way for you to adequately speak out against what\u2019s happening to you.", "I would not let the harassment take your voice away. You can talk to family, teachers and friends about what you\u2019re experiencing and what you\u2019ve seen. You can be a support for other people experiencing the same thing, and you can call out people who are trying to incite hate online. Also, educate yourself. Look at the terms of service or community guidelines for the type of platforms and social media that you\u2019re using, and find out what kind of site that company wants to run.

Along the way I learned important lessons about the strengths and weaknesses of the middle-aged brain, and how learning new things can keep it in top working order. It also made me realize that organizations and individual workers could do a lot more to bridge the gaps between generations. Each age group has untapped resources that can benefit others at a different stage of life.", "In the beginning, I felt a little awkward about reaching out to Talya at all. A part of me felt that at my age (mid-50s) it was somehow unseemly for me to ask for help, particularly from one so young.", "Ms. Arbit suggested a possible reason for my awkwardness: Baby boomers tend to have to a hierarchical view of the workplace \u2014 an \u201corg chart\u201d mind-set that imagines power filtering down from the top. Millennials, by contrast, may see the office as more of a horizontal network, she said.", "At the same time, as a younger person conversant in the trendiest technology, Talya seemed imbued with a kind of glamour. I felt as if face-to-face communication was too old-fashioned a way to set up meetings with her. Even though she sat just a few desks away, it didn\u2019t seem right to come up to her and say, \u201cCould you meet at noon on Wednesday?\u201d the way I might easily do with an older colleague.", "Email seemed old-fashioned, too. So instead we set up our meetings using her preferred method: Google Calendar. To me, the practice of deciding unilaterally on an open time felt presumptuous, and to reject someone else\u2019s suggestion seemed rude. But that\u2019s not how Talya viewed it \u2014 to her, it was the most convenient way of arriving at a suitable time because the participants can view each other\u2019s calendars.", "In one of our early Google Calendar-arranged meetings, I informed Talya why I was asking her to teach me Snapchat: \u201cI want to be on fleek!\u201d", "Very slowly, Talya taught me Snapchat fundamentals. It was not easy, partly because the software is not intuitive. In fact, as Talya put it, it can be \u201creally weird and hard to understand.\u201d", "But part of the problem was me \u2014 a person in her mid-50s trying to learn something new. Earl Miller, a neuroscience professor at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained why progress might be slow.", "As you age, your dendrites \u2014 the antennas by which neurons receive information from other neurons \u2014 begin to shrink, he said. This is especially noticeable in the prefrontal cortex, which handles higher-order brain functions like focusing, staying on task and forming long-term memories.", "The decline in these areas begins in your 40s and 50s and worsens from there, he said. This can make it tougher to focus. There\u2019s also more of a limit to how many thoughts people can carry in their heads simultaneously.", "\u201cYour mind\u2019s bandwidth is smaller,\u201d he said. \u201cYou learn at a slower rate because less information is getting in.\u201d", "All of these abilities tend to be at their peak when people are in their 20s \u2014 Talya\u2019s age. Before the age of 30, people\u2019s brains possess more plasticity, meaning they can learn more easily.", "That sounds depressing. Isn\u2019t there any mental upside to getting older?", "Yes, there is, Professor Miller said. Older people tend to be more disciplined and diligent, he said, which can compensate for learning deficits. Based on their greater experience in the world, they are also very good at putting ideas and thoughts into categories \u2014 the very basis of knowledge and wisdom.", "It\u2019s true: \u201cThe older brain is a wiser brain,\u201d he said. But it can also get into a rut because of its lack of plasticity.", "The brain is like a muscle that benefits from mental exercises such as learning new things. The more you put your brain through its paces, the easier it will be to learn the next thing. \u201cIt\u2019s always important to keep yourself cognitively engaged,\u201d Professor Miller said.", "As Brandon McMillan, host of the TV show \u201cLucky Dog\u201d \u2014 in which he rescues a dog from a shelter and trains it before placing it in a forever home \u2014 has said: \u201cYou can teach an old dog new tricks. You just can\u2019t teach them as fast.\u201d", "And as Talya taught me the fundamentals of Snapchat, I felt a little like Dottie, the 12-year-old spaniel-terrier mix who had to practice new skills over and over with Mr. McMillan on one recent episode. It took an inordinate amount of time for Talya just to show me how to hover over the yellow Snapchat QR code with my iPhone camera so I could start to follow people.", "Talya explained that each individual photo or video of a story can last up to 10 seconds. Each 10-second segment can be connected to another. A story can be as long as you want it to be, but each segment cannot exceed 10 seconds.", "That gives the resulting video a \u201craw, authentic\u201d feel, Talya said, which appeals to many of its acolytes. Another appeal: The stories are ephemeral and disappear after 24 hours (although you can archive them on your phone).", "My mentor and I set a goal of producing a Snapchat video for the official New York Times channel. But I was nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t even do video,\u201d I said.", "Talya was reassuring, calling it \u201cjust about the easiest video product.\u201d Once you shoot something, you either send it or delete it. \u201cThere\u2019s no editing. It\u2019s a very different way of thinking,\u201d she said.", "First, I began following 20 or so people and organizations, and Talya described what they do well (or poorly). Then I created some practice stories on my personal account (which had two followers), and she critiqued those.", "After my third, a video diary of a weekend trip to Hudson, N.Y., she pronounced me ready to \u201ctake over\u201d the New York Times Snapchat channel, with its worldwide viewership.", "My first Snapchat story for The Times was of a Nasdaq MarketSite opening-bell ceremony for Scripps Networks Interactive, which owns the Food Network and HGTV. My second was about a cat cafe in Brooklyn. The third was about a textiles trade show in Manhattan. Although the stories disappeared from the channel after 24 hours, we archived them, and you can see the last two online. (I neglected to save the first one \u2014 so much for being on fleek.)", "My Snapchat skills are far from advanced, but I think my second video is better than the first, and the third one is better than the second, thanks to Talya\u2019s mentoring. I was able to bring my decades-long journalistic experience to bear on a new technology, with mixed but promising results.", "It was exhilarating to see my progress \u2014 and embarrassing to witness my missteps, like putting my finger over the camera at the close of the cat cafe video. (But have you ever tried to record yourself while trying to keep a cat on your shoulder?)", "At times I was afraid that creating Snapchat stories required more mental energy than my shrinking dendrites could handle. It took several hours to do a two-and-a-half minute story.", "Before the mentorship, I had been ready to dismiss Snapchat out of hand. I came to understand that it is more creative than I realized. It\u2019s fascinating to string together photos and videos, along with captions, drawings and emojis, into a story. Snapchat\u2019s constraints \u2014 the 10-second limit to individual segments, the 24-hour existence of stories, the inability to edit \u2014 were a bracing mental challenge. They stretched me as a journalist and a person.", "So, the reverse mentorship was extremely beneficial, but there was one way in which it could have been better: I could have tried to mentor Talya at the same time. The best cross-generational mentorships work in both directions, Ms. Arbit of BridgeWorks said.", "\u201cWhat do I have to offer?\u201d I asked her, suddenly discounting three decades of career experience, which was ridiculous.", "But I think older workers at times do minimize their value, or their value is minimized by others, as society glamorizes the latest glittery technology. Sometimes the old way of doing things can inform and improve the new, and older workers may be the ones with the wisdom to realize this."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/business/dealbook/public-companies-see-gold-in-california.html": ["California is the capital of American business.

From 1965 through 1979, 10.07 percent of public companies were based in California. The number has continued to grow, so that from 2000-13, 19.46 percent of public companies had their headquarters in California.", "That\u2019s an astounding number.

Ohio had 5.58 percent and Pennsylvania had 5.9 percent of public listings in the 1965-79 period. But from 2000 through 2013, Ohio had 2.58 percent and Pennsylvania 3.78 percent of public company headquarters.", "Illinois\u2019s decline was even starker, as it slid to 3.62 percent from 6.42 percent of public company headquarters. The reason for the decline may be obvious as the old manufacturing base went into decline. The appellation Rust Belt rings true to a large degree for these states as old companies disappear and are not replaced with new ones.", "Yet the decline is not just in the industrial Midwest. New York and New Jersey also fell. New York fell to 8.31 percent of public company listings from 11.32 percent, while New Jersey slipped to 4.53 percent from 5.62 percent.", "Other states have had growth. Texas rose to 10.26 percent of public companies from 8.38 percent. Massachusetts climbed to 5.12 percent from 3.95 percent.

Why would three very different states perform so well?", "One might have expected that high-regulation, high-cost, high-tax states like California would decline over time as companies migrated. Texas, of course, offers a different situation. Yet it is not alone among states offering lower taxes and lower regulatory costs.", "And then what is one to make of Massachusetts, a relatively small state that is punching above its weight? It has regulation and taxes, and yet also business competitiveness.", "There is no special formula for states to be homes to companies. Instead, what appears to be going on is a winner-take-all system.", "California is a good example. It is a state burdened with a high tax rate, significant regulation and extreme housing costs. It is the type of place that you would think would lose business. But instead, California is winning at creating public companies. This may be because it already has a significant base of growth companies attracting yet more people to feed off the infrastructure and then create yet more new, big companies. Similar arguments can be made about Massachusetts and the natural network that its biotechnology companies and universities create.", "Compare this with Texas, which is known for having good hospitals and generates companies in more divergent fields. This may indeed be helped by a more business-friendly environment, but it is more likely a result of the centers that have developed in these fields.", "New York is increasingly the home of finance companies with a sprinkling of health care companies.

Are public figures fairer game than private citizens? Is it a crime to publish material that undermines the authority of government? Is a statement libel if it\u2019s true?", "So Richard Kluger decided this was an apt time to revisit the story of John Peter Zenger\u2019s New-York Weekly Journal, culminating in an August 1735 courtroom drama that put those questions to the test.", "Kluger\u2019s last venture into the history of American journalism was \u201cThe Paper,\u201d his monumental 1986 autopsy of The New York Herald Tribune, and he brings the same gifts to this more modest book: vivid storytelling built on exacting research, a knack for animating the context and an exquisite sense of balance that honors this country\u2019s essential press freedom without romanticizing its champions.", "The champions of \u201cIndelible Ink\u201d are Lewis Morris and James Alexander, two colonial lawyers and power brokers whose motives are anything but pure.

Alexander is \u201cprobably the foremost and perhaps wealthiest lawyer in New York,\u201d a longtime political adviser to Morris and a prolific wordsmith.", "As the central drama begins, Morris has already helped engineer the ouster of two royal governors and has locked horns with a third, William Cosby. When Cosby proves tenacious, Morris and Alexander decide to wheel in a novel piece of artillery: a newspaper.", "\u201cTo understate the matter, the printing trade was not much encouraged in colonial America,\u201d Kluger observes. Although imperial rules had relaxed a bit from the previous century, when a defamatory publication could subject the offender to \u201cthe amputation of the ears,\u201d the colonies had inherited British common law, which essentially defined as \u201cseditious libel\u201d anything that annoyed anyone in power. The prevailing legal text of the time declared that not only was truth not a defense against prosecution, it also compounded the offense, \u201csince the greater appearance there is of truth in any malicious invective, so much the more provoking it is.\u201d Speaking ill of a public figure, the prevailing jurisprudence added, \u201chas a direct tendency to breed in the people a dislike of their governors and incline them to faction and sedition.\u201d", "Somehow Morris and Alexander persuade Peter Zenger, a German-American printer, to risk everything by pushing the limits of official tolerance. Whether Zenger was moved by profit, idealism or something else is unknown, as is almost everything else about the man.

There is nothing in the record to suggest that he would publish \u201cAmerica\u2019s first printed expression of overt political dissent.\u201d The reason Zenger became the sole defendant and languished in jail when authorities ultimately cracked down on his little weekly is that while writers \u2014 first and foremost James Alexander, who supplied most of Zenger\u2019s content \u2014 hid behind pen names, printers were obliged by law to sign their work.", "The New-York Weekly Journal debuted on Nov. 5, 1733, four compact pages of gray type. The first sign that this publication was different appeared on Page 2, a lively report on an assembly election \u201cthat modern journalists would recognize as creditable reportage.\u201d Subsequent issues contained little eyewitness reporting, but increasingly bold satire and polemic aimed (though the target was not named) at Governor Cosby. The newspaper\u2019s complaints against the governor\u2019s corruption and abuse of power were often vague, undocumented and hyperbolic, including the assertion that Cosby was \u201cbut one degree removed from an idiot.\u201d Kluger makes no attempt to defend the newspaper as an ancestor of modern journalism, although you can trace a line of descent from \u00adZenger\u2019s weekly to the Gawker school.", "After failing repeatedly to persuade a grand jury to indict Zenger, Governor Cosby\u2019s men find a way to haul the printer into a court presided over by a Cosby crony. The judge signals his leaning \u00adearly on by disbarring Zenger\u2019s lawyers and appointing a far less experienced \u00addefender. But the Zenger defense team springs a surprise: After opening remarks, the court-appointed defender yields to a legal virtuoso, Andrew Hamilton of Philadelphia, \u201cthe most accomplished barrister in the American colonies,\u201d famed for having \u201cthe vivacity, wit and incandescent presence of a great Shakespearean actor.\u201d", "What ensues is a gripping courtroom confrontation that Kluger reconstructs mainly from the detailed notes of the defense lawyers, there being no official transcript. Alexander\u2019s strategy is daring, bordering on subversive. He concedes that \u00adZenger published the offending material, but asserts that it was no crime because the material was true. Moreover, he argues that, British common law be damned, there is a \u201cnatural right\u201d to complain about abusive rulers \u2014 to \u201cput their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or even \u00adviolence of men in \u00adauthority.\u201d", "The chief justice has instructed the jurors that their role is solely to rule on the facts of the case, leaving to him the question of whether the facts add up to a crime. But the jury goes rogue and after the briefest of deliberations declares \u00adZenger not guilty.", "The Zenger case did not change the law; courts in Britain and the colonies continued to treat affronts to the government as criminal. But the principle that truth cannot be libel has been recognized in American common law for well over a century; and Kluger makes a convincing case that The New-York Weekly Journal and the jurors who balked at convicting Zenger 40 years before the Revolution \u201chelped implant in the public mind that open protest against an imposed and arguably unjust government was both a societal necessity and a civil right.\u201d", "In an epilogue, Kluger flashes forward to the case of Edward Snowden, the intelligence insider who exposed the government\u2019s invasion of our phones and emails, to demonstrate that \u201cfree expression remains nearly as imperiled\u201d today as in the 18th century. Whatever you think of Snowden, that\u2019s a stretch. No journalist has been indicted \u2014 or silenced \u2014 for publishing Snowden\u2019s secrets.

The European Commission is investigating Luxembourg\u2019s tax arrangements for Amazon and McDonald\u2019s, and last year the European Court of Justice struck down tax advantages to companies and their subsidiaries selling e-books throughout Europe.

But instead of bailing out the tax dodgers under the guise of tax reform, Congress should seize this moment to take three crucial steps to repair our broken corporate tax code.", "First, Congress should increase the share of government revenue generated from taxes on big corporations \u2014 permanently. In the 1950s, corporations contributed about $3 out of every $10 in federal revenue. Today they contribute $1 out of every $10, despite their reliance on federal investments to start and expand their businesses. The National Science Foundation helped fund some of the initial work of Google\u2019s founders. Apple\u2019s consumer products still rely on technology that originated in federally funded research. To usher in the next generation of prosperous American companies \u2014 and to make the investments we need to sustain broad-based economic growth \u2014 the current generation of corporate winners must step up and pay its fair share.", "Second, Congress should encourage investment in jobs here in the United States. Giant corporations are pushing corporate tax reform proposals that offer a lower permanent tax rate for earnings generated abroad than earnings generated at home. That is nuts. Preferential tax treatment, either through special rates or deferred due dates, creates a huge financial incentive for American companies to build businesses and create jobs abroad rather than in the United States. Our tax code should favor jobs and businesses at home \u2014 period.", "Third, Congress should level the playing field for small businesses. Small companies in Massachusetts don\u2019t stash profits in the Netherlands. They can\u2019t hire a team of accountants to set up a \u201creverse hybrid mismatch\u201d to slash their taxes. This puts small businesses at a competitive disadvantage as they end up shouldering more of the burden of paying for education, infrastructure, research, the military and everything else our nation relies on to succeed.", "I have been pushing Congress to take these steps since I arrived in the Senate in 2013. The common refrain from Republicans who oppose these measures is that taking them would encourage American companies to flee abroad. But as other nations step up to prevent tax avoidance, that case gets weaker and weaker. And we have the leverage to tighten our tax code because these companies want what America offers: the world\u2019s wealthiest consumers, the world\u2019s best work force, the world\u2019s most reliable legal system and the world\u2019s deepest capital markets.", "For years, corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of all the benefits of being American companies, while searching out every possible way to avoid paying American taxes. Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, these tax dodgers suddenly want to move their money back to the United States.

Even as the iPhone remains the outsize producer of Apple\u2019s revenue and profit, sales of the smartphone have recently been declining. So more than ever, the onus is on Apple to keep up excitement for the gadget.", "What was different this time was that people were focused on something that the new iPhones lack, rather than a flashy new feature.

The iPhone has the same design as last year\u2019s (and the one the year before) and the major new thing is \u2026 a missing headphone jack. So what I was watching for was Apple\u2019s reality distortion field: How will Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, and friends convince us that taking away a feature is really an advance for the iPhone?", "Brian: As Farhad said, the new iPhones \u2014 and also the Watches \u2014 look largely the same as their predecessors. The takeaway for me was that Apple focused on making the most significant changes to the tiniest components: camera sensors, upgraded chips, a revised home button and the addition of GPS to the watch. I get the impression that they are saving the big changes for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone next year.", "So if consumers can hold off a year for the next iPhone, I\u2019d encourage them to wait. But for owners of iPhones that are at least two years old, these are going to be major upgrades \u2014 if you find a way to cope with the lack of a headphone jack.", "Katie: Apple didn\u2019t offer a new killer product or a drastic update to any of the products in its lineup. Instead, Apple piled on new features \u2014 like water-resistance, stereo speakers, wireless headphones and camera features \u2014 to appeal to specific niche buyers. Frank Gillett at Forrester Research called this strategy an accumulation of compelling new features that Apple hopes will \u201cmotivate the trend followers to buy new iPhones, and expose other buyers to the benefits they\u2019ve built into iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2.\u201d", "Perhaps more important, Apple was trying to cobble together a credible story for the future from these incremental moves \u2014 that a wireless world is coming and that it will be the leader in that world.", "Farhad: Apple likes road maps. That\u2019s what you saw today. The company clearly has deep, long-term plans for the iPhone \u2014 it wants to improve wireless functioning, it wants to keep pushing on the camera, and it will keep improving performance without sacrificing battery life.", "The problem for Apple is that the steps along the way to achieving its goals aren\u2019t always that exciting. This is one of those years: There are lots of incremental improvements, but nothing stands out as a must-have. Someday, Apple is telling us, all these increments will add up to something unimaginably amazing. Right now, though, the moves look puzzling \u2014 we really did not get a good defense for removing the headphone jack \u2014 and we may just have to live with the confusion.", "Katie: For the past few quarters, Apple has emphasized that services and software will drive growth as iPhone revenue ebbs. At Wednesday\u2019s event, Mr. Cook underlined that. He kicked off the morning with updates on two of the company\u2019s most important software and services divisions \u2014 Apple Music and the App Store.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a deep love for music,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt inspires us, and it\u2019s a key part of our product experience.\u201d", "Mr. Cook said the company had 17 million subscribers after about a year for Apple Music and added that the music service would be the \u201cpremier destination for exclusive music,\u201d nodding to the idea that the company will use its huge war chest to lock up deals with artists.", "Brian: In another nod to software, Mr. Cook said Super Mario is coming to the App Store. Nintendo, the struggling video game company, long refused to offer its games and franchise characters on mobile devices, but the company recently did a 180, with Pok\u00e9mon Go as a recent example. The change seems more beneficial to Nintendo than to Apple. Pok\u00e9mon Go was a huge success, at least initially, proving that app stores are a viable revenue stream for Nintendo beyond its consoles.", "Apple also announced a new version of iWork, its suite of productivity apps that rival Microsoft Office and Google\u2019s productivity apps. The tweaked version of iWork will include real-time collaboration, meaning multiple people can work on documents and presentation slides at the same time. It\u2019s good that these changes are coming to iWork, but Microsoft and Google have been offering real-time collaboration tools for years already.", "Farhad: The education market has been important to Apple for decades, and for the last few years it has pushed the iPad as the perfect school computer. It did so again today, with those tweaks to its iWork software aimed at schools.", "But Apple has lately faced more competition from rivals, especially Google, whose cheap and simple Chromebook has become one of the most-used machines at schools. For both companies \u2014 and lately for other tech rivals, including Amazon \u2014 the education market functions as a gateway. Get them early, win them for life.", "Brian: The new Apple Watch is called Apple Watch Series 2. It emphasizes fitness and health, with Apple showing a video of runners, gymnasts and swimmers using the watch. One major criticism of Apple Watch was that it did a bit of everything and did not have any strengths. Apple is trying to beef up the fitness capabilities, similar to Fitbit. The new version is water-resistant up to 50 meters (164 feet). It also includes GPS for tracking runs. The watch is faster than the previous version.", "Katie: Whether Apple Watch has been successful or not has largely been a mystery. Apple doesn\u2019t break out Watch revenue in its earnings. But Mr. Cook pulled back the curtain a little when he revealed that Apple is now the No. 2 global watch brand, measured by revenue, behind Rolex. The Apple Watch is also the top-selling smartwatch, even though a killer app has yet to emerge for the watch. The company is hoping to change that with the introduction of a Pok\u00e9mon Go app for the watch.", "Brian: It\u2019s important to note that Apple Watch sales don\u2019t appear to be growing much. IDC, the research firm, estimates that Apple Watch market share in the wearables market shrank 56.7 percent last quarter compared to the same period last year. That\u2019s largely because consumers have probably been waiting for a new version to come out before deciding whether to buy a watch. It\u2019s definitely still a nascent device.", "Farhad: This is the first Apple event in a few years that didn\u2019t feature any redesigned hardware. But there is a new ceramic finish for the Watch that comes closest to some new design.", "The gleaming white finish is in some ways a return to the past for Apple. (Remember all those white computers from the early 2000s?) But beyond that, it\u2019s always interesting when Apple discovers a new material for use in its devices. You usually notice some new process or material start in one product and then wend its way throughout the company\u2019s lineup over a few years\u2019 time. In other words, three years from now, we may have all-white, ceramic phones. A man can dream, anyway.", "Brian: For now, my advice to consumers: I see no compelling reason for people with Version One of the device to upgrade unless they are fitness buffs.", "The addition of GPS gives the Apple Watch a slight edge against Fitbit\u2019s Blaze, a comparable smartwatch that lacks GPS. But until we get to try the software, it\u2019s tough to tell how the new Apple Watch\u2019s fitness capabilities will compare to accessories from Fitbit. Fitbit\u2019s products are popular partly because the apps are so well designed for monitoring health statistics, including footsteps, calories and weight. So GPS isn\u2019t necessarily the magic bullet.", "Katie: Leading up to the event, the most ballyhooed update was Apple\u2019s decision to eliminate the headphone jack. On Wednesday, Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s marketing chief, saved that announcement for last.", "Removing the port for standard headphones means users now have to connect their headphones to the iPhone through the charging port.", "\u201cFrom the start we designed Lightning to be a great digital audio connector,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.", "The update may have its detractors in the days after the announcement, but Apple has a long history of making hardware changes that the industry eventually follows, including the decision to change floppy disk sizes in the old Mac days and, more recently, the decision to take away laptop ports. Apple will include new Lightning earbuds, and an adapter, in the box.", "Why remove the headphone jack, a technology that people seem to like? Mr. Schiller summed it up in one word: \u201cCourage.\u201d", "Farhad: Apple said the most important reason it\u2019s removing the headphone jack is because it believes in a \u201cwireless future\u201d for audio. It\u2019s making that future a reality with a new set of wireless headphones, called AirPods. They look like Apple\u2019s wired earbuds, without the wires; they apparently just slip in your ears.", "Perhaps more important than the earbuds themselves is the wireless technology Apple is using to power them. The company is using Bluetooth, and Apple says its chips improve the technology by connecting faster and using less power. If Apple has perfected a new, proprietary way of doing this, it could prove an important innovation for lots of future wireless products, including home devices, cars and wearables.", "Brian: Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s design chief, said in a video at the event that we are \u201cjust at the beginning of a truly wireless future.\u201d But wireless earphones have been around for years, and Bluetooth wireless technology has become excellent. This is another example of Apple\u2019s being a latecomer to a market and saying it will make a better product than earlier ones.", "Farhad: The reality distortion was in force in other ways. In true Apple fashion, we got a deep-dive video into the development process for the iPhone 7, with not even a nod to the fact that the phone looks nearly identical to the one Apple released last year and the one the year before. Because it has a new color and a new Apple logo, Apple insists it\u2019s \u201ca beautiful new design.\u201d", "I\u2019m sure there are minor differences \u2014 the antenna band is different \u2014 but it seems too rich to call it a new design. Too rich, except for Apple.", "One area where I do give Apple points on the iPhone is the focus on the camera. Apple made a strategic decision a few years ago to plow a lot of development resources into the iPhone camera. That has paid off: The iPhone\u2019s camera has long surpassed most other smartphone cameras, and for many people, it\u2019s better than most stand-alone cameras. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus continue that trend. The Plus model features two cameras, which allows for super-zooming. Even the smaller phone\u2019s camera includes features to improve your snapshots. If the pictures Apple showed off are any guide, the iPhone\u2019s camera is fast closing in on all but the most high-end of cameras.

That short duration, along with Snap\u2019s branding itself as a place of fun ephemera, may help these glasses get past the objections Google faced with Glass, its camera for your face.", "If Snap can put millions of these glasses on our noses, it will have a lot of interesting content, like the way dashboard cameras and security cameras have inadvertently created millions of minutes of watchable content. More ominously, more mobile video will expose more social woes, like the number of police shootings of black people.", "Snap is a business, and it wants to sell ads to run with pretty much anything people are looking at.

Cable customers would still be able to rent a box from their provider, if they prefer.", "The proposal could save consumers nearly $20 billion a year by liberating them from cable set-top box fees, which average about $230 annually per account, according to supporters of the plan.

Most Americans don\u2019t have time to watch CNN and Fox and Al Jazeera.

Jesus doesn\u2019t get much screen time. \u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be for the \u2018Passion\u2019 crowd,\u201d he says, which reminds me that Mel Gibson\u2019s torture-porn epic is one of the things that drove me out of the church.

One of his daughters, for example, loves cassette tapes the way someone Pitt\u2019s age might have a fondness for the gramophone, or making his own daguerreotype. He\u2019s also reminded of his age on set. \u201cWhen I was making a World War II movie called \u2018Fury,\u2019 we did this boot camp for a week, and Logan Lerman, who was the youngest actor of the bunch \u2014 I think he was 21 \u2014 was given grunt detail. We gave him a watch and he had to keep track of how long it took us to eat and get in and out of our gear. One day he came to me and said the watch has stopped, and I said, \u2018You\u2019ve just got to wind it.\u2019 He came back literally 15 minutes later and said, \u2018Wait, how do you wind it?\u2019\u2009\u201d", "The good thing about playing an interview slow and loose, especially when you\u2019ve caught your subject on a free day, is that you can slide into the type of half-substantial, half-trivial conversation only possible with truly friendly people.

But there\u2019s a casual intimacy to the few hours we\u2019ve spent together, shooting the breeze with a rapport so easy that I keep turning the recorder back on after I assume the interview is over; him talking about falling under the spell of New Orleans, or being a \u201csucker for an underdog story,\u201d or how \u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild\u201d is an amazing film that broke his heart.", "The bad thing about playing an interview slow and loose is that you\u2019re never sure how to end it.

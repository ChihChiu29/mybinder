On one hand, so many colleges and universities have opted not to require it that the College Board, which administers the SAT, has announced a top-to-bottom revamp because the test is out of step with today\u2019s academic expectations. On the other hand, many employers are still asking job applicants for their test scores, even if they are years out of date.", "It is scary enough that a high-pressure four-hour exam could dictate where you go to college, let alone that your score might clamp onto your ankle as you try to ascend the career ladder \u2014 and apparently for no good reason. Researchers have found that high-school grades, or even subject-specific tests like Advanced Placement exams, can be better predictors of college performance than the SAT, leading a growing number of colleges to rethink their emphasis on the test. So why, then, do elite employers like McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company and Goldman Sachs still want to know how you scored?", "The simplest answer is that the SAT, in what is still a seller\u2019s market for employers, is a handy screening device that helps them weed out candidates without too much effort. Human-resource managers insist that a test score is only one data point among many, used to round out a complete picture of a candidate. \u201cThey\u2019re most valuable early in the process because we get tens of thousands of applications and we don\u2019t interview tens of thousands of people,\u201d said Jennifer Comparoni, head of recruiting in the Americas at the Boston Consulting Group, adding that scores are optional and applicants aren\u2019t penalized if they don\u2019t submit them. \u201cIt can be a reasonable and useful proxy for some of the things that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d", "High scores can also be a matter of corporate culture: If the company you\u2019re applying to is full of brainiacs, chances are the recruiters are looking for scores above the 95th percentile. Companies say a lower score will never automatically disqualify a candidate, but that can be more true in policy than in practice. \u201cThey will tell you that, but honestly, that rarely works out,\u201d said Mark Rich, managing director of Whitehouse Pimms in Dallas, which headhunts for top-tier consulting firms. \u201cIf you present someone with a lower number, usually the interview doesn\u2019t take place.\u201d", "That may sound harsh, but businesses invest a great deal of time and money figuring out how to avoid mistakes in hiring. So even though the SAT is supposed to predict nothing more than freshman-year grades, employers clearly have their reasons for thinking it goes further.", "Eric Eden, vice president of marketing at Cvent, an online event management business, said the company had to know if a candidate was capable of learning its software in detail. Because its system is proprietary, there\u2019s no objective measure candidates can earn, like an Excel certification. So it makes sense for Cvent to turn to the SAT, which measures what psychologists call \u201cg,\u201d or general mental ability \u2014 how well a person might respond to an unspecified challenge. In this age of rapidly changing technology and constantly upgraded skills, \u201cg\u201d may be a better predictor of success than expertise in a specific software package.", "\u201cEmployers used to consider educational aptitude tests as having nothing to do with the real world, but some may have read enough to know that they\u2019re very highly correlated with job performance,\u201d said Frank Schmidt, an expert on employment testing.

But he said the difference was not large enough for employers to develop their own job-specific tests.", "Jonathan Wai, a research scientist at the Duke University Talent Identification Program, said one limitation of much of the new research questioning the SAT\u2019s predictive powers was that it didn\u2019t track the students after finishing college. \u201cThere\u2019s a body of work that says you can use the SAT to predict life outcomes, which kind of calls into question the shorter-term studies,\u201d he said, mentioning one recent study that showed little difference in college grades between students who submitted SAT scores when they applied and those who did not. \u201cReally, you need to follow all the people up long-term, and if it turns out that they\u2019re actually the same in terms of occupational success and income, then you can say the SAT is really not needed.\u201d", "One of Dr. Wai\u2019s studies found that among precocious 13-year-olds who took the SAT in the 1970s, the top scorers were more likely to have graduate degrees, be high earners and even to secure more patents than their not-quite-as-precocious peers. (Bragging point for Gen Xers: the SAT before 1995 was harder than it is now.)", "But the value of the SAT scores was called into question last year, when the biggest of the big-data companies said the test had proved \u201cworthless\u201d in predicting job performance. \u201cGoogle famously used to ask everyone for a transcript and G.P.A.s and test scores, but we don\u2019t anymore, unless you\u2019re just a few years out of school,\u201d said Laszlo Bock, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations. \u201cWe found that they don\u2019t predict anything.\u201d", "Mr. Wai has a theory about why that might be.

If this view is correct, then a relationship between a human being and a program like Samantha, however intelligent she might be, would be hopelessly one-sided. Moreover, few humans would want to join Samantha, for to upload your brain to a computer would be to forfeit your consciousness.", "This view, however, has been steadily losing ground. Its opponents point out that our best empirical theory of the brain holds that it is an information-processing system and that all mental functions are computations. If this is right, then creatures like Samantha can be conscious, for they have the same kind of minds as ours: computational ones. Just as a phone call and a smoke signal can convey the same information, thought can have both silicon- and carbon-based substrates. Indeed, scientists have produced silicon-based artificial neurons that can exchange information with real neurons. The neural code increasingly seems to be a computational one.", "You might worry that we could never be certain that programs like Samantha were conscious. This concern is akin to the longstanding philosophical conundrum known as the \u201cproblem of other minds.\u201d The problem is that although you can know that you yourself are conscious, you cannot know for sure that other people are. You might, after all, be witnessing behavior with no accompanying conscious component.", "In the face of the problem of other minds, all you can do is note that other people have brains that are structurally similar to your own and conclude that since you yourself are conscious, others are likely to be conscious as well. When confronted with a high-level A.I. program like Samantha, your predicament wouldn\u2019t be all that different, especially if that program had been engineered to work like the human brain.

If Theodore were to undergo this procedure, would he succeed in transferring himself into the digital realm? Or would he, as I suspect, succeed only in killing himself, leaving behind a computational copy of his mind \u2014 one that, adding insult to injury, would date his girlfriend?", "Ordinary physical objects follow a continuous path through space over time. For Theodore to transfer his mind into a computer program, however, his mind would not follow a continuous trajectory. His brain would be destroyed when the scan was made, and the information about his precise brain configuration would be sent to a computer, which could be miles away.", "Furthermore, if Theodore were to truly upload his mind (as opposed to merely copy its contents), then he could be downloaded to multiple other computers. Suppose that there are five such downloads: Which one is the real Theodore? It is hard to provide a nonarbitrary answer. Could all of the downloads be Theodore? This seems bizarre: As a rule, physical objects and living things do not occupy multiple locations at once. It is far more likely that none of the downloads are Theodore, and that he did not upload in the first place.", "Worse yet, imagine that the scanning procedure doesn\u2019t destroy Theodore\u2019s brain, so the original Theodore survives. If he survives the scan, why conclude that his consciousness has transferred to the computer? It should still reside in his brain.

I don\u2019t think so, for uploading technology can benefit our species. A global catastrophe may make the world inhospitable to biological life forms, and uploading may be the only way to preserve the human way of life and thinking, if not actual humans themselves.

Later, Tyler Florence, the Food Network star, left an encouraging comment about the beef course. \u201cTight brother,\u201d he wrote.", "McGarry\u2019s story reflects many of our prevailing pop-culture obsessions \u2014 precocious kids, superparenting, esoteric food, homemade celebrity \u2014 and he has already appeared on \u201cLate Night With Jimmy Fallon,\u201d the \u201cToday\u201d show and NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News.\u201d He has consulted on a sitcom about a teen chef, inspired by his life, that was in development for a while at NBC. He\u2019s working on a book about his experiences and his approach to food. After turning down countless reality projects, he\u2019s in the process of developing an unscripted travel series with RipCord, a production company founded by the actor Mike White, that will soon be pitched to networks. As a way to cull through all the inquiries, Meg, whose mother was once an executive at NBC, initially instituted an NBC-only press policy. But as interest grew, the family handed over the task to professionals. McGarry now employs a manager and a lawyer, and requests go through his agent at U.T.A.", "Yet the formidable machine that has been assembled to catapult McGarry to the culinary equivalent of Bieberish heights is, in some ways, at odds with his real ambition. The danger of child stardom is that it can undermine adult credibility. McGarry prefers not to think of himself as a kid chef, but rather as a kid who happens to have aspired to be a Michelin-starred chef since he was 12. To that end, McGarry, who is home-schooled through an online program, cooks an average of 160 hours a month. He has apprenticed at some of the best restaurants in the country \u2014 at Grant Achatz\u2019s restaurants Next and Alinea in Chicago, and at Daniel Humm\u2019s Eleven Madison Park in New York, where he has staged, or interned, five times. He was invited to help prep a dinner at the Modernist Food Lab in Seattle, under the chef Maxime Bilet, and asked back a few months later to help put together a charity dinner with guest chefs, including the departing White House pastry chef, Bill Yosses, who helped him land a gig cooking on the White House lawn during the Easter Egg Roll. McGarry posed for a picture with the Obamas.", "Last September, after he became a regular at the Eureka dinners, Shapiro took McGarry to Alma, in downtown Los Angeles, which was named Best New Restaurant in America in 2013 by Bon App\u00e9tit magazine. Ari Taymor, Alma\u2019s 28-year-old owner and chef, asked McGarry if he\u2019d like to help out the next day at a private event, a collaboration dinner for 150 people at a farm near Bakersfield. McGarry said yes, and they spent five hours cooking two whole goats over an open fire in pitch dark 40-degree weather. \u201cIt was pretty gnarly,\u201d Taymor recalls. \u201cI got smoke-inhalation poisoning, and he looked like he came out of a chimney.\u201d", "But Taymor was impressed by the young chef. \u201cHe\u2019s a prodigy,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s only been cooking for two or three years. I\u2019ve had people working for me for eight or 10 years \u2014 it\u2019s just the way he handles, the way he moves. It\u2019s kind of an innate thing for him.\u201d McGarry, who is technically in the 10th grade, now works at Alma a couple of days a week. Meg wants him to finish school as quickly as he can so he can work full time at a restaurant. \u201cHe\u2019s a professional,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think he can learn more being out in the world.\u201d", "The celebrity chef is a relatively new cultural species. In the early \u201960s, chefs like Paul Bocuse became famous \u201cfor cooking in their restaurants,\u201d says Colman Andrews, editorial director of The Daily Meal, a website, and a founder of Saveur magazine. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have TV shows, they weren\u2019t seen out socially at parties, they didn\u2019t, for the most part, have product lines.\u201d Wolfgang Puck glamorized the profession in the \u201980s, becoming a celebrity who catered to celebrities and wasn\u2019t shy about lending his name to frozen pizzas, performance blenders and 1,000-watt crepe makers. (\u201cThey could make jokes about him on \u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019 and all of America would know perfectly well what they were talking about,\u201d Andrews says.) But it wasn\u2019t until the Food Network debuted, in 1993, that cooking truly became its own genre of entertainment. \u201cTelevision shows could not be just about instructional cooking,\u201d says Bob Tuschman, a senior vice president, who helped get the network running. They needed to be \u201cjust fun to watch, where you would learn a lot sort of as a byproduct of being entertained.\u201d", "The Food Network exposed millions of Americans to an aspect of culture, gastronomy, they would not have normally encountered. And according to Allen Salkin, the author of a history of the network, \u201cFrom Scratch,\u201d this included a lot of children, too. As food personalities became celebrities, children who once dreamed of being rock stars or actresses now dreamed of being chefs. As a 3-year-old, McGarry dressed up as Emeril for Halloween. At 10, after his parents split up, he grew frustrated with all the takeout that his mother was ordering and decided to do something about it. \u201cFor two years, I practiced the basics by myself,\u201d he says. \u201cKnife cuts, sauces \u2014 using the Internet and cookbooks and stuff like that.\u201d", "The Internet soon became a conduit to the world of haute cuisine \u2014 of cooking as self-expression and eating as experience \u2014 and introduced him to the key players. After Meg, a freelance filmmaker, signed him up for a kids\u2019 cooking class, the teacher asked the students to buy a cookbook of their choice. McGarry chose Thomas Keller\u2019s \u201cFrench Laundry Cookbook\u201d and subsequently worked his way through its recipes. \u201cI had no clue what Michelin was,\u201d McGarry says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know all of the rankings and all the food. And then once I got on Google, I was like, \u2018Oh.\u2019 That kind of opened my eyes to it.\u201d On the Internet, he learned about molecular gastronomy, sous vide and so-called progressive cooking. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, you go on YouTube, and you watch a Thomas Keller video, and then there\u2019s this Grant Achatz video.\u201d McGarry picked up proper knife techniques by watching online demonstrations; then he began experimenting with flavors and preparations. \u201cWhen I was like 10, I wanted to be in a Food Network show, and then when I saw [those videos], I just fully did like a 180.\u201d", "His parents encouraged his desire to become a serious chef. When the counters in the kitchen proved too high, they made him a prep kitchen in the dining room that was modeled after Keller\u2019s at French Laundry. When McGarry decided he wanted a private space to create menu ideas, his dad constructed a kitchen in his bedroom to resemble Alinea\u2019s in Chicago. They redid the electricity, built the tables and removed the closet doors to convert it to a pantry; McGarry would get an induction burner for a birthday, a vacuum sealer for Christmas. When McGarry eventually visited the restaurant, he remarked, \u201cThis is what I put in my bedroom!\u201d", "The turning point, however, occurred after his 11th birthday. McGarry contracted whooping cough, and he was forced to stay home for almost three months, much of which he and his mother spent watching \u201cIron Chef Japan.\u201d When he recovered, they gave a dinner party for Meg\u2019s friends from the \u201cLe Bernardin Cookbook.\u201d \u201cIt was funny,\u201d Meg recalls. \u201cIt was like a school play. Everybody applauded at the end, and he realized, \u2018Oh, this is a really cool thing that I want to do.\u2019 \u201d McGarry, who had long been bullied at school, returned to sixth grade, but during the next year, he asked his mother if he could be home-schooled in order to focus on cooking. \u201cI was actually relieved,\u201d says Meg, who at that point had spoken to several principals about the bullying. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to be unhappy. And I want him to do what he likes to do.\u201d", "McGarry began to focus on the supper club, and when a Talk of the Town item on Eureka appeared in The New Yorker, in early 2012, the dinners became a popular ticket on the Los Angeles food scene. Soon after, McGarry and Meg met Kris Morningstar, the chef at Ray\u2019s & Stark Bar, the Renzo Piano-designed restaurant at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, at a food event called Taste of Beverly Hills. (They struck up a conversation after Morningstar complimented Meg\u2019s Hall and Oates T-shirt.) The chef invited McGarry to see what it was like to work in a real kitchen, with professional cooks, and before long he was helping out a couple of days a week. The line cook taught McGarry how to work the meat station. One sous chef taught him how to break down fish; another taught him how to butcher. He met Josh Graves, who taught him how to make bread and ice cream. \u201cEven my mom,\u201d McGarry recalled, \u201cwas like: \u2018Are you sure you wanna do this? You\u2019re a 12-year-old working a 15-hour day.\u2019 \u201d But he was attracted to the pressure and the pace of a professional kitchen. \u201cOnce I realized that I could do it, then I was like, \u2018This is what I want to do.\u2019 \u201d", "McGarry next asked Bernhard Mairinger, the chef-owner of the Austrian restaurant BierBeisl, if he could borrow his kitchen to host a dinner. The pop-up quickly became a monthly event, and McGarry was invited to do a dinner for 150 people at Playa, the critically renowned restaurant, which has since closed. The revenue financed a trip to Chicago, where he apprenticed at Next, and then at Alinea.", "McGarry told me that despite his professional demands, he tries to keep up with his old friends from middle school. \u201cI have the kid side and the cooking side,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I hang out with people my own age, I sort of shut the cooking side off, which I also think is good for not burning out.\u201d But he concedes that he now has more in common with his fellow chefs \u2014 the often-tattooed hipsters, 10 years his senior \u2014 whom he considers his peers. He uses Uber, the ride-sharing app, to meet them for dinners at night. (In May, he\u2019ll be getting his learner\u2019s permit.) \u201cI get along better with them than I do with lots of people my own age,\u201d he says. \u201cYou adopt the traits of people around you, and I spend most of my time around 25-year-olds. I start to adopt their traits and become more of an adult. I go out to dinner with them. I work with them so much \u2014 they\u2019re friends.\u201d", "When I asked Meg if she worried that McGarry was pushing himself too hard, she said: \u201cThis all came from him.\u201d I asked if she worried about the lifestyle he would be exposed to, hanging out at night with his new older friends. \u201cIn every kitchen he\u2019s been in, there\u2019s a real protectiveness. A lot of people are mid-to-late 20s or 30s \u2014 so they\u2019ve been through crazy times and come out the other side,\u201d she said. They seemed safer, perhaps, than teenagers. \u201cIt\u2019s a better group for him to be around.\u201d", "In a corner of the McGarrys\u2019 \u201cBonanza\u201d-style kitchen, there\u2019s a rack containing roughly $6,000 worth of highly specialized kitchen equipment, including a chamber vacuum sealer, induction burners, a binchotan grill and an immersion circulator that McGarry bought after he sold one of his guitars when he was 10. \u201cTo cook like this, it takes expensive tools,\u201d McGarry says. \u201cAnd the ingredients are expensive. That\u2019s why when people ask how you can charge people $160, it\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand how expensive the ingredients are.\u2019 \u201d", "When shopping for his dinners, McGarry and his mother wake up at 5 a.m. to go to the fish market downtown or to the butcher. When McGarry needs something from Whole Foods, a few miles away, he hops on his bike. The big farmers\u2019 markets in Hollywood and Santa Monica are the ones worth going to, but on a recent Thursday the only option was a tiny one downtown. McGarry goes to farmers\u2019 markets all the time just to see what they have, what\u2019s in season, to taste around and see what\u2019s good. He talks to farmers and creates a list of all of the produce he can use. His menus are primarily produce-driven, usually eight courses (two of which are desserts, which he leaves to Graves). He narrows each of them down to a maximum of nine ingredients.", "Some chefs have an emotional approach to food; McGarry\u2019s is decidedly conceptual. He thinks in terms of juxtapositions. At the Eureka dinner in February, he served abalone with kale, almond and ember-roasted chicken broth, because \u201cabalone is really rich, and the kale, if you grill in a lot of different layers to it, is really nutty,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I figured if you pur\u00e9e almonds into it, it will give it a good texture and add some depth of flavor.\u201d After he has decided on a combination, he begins to calculate balance. \u201cYou need acid, sweet, salt, crunchiness, and then if you have something soft, you need something crunchy. If you have something salty, you need something sour \u2014 so maybe I pickle the kale. You start to add techniques to it to make things taste certain ways.\u201d", "Once he comes up with the concept for a new dish, McGarry draws a picture of what it might look like on a plate. His experiments, like one particular vegetable dish, are often intentionally playful and witty. \u201cThe idea was that cardoons \u2014 a type of artichoke \u2014 and celery look alike,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd rhubarb, which is also in season, looks like that, too. So maybe all three will go together. I have no clue. I haven\u2019t tested it yet. It\u2019s like a visual idea.\u201d He ended up poaching the cardoons in goat\u2019s milk and pairing them with pickled rhubarb, grilled celery and a mushroom consomm\u00e9. \u201cI was always creative kid,\u201d McGarry said. \u201cI played music, I painted a lot. I was always really creative. My whole family is creative. I got into the creative side of cooking \u2014 seeing how I could take a carrot and elevate it to this incredible level that you\u2019d never imagine eating a carrot.\u201d", "Despite the attention that\u2019s always paid to McGarry\u2019s age, cooking is a profession, with its hours and pressure and physical demands, that skews young. Apprentice chefs in Europe begin working in kitchens around 15 or 16, while also attending multiyear culinary schools where they\u2019re not only trained in cooking but also in management, accounting, bookkeeping, service and all other aspects of running a restaurant. Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, whose restaurant, Noma, in Copenhagen, was voted the best in the world three years in a row by Restaurant Magazine, started when he was 13. Redzepi opened Noma at 26. \u201cI think the age gets blown out of proportion,\u201d Taymor says. \u201cI don\u2019t see him by his age. It doesn\u2019t really exist to me.\u201d", "But McGarry\u2019s age has certainly helped with opportunities. As Andrews points out, most teenage apprentices in Europe would be deep in the kitchen trenches, tourn\u00e9ing hundreds of potatoes a day, not collaborating with famous chefs in pop-ups or interning in Michelin-starred restaurants. \u201cAt that age he would be in a kitchen,\u201d Andrews says, \u201cbut he wouldn\u2019t be a celebrity chef. He\u2019d be peeling vegetables or cleaning fish.\u201d", "McGarry may be in something of a rush, but even the chefs he has worked with have encouraged him to be patient. \u201cConsidering his age, he has such a creative mind, and it\u2019s only going to continue to develop as he gets older,\u201d Daniel Humm, the executive chef at Eleven Madison Park, told me. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that he keeps his focus, that he keep a strong desire to learn more and to not rush his development as a cook. This industry is very difficult, very demanding, and there are no guarantees at all.\u201d", "Humm describes his own training as a decade-long period spent in the background of kitchens, working every station, performing every task. He credits this experience with allowing him to learn the basics, but also preparing him to run his own three-star kitchen. \u201cThese days,\u201d he says, \u201cwe turn the spotlight onto any young talent, whether it\u2019s an athlete, a musician or a cook, and it could hurt that person\u2019s development. For Flynn, I just want to make sure he takes the time to grow, because he\u2019s already in such a great position to have a bright future if he can keep his focus. It\u2019s more important for him to have a big name in 15 years, not necessarily right now.\u201d", "Alma is located in an unassuming space around the downtown Los Angeles arts district, on a stretch of blocks that is gentrifying at what seems like warp speed. It serves inventive, seasonal tasting menus focused mainly on produce. McGarry works in an open kitchen, alongside seven other cooks nearly twice his age. One afternoon in March, just before 3 o\u2019clock, he was breaking down an enormous sturgeon into smaller pieces. In less than half an hour, the staff would clean down the kitchen in preparation for dinner service, but behind the counter, everyone worked quickly and efficiently, effortlessly avoiding collisions as they darted around in the small space. McGarry was focused and efficient, fast but also methodical and calm. At one point, Taymor called him over to check out a couple making out outside the plate-glass window, but McGarry remained at his post. Taymor told me that people often ask him, and his servers, what that kid is doing in the kitchen.", "McGarry has yet to make much money for his cooking, but that could change soon. Once he turns 16, he can take his California High School Equivalency Exam and, with his parents\u2019 consent, work full time at a restaurant like Alma. And while McGarry may be singularly focused on his cooking \u2014 \u201che doesn\u2019t want to be the kid chef,\u201d Meg says \u2014 he also seems to recognize the value of his unusual story in achieving his ultimate goal. He is hoping to expedite his professional development by traveling across the globe to work in some of the world\u2019s top kitchens. And he is hoping to make this possible by starring in a reality show in which he is paid to travel across the globe to work in some of the world\u2019s top kitchens. \u201cI get to learn from these chefs and experience all of these different places, but I don\u2019t have to pay a lot of money for it,\u201d McGarry said. David Bernad, who is developing the show, said: \u201cFlynn is very confident kid, but he also knows that he doesn\u2019t know everything and has a lot to learn. So the idea of the show is that it\u2019s his journey to being the youngest Michelin starred chef in the world.\u201d", "McGarry\u2019s real precociousness, in fact, may be his ability to confront his own ambition. Twice during our conversations, he spoke about how he tries to avoid reflecting too much on all the things that are happening, to not pay attention to the media or let it freak him out. At the same time, he\u2019s a willing participant in it; he told me he was convinced that self-promotion \u2014 whether it\u2019s a show or a magazine article \u2014 was an integral part of being a creative person nowadays. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do anything without selling out, to an extent,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t consider this selling out, because I want to do it. I was like: \u2018I want to do a travel show. I want to meet these chefs. I want to talk to them, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it otherwise.\u2019 I could get into these kitchens, maybe, and work there, but I\u2019d have to find a place to live, and all the plane tickets and stuff. And also, I\u2019m 15, so my mom has to come with me, too.\u201d", "McGarry\u2019s eventual plan is to move to New York at 17, work at Eleven Madison Park or somewhere like it for a year, maybe a year and a half, and then start work on his restaurant by 19. The remainder of his teenage years seems to him a respectable stretch of time in which to learn and develop. Then again, \u201cnow that I think about it,\u201d he says, \u201ctime moves very quickly for me, so it\u2019s not that far away. I don\u2019t think I can wait too long, because the real estate [in New York] keeps going up and up and up. You can\u2019t wait forever to do it, because if you wait forever, your opportunity might just be gone.\u201d", "He paused for a moment. \u201cI know people are always like, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t mark what you want by someone else\u2019s [standards]\u2019 \u2014 like three Michelin stars or four New York Times stars \u2014 but it\u2019s kind of like a goal to look up to. This is what I want. I want to have one of the best restaurants in the world, or whatever, which is kind of a very high goal to have, but I like pressure. So to say I want the best restaurant in the world would put enough pressure on me to try as hard as possible to have the best restaurant in the world.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/t-magazine/to-have-and-to-hold.html": ["Once upon a time, a man\u2019s bag indicated his trade.

No one will ever know, but every viewer feels the power of the symbol.", "One thinks also that, in real life, the briefcase \u2014 every briefcase and every satchel and knapsack and tote and much derided so-called murse \u2014 is itself a kind of MacGuffin. The exact details of the personal effects and professional necessities a man daily organizes in his bag don\u2019t matter. What\u2019s meaningful is the male bag itself, which, ever evolving, has developed into a fascinating index of masculinity.", "I hope that I will not run afoul of the gender police in supposing that the typical man\u2019s relationship with his bag is different in kind from a typical woman\u2019s relationship with hers \u2014 more utilitarian, less personal and mystifying even in its mundanity. He operates according to a system of codes that are harder to read and quicker to change, and when his semiotic knapsack opens, a thousand questions spill out.", "What can it mean that I have seen the editor of GQ on the street wearing a simple backpack labeled JanSport? Don\u2019t get me wrong; he looked good. But if such a major arbiter of male fashion sees fit to wear a bag scarcely distinguishable from that shouldered by Johnny Sixth Grader or Average Joe Busboy, then we have ourselves a puzzle on (and in) our hands. The pinstriped senior partner porting a leather case back and forth to Larchmont, N.Y., the graphic designer toting a bourgeois revision of a prototypically blue-collar kit bag, the dude swinging a Louis Vuitton carryall to the gym \u2014 each is lugging around an awful lot of symbolic weight.", "No bag in the history of male bags \u2014 a history that stretches back to the leather loculus (meaning \u201clittle place\u201d) of the Roman soldier \u2014 has more cultural baggage than the briefcase.

The strap on a laptop bag is also a kind of yoke, for the liberating laptop has its flip side. The person carrying a computer used for business is wearing a reminder of business obligations, and is also mixing his business and personal lives in a way that must, on at least some vague level, change his sense of pleasure.

When it caught on in the 1990s, as Manhattan Portage nylon bags swarmed the sidewalks, customers appreciated its durability.

Before the Young Collectors Party, museum executives held an exclusive dinner for a select group of young donors already contributing at a high level.

He is now on the finance committee, where he has gotten to work closely with James Foster, a more seasoned board member who is chief executive of the pharmaceutical company Charles River Laboratories. \u201cIt\u2019s given me an opportunity to be involved at much deeper level,\u201d Mr. Hess said.", "Such mentorships are a hallmark of effective board succession plans.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not born a philanthropist,\u201d Mr. Benezra said. \u201cWith a board that\u2019s 65 members strong, it\u2019s very easy for new members to feel unengaged.\u201d", "To avoid any alienation, many museums encourage new trustees to join committees as a way of working with other board members and learning the ropes.", "The former Wells Fargo chief executive Richard Kovacevich is chairman of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\u2019s finance committee, allowing younger trustees to learn from a legend. \u201cThey observe how they think, how they act, how they interact with the staff,\u201d Mr. Benezra said. \u201cMentoring is a big part of what we do. It\u2019s how newly elected trustees find their way.\u201d", "Another accommodation made for younger trustees \u2014 who may still be in the prime of their careers \u2014 is the division of responsibilities.

How great can that be?\u201d", "Whether Comcast can become a force in New York now rests with regulators at the Justice Department, who are examining antitrust issues related to the Time Warner Cable deal, and at the Federal Communications Commission, which is looking at broader public policy issues. The sheer size of the deal, and the intense public interest in unfettered Internet access, have galvanized an array of opponents, from Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, to the Consumers Union to the Writers Guild of America.", "I suspect few of them, if any, are Time Warner Cable customers. In a 2013 J. D. Power customer satisfaction survey, Time Warner Cable ranked last in all but one region among television service providers.", "Time Warner Cable operates in 29 states, but thanks to the old system of regional and municipal cable monopolies, Comcast and Time Warner Cable don\u2019t compete anywhere. Justice Department merger guidelines define geographical markets, which is why regulators weighing airline mergers examine competition on individual routes, not national market share. In New York, Comcast will simply supplant Time Warner Cable in the array of consumer television and broadband options, which include Verizon\u2019s FiOS service, RCN, DirecTV and the Dish Network.", "\u201cGiven that these are local markets, and that Comcast and Time Warner Cable don\u2019t overlap, the merger really has no impact on competition,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust professor and specialist in intellectual property at Columbia Law School.", "Under conventional antitrust standards, it\u2019s pretty much an open-and-shut case. But some opponents have seized on the rarely invoked doctrine of potential competition \u2014 the theory that, if Comcast were barred from acquiring Time Warner Cable, it would enter the New York market on its own.", "But Mr. Roberts flatly ruled out that possibility, given the prohibitive costs of replicating Time Warner Cable\u2019s infrastructure. As it is, he said Comcast is going to have to spend heavily to bring Time Warner Cable\u2019s network up to Comcast\u2019s standards.", "And though it seems unlikely anytime soon, other potential competitors may still enter the New York market. Google has built high-speed fiber networks in three areas \u2014 Kansas City, both in Missouri and in Kansas; Austin, Tex.; and Provo, Utah \u2014 and plans to expand into nine more. Sprint is talking about using its spectrum for a wireless broadband connection to homes.", "In any event, the doctrine of potential competition has rarely been invoked by courts to block mergers. (There have been only three instances, and one was overturned on appeal.)", "Critics of the proposed merger have also dusted off a little-used antitrust doctrine called monopsony, arguing that the size of a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable \u2014 the company would control about 30 percent of national pay television subscribers \u2014 would enable it to squeeze lower prices from suppliers like Netflix and cable programmers like ESPN. This issue of Comcast\u2019s size and leverage with suppliers has also gotten caught up in the debate over net neutrality, which is the doctrine that all data on the Internet should be treated the same and that broadband providers like Comcast shouldn\u2019t be allowed to charge a premium to heavy users like Netflix.", "Susan Crawford, a professor at Cardozo School of Law and author of \u201cCaptive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age,\u201d has emerged as one of the most persuasive critics of the deal.", "Although Professor Crawford, who is currently a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, concedes there\u2019s little or no overlap between Comcast and Time Warner Cable in any relevant markets, \u201cthat\u2019s missing the forest for the trees,\u201d she said. \u201cThe deal takes an already terrible situation and makes it worse. Comcast has enormous market power where it operates and has the increased ability to stifle innovation in cable boxes, in uses of the Internet and to favor some programs over others. They have a built-in conflict of interest. It\u2019s hard to imagine all that they can do.\u201d", "But Professor Hemphill noted that the purpose of antitrust law was to protect consumers, not program suppliers. It\u2019s hard to imagine that the wildly popular ESPN or Netflix needs protection from regulators in Washington. When Time Warner Cable blocked CBS from its cable network in a dispute over fees, customers were outraged, and the cable company largely capitulated to CBS\u2019s demands.", "Most monopsony claims fail because consumers end up benefiting from the lower prices a monopsonist can extract from suppliers. If Comcast can negotiate a better deal with programmers, it has an incentive to pass at least some of those savings on to customers to increase demand for its services with lower prices. As Professor Hemphill noted, \u201cEven a monopolist will pass through savings to customers as long as there\u2019s elasticity of demand.\u201d", "On a less theoretical level, Comcast is promising a leap in quality for Time Warner Cable customers, who will be in line to gain access to Comcast\u2019s new Xfinity wireless gateway. While in Philadelphia I got a demonstration of the new technology, which moves the brains of the cable box to the cloud and reduces its dimensions to the modest size of a wallet.", "As a current Time Warner Cable customer, I\u2019m reluctant to even turn on the television, so lengthy is the menu of mostly unwanted options. (I still have trouble finding \u201cMad Men\u201d on AMC.) The Comcast interface was clear and easy to use, with colorful graphics and choices tailored to users\u2019 viewing habits.", "In the Comcast movie deck, I spotted recent releases \u2014 \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d \u201cFrozen\u201d and \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d \u2014 any of which could be selected with a click of the remote or, with a Comcast app on a smartphone, by voice command. Each title also displays a Rotten Tomatoes rating. Ask the app, \u201cWhat should I watch?\u201d and the screen offers choices tailored to your interests. Comcast is also well on its way to making this all available on any device, though rights restrictions still limit what can be downloaded outside the home.", "This technology, the product of what Mr. Roberts said has been billions of dollars in capital investment, is a powerful gatekeeper. As Professor Crawford pointed out, in the wrong hands, it could easily be used to favor some providers, like Comcast\u2019s own NBCUniversal offerings, and bludgeon others, like Netflix, into paying high access fees. (Netflix didn\u2019t show up on the Comcast gateway screen, but it\u2019s nowhere to be found on Time Warner Cable, either.)", "To gain approval for the NBC deal, Comcast agreed to a long list of conditions that bar discriminatory conduct, go a long way toward guaranteeing net neutrality and generally \u201cenhance the public interest,\u201d in the words of the F.C.C. And acquiring Time Warner Cable would bring those company\u2019s 11 million subscribers under the terms of the agreement.", "Regulators may well decide to impose even more conditions as a requirement for approving the Time Warner Cable deal, although Professor Crawford is skeptical that will happen if Comcast gets the go-ahead for the acquisition.", "\u201cThey\u2019ve never been constrained by any words that tell them what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have great lawyers. It\u2019s hard to imagine conditions that would make them consumer-friendly.\u201d", "Comcast\u2019s performance on the J. D. Power customer satisfaction survey is only marginally better than Time Warner Cable\u2019s. (Verizon\u2019s FiOS service ranks first in the East.) While conceding room for improvement, Mr. Roberts pledges that will change once Comcast rolls out its new Xfinity service, and he says that the company\u2019s strategy is focused on improving customer experiences.", "\u201cWe want to be a tech company, not a wire company,\u201d he said. He said he was frustrated that Google and Apple sell their services and products everywhere, but Comcast can\u2019t. \u201cWe want to lead, to innovate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is this controversial?\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/opinion/sunday/is-success-in-our-dna.html": ["Readers discuss a claim that social status is strongly \u201cdetermined by your lineage.\u201d", "To the Editor: According to Gregory Clark (\u201cYour Ancestors, Your Fate,\u201d Sunday Review, Feb. 23), there is far less class mobility from generation to generation than is commonly thought.

The band settled in New York in part because it is arranging and playing the music for \u201cFly by Night,\u201d a new musical that is being prepared for an Off Broadway run this spring at Playwrights Horizons. The musical, which has a \u201cSonic Youth-y, washed-out feeling,\u201d brings a new dynamic to the house, Mr. Garcia said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole theater circuit thing,\u201d he said, \u201cand if it does well, it could go to Broadway, so that\u2019s cool.\u201d", "While all this unfolded, the partners in BKLYN1834 \u2014 the name is a nod to the year the borough was incorporated as a city, before merging with New York, and to the 18-to-34-year-old demographic the company will target \u2014 had been searching for a focus. \u201cThree years ago we started thinking about BKLYN1834, but we weren\u2019t sure, would it be a retail business?

Aaron Vazquez, 26, is the company\u2019s art director. A photographer and video director, Mr. Vazquez was born in the United States but grew up in Coahuila, Mexico, where his father still lives. In 2011, he dropped out of the University of Texas and moved to New York, staying with friends before making his way to the Clubhouse. \u201cI saved up $500 making music videos for some friends, and so I sublet Jay Jennings\u2019s room while he was on tour,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I stayed on the couch for a while, until a room opened up and they asked me to become an official house member.\u201d", "While the alliance between the Clubhouse members and their backers may seem unlikely, Mr. Markman has deep Brooklyn ties. He was born and raised in Bensonhurst, and his family lived in the borough for nearly a century. He sits on the board of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and helped establish the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a local development corporation. In addition to Dellarocco\u2019s, he is a co-owner of the nearby Brooklyn Heights Caf\u00e9.", "And if the idea of trying to monetize cool might once have been called selling out, the concept is all but meaningless in the Clubhouse.", "\u201cFor our generation of artists, we realize that we are each our own brand, but not everyone knows how to manage this,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cOur business is to equip artists with these tools, which feels like a natural, organic progression of what we already do at the Clubhouse.\u201d", "The house operates in a web of interconnectedness and serendipity. \u201cThe first time I came here was four years ago, and it was supposed to be for 30 minutes, just to lay down one verse,\u201d Mr. Marc said, \u201cbut I stayed all night.\u201d Born and raised in Sheepshead Bay, where he still lives, Mr. Marc is a rapper, songwriter and producer. As for the Clubhouse, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily the guy on the couch, I don\u2019t bum over there. But I\u2019ll get there at 9 a.m. and won\u2019t leave till 2 a.m., and just cycle it; I spend so much time there it\u2019s like I\u2019m the third arm.\u201d", "\u201cYou might have a perception of what it is like to live in a situation like this,\u201d Mr. Reid said, \u201cand you might think it\u2019s a bunch of crazy hippies or Brooklynites sharing a space hipster-style.

Headed to trial in San Jose this spring, the case involves 64,000 programmers and seeks billions of dollars in damages. Its mastermind, court papers say, was the executive who was the most successful, most innovative and most concerned about competition of all \u2014 Steve Jobs.", "The suit shows how more than two years after his death, Mr. Jobs still casts a long shadow. It also offers a portrait of Silicon Valley engineers that differs sharply from their current caricature as well-paid villains who are driving up the price of real estate in San Francisco and making the city unbearable for others.", "Instead, the court documents portray the engineers as \u201cvictims of a conspiracy\u201d who were cheated by their bosses, said Joseph R.

In a simultaneous settlement, the companies agreed to drop the no-poaching practice. The settlement did not preclude the programmers from pursuing their own case against the companies, and the class-action lawsuit quotes emails and other communications from some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names.", "Mr. Jobs was particularly worried about Google, which was hiring rapidly and expanding into areas where Apple had an interest. In 2005, for instance, Google\u2019s co-founder, Sergey Brin, tried to hire from Apple\u2019s browser team. \u201cIf you hire a single one of these people that means war,\u201d Mr. Jobs warned in an email, according to court papers.", "Mr. Brin backed off, and Google and Mr. Jobs soon came to an informal agreement not to solicit each other\u2019s employees. Apple made similar deals with other companies. So did Google.", "By 2007, when a Google recruiter slipped up and contacted an Apple engineer, Mr. Jobs immediately complained. To appease the Apple chief, Google fired the recruiter within an hour. Mr. Jobs\u2019s control extended even to former Apple engineers.

I would not like this broadly known.\u201d", "The origins of the conspiracy, according to the lawsuit, date back to the 1980s, when the filmmaker George Lucas sold part of his company to Mr. Jobs.", "\u201cWe cannot get into a bidding war with other companies because we don\u2019t have the margins for that sort of thing,\u201d Mr. Lucas is quoted as saying in the court papers. So Lucasfilm and what was to become Pixar made a deal that there would be no cold-calling, that they would notify each other when offering a job to an employee and that any offer was final and would not be improved in response to a counteroffer.", "What worked for Pixar would work for Apple, Mr. Jobs decided.", "The Justice Department inquiry that brought the anticompetitive deals to light concluded in 2010 with an antitrust complaint against Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Adobe and Pixar. There were no financial sanctions.", "Google explained at the time that it used no-poaching agreements \u201cto maintain a good working relationship\u201d with other companies, but said they did not affect wages or hiring. An Intel spokesman said the chip maker \u201cdenies that it violated any laws or engaged in any wrongdoing.\u201d Adobe declined to comment.", "The hands-off deals might have been more widespread than many in the valley assumed. The Justice Department is currently pursuing a case against eBay, accusing it of having an illegal no-poaching deal with Intuit. An eBay spokeswoman said the company was in settlement talks with the government.", "Pixar (bought by Disney for $7 billion in 2006) and Lucasfilm (bought by Disney for $4 billion in 2012) have already settled the class-action suit, as has Intuit.

But he said he felt it was important not to bend.", "\u201cA lot of times you\u2019re confronted with things that may be advantageous, but you have to make the critical decision that morally, it is not right,\u201d he said, noting that Apple never did sue. \u201cUnfortunately, this does not happen as often as it should.\u201d"], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/inside-boxs-i-p-o/": ["Cloud-based computing has been a hot area for deal makers, and a number of start-ups in the business are expected to go public this year.", "Among the first is Box, which filed a prospectus on Monday evening to raise as much as $250 million in an initial public offering.

In what is becoming a common narrative, researchers like to describe how they begged the federal science establishment for funds, were brushed aside and turned instead to the welcoming arms of philanthropists. To help scientists bond quickly with potential benefactors, a cottage industry has emerged, offering workshops, personal coaching, role-playing exercises and the production of video appeals.", "Advancement Resources of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, did its first workshop in 2002 and has now conducted hundreds across the country, mostly to coach scientists and medical institutions in what it calls the art of donor development. \u201cWe help make their work accessible to people who do not have scientific backgrounds but do understand money,\u201d said its founder, Joe K.

Congress had long reached across party lines to support government research, for its economic and military rewards and because the distribution of billions of dollars plays well come election time. After rising steadily for decades, federal science financing hit a high point in 2009, in the early days of the Obama administration, as Congress, to stimulate the economy amid the global financial crisis, allocated about $40 billion for basic science.", "That bipartisan consensus eroded with the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections and the budget battles that followed. Spending on basic research has fallen by roughly a quarter, to $30 billion last year, one of the sharpest declines ever.", "The cutbacks translate into layoffs: A group of scientific societies recently surveyed 3,700 scientists and technical managers and reported that 55 percent knew of colleagues who had lost jobs or expected to lose them soon.", "In an interview, the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis S. Collins, called 2013 one of his agency\u2019s darkest years ever, with fewer grants awarded and with jobs and programs cut. In decades past, research financed by the institutes won more than 100 Nobel Prizes. The cutbacks, Dr. Collins said, were \u201cprofoundly discouraging.\u201d", "Largely unmentioned in the gloom is the rise of private science. The White House report mentioned philanthropy only in passing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it justice,\u201d said one of the authors, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the report\u2019s preparation.", "Science policy has always been shot through with politics. Little surprise, then, that political sensitivities have been stoked by the injection of philanthropic money into this traditionally public sphere.", "The official reticence about private science may reflect, in part, a fear that conservatives will try to use it to further a small-government agenda. Indeed, some of the donors themselves worry that too much focus on private giving could diminish public support for federal science.", "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a major worry,\u201d said Robert W. Conn, president of the Kavli Foundation, which has committed nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to science and is part of the private effort to increase financing for basic research. \u201cPhilanthropy is no substitute for government funding.

They consider gender and race, income and geography.", "Yet even as the federal government finely monitors its own investments in science research, philanthropy remains largely uncharted territory. (The government does carefully track science financed by private industry, but that research tends to produce such practical things as drugs, jets and gadgets, rather than fundamental insights into the mysteries of nature.)", "\u201cPeople assume we do it,\u201d said John E. Jankowski, a senior analyst at the National Science Foundation, which not only finances research but also tracks science budgets. \u201cBut we don\u2019t, because of resource constraints.\u201d", "The task is daunting. If government science is centralized, science philanthropy is determinedly not: It is an agglomeration of donors, from the wealthiest patrons to people who write modest checks to their favorite charities.", "The National Academy of Sciences has repeatedly urged the government to step up its monitoring of the uncharted billions. And recently, Dr. Jankowski said, the National Science Foundation began developing a pilot survey, to be completed in about a year.", "If budgets allow, he added, the agency plans to \u201cultimately fund\u201d a comprehensive survey.", "In the meantime, Fiona E. Murray, a professor of entrepreneurship at M.I.T., has taken a different tack, studying not the donors but the recipients \u2014 particularly the nation\u2019s research universities.", "To simplify the task, she looked at the 50 leading universities in science-research spending, places like Columbia and Stanford, Duke and Harvard, Michigan and Johns Hopkins.", "What Dr. Murray found sheds light on the scope of the phenomenon, as well as questions about who benefits. Private donors now account for roughly 30 percent of the schools\u2019 research money, she reported, adding that the rise of science philanthropy may simply help \u201crich fields, universities and individuals to get richer.\u201d", "The new patrons are responsible for one of the most striking trends on these campuses: the rise of privately financed institutes, the new temples of science philanthropy.", "In Cambridge, Mass. \u2014 home to M.I.T. and Harvard \u2014 they include the $100 million Ragon Institute for immunology research, the $150 million Koch Institute for cancer studies, the $165 million Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, the $250 million Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the $350 million McGovern Institute for brain research, the $450 million Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and the $700 million Broad Institute for genome research.", "\u201cIf I\u2019m a rich person, I\u2019m going to give to a leading institution \u2014 to Harvard or Princeton,\u201d Dr. Murray said in an interview. That pattern, she added, \u201cposes big issues\u201d for the nation.", "A Focus on Disease", "If the map of the world of private science has yet to be drawn, one thing is clear: Much of the money is going into campaigns for a cure.", "This private war on disease has resulted not only in significant advances in treatment, but also in what experts describe as a major breakthrough in how biomedical research is done. The method opens up blockages that have traditionally kept basic discoveries from being turned into effective treatments \u2014 especially for rare diseases that drug companies avoid for lack of potential profit.", "\u201cWe think it\u2019s potentially transformative,\u201d said Maryann P. Feldman, a professor of public policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies the approach.", "The first success came with cystic fibrosis, which arises when a faulty gene clogs the lungs and pancreas with a sticky mucus. People with cystic fibrosis suffer from coughing, fatigue, poor digestion and slow growth, and die relatively young.", "Around 2000, a surge of wealthy donors began making large contributions to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Tom and Ginny Hughes of Greenwich, Conn., had two daughters with the disease, and gave millions of dollars. The family also posed in snapshots for the foundation\u2019s \u201cMilestones to a Cure\u201d updates, and Mr. Hughes, a banker, helped the charity develop strategies to expand its fund-raising.", "Year after year, the foundation held galas, hikes, runs and golf tournaments, eventually raising more than a quarter-billion dollars. With great skill, it used the money to establish partnerships across industry and academia, smashing through the walls that typically form around research teams.", "By early 2012, the financial surge produced the first treatment for an underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. The drug counters a gene mutation that accounts for 4 percent of the cases in the United States \u2014 about 1,200 people. The medication thinned the deadly mucus, lessening symptoms and drastically improving quality of life.", "The success begot a global rush to turn basic discoveries into treatments, a field now known as translational science. It also inspired rich donors to shower new money on disease research.", "Many of their efforts are rooted deep in personal or family trauma. Sometimes, by sheer force of genetics and demographics, that impulse may risk widening historical racial inequalities in health care and disease research, disparities that decades of studies have shown to contribute to higher rates of disease and death among blacks, Hispanics and other minority groups.", "A review of these campaigns finds that, as with cystic fibrosis \u2014 which mainly strikes people of Northern European descent \u2014 a significant number are devoted to diseases that disproportionately affect white people.", "Ovarian cancer strikes and kills white women more often than minority women. In 2012, after his sister-in-law died of the disease at age 44, Jonathan D. Gray, the head of global real estate at the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, gave the University of Pennsylvania $25 million to set up a center to study female cancers.", "Melanoma, the deadliest of skin cancers, also strikes and kills whites preferentially. Debra Black, wife of the financier Leon Black, survived a bad scare. Soon after, the couple teamed up with Michael R. Milken, the former junk-bond financier, whose charity FasterCures gives advice on how to accelerate research, to found the Melanoma Research Alliance. It quickly became the world\u2019s largest private sponsor of melanoma research, awarding more than $50 million for work at Yale, Columbia and other universities.", "Of course, the pervasiveness of most diseases means most philanthropists give comfort and medical relief across the lines of race and ethnicity. When Mr. Milken, for example, learned that he had prostate cancer, he set up a foundation to fight it. The charity has raised more than half a billion dollars, helping save not only him but also many black men, since they develop the disease more frequently than white men do.", "So, too, the techniques of translational science, inspired by philanthropy, are now being applied in a federal effort against sickle cell anemia, a blood disorder that mainly strikes black people and has long been something of a research orphan.", "Scientists first described sickle cell anemia in 1910 and uncovered its genetic basis in 1949. The discovery, by a team that included Linus Pauling, a Nobel laureate twice over, was central to the creation of the field of molecular medicine. Yet with little financing for sickle cell research, either public or private, no drug has been developed that targets the disease\u2019s underlying cause, even though it has crippled and killed millions of people.", "The government effort began with Dr. Collins, the N.I.H. director, who as a biologist had helped uncover the cystic fibrosis gene. As the new cystic fibrosis treatment emerged, he pressed the government to adopt the breakthrough translational method, federal budget cuts notwithstanding. Today, the N.I.H. translational science center has an annual budget of more than $600 million and seeks new drugs for rare diseases, which number in the thousands.", "Dr. Collins, who works with many wealthy donors, said the government was trying to level the playing field rather than rush off to where \u201ceverybody\u2019s already piled up effort.\u201d An effective treatment for sickle cell disease, he said, has \u201cbeen a long time coming.\u201d", "A candidate drug is undergoing clinical trials and looks promising. In December, the company working with N.I.H. on the research effort announced that a single dose produced a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d of pain for up to 24 hours.", "Setting the Agenda", "In the early 1980s, Leroy Hood, a biologist at the California Institute of Technology, proposed to make the first automated DNA sequencer, which he pitched to the National Institutes of Health as a way to rapidly identify the billions of hereditary units in every human cell. His grant proposals were rejected, so he turned to Sol Price, a warehouse-store magnate whose companies ultimately merged with Costco.", "The breakthrough of the DNA sequencer led to the Human Genome Project \u2014 the federal effort that, at a cost of $3.8 billion, mapped all the heritable units \u2014 and, more recently, to the burgeoning field of personal genomics.", "Science philanthropy, Dr. Hood said, \u201clets you push the frontiers.\u201d", "Over the years, the flood of private money has also inspired something of a reversal. In gene sequencing, in translational medicine, in the Obama administration\u2019s Brain initiative and in other areas, the federal government, instead of setting the agenda, increasingly follows the private lead.", "A decade ago, Anousheh Ansari, a Texas engineer who made a fortune in telecommunications, financed a $10 million prize competition for the first private craft that could send three people into space. Her success spawned a boom. Private donors now back dozens of science awards, and the government offers hundreds of its own, motivated, according to a White House study, \u201cby the success of philanthropic and private sector prizes.\u201d", "Sometimes, private donors go to the government\u2019s aid. When budget cuts threatened to shut down a giant particle accelerator on Long Island in 2006, Dr. Simons, the hedge-fund investor, who lives nearby, raised $13 million to bail it out. As a result, research teams were able to keep exploring subatomic aspects of the blast that brought the universe into existence.", "If the rich donors are to be believed, their financing of scientific research in the years ahead will expand greatly in size and scope. A main reason is the Giving Pledge.", "In 2010, Mr. Gates, along with his wife, Melinda, and the investor Warren E. Buffett, announced the campaign. So far, roughly a fifth of America\u2019s nearly 500 billionaires have signed up, pledging to donate the majority of their fortunes to charity.", "A Times analysis of the pledge letters made public shows that more than 40 percent of the signers plan to finance studies in science, health and the environment. With personal fortunes in excess of $250 billion, they are promising, at a minimum, to donate more than $125 billion. How much is destined for science is unclear, but several laid out objectives that are fairly extraordinary.", "\u201cWe want to eradicate diabetes in our lifetime,\u201d wrote Harold Hamm, a leading figure in the North Dakota oil rush, and his wife, Sue Ann.", "Jon M.

Oddly, the patient was also constantly showering.", "Dr. Allen noticed that the symptoms improved during hospitalization with no intervention and recurred once the patient was sent home. He also noted that at home the patient was a chronic heavy marijuana user and hypothesized that the vomiting might be caused by the drug, while easing of symptoms was linked to abstinence.", "Over the next several years, Dr. Allen noted similar patterns in other patients admitted with vomiting disorders. In 2004, he published a report on 10 patients found to have with what he called cannabinoid hyperemesis.", "Each patient in his case series smoked marijuana daily; each had developed intermittent nausea and vomiting. All had used marijuana for years before they developed these episodic bouts of nausea and vomiting. And remarkably, nine of the 10 patients reported that hot showers eased their symptoms when everything else failed. All symptoms resolved when these patients gave up marijuana \u2013 and then reappeared when they resumed their cannabis use.", "A Marijuana Syndrome, Without the Marijuana:", "Dr. Allen\u2019s case series prompted recognition of similar patients around the world. The mechanism by which marijuana \u2013 a drug otherwise recognized for its antiemetic properties \u2013 induces vomiting in some chronic heavy users is not well understood. There are several hundred organic compounds in marijuana, and many have been noted to have complex effects on both the brain and the gut.", "However, this patient had no marijuana in his system.

The list of ingredients often includes herbal components that have long had the reputation of having marijuana-like psychoactive properties. However, when analyzed, these compounds are often not found, and the effect is provided by chemicals that resemble marijuana\u2019s cannabinoids sprayed onto the dried plants.", "Many of the most popular of these synthetic cannabinoids were developed in the 1980s by a researcher from Clemson University who created several molecules that bind to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain, stimulating it in a way that is similar to that of the original. Pharmaceutical companies were investigating these molecules to treat pain but abandoned the effort because of the difficulty of isolating the desired qualities of the drug from the unwanted psychoactive effects. Chemical analyses of the products sold as synthetic marijuana has been shown to contain one or more of these chemicals.", "In the United States, the Drug Enforcement Agency has tried, with limited success, to ban these products.

Somehow the water \u2013 as hot as they can stand it \u2013 makes the nausea disappear. It was the defining quality of the syndrome when it was first described by Dr. Allen in 2004.", "But this guy said he hadn\u2019t smoked marijuana in months. The people Dr. Brady had seen with cannabinoid hyperemesis usually smoked every day. Maybe the patient had relapsed after all.", "Dr. Brady ordered a urine toxicology screen; that would show if he had used marijuana recently.

Dr. Brady hurried to a computer and looked for a link between Spice and pancreatitis. Nothing. There were a few reports suggesting a link between marijuana and pancreatitis, but nothing about this synthetic marijuana. Moreover, the people in those case reports had the typical symptoms of pancreatitis \u2013 nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. This patient had no pain.", "What about the vomiting? Could this so-called synthetic marijuana cause cannabinoid hyperemesis \u2013 even if it wasn\u2019t the real thing? It seemed unlikely, and yet his symptoms were so typical. She turned to Google to search for the terms cannabinoid hyperemesis and Spice.", "Sure enough, there it was \u2013 two recent case reports describing several regular synthetic marijuana users who developed a syndrome that was indistinguishable from cannabinoid hyperemesis caused by the real stuff.", "Smoking a Lot of Spice:", "Dr. Brady went back to the patient. How much synthetic marijuana did he smoke? A lot, he told her. Sometimes 3 to 4 grams a day. With real marijuana, a couple of tokes in the morning would keep him relaxed for most of the day. With the synthetic stuff, the feeling of being relaxed never lasted, and he was constantly chasing it by smoking more and more.", "She asked him if he\u2019d heard about cannabinoid hyperemesis. He had. But he hadn\u2019t smoked pot since November, he told her. She explained that she was concerned that the stuff he was smoking \u2013 the synthetic version \u2013 might be a good enough fake to give him the same symptoms.", "When the team visited the patient the next morning, he was already dressed and ready to go. No abdominal pain, no nausea. He hadn\u2019t vomited in over 12 hours.

The rapid consumer-ification of tech, led by Facebook and Google, has created a deep rift between old and new, hardware and software, enterprise companies that sell to other businesses and consumer companies that sell directly to the masses. On their face, these cleavages seem to be part of the natural order. As Biswas pointed out, \u201cThere has always been a constant churn of new companies coming in, old companies dying out.\u201d", "But the churn feels more problematic now, in part because it deprives the new guard as well as the old \u2014 and by extension, it deprives us all.

Last August, it raised $258 million and was valued at about $3.5 billion; this winter, it partnered with Xbox and Bud Light for Super Bowl promotions.

I was confused why a taxi app, or any iPhone app, for that matter, needed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. But it had a great data blog that I enjoyed, so I applied for an internship. When I got the job, friends who worked in tech were excited. Friends who worked in venture capital were excited. I started reading articles on TechCrunch about how Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, envisions a company that will become the universal way to transport purchases and people, and about how its motto had been changed from \u201cEveryone\u2019s Private Driver\u201d to the more expansive \u201cWhere Lifestyle Meets Logistics.\u201d The more I read, the more I heard, the more I started to see that vision myself.", "What was impressive to me was not the ambitious leap of logic from \u201crideshare\u201d to \u201cAmazon for logistics,\u201d but how quickly that final notion became a foregone conclusion in my mind.

Conviction animates every start-up. Uber could be bigger than Facebook! Or, of course, it could go the way of the location check-in app Foursquare, which had a meteoric rise but whose valuations have since languished in the mere hundreds of millions of dollars. Not every start-up is an unequivocal success.

For better or worse, these are the kinds of companies that seem to be winning the recruiting race, and if the traditional lament at Ivy League schools has been that the best talent goes to Wall Street, a newer one is taking shape: Why do these smart, quantitatively trained engineers, who could help cure cancer or fix healthcare.gov, want to work for a sexting app?", "Part of the answer, I think, lies in the excitement I\u2019ve been hinting at. Another part is prestige. Smart kids want to work for a sexting app because other smart kids want to work for the same sexting app. \u201cHighly concentrated pools of top talent are one of the rarest things you can find,\u201d Biswas told me, \u201cand I think people are really attracted to those environments.\u201d But that presumes that the talent at older companies is somehow subpar, less technically proficient, than it is at their younger counterparts. This seems unlikely if you look at Cisco\u2019s list of patents. Yet clearly there exists some sort of discrepancy between the talent the new guard looks for and the old guard provides. There are thousands of engineers working at big corporations in Silicon Valley, many with years of experience and proven track records of creating code. Many of them have also been through several cycles of layoffs, as older companies divest assets and shave costs. So why are start-ups constantly bemoaning a shortage of talent?", "The easiest explanations are mismatched skill sets or cultural friction. Older engineers are not smart in the way that start-ups want them to be \u2014 or, if they are, they have reservations about the start-up lifestyle. Both these reasons are symptomatic of how far apart the two sides have drifted. If there are whole swaths of engineering talent whose skills or styles cannot be integrated into a company, then maybe that operation has been limiting itself. As David Dalrymple, a technologist in the valley, told me, \u201cThe most innovative and effective companies are old-guard companies that have managed to reach out to the new guard, like Apple, or vice versa, like Google.\u201d", "Dalrymple\u2019s description makes sense, but its implied recommendation \u2014 that new and old need to embrace each other \u2014 is difficult to put into practice. Several of Cisco\u2019s previous attempts to reach out to the new guard, like the Flip video camera and the Cius tablet, were busts. The phrase that\u2019s constantly repeated in the valley is \u201cinnovate or die.\u201d Innovation, everyone seems to agree, is the answer.

He had a wife and two kids and went to work for a company called DSC Communications, which made telecommunications equipment. Much of the excitement in the valley at that time was over advances in Ethernet and network speeds that would eventually lead to widespread access to the Internet and to the merging of telephony and data. (Actually, we lived in a different valley then: \u201cTelecom Valley,\u201d which was a nickname for Petaluma, north of San Francisco.)", "Three years later, when my dad decided to leave DSC, he had two job offers, both at networking start-ups founded by DSC alumni \u2014 one called Fibex, the other called Cerent. They made similar products and were of comparable size and prospects; he chose Fibex because he disliked one of the engineers at Cerent he would have had to work closely with. I was too young at the time to remember what it was like after he started his new job, but my mother tells me it was as hectic and late-night and junk-food-fueled as any of the start-up scenes of my generation. He was lucky. A little over a year after my dad joined Fibex, Cisco bought it for approximately $320 million. Then, a few months later, Cisco bought Cerent too \u2014 for $7.2 billion. That 20-fold difference between the money he made and the money he could have made has been fodder for family jokes ever since. Yet despite the obvious incentives, he never did go to another start-up.", "I know that my dad\u2019s choices were constrained by circumstances \u2014 his family, his immigration status \u2014 but his self-image was always more engineer than entrepreneur. I think he has been happy being a \u201clifer\u201d at Cisco in a way that few of my friends would be at Google.", "There are certainly young engineers today comfortably ensconced at established companies, just as there are 50-year-olds at their fourth start-up. But as a group, my peers feel more restless, more constantly in search of the next big thing \u2014 in part because start-ups select for and reward these impulses, which also spur the successive exoduses from Yahoo to Google, from Google to Facebook, from Facebook to younger, hipper companies. These are places where the C.E.O. often sits alongside the engineers, where recruiters talk about a \u201cflat\u201d hierarchy as a perk on par with paternity leave, where regular engineers get equity. Some of these changes have occurred out of necessity. \u201cIn the \u201880s, it was not uncommon to pay people salaries and give them few if any stock options,\u201d Biswas said. \u201cNow, you can\u2019t have a company like Facebook and attract that kind of talent without offering equity.\u201d Other changes simply come from the spirit of the times \u2014 when a company\u2019s product is premised on a mobile, open, connected world, it doesn\u2019t do for its C.E.O. to be sitting in a corner office.", "There\u2019s an App \u2014 and an A.P.I. \u2014 for That", "All varieties of ambition head to Silicon Valley now \u2014 it can no longer be designated the sole domain of nerds like Steve Wozniak or even successor nerds like Mark Zuckerberg. The face of web tech today could easily be a designer, like Brian Chesky at Airbnb, or a magazine editor, like Jeff Koyen at Assignmint. Such entrepreneurs come from backgrounds outside computer science and are likely to think of their companies in terms more grandiose than their technical components. Chesky, for instance, has described Airbnb as a \u201ccommunity marketplace that connects people through unique spaces around the world\u201d \u2014 a valid business model, but not one that necessarily depends on any particular technology.", "By contrast, Intel, founded by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, both physicists, began by building memory chips that were twice as fast as old ones. Sun Microsystems introduced a new kind of modular computer system, built by one of its founders, Andy Bechtolsheim. Their \u201cbig ideas\u201d were expressed in physical products and grew out of their own technical expertise. In that light, Meraki, which came from Biswas\u2019s work at M.I.T., can be seen as having its origins in the old guard. And it followed what was for decades the highway that connected academia to industry: Grad students researched technology, powerful advisers brokered deals, students dropped out to parlay their technologies into proprietary solutions, everyone reaped the profits. That implicit guarantee of academia\u2019s place in entrepreneurship has since disappeared. Graduate students still drop out, but to start bike-sharing apps and become data scientists. That is, if they even make it to graduate school. The success of self-educated savants like Sean Parker, who founded Napster and became Facebook\u2019s first president with no college education to speak of, set the template. Enstitute, a two-year apprenticeship, embeds high-school graduates in plum tech positions.

Now anyone can do it, thanks to the Facebook login A.P.I. or the Google Maps A.P.I.", "One of the more enterprising examples of these kinds of interfaces is the start-up Stripe, which sells A.P.I.s that enable businesses to process online payments. When Meraki first looked into taking credit cards online, according to Biswas, it was a monthslong project fraught with decisions about security and cryptography. \u201cNow, with Stripe, it takes five minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you combine that with the ability to get a server in five minutes, with Rails and Twitter Bootstrap, you see that it has become infinitely easier for four people to get a start-up off the ground.\u201d", "The sense that it is no longer necessary to have particularly deep domain knowledge before founding your own start-up is real; that and the willingness of venture capitalists to finance Mark Zuckerberg look-alikes are changing the landscape of tech products.

The doors to start-up-dom have been thrown wide open. At Harvard, enrollment in the introductory computer-science course, CS50, has soared. Last semester, 39 percent of the students in the class were women, and 73 percent had never coded before. These statistics are trumpeted as a sign of computer science\u2019s broadening appeal and, indeed, in the last couple of years the class has become something of a cult and a rite of passage that culminates in the CS50 fair, where students demo their final projects and wear T-shirts reading \u201cI Took CS50.\u201d", "In 2010, the year I took the CS50, the hottest final project was a dating app called CrimsonSpark. By entering an email address, you could \u201cspark\u201d classmates you were interested in, and if they sparked you back, both of you would be notified. Over the first three days, it attracted 800 users (from an undergraduate class of 6,500), 1,800 sparks and 300 matches. It was abandoned soon after.", "CrimsonSpark, like so many new-guard inventions that are wildly and briefly popular (What Would I Say, an app that analyzes your Facebook history to create a new status, comes to mind), wasn\u2019t doing anything technically profound. In fact, it was technically regressive. Six years after Thefacebook was founded in a Harvard dorm, CrimsonSpark returned to the early days of poking. The central concept, though, was alluring: It connected people who wanted to sleep together. Likewise, many of the hottest web start-ups are not novel, at least not in the sense that Apple\u2019s Macintosh or Intel\u2019s 4004 microprocessor were. The arc of tech parallels the arc from manufacturing to services. The Macintosh and the microprocessor were manufactured products. Some of the most celebrated innovations in technology have been manufactured products \u2014 the router, the graphics card, the floppy disk \u2014 while advances like IBM\u2019s \u201cbusiness solutions\u201d are viewed as little more than customer support. But things are changing. Technology as service is being interpreted in more and more creative ways: Companies like Uber and Airbnb, while properly classified as interfaces and marketplaces, are really providing the most elevated service of all \u2014 that of doing it ourselves.", "Recently, an engineer at a funded-to-the-gills start-up in San Francisco texted me to grumble about his company\u2019s software architecture. Its code base was bug-ridden and disorganized \u2014 yet the business was enjoying tremendous revenue and momentum. \u201cNever before has the idea itself been powerful enough that one can get away with a lacking implementation,\u201d he wrote. His remark underscores a change wrought by the new guard that the old guard will have to adapt to. Tech is no longer primarily technology driven; it is idea driven.", "Unhappy Valley", "A few weeks ago, a programmer friend and I were talking about unhappiness, in particular the kind of unhappiness that arises when you are 21 and lavishly educated with the world at your feet. In the valley, it\u2019s generally brought on by one of two causes: coming to the realization either that your start-up is completely trivial or that there are people your own age so knowledgeable and skilled that you may never catch up.", "The latter source of frustration is the phenomenon of \u201cthe 10X engineer,\u201d an engineer who is 10 times more productive than average. It\u2019s a term that in its cockiness captures much of what\u2019s good, bad and impossible about the valley. At the start-ups I visit, Friday afternoons devolve into bouts of boozing and Nerf-gun wars. Signing bonuses at Facebook are rumored to reach the six digits. In a landscape where a product may morph several times over the course of a funding round, talent \u2014 and the ability to attract it \u2014 has become one of the few stable metrics.", "Yet for all the glitz and the glory and the newfound glamour, there is a surprising amount of angst in Silicon Valley. Which is probably inevitable when you put thousands of ambitious, talented young people together and tell them they\u2019re god\u2019s gift to technology. It\u2019s the angst of an early hire at a start-up that only he realizes is failing; the angst of a founder who raises $5 million for his company and then finds out an acquaintance from college raised $10 million; the angst of someone who makes $100,000 at 22 but is still afraid that he may not be able to afford a house like the one he grew up in.", "Tech is fun now, deliriously so, but this fun comes with a built-in anxiety that it must lead to more. As an engineer, coding should be your calling, not just a job, so you are expected to also do it in your time off. Interviewers will ask about side projects \u2014 a Firefox browser add-on maybe, or an Android version of your favorite iPhone app \u2014 which are supposed to indicate your overflowing enthusiasm for building software. Tech colloquialisms have permeated every aspect of life \u2014 hack your diet, your fitness, your dates \u2014 yet in reality, very little emphasis is placed on these activities. In a place with one of the best gender-ratios in the country for single women, female friends I talk to complain that most of the men are, in fact, not available; they are all busy working on their start-ups, or data-crunching themselves. They have prioritized self-improvement and careers over relationships.", "These choices, to insulate oneself, to make technology the central theme in your life, make some sense: The marketplace is competitive, and if you\u2019re not working on this or that potentially industry-disrupting idea, someone else will get there before you. But it breaks down when you begin to question whether or not your idea is actually industry-disrupting or, really, meaningful at all. I was asking a friend, a former computer-science major who now works for a hedge fund in New York, why he chose finance instead of tech. \u201cThere are so few start-ups that are doing things that are worthwhile to me,\u201d he said. I protested: \u201cWhat about Facebook?\u201d He looked at me, and I thought about it. No doubt, Facebook has changed the world. Facebook has made it easier to communicate, participate, pontificate, track down new contacts and vet romantic prospects. But in other moments, it has also made me nauseatingly jealous of my friends, even as I\u2019m aware of its unreality. Everything on Facebook, like an Instagram photo, is experienced through a soft-glow filter. And for all the noise, the pinging notifications and flashing lights, you never really feel productive on Facebook. A couple of months ago, I installed a Google Chrome extension called \u201cKill News Feed,\u201d built by Neal Wu, a senior at Harvard who incidentally previously worked at the social network.

He studied computer science, interned at Facebook and spent a year working for the restaurant recommendation app Ness (acquired by OpenTable a month ago for more than $11 million) before landing at Stripe. In jeans and a giveaway T-shirt from his days as a programming intern at Jane Street, the New York proprietary trading firm known for its grueling interviews and eye-popping compensation, he seemed very much an embodiment of the suddenly cool software engineer \u2014 with his disheveled outfit, his technical chops, his surprising charisma. He speaks with the confidence of someone who has always, always landed the job.", "A couple of months ago, Stripe raised $80 million in a funding round that valued the company at nearly $2 billion, and that flushness showed in the ergonomic workplace setups, the abundance of light-hued furniture. There were long birch tables in the canteen, birch benches, chairs with voluptuous curves. Books, many of them wrapped in colorful paper, were stacked and piled artfully on birch bookcases. \u201cPeople always think the books are fake,\u201d Jim said. But the shelves contained several well-known computer-science titles, presumably donated by new graduates, and Lisa, noting Michael Artin\u2019s seminal \u201cAlgebra,\u201d the textbook assigned in most introductory abstract algebra courses, hummed her approval. She was a math major at M.I.T. who took a lot of programming courses her senior year.", "The start-up where Lisa now works, Opower, develops software that analyzes household or business utility expenditures and suggests areas for reduction. She has been there since graduating in 2010 and really likes it \u2014 the work allows her to combine engineering and environmentalism, a longtime pet cause. She\u2019s one of the few people I know in the valley who seems committed to doing unequivocal social good. Most people, like her brother, couch their contributions to humanity in more operational terms. \u201cI think that we\u2019ve now reached a point where every minute a Stripe engineer spends coding saves more than a minute of the customer\u2019s time,\u201d Jim said. \u201cIt evens out.\u201d", "The two of them grew up in Los Altos, in a low, lovely, now exorbitantly priced house that Jim misses being near. It\u2019s one of the many complaints he has about San Francisco, which is steadily stealing the South Bay\u2019s thunder. (\u201cSometime in the last two years, the epicenter of consumer technology in Silicon Valley has moved from University Ave. to SoMa,\u201d Terrence Rohan, a venture capitalist at Index Ventures, told me, referring to places in Palo Alto and San Francisco.) Both the geographic shift north and the increasingly short product cycles are things Jim attributes to the rise of Amazon Web Services (A.W.S.), a collection of servers owned and managed by Amazon that hosts data for nearly every start-up in the latest web ecosystem.", "\u201cIn the old days, you had to be racking your own servers,\u201d Jim said. \u201cIn the old, old days, if you were a hardware start-up, you would need a fab\u201d \u2014 a place to fabricate \u2014 \u201cor at least a room to tinker in. You might need to be near Milpitas or Fremont,\u201d South Bay suburbs with room enough to host large server farms. \u201cBut now, every start-up is A.W.S. only, so there are no servers to kick, no fabs to be near. You can work anywhere. The idea that all you need is your laptop and Wi-Fi, and you can be doing anything \u2014 that\u2019s an A.W.S.-driven invention.\u201d This same freedom from a physical location or, for that matter, physical products has led to new work structures. There are no longer hectic six-week stretches that culminate in a release day followed by a lull. Every day is release day. You roll out new code continuously, and it\u2019s this cycle that enables companies like Facebook, as its motto goes, to \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d", "We were having this conversation over dinner at the office, because Jim was coming up on a deadline and didn\u2019t have much time. The fare was all twists on college staples: sweet-potato fries, barbecued chicken, roasted radishes. There has been much tut-tutting at the lavishness of these spreads, their implied self-indulgence, and when I visited the new Airbnb headquarters the next evening in SoMa, with its soaring atrium and a Bali-themed conference room, it was, admittedly, hard not to gape. But I got it. People think of all these perks, the free food, the flexible hours, as a sort of Gen Y invention, a deliberate extension of adolescence deep into the 20s. But it\u2019s not really about that. It\u2019s not even about squeezing extra code out of employees. It\u2019s about fulfilling some platonic vision of how work should be: a tight-knit group of friends, pushing themselves to greatness.", "One of Stripe\u2019s founders rowed five seat in the boat I coxed freshman year in college; the other is his older brother. Among the employee profiles posted on its website, I count three of my former teaching fellows, a hiking leader, two crushes. Silicon Valley is an order of magnitude bigger than it was 30 years ago, but still, the start-up world is intimate and clubby, with top talent marshaled at elite universities and behemoths like Facebook and Google. These days, a new college graduate arriving in the valley is merely stepping into his existing network. He will have friends from summer internships, friends from school, friends from the ever-increasing collection of incubators and fellowships. His transition will be smoothed by a hefty relocation package and cheerful emails from the young female H.R. staff at his hot web-consumer start-up.", "The Youth Bubble", "The valley has always been a hard-charging, ever-optimistic place, full of people who are passionate about ideas that require some suspension of disbelief. But in the last 10 years in particular, there has been an exacerbation of the qualities for which it\u2019s been both feted and mocked: Valuations are absurdly high for companies with no revenue. The founders are younger; the pace is faster. The current reigning class is engineers of Jim and Lisa\u2019s age, who grew up in a world where a laptop and Wi-Fi can challenge a government, where the profound and the absurd can coexist on a computer screen. There is a sense among them of manifest destiny, of \u201cThis is our time.\u201d On Quora, the popular question-and-answer site that has become something of a weather vane for the technorati, one member asks, \u201cWhat do people in Silicon Valley plan to do once they hit 35 and are officially over the hill?\u201d", "Despite its breathtaking arrogance, the question resonates; it articulates concerns about tech being, if not ageist, then at least increasingly youth-fetishizing. \u201cPeople have always recruited on the basis of \u2018Not your dad\u2019s company,\u2019 \u201d Biswas said. But in recent years, that precept has become a mantra. According to the company PayScale, the median age of employees at Hewlett-Packard is 39, at Facebook 26. I tried to verify with Jim the median age at Stripe, which looked to be about 25, and he paused to think. \u201cWell, we just got an engineer whose hair is thinning.\u201d Then he added, \u201cI actually have no idea how old he is.\u201d", "Among those of us who grew up in the valley, this tunnel vision brings up another interesting conundrum. For Jim and Lisa (whose father is a director at NetApp, a data-storage and software-development company), for Biswas (whose father is a designer at the chip maker ARM) and for me, what happens when it is, quite literally, your dad\u2019s company?", "On a certain level, the old-guard-new-guard divide is both natural and inevitable. Young people like to be among young people; they like to work on products (consumer brands) that their friends use and in environments where they feel acutely the side effects of growth. Lisa and Jim\u2019s responses to the question \u201cWould you work for an old-guard company?\u201d are studiously diplomatic \u2014 \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d they say \u2014 but the fact remains that they chose, from a buffet of job options, fledgling companies in San Francisco.", "On the other hand, the continued success of companies like Apple, which are old guard yet somehow don\u2019t seem out of date, implies that there is still another force at work. It is possible, albeit difficult, for a large, established company to stay relevant \u2014 but it requires recognition that to a software engineer in his 20s, with endless opportunities, what matters most is not salary, or stability, or job security, but cool. Cool exists at the ineffable confluence of smart people, big money and compelling product. You can buy it, but only up to a point. For example, Microsoft, while perpetually cast as an industry dinosaur, is in fact in very good financial shape. Starting salaries are competitive with those at Google and Facebook; top talent is promoted rapidly. Last year, every Microsoft intern was given a Surface tablet; in July, they were flown to Seattle for an all-expenses-paid week whose activities included a concert headlined by Macklemore and deadmau5.", "Despite these efforts, Microsoft\u2019s cool feels coerced. One reason might be its sheer size \u2014 with a market cap of $315 billion, Microsoft will never enjoy the headlong rush of a company with nothing to lose, the bite of the underdog. But I think a more important reason is that so many of its products came up short for so long that its offerings now, however well packaged, are greeted with skepticism. About two years ago, I started noticing an advertisement for Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer 9 on YouTube. Internet Explorer was the dominant web browser for nearly a decade and is still used by about a fifth of all Internet goers, according to StatCounter, but it has fallen out of favor with the tech savvy. Many websites are not compatible with Internet Explorer; its development tools are thin compared with those of Chrome and Firefox. The commercial, however, was excellent \u2014 sleek and sophisticated and featuring a dubstep remix of \u201cToo Close\u201d by Alex Clare; I distinctly remember watching it through to the end, watching it again and then thinking, That commercial almost made me want to use Internet Explorer. Of course, I never did switch to Internet Explorer.", "Who Wants to Be Called a \u2018Ninja\u2019?", "The morning after I had dinner with Jim and Lisa, I met their father, Karl Danz, in Los Altos, a quiet suburb just south of Palo Alto. Karl, a valley veteran, was easygoing and loquacious. Our conversation veered from tales of Google\u2019s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, in his early days at Sun Microsystems to stories about Jim and Lisa in high school. Toward the end of our interview, because he was so obviously proud of his kids and excited about the work they were doing, I asked him another version of the question I had put to them: Would he work for a new-guard company? Specifically, were he laid off from NetApp tomorrow, would he apply for a job at Stripe?", "Ageism in Silicon Valley has generally been framed as an issue of the youngest companies discriminating against older engineers \u2014 or older engineers, because of inertia or complacency, failing to keep their skills up to date. There are grains of truth in these claims. But Karl\u2019s response underscores another caveat: Older engineers form a smaller percentage of employees at top new-guard companies, not because they don\u2019t have the skills, but because they simply don\u2019t want to. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d Karl said, \u201cfor a 50-something to show up at a start-up where the average age is 29, there is a basic cultural disconnect that\u2019s going on. I know people, mostly those who have stayed on the technical side, who\u2019ve popped back into an 11-person company. But there\u2019s a hesitation there.\u201d The flip side of the kind of cohesion I saw at Stripe is that it can be off-putting to people outside the circle. If you are 50, no matter how good your coding skills, you probably do not want to be called a \u201cninja\u201d and go on bar crawls every weekend with your colleagues, which is exactly what many of my friends do.", "These concerns are self-reinforcing. The structure of employment interviews at new-guard companies puts older engineers at a disadvantage; they chalk it up to a cultural gap and are subsequently more reluctant to try. I spoke recently with Gayle Laakmann McDowell, the chief executive of the website CareerCup. If tech today is yet another California gold rush, then McDowell is a boot maker or an innkeeper, a savvy businesswoman who has realized that perhaps an even bigger fortune can be made by supplying those who do the actual panning for gold. Her book, \u201cCracking the Coding Interview,\u201d is the definitive prep guide to tech interviews. Sandwiched between practice questions and pages of coding solutions are anecdotes from her time as a software engineer at various tech companies and one-liners on how you, too, can get a job at Google.", "As tech valuations rise to truly crazy levels, the ramifications, financial and otherwise, of a job at a pre-I.P.O. company like Dropbox or even post-I.P.O. companies like Twitter are frequently life-changing. Getting these job offers depends almost exclusively on the candidate\u2019s performance in a series of technical interviews, where you are asked, in front of frowning hiring managers, to whip up correct and efficient code. Moreover, a majority of questions seem to be pulled from undergraduate algorithms and data-structures textbooks, which older engineers may have not laid eyes on for years. \u201cTop tech companies emphasize rigorous algorithms problem solving and de-emphasize prior experience, which is where an older engineer is going to shine,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cOlder engineers are also very likely not to have computer-science degrees; even if they do, C.S. was a completely different field 30 years ago.\u201d The dearth of older engineers in new-guard companies is thus due in part to their feeling intimidated and in part to hurt feelings. \u201cWith interviews the way they are, the new-guard companies are basically saying, \u2018We don\u2019t care about the fact that you have 30 years of experience \u2014 that doesn\u2019t matter to us.\u2019 Older engineers often don\u2019t react well to this.\u201d", "There are, however, some newer companies that do in fact value experience and are actively seeking it. A friend who works at a late-stage web start-up tells me that his company is no longer hiring new graduates; a quick search on LinkedIn returns dozens of engineering managers at Facebook who \u201ctrained up\u201d at Oracle. But this sort of attitude generally appears only later in the life cycle of a start-up, when the pace of growth means it\u2019s no longer feasible to rely on hiring friends of friends and when the approach of a public offering means the company is finally accountable as a business. \u201cThe older crowd does a better job of building things that feel substantial \u2014 more challenging and complex businesses, businesses that need to think of revenue streams, sales force, timelines,\u201d McDowell said. But this maturation process also increases the prospect of losing out on seemingly stupid but potentially brilliant ideas. \u201cThe younger culture runs as fast as they can to build something cool,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cThe old guard can think in a more measured way about doing things. The problem is that they may be making more reasonable steps, but they\u2019re making fewer steps. It\u2019s hard to compete when you\u2019re moving slower, even if you\u2019re moving in a consistently correct direction.\u201d", "Can\u2019t We All Just Get Along?", "Despite all the differences in culture, cool and hard-core coding prowess, there are signs that, in some areas at least, the old guard and the new guard might be inching closer together. I spoke last year with Doug Leone, a venture capitalist at Sequoia, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s oldest and most prestigious investment firms. Sequoia funded both Stripe and Meraki, and also, almost 30 years ago, Cisco. \u201cI see the old guard and the new guard coming together again,\u201d Leone said. \u201cPeople want the enterprise tools they use at work to look and feel like the web apps they use at home.\u201d As an investor, Leone is especially interested in software-as-service companies that host their products on the cloud and address business applications \u2014 in other words, companies like Meraki that combine the best of both old and new. It\u2019s a heartening prospect.", "Perhaps the greatest barriers to closing the divide lie closer to home. This past Christmas, my family went to dinner with another family, the Yangs, whose son, Andrew, was a sophomore at the University of Chicago and trying to decide on a major.

She scarcely shared it even with those who knew her. Then again, many of her acquaintances when she was taking some of her remarkable images, particularly in and around Chicago in the 1950s and \u201960s, were the children she cared for while working as a nanny. Later in her life, some of those children took care of her in turn, first by moving her into an apartment and then the nursing home where she died in 2009. What rotten timing: She was on the verge of being discovered, first as a curiosity and then as a social-media sensation and a mystery.", "It\u2019s no surprise that Maier is now the subject of a documentary, given the quality of her work, the nominal exoticism of her life and the secrets that still drift around her. She\u2019s a terrific story \u2014 part Mary Poppins, part Weegee \u2014 who was at once emancipated and in service. She was introduced to the world, as it were, by John Maloof, one of this movie\u2019s directors, who bought a box of her negatives at a Chicago auction in 2007 for about $400. The auction house, he explains, told him the work was by Maier, but he found nothing about her on Google. He had purchased the negatives for a book he was working on, but after deciding that they were of no use, he stashed the box away.", "And then he took it out again, scanned some images and put them up on Flickr. \u201cI have a ton of her work (about 30-40,000 negatives), which ranges in dates from the 1950s-1970s,\u201d he wrote there in October 2009. \u201cIs this type of work worthy of exhibitions, a book? Or do bodies of work like this come up often?

More news articles followed, and by January 2011, the Chicago Cultural Center had mounted an exhibition titled \u201cFinding Vivian Maier: Chicago Street Photographer.\u201d The industrious Mr. Maloof, meanwhile, scanned more of her work, bought more of her negatives and started telling his tale and hers, or as much as he knew. Given that this is also a social-media story \u2014 Mr. Maloof discovered her, but the Internet made her a star \u2014 the Kickstarter campaign to bankroll this documentary was inevitable.", "The film, which he directed with Charlie Siskel, is absorbing, touching and satisfyingly enjoyable because Maier was a fascinating, poignant and somewhat enigmatic woman. As the title suggests, the filmmakers take up Mr. Maloof\u2019s search for his mystery woman (complete with an unnecessary show-and-tell shot of someone typing her name into Google), framing her as a riddle to be solved. With Mr. Maloof playing M.C. and sleuth, he and Mr. Siskel follow much the same arc that runs through the better news accounts about Maier. It\u2019s a breezy, perhaps overly tidy narrative ornamented with her work and packed with interviews with some of her old charges and their parents. Some of the darker reminiscences are in sharp contrast to the movie\u2019s upbeat tone and relentlessly jaunty music.", "So, it\u2019s a solid if finally thin introduction to Maier. It\u2019s also, to state the obvious, a feature-length advertisement for Mr. Maloof\u2019s commercial venture as the principal owner of her work; his name is on the stamp that authenticates the photographs. Vivian Maier is a find but she\u2019s also now a business, and the documentary would be stronger if it had dug into the complexities of what it means when one person assumes ownership of another\u2019s art. There are times when Mr. Maloof \u2014 particularly when he\u2019s defensively speaking about the work\u2019s artistic merit \u2014 feels as if he were delivering a sales pitch. He and the movie are on better ground when they let the likes of Mary Ellen Mark testify to its quality.", "The documentary nods in the direction of some rich issues, including who gets to sanctify work as art, and why. It\u2019s a thread that has additional resonance, given that everyone\u2019s a critic on the Internet, which is where Maier\u2019s work was not just first publicly seen but also anointed. There\u2019s another undercurrent here about her status as an artist (partly because she didn\u2019t formally study art) and even questions about photography\u2019s status as an art (a hoary theme that emerges because she didn\u2019t print all of her own work). Time and professional pronouncements will decide if she was an outsider artist or just an unorthodox one who, as a single 20th-century woman, found freedom, her voice and her own private bohemia while under cover of other people\u2019s bourgeois domesticity."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/business/smallbusiness/supporting-start-ups-with-advice-connections-and-caffeine.html": ["Lauren Cannon was clearly nervous as she started a carefully prepared presentation about her start-up, PackSack, which makes a reusable grocery bag that folds into itself for storing.

Since it started, Reputation.com has raised $67 million in venture capital and attracted more than 1.6 million customers. It generally charges small businesses $1,000 to $4,000 a year, Mr. Fertik, 35, said in a conversation that has been condensed and edited.", "Q. How do you help companies protect their online reputations?", "A. The No. 1 thing we do is help them collect real reviews from real customers. Then we help them publish them on the web in a variety of places and ways. Companies understand that 90 percent of consumers are looking at reviews and relying on reviews when making a purchasing decision.", "Q. You also help them push negative mentions down Google rankings, right?", "A. If a former employee is attacking you in a blog and that\u2019s the third thing people see about your company online, what we\u2019d do is take the other stuff people could see online and move it up in the search ranking. You sponsor a Little League team; you\u2019ve been in business for 10 years; you\u2019re voted the best place to work in your town. It\u2019s like a cousin of search engine optimization. There\u2019s no reason that the damaging content from the former employee has to be the first thing people see.", "Q. Of course, sometimes that negative content is right.", "A. Our customers are hungry for constructive feedback, positive or negative. They tend to take action, and they tend not to deny the substance of negative feedback. The receptionist at your medical office or the bouncer at your bar is rude. The business owner wants that feedback and takes action on it. What they don\u2019t like is that a year later it\u2019s the only thing people see about their company. That\u2019s the part that really bothers them. And that\u2019s the part I understand.", "Q. How can small-business owners encourage reviews from customers, especially if they\u2019re in industries, like dry cleaning, that don\u2019t normally inspire strong opinions?", "A. Only two categories get a lot of reviews, lifestyle and hospitality/entertainment. But in dry cleaning the only kind of strong reaction you get tends to be negative. No one goes online and takes the time unless you burn their garment. So you have to ask. And you have to make it easy. You can email them at home. Or one of the applications we offer is a tablet so people can enter a review right as they pay.", "Q. The New York State attorney general\u2019s investigation of fake Yelp reviews showed that not all businesses get reviews the right way.", "A. Never, ever, ever manufacture reviews. That\u2019s a clear No. 1. No. 2, we discourage compensation for reviews. There are a lot of companies that have done this for a long time. But too easily it can start to be a biasing thing. And the truth is, you don\u2019t need to incentivize people. You just need to make it easy.", "Q. When should a business that has been attacked online in reviews or on social media sites respond?", "A. The first thing you do is breathe. Some of this stuff is written for an audience of one: you. Unless it\u2019s very visible, it\u2019s not worth a response. If something that they are saying is unambiguously false, you do want to consider a response: \u201cThese people do not serve lasagna.\u201d \u201cThey fired their key person who handles accounting.\u201d Those are examples when it\u2019s very easy to correct the record. In a very sanitized, polite way, you can say, \u201cIn fact, so-and-so still works here.\u201d", "Q. What if it\u2019s really nasty?", "A. As we say in Kentucky, when you wrestle with a pig you both get covered in mud. The last thing you want to do is start fighting these guys. You can\u2019t take this personally.", "Q. So what should the owner do?", "A. Collect real reviews from real customers who are not that person. Get more voices in the conversation.", "Q. What if the owner really did screw up?", "A. The only thing you can do is reset and make a sustained effort to bring humor, light and grace back into the discussion. \u201cYup, sorry, major screw-up, totally learned our lesson, here\u2019s some humor about ourselves, thank you for the feedback, we\u2019re going to work hard to regain the standing we had.\u201d And you touch it every month or every few weeks for a year. You don\u2019t let it go.", "Q. Your company had a data breach last year and got battered online. What did you do?", "A. We decided to talk about it publicly very fast. The data breach was of a shape and size that only one state would have required us to notify residents in that state. Instead of just telling them, we told everybody. And it was painful for a company that does privacy to do that. We told everybody, we made it clear, and we said this is what we have to do, and this is what we offer you, free services and so forth. We owned the fact that it would be an unpleasant 48 hours. We didn\u2019t tell the press first, we told our customers first and the press found out. And since, we\u2019ve made radical changes to our security.", "Q. How much time should business owners invest in social media?", "A. Social media is often a waste of their time. A rule of thumb: If you\u2019re selling cupcakes, useful; if you\u2019re selling power tools, not useful. So: pleasurable, joyful items? Probably yes. More female-facing? Probably yes. Power drinks? Sure. Orthopedics? No.", "Q. How often can a business owner be expected to tweet? A. A couple times a day to a couple times of week is more than enough depending on your sector. If you\u2019ve been doing it a year, and you have 100 followers in your community, you may want to reconsider what you\u2019re doing, or just stop. Having said that, having a presence is useful because it gives you real estate online.", "Q. How can small businesses identify the best social media options for them?", "A. If your customers are basically women, Facebook is a good bet for you. You don\u2019t need to have multiple platforms and there are easy tools that can amplify your reach by rebroadcasting your stuff on Twitter. If you\u2019re trying to reach professionals or those who are going to pay north of $500 to $1,000 for a product, LinkedIn is the way to go.

Lady Morgan wrote, \u201cSignore Vigan\u00f2 is the Shakespeare of his art; and with such powerful conceptions, and such intimate knowledge of nature and effect, as he exhibits, it is wonderful, that, instead of composing ballets, he does not write epics.\u201d", "For Stendhal, Vigan\u00f2 had Shakespeare\u2019s truthfulness in his staging of historical tragedy. And though the tendency of the dance-dramas of the day was to convey serious emotion by means of silent acting and expressive mime, Lady Morgan wrote that \u201cthe Moor appears literally dancing mad with jealousy.\u201d", "Having seen some rotten dance versions of \u201cOthello,\u201d I\u2019d have been skeptical of that observation, were it not that Othello\u2019s despair hit me anew in 2012 with Doug Elkins\u2019s \u201cMo(or)town Redux\u201d: a modern-dress version to Motown music. Othello crumbled in a series of contractions to \u201cI Heard It Through the Grapevine.\u201d", "Still, how on earth did Vigan\u00f2 realize \u201cCoriolanus\u201d in dance terms? That seems among the most dance-resistant of plays. But Vigan\u00f2 was the master of what the Italians called \u201ccoreodramma\u201d (dance drama featuring powerful ensemble) and may have made extraordinary effects from its many public scenes. We may also imagine how the scene of Coriolanus\u2019s mother and wife supplicating him on their knees worked when set to music. Alas, none of the Shakespeare ballets of the 18th and 19th centuries have survived.", "The miraculous Shakespeare score of that era was Mendelssohn\u2019s incidental music for \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d: It abounds in gossamer, magic, horseplay and enchanted sleep. In the 1960s, this prompted both Balanchine\u2019s and Ashton\u2019s versions \u2014 still the two greatest and most poetic Shakespeare ballets today. But Marius Petipa, the master of the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, used Mendelssohn\u2019s music as the basis for a ballet of the play in 1876; he even told Tchaikovsky to use it as a model for part of \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty.\u201d", "Only when the right music is found does a Shakespeare ballet have a chance of surviving. In 1935, Prokofiev completed the first version of his \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d; he gave it a happy ending, not because he could not bear the young lovers to die, but because he felt a ballet needed dancing near its conclusion. That version of the score was recently rediscovered; in 2008, Mark Morris choreographed it.", "But the classic version of the score only materialized when Prokofiev was persuaded to give the lovers their usual deaths. Prokofiev was a movie fan and had already proved himself the most distinguished of film composers; but it\u2019s fair to call his \u201cRomeo\u201d the greatest silent-movie accompaniment ever written. When the choreographer Leonid Lavrovsky staged this \u201cRomeo\u201d for the Kirov and the Bolshoi Ballet in the 1940s, silent acting dominated; Galina Ulanova\u2019s Juliet \u2014 an astounding feat of Stanislavskian acting, preserved on film \u2014 has the fervor of Lillian Gish.", "Since the 1950s, many of the West\u2019s best and worst choreographers have tackled this \u201cRomeo.\u201d The most poetic of them was Ashton\u2019s 1955 version, which I often saw between 1985 and 1989 with the company now called English National Ballet; I remember many of its details. In Europe and America the 1962 staging by John Cranko has its devotees; and on the Continent, some remain loyal to Rudolf Nureyev\u2019s overliterary 1977 version. (In the play, Juliet says, \u201cLet death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.\u201d Nureyev, preposterously, took her at her word: a Death figure deflowers her before Romeo has the chance.)", "But it\u2019s Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s 1965 production that has become a classic. Most years, it returns to the repertories of the Royal Ballet (for which he created it) and Ballet Theater. Although there was an enduring scandal about Margot Fonteyn and Nureyev\u2019s dancing the premiere of a ballet that MacMillan had created for the far more radical Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable, the choreographer actually gave considerable interpretive leeway to all of his first four casts, so that Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell, Merle Park and Donald MacLeary all made individual imprints on the roles. He also had the benefit of brilliant designs by Nicholas Georgiadis, which glow like stained glass.", "And so this \u201cRomeo\u201d became an enduring vehicle for many stars. The performances that Ms. Seymour danced in 1977 with Mikhail Baryshnikov remain my own high-water mark. (Nobody has matched Ms. Seymour\u2019s extraordinarily vehement and poignant use of weight and plasticity in the potion scene.) But dancers from Natalia Makarova to Alina Cojocaru, from David Wall to David Hallberg, have triumphed as Juliet and Romeo. In this decade, Natalia Osipova\u2019s Juliet, with Ballet Theater and now the Royal, is the latest of a series of \u201cRomeo\u201d sensations.", "Here\u2019s the advantage ballet has over theater: A great ballet production can endure over decades. Many productions of the play \u201cRomeo\u201d disappoint; but MacMillan\u2019s take sets a standard on which we can rely.", "Certainly, there have been Shakespearean dance one-offs that have succeeded. In \u201cDancing Henry Five,\u201d David Gordon addressed many themes arising out of \u201cHenry V\u201d: history, invasion, war, the stageable. (It helped that he employed the spoken word; but he also made marvelous use of William Walton music.)", "Paul Taylor choreographed \u201cTroilus and Cressida (reduced)\u201d in 2006; alas, it\u2019s one of his sillier works. But it seems likely that aspects of \u201cAs You Like It\u201d underlie his beautiful, funny, vaulting \u201cArden Court\u201d (1981): Though it tells no story, it contains suggestions of romantic comedy, multiple plots and a court created in exile in the open air (Shakespeare\u2019s Forest of Arden).", "The element of romantic love is what gives wing to many Shakespearean dances. Cranko\u2019s \u201cThe Taming of the Shrew\u201d (1969) looked wretched when danced by the Stuttgart Ballet last November; but when it was young, though irksome in many respects, its central performances, by Marcia Hayd\u00e9e and Richard Cragun, suggested that Katharina and Petruchio are the freest spirits of their society, and eventually join with the ardor of Daphnis and Chloe.", "When the Ratmansky \u201cTempest\u201d was new last year, the love of Ferdinand and Miranda was the most poetic part. \u201cThe Tempest\u201d has tempted successive choreographers; I\u2019ve seen productions by Glen Tetley, Michael Smuin, Nureyev and Crystal Pite \u2014 all of them fairly or very terrible. Mr. Ratmansky\u2019s, staged to Sibelius\u2019s incidental music, is a big improvement; but it still does too little to release the dance in this play while telling the complex story. Prospero\u2019s reflectiveness has not yet been choreographed effectively. It\u2019s fair to hope that, when this production returns this summer, Mr. Ratmansky will at least have improved the dances for the wind spirits. Ballet really can conjure magic and the elemental.", "Dance versions of \u201cHamlet\u201d used to keep coming around, too. (Helpmann\u2019s psychodrama sleep-of-dreams rendition endured almost 40 years.) And I\u2019ve seen dancing Lady Macbeths. Use Google, and you\u2019ll find recently choreographed versions of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d \u201cKing Lear,\u201d \u201cRichard III\u201d and \u201cTitus Andronicus\u201d \u2014 as well as a Wild West \u201cAs You Like It.\u201d", "The cynic in me agrees they all sound absurd; but decades of theatergoing keep teaching me the different ways in which Shakespeare lends himself not just to the ear but also to the eye.

In her striped leotard and legwarmers, Fonda led the charge against the generally held opinion that exercise was a weird waste of time. (In those days, lifting weights was for Charles Atlas aspirants, and jogging was for quirky \u201chealth nuts.\u201d) The tireless exertions of Fonda \u2014 and of tiny-shorted Richard Simmons and toothy Judi Sheppard Missett, the founder of Jazzercise \u2014 were ultimately wildly successful, making what was then an eccentric choice into what is now practically an obligation.

In his new book, \u201cSmarter,\u201d he embraces scientists\u2019 assertions that cognitive training can increase working memory \u2014 the mental holding space in which we manipulate and combine facts and ideas \u2014 and even fluid intelligence, the all-purpose problem-solving capacity that is partner to crystallized intelligence, or knowledge stored in memory.", "Like the early advocates of physical exercise, Hurley has a tough sell. The mental exercises recommended by the researchers he interviews are at once numbingly boring and exasperatingly difficult. The most-studied among them is called the N-back, which is \u2014 well, I\u2019ll let Hurley explain:", "\u201cImagine that you are listening to a string of letters spoken aloud. You are asked to press a button every time you hear the same letter repeated twice in a row. That\u2019s 1-back. That\u2019s easy. So if you hear the list n-a-m-m-a-m, you press the button when you hear the second m, right? But now let\u2019s try 2-back: this time, you have to press the button when you hear the last letter in the series, because this last m was preceded two letters earlier (hence \u20182-back\u2019) by another m. If you were being tested on 3-back, however, you would press the button when you heard the second a, because it was preceded three letters earlier by the first a. And so it goes, to 4-back, 5-back and on.\u201d", "What makes this task so difficult, Hurley explains, is that the list keeps coming \u2014 not a list of just six letters but one that keeps going, with another letter and another letter, for a minute and a half. The player must keep track of the sequence of two, three, four or more letters, which changes as the next one is added. \u201cIt requires total concentration,\u201d he warns.", "A bit daunting as a leisure time activity. But Hurley is like the early champions of physical exercise in another way: He is offering to feed a great demand. Thirty years ago, the public was eager for guidance about how to have healthier lives and fitter bodies. Today, we\u2019re urgently seeking advice about how to make our minds operate more efficiently and effectively. We compete in a world of knowledge work, a daily contest in which the best brains win; we\u2019re living longer and hoping to hang on to our faculties until the end. If the N-back can help, there may be no amount of torment and tedium we won\u2019t tolerate.", "The question, of course, is whether the N-back and other kinds of mental training deliver what they promise. By the time Richard Simmons was \u201cSweatin\u2019 to the Oldies,\u201d science had reached an overwhelming agreement that physical exercise was central to good health \u2014 a consensus that has only strengthened in the years since. The research on cognitive exercise is much patchier, with the first studies of the effects of training with the N-back appearing just six years ago.", "In May 2008, the Swiss researchers Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl reported on an experiment in which college students practiced the N-back exercise 20 minutes a day, five days a week, for four weeks. The students took a test of fluid intelligence before and after the training occurred. \u201cUnlike physical conditioning, which can transform 98-pound weaklings into hunks, a hundred years of scientific doctrine insisted that fluid intelligence was impervious to the effects of training,\u201d Hurley notes. But after a month of working with the N-back, students\u2019 scores on the test of fluid intelligence increased, on average, by 40 percent.", "The author devotes ample space to Jaeggi and Buschkuehl, and to Torkel Klingberg, one of the pioneers in cognitive exercise research who was a co-founder of Cogmed, a for-profit company (now owned by the testing giant Pearson). Individuals who engage in cognitive exercise, the company claims, will be \u201cbetter able to stay focused, ignore distractions, plan next steps, remember instructions and start and finish tasks.\u201d The pool of people who could benefit from such training is vast, the site suggests: \u201cchildren and adults with attention deficits or learning disorders, victims of brain injury or stroke, and adults experiencing information overload or the natural effects of aging.\u201d", "Hurley also offers airtime to critics of the claims made for cognitive exercise. One of the fiercest of these is Randall Engle, a professor of psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Of Torkel Klingberg and Cogmed, Engle tells Hurley, \u201cIf you Google it, it looks like Cogmed can be used to solve everything from arthritis to lumbago. Pearson is making a fortune off this, and the researchers are in on the cult.\u201d", "For his own part, Hurley calls himself a \u201cskeptical bastard,\u201d professionally disposed to doubt both sides. But he comes across as a not-quite objective guide to the emerging science of cognitive fitness, keen to accept its premises and believe its promises. In a bout of self-experimentation he calls \u201cboot camp for my brain,\u201d the author tries N-back training and a variety of other lab exercises. When it\u2019s over, he finds that his score on a test of fluid intelligence has climbed 16.4 percent. As for functioning in ordinary life, he reports: \u201cI got along better with my wife and daughter. I no longer found myself getting into my car and realizing that I\u2019d forgotten my briefcase. I went on nearly a dozen trips to scientific meetings around the country during this same period, booking all my flights and rental cars and hotels but experiencing none of the stress and sense of being overwhelmed that I\u2019d expected.\u201d", "\u201cWhat can I tell you?\u201d Hurley concludes. \u201cI feel smarter.\u201d", "Cognitive training may yet turn out to be the solution to sagging memories and flabby reasoning. But it\u2019s not there yet. Hurley\u2019s book feels premature, like the crowning of a winner in a race that\u2019s only just begun. Its author may declare himself satisfied with the evidence generated so far, but the rest of us will need to see more proof that these exercises, unpleasant as they sound, have meaningful effects on the outcomes we care about: doing better at school and at work, remembering more accurately, solving problems more effectively.", "Until then, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll find better things to do with our time than practice the N-back.

Two hundred and fifty feet below me, the sandstone city of Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan, resembled an earthen cubist painting of angular card-houses, surrounded by an endless sand-and-scrub landscape. Above it all, the evening sky glowed a dusky purple.", "I had come to Jaisalmer, in the midst of the nearly 77,000-square-mile Thar Desert to explore this ancient part of Rajasthan and go on a three-day camel trek into the wilderness. Jaisalmer Fort, known as Sonar Quila or \u201cGolden Fort\u201d for the way sun lights its sandstone walls from amber to gold throughout the day, was a major draw for my visit.", "But I soon learned that Jaisalmer has its own charms. Though it is dusty, the city was a welcome departure from the grimy crush of New Delhi, where I had entered the country. Jaisalmer\u2019s narrow streets were filled with vendors, trading in handmade leather bags, fabrics and finished clothing, jewelry, spices and countless other textiles. Busy, yes, but there was also a pleasant, unrushed feel to the place.", "And the fort, accessible by a narrow stone roadway that passes through a series of stone gates, did not disappoint. Its interior was a labyrinth of alleys dotted with havelis \u2014 sandstone buildings, hundreds of years old, covered from stoop to roof in intricate carvings of gods, geometric symbols and mythological depictions.", "One morning I explored a group of elaborately sculptured Jain temples inside the fort, then hired an auto-rickshaw to see the dozens of chhatri cenotaphs at a nearby ruin called Bada Bagh in the afternoon. But the highlight was sitting on the top of the fort\u2019s walls just before sunset, with a cup of chai, to watch children fly kites from nearby roofs.", "On the evening before my camel trek, I spent 30 minutes chatting with Dilip, the owner of the government-licensed bhang shop, around the corner from the outer gate of the fort, on a street lined with leather workers. The shop sells legal preparations of marijuana in edible, or drinkable, form. I\u2019d ordered a bhang lassi, thick with ground pistachios, saffron, black pepper and dairy curd. It tasted like Turkish delight in milkshake form. Considered at once a medical tonic, a sacrament, and in some parts of India more socially acceptable than alcohol, bhang is as old as the Vedic texts, and remains legal and regulated in Rajasthan.", "But a warning: It\u2019s strong stuff. When the bhang finally hit me, I was having a hard time holding a conversation with another guest on the roof of our guesthouse. After excusing myself, I spent the next hours in my room contemplating the vibrating sensations in my body and staring out at the twinkling lights of the city I had been exploring for the last two days.", "The next morning I emerged from my room at 5:30, walked past a few old people and children, presumably on their way to work or school, and dodged wandering cows in the alleys.", "Outside the office of Adventure Travel Agency, two other travelers, three guides and I crammed into an old 4 x 4 for the predawn ride into the desert. Over the next three days we\u2019d forgo showers, eat mostly vegetarian meals cooked over a fire and sleep on bedrolls spread out on dunes. Everything we needed we\u2019d carry with us, and all of our trash we\u2019d pack out.", "After about 45 minutes in the truck, we debarked at the side of a road, where a half-dozen camels grazed on stubby trees near a temporary camp consisting of a windbreak made from dried sticks and brush. A handful of men dressed in tan robes and blankets draped over their shoulders sat around a small fire brewing chai.", "The men offered us the tea, and a breakfast of hard-boiled eggs and freshly made chapati flatbread. And then our guides, with little instruction other than to lean back when the camels stood up, helped us onto our camels. We each rode our own.", "Once I was in the saddle, Deena, our 20-year-old lead guide, made a percussive \u201cck-ck\u201d noise from the side of his mouth, abruptly sending the camel up on its hind legs and nearly pitching me over the animal\u2019s head.", "It took a couple of hours to get used to the camel\u2019s swaying, jarring gait. We left behind the access roads and windmills encroaching on the desert and by lunchtime had entered a primal landscape, with alternating areas of rocky and sandy ground punctuated by short, squat trees and towering Calotropis bushes, whose delicate white and purple flowers, our guides warned us, leaked a gooey sap that could cause blindness.", "We passed by small mud-and-straw villages where women were dressed in brilliant red and yellow saris with gold lace details, and men wore red, green or orange paggar turbans. We also passed single-building outposts made from brush that were used by semi-nomadic people during the rainy season for farming peanuts, guar and millet, and herding sheep and goats.", "By late afternoon, as the sun slipped behind the dunes, I caught glimpses of wild antelope grazing on dried vegetation. And shortly afterward, we stopped at a suitable place to make camp: a sand dune rising out of the mostly flat landscape like the back of a serpent. As with each meal, our food (curried vegetables, millet and wheat chapati, and rice) was cooked over a wood fire and eaten with bare hands from metal plates.", "Exhausted from the long day, we unpacked our sleeping rolls. I lay supine for a while, staring up at a clear sky filled with stars. Then I pulled the covers over my head, partly because of the cold, but mostly because a friend had told me that once, on a similar trip, he had awakened to find a small pack of wild dogs licking his face.", "I was awakened by something less startling and decidedly more pleasant: one of our guides handing me a cup of sweet fire-brewed chai with fresh ginger. The dunes were lit a bright orange, covered in undulating ridges set by an overnight breeze, and crisscrossed by strange tracks that (thank goodness) I didn\u2019t identify as scorpion trails until weeks later when I had a chance to do a search on Google.", "Walking around before we departed, I found thousands of bleached-white spiral seashells about the length of the tip of my pinkie.", "\u201cThey are from an old ocean,\u201d Deena said.", "The second day was much like the first, but with more-frequent stops at small villages, where our guides, who had various religious backgrounds, would say, \u201cThis one is Muslim\u201d or \u201cThis one is Hindu.\u201d", "At each of our stops, clustered during the hottest part of the day, a goatherd or a few children joined us to share our food and try on our sunglasses. At lunch, an extended family of 10 led us over a nearby ridge to their small compound, where they showed us their fields of guar and peanuts and offered freshly made goat or sheep curd.", "\u201cWe found a goat,\u201d Deena announced as we stopped to set up camp later that evening. \u201cIf you still want it, they will bring it here tonight, and we can make mutton curry and barbecue.\u201d", "For around 3,000 rupees (about $50 at 60 rupees to the dollar), we bought the whole animal, and an older relative of one of our guides slaughtered and butchered the goat according to halal tradition. By the time the meat was ready, we were three tourists, three guides and a half-dozen men from a nearby village, sitting around three fires and chatting about our lives.", "With a full stomach and the fire still crackling, I slipped away to my bedroll. In the morning, I\u2019d awake to dozens of peacocks calling from perches in nearby trees, and a few wild dogs, tails tucked between their legs, searching the outskirts of camp for scraps.", "But as I lay under the stars after our feast, I was more ecstatic than the night I tried bhang, and more exhausted than I had been in a long time. I stared at the stars and listened to the local men still chattering around the fire. And while I remember eventually seeing wispy clouds blot out the stars and hearing the faintest patter of rain so light that the drops evaporated upon reaching the ground, I don\u2019t remember falling asleep."], "https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/": ["This coming Friday, 3.14 is Pi Day.

It was also a remarkably simple method, requiring just two balls and a wall. With these you have a pi machine.", "I could barely believe it, so Dr. Amit continued. To calculate pi, take two identical balls. Put one near a wall and roll the other ball toward it.

The machine works!", "This isn\u2019t very convincing, of course. We need something a bit more precise. Can this machine tell us pi is 3.1? Or 3.14?", "With a little modification, it can. A first ball that\u2019s 100 times as massive will create 31 clicks. 10,000 times as massive will create 314 clicks.", "The machine can be used to generate (in theory, at least) as many digits of pi as you\u2019d like.

Dave hit upon (and Hans and Mark \u2014 who simultaneously found another approach \u2014 also explored) a beautifully simple explanation that happened to be the same one I originally used: the collisions mark segments around a circle in a way that exactly determine pi. Although this explanation seems fairly obvious, it appears to be original \u2014 it\u2019s distinct from the method used by Gregory Galperin, who discovered this property nearly twenty years ago, and wasn\u2019t an approach Dr. Galperin was familiar with when I spoke to him a couple weeks ago by phone.", "Dr. Galperin\u2019s own technique is ingenious \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that in a moment \u2014 but we\u2019ll start with the simpler approach.", "", "I think it\u2019s easiest to forget about the bouncing balls for a moment and focus on pi. What does it mean to jot out pi to a particular number of digits? One way to think about it: pi to one digit, for starters, is simply the number of times you can fully wrap the diameter of a circle around that circle.", "To figure this out we would pick up the diameter, wrap it around the first part of the circle, then mark where it ends. We\u2019d then repeat the process until we ran out of circle, giving us a one-digit value of pi of 3.", "Key is that first mark. If we can figure out another way to find it we\u2019ll have an alternative way way to determine pi. (We just need to ensure that this estimate is accurate enough, which means, in this case, it falls between the points created by three-sided and four-sided polygons.)", "One alternative way: take the diameter and tilt it up against the right side of the circle, and then draw the red line as shown, creating a triangle. This red line gives us a mark that falls within the range we need. And if we rotate this triangle we find it marks the same spot.", "A bit unwieldy, but it seems to work. For two digits of pi, we\u2019re looking for the number of times a tenth of the diameter can be wrapped around the circle. Following the same process gives us a very accurate estimate for that first mark. Repeating this we produce 31 of these tenth-diameter segments.", "Divide the diameter into 100 segments and the process will produce an initial segment that will fit 314 times around the circle. The method will give us pi to as many digits as we\u2019d like.", "But how does this relate to colliding balls? There\u2019s actually an exact connection: the balls will actually create, with a little rescaling, this same circle-and-line diagram, with the circle showing a graph of their kinetic energy and the line indicating momentum. A plot of ball velocities (the first ball\u2019s velocity on the x axis and the second ball\u2019s on the y) will plot out pi around the circle to whatever accuracy we\u2019d like.", "Take the first example, where the ball masses are equal. The balls start out as velocities (1,0) after the first ball is given a push. After the first collision the first ball stops and the second starts (0,1); the second then hits the wall and reverses (0,-1) and finally hits the first ball again (-1,0). Three collisions (though the pattern doesn\u2019t jump around the circle counter-clockwise \u2013 instead it zig-zags up and down around the circle) and three intersections after that first point.", "In the second example, where the first ball is now 100 times more massive than before, we get a circle with a more vertical line that will create 31 intersections. (See Dave\u2019s comments for detail.)", "Dr. Galperin\u2019s approach was also geometric but very different (using an unfolding geodesic), building on prior related insights. Dr. Galperin, who studied under well-known Russian mathematician Andrei Kolmogorov, had recently written (with Yakov Sinai) extensively on ball collisions, realized just before a talk in 1995 that a plot of the ball positions of a pair of colliding balls could be used to determine pi. (When he mentioned this insight in the talk, no one in the audience believed him.) This finding was ultimately published as \u201cPlaying Pool With Pi\u201d in a 2003 issue of Regular and Chaotic Dynamics.", "I recently reached Dr. Galperin by phone and asked about the key insight behind this idea and how he in particular happened to see it. \u201cThe Greeks could not have discovered this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t know about kinetic energy and momentum. Leibniz, who proposed the idea of kinetic energy, did not work in this area. As for others \u2014 mathematics is a broad field. This came to me as the collision of several ideas in areas I have worked deeply in.\u201d", "Thank you, Dr. Galperin, and thank you as well to everyone who participated in this week\u2019s challenge: Mark, Gary, Ibabel, Hans, Ravi, Dave, Mark, Giovanni Ciriani, Kurt and Sheldon Ross.", ""], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/us/judge-rebukes-officials-over-requests-for-broad-email-searches.html": ["WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge has admonished the Justice Department for repeatedly requesting overly broad searches of people\u2019s email accounts, a practice that he called \u201crepugnant\u201d to the Constitution.", "The unusually sharp rebuke by Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola came last week in a kickback investigation involving a defense contractor.

Prosecutors asked Judge Facciola for the authority to take everything in the account and search it for evidence of wrongdoing. Even though the government would have everything, it only considered the evidence to be \u201cseized.\u201d The argument is similar to the Obama administration\u2019s justification for collecting the phone records of every American: that the authorities do not know what is relevant until they have reviewed everything.", "\u201cThe fact that our data is being held by third-party service providers is allowing the government to engage in fishing expeditions that they\u2019ve never been able to conduct before,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.", "A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, said prosecutors would respond to the judge in court documents, though it was not clear whether those documents would be public.

(It\u2019s sometimes called \u201cthe God particle.\u201d) The experience of watching the film can be vertiginous: You toggle between the tiny and the infinite, between eternity and the real time of the recent past.", "The Higgs particle is named for Peter Higgs, one of the physicists who first posited its existence in 1964.

It has a central role in what physicists call the Standard Model, a comprehensive account of, well, just about everything.", "The search for the particle itself led to the construction of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN \u2014 also called the European Organization for Nuclear Research \u2014 near Geneva, where much of the action in \u201cParticle Fever\u201d takes place, in the years leading up to a 2012 breakthrough. At CERN, practical science outstrips the dreams of science fiction as a machine shoots beams of particles around a long track. The hope is that their collisions will provide data indicating the presence of the Higgs.", "The experimental physicists deployed on the Hadron work in the service of ideas formulated by their theorist brethren (shown in their Princeton and Palo Alto habitats, walking in the woods or writing on whiteboards). There are hints of collegial rivalry between the groups, and of competition among the theorists. Much of the background is explained by David E. Kaplan, a Johns Hopkins physicist who is a producer of the film. Mr. Kaplan helped commission Mr. Levinson (and also Walter Murch, the visionary editor of \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and \u201cThe English Patient\u201d) to translate science into cinema, and he proves an able and amiable guide.", "The physics that Mr. Kaplan and his colleagues practice is forbiddingly complex, comprehensible to most of the people in the film and to very few outside it.

While the discovery of the Higgs may not have immediate consequences for the way we live, or applications in the world of technology and industry, its implications, according to \u201cParticle Fever,\u201d could hardly be more profound. Through most of the film, the scientists are awaiting a specific bit of data, a single number that will either vindicate a theory of the universe known as supersymmetry or suggest the possibility of multiple universes.", "The differences between these two outcomes seem very stark. In the first case, more particles are likely to be found, contributing to a detailed and orderly picture of the nature of things. In the second, the Standard Model will be thrown into chaos, and the stability of the universe itself may be called into question. It won\u2019t be the end of the world, but for some theorists, it will feel that way.", "Mr. Kaplan is hoping for supersymmetry.

It is enormously suspenseful, too, chronicling a period that included nearly catastrophic setbacks and public relations disasters, as well as progress. There was always a risk that the machinery would not work, that the beams would not collide properly, and that the Higgs would continue to hide at the theoretical center of the universe without empirical confirmation.", "Even if you recall (or Google) newspaper articles from the summer of 2012, when CERN made headlines, you may still hold your breath at the climax of \u201cParticle Fever.\u201d What will the magic number be?

But it is hard to argue in good faith that eBay somehow knew that the business was worth more than the market at the time and still went ahead with the sale mainly to enrich Mr. Andreessen.", "Perhaps forgotten in the back-and-forth between Mr. Icahn and eBay is this: From the time the company signaled its intent to divest Skype until the sale to Microsoft closed, eBay\u2019s market value jumped by $29 billion, or 195 percent, in no small part because investors believed that the company had refocused itself on the right priorities. While eBay may be short $4 billion, in truth, the amount was more than made up by the increase in the company\u2019s market value.", "So did Mr. Andreessen have an undue influence on the board\u2019s decision to sell Skype to the investor consortium? By all accounts, the answer is no.", "That\u2019s not to say that a company selling a business to a group of investors that includes one of its board members should be applauded. It raises all sorts of questions that could have been avoided if Mr. Andreessen had recused himself from being part of the investor group that bought Skype as opposed to a board member involved in a critical decision for eBay\u2019s future.", "Silver Lake approached eBay long before Mr. Andreessen was ever invited to be part of the bidding group \u2014 and his firm, Andreessen Horowitz, invested only $50 million in the deal \u2014 so it was hardly necessary for him to participate in the deal the way he did.", "Sadly, the debate over Mr. Andreessen\u2019s role is obscuring a larger and more important debate: Should PayPal continue to be part of eBay, or would it be more successful separately?", "Mr. Icahn may be a bit of Luddite, but when it comes to investing, he has a hot hand.

He sets the undergarment, which is zebra striped, into the case beside three other pairs that range from polka dot to paisley. \u201cI like to wear strong patterns against my skin,\u201d he says, pitching his voice low, as though to share a tip that I don\u2019t recall soliciting. \u201cIt gives me a wonderful feeling of inner confidence.\u201d", "For Mr. Kirn, 51, who indeed brims with an outer confidence that can be intimidating at times to those unused to brash, creative types who dress in custom cowboy boots and seem indifferent to the modest niceties of literary image, the loud underwear seems to be working this afternoon. After pressing a pair of red briefs into my hand (\u201cYours to keep,\u201d he says), he lets it be known that he\u2019s something of an expert on packing efficiently for extended trips. His 2001 novel, \u201cUp in the Air\u201d \u2014 the story of a lonesome businessman obsessed with collecting airline bonus miles that was made into a 2009 Oscar-nominated movie starring George Clooney \u2014 is all about traveling light, he says, both physically and emotionally.", "\u201cI know how you might get confused on this, but the Clooney character isn\u2019t me,\u201d Mr. Kirn says, addressing the first of many unasked questions. \u201cAside from a basic physical resemblance, we really don\u2019t have much in common. No. 1, I\u2019m engaged to be married. I\u2019m not a bachelor. I form more lasting bonds.\u201d", "The new book that Mr. Kirn will be traveling to promote, \u201cBlood Will Out,\u201d is the story of a bond that some may wonder why he formed at all, let alone allowed to last so long: his bizarre 15-year relationship with the infamous impostor and murderer who went by the alias Clark Rockefeller. He met the masquerading German immigrant (whose real name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter and who is serving a sentence of 27 years to life in a California prison) in the summer of 1998, when Mr. Kirn was between books and feeling restless.", "\u201cA writer who isn\u2019t writing,\u201d Mr. Kirn reflects, tossing a pair of dark socks into his bag free-throw style, \u201cis asking for trouble.\u201d In his case, trouble took a canine form when the Livingston animal shelter contacted him about a homeless hunting dog that was crippled and used a wheelchair. The dog had been adopted over the Internet by \u201cClark,\u201d a resident of New York, who planned to treat it using acupuncture. \u201cThe shelter asked if I\u2019d talk to him,\u201d Mr. Kirn says, \u201cthinking, perhaps, that because I\u2019d gone to Princeton, I might know how to speak his language. Long story short, I ended up setting out to drive the dog to Manhattan in my Ford pickup, thinking this might earn the shelter a big donation. I had no clue what I\u2019d gotten myself into.\u201d", "Readers of \u201cBlood Will Out\u201d may find Mr. Kirn\u2019s persistent cluelessness astonishing. For 10 years, until \u201cRockefeller\u201d was unmasked after kidnapping his noncustodial daughter outside a Boston courthouse, Mr. Kirn never suspected that his posh friend was anyone other than whom he said he was, let alone a fugitive person of interest in a gruesome cold-case murder from 1985. There were many red flags, but the trusting Oxford graduate (Mr. Kirn studied there on a scholarship after Princeton), explained them away as upper-class eccentricities not unlike those of the young British aristocrats whom he encountered in his early 20s. The bogus heir described himself as \u201ca freelance central banker\u201d and claimed to possess a key \u2014 a master key \u2014 to all of the buildings in Rockefeller Center. He also boasted of close friendships with Britney Spears and the former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.", "\u201cPeople ask why I didn\u2019t just Google him,\u201d Mr. Kirn says, pointing to the laptop on the oak desk where he finished \u201cBlood Will Out\u201d over several hectic months last year, fueled by e-cigarettes, energy drinks and anger. \u201cWell, Google wasn\u2019t around when we first met. You took people at face value in those days.\u201d This is slightly misleading, I respond, since Google was officially founded that year, and there were other search engines like Yahoo and Ask Jeeves. Mr. Kirn stiffens at this remark and turns sarcastic. \u201cAsk Jeeves!\u201d he says. \u201cWho ever used that thing? College freshmen to find out who Goethe was \u2014 that\u2019s it. I feel like you\u2019re faulting me for being trusting. Well, I trust you, and I haven\u2019t Asked Jeeves you!\u201d", "A few minutes later, having settled down some, Mr. Kirn digs in the cluttered top drawer of his desk. He\u2019s hunting for an external battery pack to power his iPhone while he\u2019s on the road. He intends to shoot videos on the phone, he says, to document his book tour. \u201cI want to dispel this idea young writers have that this is a glamorous way of life,\u201d he says. \u201cThe room-service Caesar salads with soggy croutons, the distant relatives who show up at readings pitching weird, far-fetched investment schemes, the fans who have you sign a book to \u2018Cathy\u2019 and then tell you, \u2018No, it\u2019s Kathy with a K\u2019 \u2014 it gets challenging after a while. It tests your stamina.\u201d", "Mr. Kirn\u2019s prickliness and flashes of arrogance seem to disguise a basic insecurity that may explain why he longed for the approval of a con man posing as a blue blood. For all of his boasting about his Princeton and Oxford days (a Time magazine review of \u201cBlood Will Out\u201d notes that the book mentions the universities a combined 25 times), he strikes me as anxious and socially uncertain. While packing his shaving kit, he asks me for deodorant advice. \u201cDoes the natural, unscented stuff even work?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if I need the stronger kind. How do I smell to you right now? Be honest.\u201d", "Before I can answer, he asks another question: What did I think of the homemade video that he recently shot for \u201cBlood Will Out\u201d and posted on YouTube and other social media, causing something of a stir? In the spontaneous 13-minute rant, which some viewers found inspired and others rambling, he called out the novelist Gary Shteyngart for enlisting James Franco to appear in a book trailer to publicize Mr. Shteyngart\u2019s recent memoir, \u201cLittle Failure.\u201d In the video, sitting on the floor beside a fireplace and looking disheveled and agitated, Mr. Kirn deplores the literary world\u2019s drift toward celebrity worship and Internet showmanship.", "\u201cGary\u2019s a friend, and I hope he took it well,\u201d Mr. Kirn tells me without waiting for my answer. \u201cThough I don\u2019t really know, because we haven\u2019t spoken since. We\u2019ve \u2018favorited\u2019 some of each other\u2019s posts on Twitter, but I\u2019m not sure that constitutes true communication. Actually, I\u2019m fairly sure it doesn\u2019t.\u201d", "Mr. Kirn gives up searching for his phone battery. His desk drawer is filled with debris from last year\u2019s writing marathon: four nail clippers, numerous foam earplugs, countless loose Ibuprofen tablets and two brass lighters. \u201cNot every cigarette I smoked was electronic,\u201d he confesses. In the book, he blames some of his gullible, muddy thinking during the years he was friendly with \u201cRockefeller\u201d on prescription A.D.H.D. drugs that helped him to stay up late and meet deadlines. He says he doesn\u2019t use the pills now, preferring a natural potion, E3 Live, which is made from blue-green algae.", "\u201cMy fianc\u00e9e, Amanda, whom I met when \u2018Up in the Air\u2019 was being made and who won me over one day on the set by conspicuously putting her arm around me while George Clooney was feeding her some line, has turned my life around, nutrition-wise,\u201d Mr. Kirn says. \u201cShe\u2019s also taught me to trust people again. Knowing \u2018Clark\u2019 made me paranoid. I was a wreck. The way I\u2019ve let my guard down with you today just wouldn\u2019t have been possible back then. I would have been sure that you were out to get me. You aren\u2019t, though, are you? You\u2019re going to make me look good.\u201d", "I remind him that the job of a reporter is not to flatter or reassure a subject but simply to observe him and write the truth.", "\u201cThere is no truth when it comes to human beings,\u201d Mr. Kirn observes bitterly, bending over his suitcase and revealing a strip of garish orange-and-black tiger-striped underwear. \u201cThat\u2019s what my book\u2019s about. Did you even read it? You didn\u2019t, I bet. You\u2019re a phony like the rest of them. What\u2019s your name? Your real name?\u201d", "I spell my name for him so he can Google it. \u201cJust kidding, I believe you, \u201d Mr. Kirn responds. \u201cI like you. You\u2019re a character.

Skylight holds long-term leases or management contracts on large, typically historic locations, which it transforms into event spaces for corporate clients like Nike and Google. \u201cWhat we do is so random and it didn\u2019t exist before, so there\u2019s really no on-the-job training that you could have,\u201d she said.", "Instead, she looks for smart people who are problem solvers. They also have to be unflappable when stressed and working on a deadline. Other important traits include the ability to communicate clearly and effectively with clients. Independent thinkers are especially valued. Regardless of an employee\u2019s level within the company, each person has an entrepreneurial role.", "\u201cEach event is a project and each project is completely different,\u201d Ms. Blumin said. Although Skylight has created systems and templates, the unexpected often happens, whether it\u2019s a snowstorm or a transit strike. Employees must be able to figure things out on their own.", "Ms. Blumin said Skylight\u2019s president, who manages day-to-day operations and serves as her \u201cright hand,\u201d fits this description. She was a Yale history major who worked at Google for four years before joining Skylight. She was referred to Skylight by a friend at Google who had worked with the company on events. Ms. Blumin said she had always hired by word of mouth and had never had to post a job listing.", "\u201cYou seem to know who you want,\u201d said Susan Parker, who owns Bari Jay, a store selling wedding dresses. But, she wondered, how does Ms. Blumin determine whether her employees have these qualities before she hires them?", "\u201cWe hire everybody on a trial basis,\u201d Ms. Blumin replied. She was, in fact, trying out some people at the time of our meeting, during Mercedes Benz Fashion Week when many of Skylight\u2019s clients held events.", "\u201cFor like three months?\u201d asked Deirdre Lord, who owns the Megawatt Hour, an energy advisor.", "\u201cIt depends,\u201d Ms. Blumin said.

She wondered if Ms. Blumin would have to change her approach.", "Ms. Blumin said she had also used the tryout approach in better economic times.

Others, like Honda and Hyundai, have applied for gesture patents. Microsoft and Apple have long-range projects with automakers; both companies, along with Google, have filed for related patents, have purchased gesture-systems makers or both.", "Commands initiated by hand movements are no Harry Potter fantasy, but a reality found in many homes today.

Most proposed gestures are obvious enough \u2014 hands swiping or pointing, palms facing up or down \u2014 but some involve pantomimes like cupping an ear. Coming next are waves, winks and nods that are read by video or infrared cameras and ultrasound sensors.", "Gesture technology, which falls under the heading of natural user interfaces, will be more than just another gadget.

There\u2019s a real danger that today\u2019s misalignment between newer peer-to-peer business models and older regulations will impede economic growth. The solution is to delegate more regulatory responsibility to the marketplaces and platforms while preserving some government oversight, by creating new self-regulatory organizations like those that have succeeded in other markets and industries.", "It\u2019s not as if today\u2019s city and state regulations are fundamentally flawed. They\u2019re not.  It\u2019s simply that this wave of digital disruption is altering how we experience familiar services \u2014 short-term accommodation, point-to-point urban transportation, car rental. The economic engine at work here is an array of new peer-to-peer marketplaces that unlock dormant physical capital (real estate, vehicles, household assets) and put it to productive use, creating, in the process, a wide variety of new consumption experiences (contrast the modest range of hotel rooms with the diversity of Airbnbs), and catalyzing innovation by micro-entrepreneurs who can dip their toes into the world of small business unimpeded by the risks of an all-or-nothing start-up.", "Not surprisingly, there\u2019s a misalignment between the rules developed for the older, industrial-age, \u201canalog\u201d ways of shared consumption, like staying in hotels or hailing taxis, and the peer-to-peer business models enabled by the new digital platforms. If this gap \u2013 between the old regulations and the new models \u2013 isn\u2019t closed soon, there is a real risk that the impending economic growth could be stifled. Moreover, a lack of genuine regulatory oversight and guidance where actually necessary can lead to backlash that might damage both the platforms and their millions of suppliers.", "There is a solution to this regulatory conundrum. First, the government should recognize that the new peer-to-peer marketplaces have sophisticated controls naturally built in. For example, Airbnb offers its traders a robust digital reputation system based on detailed post-transaction ratings, as well as identity verification systems that combine the digitized social capital of Facebook or LinkedIn with the existing government ID infrastructure. Verifying identity lowers the risks of market failure by making users (both renters and suppliers) feel safer; instant and transparent user feedback makes government oversight \u2014 about, say, space cleanliness \u2014 less essential.  Likewise, government-mandated taxi fares and meters seem unnecessary when Uber, Lyft and Sidecar set uniform rates and track routes exactly using navigation technology.", "The platforms have voluntarily adopted additional nondigital safeguards. Ahead of any regulatory requirement, Lyft and Sidecar had put in place a fairly elaborate supplier-screening protocol, one that was perhaps a template for California\u2019s recently introduced regulatory framework for ride sharing.  Airbnb has more than 50 investigative agents, headed by a former army intelligence officer, on its trust and safety team.  This isn\u2019t surprising. The profit-seeking interests of these private marketplaces aren\u2019t that different from those of a textbook regulator: encouraging productive trade, keeping market participants safe and preventing \u201cmarket failure.\u201d", "Self-policing isn\u2019t a universal panacea. We\u2019ll still need government mandates to prevent effects like congestion, or for, say, providing accessible vehicles and ensuring disaster preparedness \u2014 things that markets don\u2019t easily self-provide. As we better understand the scope and sustainability of effective self-policing, and what new forms of oversight are needed, we should encourage the creation of a new class of self-regulatory organizations that set and enforce regulations for peer-to-peer sharing marketplaces, perhaps initially with some federal or state oversight.", "As hundreds of new peer-to-peer marketplaces emerge over the coming years, such organizations would ease what would otherwise be a tremendous strain on the government\u2019s resources: having to constantly monitor and correct regulatory misalignment across an evolving set of industries. They could also inform the new oversight questions that emerge as these platforms reach mass-market scale, like the liability of ride-sharing platforms for accidents involving drivers between fare-paying rides, and whether residential zoning and noise laws should change when individual apartments become mixed-use real estate.", "Following the Securities and Exchanges Act of 1934, a variety of securities markets have self-regulatory organizations like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra (and the predecessor regulatory arms of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq), all under the watchful governmental eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Granted, peer-to-peer markets for goods and services have different complexities than markets for financial securities. But industry-created organizations have led to effective self-regulation in other (nondigital) peer-to-peer businesses as well. The National Association of Realtors and the American Medical Association, which emerged organically from a need to self-regulate, are perhaps the best examples. Bar associations guide the behaviors of lawyers in each state. The historical roots of industry consortiums for self-policing go much further back, perhaps to the merchant guilds of medieval times.  The idea has been around and worked for centuries.", "This digital transformation that is creating today\u2019s \u201ccollaborative economy\u201d is quite different from the ones that preceded it.

Leapfrog was once a traditional and fairly harmless pastime, but the West Side Boys have transformed it into a savage contest in which Agar is sometimes the prime target.

The book renders an unusually intimate, detailed and vivid picture of a place that is simultaneously private and open. These observations crystallize most beautifully in a section in which the narrator, wondering whether his writing about Chibi \u201cgave the neighbors an estranged or alienating feeling, as if the pet they loved had been abducted by strangers,\u201d compares the cat to a story: \u201cAfter all, a cat left outside on its own will cross any border it wants. . . .

Obama has made his share of mistakes, especially lately, but too much conservative commentary on \u201cAmerica\u2019s retreat,\u201d and the like, is written as though the great squander of the Bush era doesn\u2019t still cast a shadow over our foreign policy.

The House Republican caucus is just too dysfunctional to unite around anything except modest budget deals and insufficient alternatives, and if they did unite around something more substantial they\u2019re too distant from the White House ideologically to cut a deal. That\u2019s probably still going to be the case after the midterms, and the lame duck phase of presidencies rarely produce much policy movement anyway. So for the ideas currently circulating to actually come up for votes that mean something, I think you\u2019d need a change in the correlation of forces in Washington D.C. \u2013 and in particular, you\u2019d need a clear leader capable of pushing them, which basically can only happen if there\u2019s a Republican in the White House.", "As for what happens to these kind of proposals if it\u2019s Hillary Clinton in the White House instead, with a Republican House and a divided Senate?

(I\u2019ve rambled at greater length on this subject in the past, so I won\u2019t do so here.)

But even in the unlikely event that public opinion swung back in my direction on the definition-of-marriage issue, I don\u2019t see any necessary reason (though I concede the existence of historically contingent ones) to think that maintaining the traditional definition of matrimony in 21st century America would close off your ability to pursue love, or be found by it.", "Now the religious questions are different, and harder. I don\u2019t see a way for my church \u2014 and yours by baptism \u2014 to bless same-sex unions absent a true doctrinal revolution, which if it happened would essentially involve Catholicism becoming a very different kind of church and faith than the one that I understand it to be. (The issue isn\u2019t just a matter of reinterpreting a few biblical passages; the conjugal, procreative view of marriage is woven into Christian doctrine in ways that would require truly radical revisionism to undo.) So the position of gay people who are raised Catholic or Christian, or feel drawn \u2014 or in your case, perhaps someday drawn back \u2014 to Christianity is, I expect, going to continue to be fraught and complicated and uniquely challenging, at least barring some sort of shift that I can\u2019t conceive of at the moment.", "This fraughtness will take (and already takes) various forms in a post-closet world: There will be churches that bless same-sex unions, but they will have an at-best-uneasy relationship to their own scriptures and traditions; there will be gay Christians who attend more orthodox churches while maintaining relationships that conflict with their faith\u2019s official teachings, and who live (like all of us, but more so than many) with unresolved tensions in their spiritual life; and there will be gay Christians who embrace some sort of celibate vocation, and try to carve out or revive (as various gay Christian writers are trying to do) forms of religious community that are specific to their situation.", "If I were attracted to men and otherwise held exactly the same theological views, my beliefs would impel me toward the third option.

After all, only a month earlier, Facebook said that it was buying WhatsApp, a social media company with modest sales, for a price that may reach $19 billion.

In 2013, our lowest-selling month was March ($125,993) and the next worst was January ($165,282). But they were bookends for a very strong February, during which we wrote $354,595 in new orders.

That means we have a backlog of six weeks, which is not unusual for us. That\u2019s actually where I prefer to be, so that we can respond quickly to clients who need work fast. The problem is that we\u2019re not holding steady at the six-week mark. We are building so much faster than we are selling that the backlog is dropping, fast.", "It\u2019s extraordinarily unlikely that we will book no new orders before our backlog runs out, but we cannot sustain a production rate of $3.2 million per year with a sales rate of $1.5 million a year. Eventually, I will need to do something.", "I went through a similar sustained sales slump in the 2nd quarter of 2012. When it started, I was convinced that my problem was caused by uncertainty in the economy. Eventually I came to believe that a change I had made to my Google AdWords campaign was the culprit. I ended up rejiggering that campaign\u2019s structure and also initiated a complete overhaul of my sales process. The problem went away.", "Which brings me back to where I started. Am I seeing a normal variation? If we don\u2019t have good numbers in March, I would say something is wrong. So did I mess something up? I can\u2019t, at the moment, figure out what I have done, but my capacity for error is large and well honed by years of practice. Or is this just a temporary thing that isn\u2019t my fault?

Another conference consensus: users will need to seek information less. Instead, phones will know what you want without asking you.

For students whose schooling might not give them the access to solid instruction and a meaningful education on those basics, the College Board, which administers the SAT, will form a partnership with the educational website Khan Academy to offer free online courses designed to help students to learn and prepare in the areas the test examines.", "The changes are sweeping and the intent, largely attributed to David Coleman, president of the College Board, is no less broad. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake, he often makes clear,\u201d writes Todd Balf in The Story Behind the SAT Overhaul, \u201cis not just the fairness and usefulness of an exam but our nation\u2019s ability to deliver opportunity for all, which, really, is about the soul of the country.\u201d", "That\u2019s a whole lot riding on one test.", "Of course, there has long been a whole lot riding on that one test, whether you look at it from a national or an individual perspective. Although more students took the ACT than the SAT in 2012, the SAT remains the lightning rod, possibly because, historically, the ACT was used more in the Midwest, while the SAT was required by more prestigious schools on the East and West coasts. Those perceptions are outdated but linger and give even more weight to the changes (and I write this as a former student from the Midwest, whose college required neither test of in-state applicants).", "We place a strange importance on the SAT, one surely welcomed by the Educational Testing Service, which develops the SAT and which, while a nonprofit, nonetheless competes for market share with the ACT and relies on our national enthusiasm for standardized testing for its continued existence. At least in its current iteration, the SAT\u2019s results are of little apparent use to colleges reviewing applying students; recent research on colleges that made supplying SAT or ACT scores optional (described in the New York Times Magazine) found that \u201cstudents with good high-school grades did well in college, even if they had weak SAT scores. But students with weaker high-school grades \u2014 even with strong SATs \u2014 did less well in college.\u201d", "If the new SAT succeeds in measuring what students actually learn in the classroom, scores and grades might be more closely aligned, but that still leaves open the question of what the test adds to the process. The SAT looks to gain additional relevance as a talent-finder, helping universities seek out high-achieving, low-income students who might not apply to selective schools. In the process, it will help to cement the Common Core standards, which Mr. Coleman was integral in developing into the public education system as the path to college. (As will the ACT, which some states use as a test for high school performance.)", "For a nation that has long resisted a nationalized education system, the result of this alliance among the College Board, colleges and curriculum is a convoluted, sideways approach to exactly that: a structure that teaches students a curriculum, tests them on their success, and funnels them into varied forms of higher education based on that success or the specific areas of that success. The most laudable part of the enterprise, the use of the SAT (and, not incidentally, the ACT) to identify low-income, high-achieving students and encourage them to apply to selective schools, depends on our collective buy-in to the premise that these tests do measure something. If we aren\u2019t willing to pay individually for some students to be measured, and thus collectively for the measuring of those who cannot afford to pay, there won\u2019t be enough measurements \u2014 of whatever is being measured \u2014 to compare. It\u2019s partly private, partly public and altogether a reflection of our national character: We don\u2019t want to limit opportunity to those who can pay for it, but we don\u2019t want to limit the opportunities of those who can pay for them, either.", "Like the intent of the Common Core curriculum, which was designed to raise performance expectations for all students and ensure a more cohesive educational experience across classes and classrooms, the intent of the new SAT is laudable, but like the Common Core curriculum, it\u2019s also riddled through with hidden motivations and paths to unintended consequences. As a parent, I welcome any effort to put an end to the all-test-prep, all-the-time, marathon that the junior year of high school seems to have become for affluent students, and I welcome, too, anything that might push us away from magnifying the edge that those affluent students already have on college admissions. But that shouldn\u2019t distract our attention from the College Board\u2019s primary goal: to encourage those students \u2014 the same ones whose high school grades are more predictive of college success than their SAT scores \u2014 to keep shelling out their money and taking the test.", "Follow KJ Dell\u2019Antonia on Twitter at @KJDellAntonia or find her on Facebook and Google+."], "https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/does-texting-at-a-stop-sign-count/": ["Most drivers, teenage and adult, have received the message loud and clear: Don\u2019t text and drive.", "Got it.

During the games, 8 percent of the Finnish population, or around 420,000 viewers, downloaded the broadcaster\u2019s mobile application to watch live sports on their smartphones and tablets.", "While YLE\u2019s on-demand and streaming services have yet to put significant strain on Finland\u2019s data networks, Lauri Kivinen, the broadcaster\u2019s chief executive, worries that carriers will eventually give priority to content providers willing to pay for premium access to broadband networks.", "\u201cThe tollkeeper shouldn\u2019t be able to define what content is available,\u201d Mr. Kivinen said.", "Others worry that the European legislation would allow telecom companies to discriminate against services like Internet messaging and video streaming that compete with the carriers\u2019 own offerings.", "A few years ago Dutch lawmakers opposed efforts by the country\u2019s big telecom company KPN and the local units of Vodafone and T-Mobile to block, or charge extra for, Internet communication services like Skype and WhatsApp. In response, in 2011 the Netherlands became the first European country to enshrine the concept of net neutrality into national law.", "And a German court overturned efforts by Deutsche Telekom last year to reduce the speed of consumers\u2019 Internet services after they reached certain download limits. The company\u2019s opponents, noting that the limits did not apply to Deutsche Telekom\u2019s own online content, argued that the approach would have given the carrier an advantage over other Internet companies looking to offer rival online services like video on demand.", "Even as such arguments continue to be made during the debate over the European Parliament\u2019s legislation, some carriers and content providers are hashing out their own deals.", "To woo prospective customers as Vodafone did with Mr. Herbert, many of Europe\u2019s telecom companies are starting to forge agreements with Spotify, Facebook and other content providers to give consumers unlimited access to the services as part of their monthly contracts.", "Such arrangements enable carriers to distinguish themselves from their rivals. And for content providers, particularly small start-ups in search of customers, a packaging deal with one of Europe\u2019s telecom giants could be crucial to staying in business.", "\u201cInterest is high for partnerships,\u201d said Mattias Hjelmstedt, founder of Magine, a Swedish online TV start-up that is working on deals with a number of European mobile and Internet service providers. \u201cInstead of making it a war, make it about working together.\u201d"]}

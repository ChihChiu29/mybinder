This is because inequality erodes two foundation stones of modern society \u2014 openness to new ideas and opportunities, and a conviction that all citizens are morally equal.", "For the first three decades after World War II, openness and equality constituted a virtuous circle. Openness generated unprecedented levels of prosperity. That prosperity allowed America and the citizens of other modern nations to invest in excellent schools and universities, basic research, modern infrastructure and social insurance. These investments, in turn, made it easier for people to adapt to change, and fostered ever greater equalities of income and opportunity. The result was a high level of trust in the fairness of the political and economic system.", "But by the 1980s, the virtuous circle had stopped working. Economic and technological dynamism was upending jobs, convulsing communities and splintering families. At the same time, inequalities of earnings, wealth and job security were widening. After the financial crisis of 2008, many Americans, along with the citizens of other nations affected by the crisis, began to doubt the fairness of the system. Some came to feel neglected, disadvantaged, powerless or otherwise left behind. Within the decade they became easy fodder for demagogues who rejected openness and blamed \u201cothers\u201d \u2014 immigrants, foreign manufacturers, the news media, racial or ethnic or religious minorities \u2014 for what had happened to them.", "Enter Donald Trump, who promised to \u201cmake America great again\u201d by erecting walls, slowing immigration, withdrawing from free-trade agreements, cutting science budgets, attacking the free press and retreating from security alliances the United States has maintained since 1945. Meanwhile, Britain has pulled out of Europe. Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s National Front, has been mounting a challenge to the French establishment. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and others of his ilk are emulating closed-society dictatorships. The result is likely to be less prosperity and widening inequality. The old virtuous circle is in danger of becoming a new vicious cycle.", "Two important new books offer useful and complementary explanations for what has occurred and, by implication, what must be done. In \u201cThe Fate of the West,\u201d Bill Emmott argues that the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath resulted from \u201ca devastating blend of complacency, negligence and corruption\u201d in the years leading up to it. The banks that created the calamity got bailed out and no top executive went to jail, but millions of people lost their jobs, savings and homes. Nearly a decade later, many citizens in the United States, Britain, France, Italy and elsewhere still feel trapped in dead-end jobs or don\u2019t have jobs at all. The result has been a profound loss of confidence in the system.", "Emmott, who was editor in chief of The Economist from 1993 to 2006, faults economic and political elites who chose to advance themselves at the expense of the larger society. He points to a paradox deep within modern capitalism: The same financial incentives that spur innovation and investment can also lead the captains of industry and finance to manipulate the rules of the game for their own benefit, and thereby harm those without power. These moneyed elites \u201care the true sources of the sense of inequality that is currently threatening the openness that has enabled us in the West to flourish,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey are the explanation for Trump, for Brexit, for Le Pen.\u201d", "Emmott argues that the financial interests of banks and big companies have distorted and disarmed public policy. Both of America\u2019s political parties are culpable. \u201cMost notorious, in the U.S. at least, was the successful lobbying in 1998 by Wall Street of the treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, and his deputy, Larry Summers, to block regulation of the trading of complex derivatives products which had been proposed by the then head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Brooksley Born.\u201d Emmott also criticizes big companies like Google, which have the lobbying and financial heft to get whatever they want in Washington. Campaign finance scandals have likewise revealed the political influence of money in Germany, Japan, France, Britain and elsewhere.", "The greatest source of unfairness stemming from the 2008 crash, according to Emmott, was the political and civic inequality it revealed. He believes that to preserve an open society we really do need, as Trump has said, to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d Getting big money out of politics would enable us, for example, to combat the rigidities and high prices of monopolies through strong antitrust enforcement, and to remove the exorbitant privileges that allow big banks to make profits at the expense of the rest of society. But to do this we will need a new, or at least restored, vision of equality, based not on redistribution or socialism but on equality of voice and rights, so citizens can demand such reforms.", "Emmott sees political and civic equality as the means to an open society. But why shouldn\u2019t such equality be an end in itself? In \u201cOne Another\u2019s Equals: The Basis of Human Equality,\u201d Jeremy Waldron, a professor of philosophy at New York University School of Law, argues that Western thought has been rooted in the moral imperative that people be treated and respected as equals, whatever disparities may exist between them in wealth or talent. Waldron sees moral equality between human beings as what\u2019s left over when \u201cmerit\u201d is set aside. People deserve equal concern and respect because they are humans. Differences in wealth and power are consistent with this imperative if those differences serve the interests of all. Thus the answer to whose good is to be promoted in our social arrangements is \u2014 everyone\u2019s good.", "Waldron warns that wide inequalities of income and wealth can erode this moral imperative because they make it harder to make the mental leap it requires: The poor may come to seem so different from the privileged and prosperous that the well-off cannot understand a moral principle that assigns equal value to the living of a human life as such. \u201cWe might become so accustomed to economic inequality, so inured to the spectacle of it despite its being unjustified, that we cease to recognize those who are deprived as nevertheless our equals,\u201d he writes, clearly alluding to modern Western society. \u201cIt may even be morally embarrassing for us to recognize them as such,\u201d he argues, \u201csince we would then have to acknowledge the injustice. Better perhaps to turn away, or to try what it feels like to deny or suppress the proposition that poor people too are entitled to equal concern.\u201d", "Waldron urges the same sort of political equality as does Emmott, but he gets there from the opposite direction. For him, the purpose of political equality is not to preserve an open society. It is to honor basic human equality. \u201cIt is because we are one another\u2019s equals that we ought to have concern about high levels of economic inequality,\u201d he writes.", "Viewed from either Emmott\u2019s or Waldron\u2019s point of departure \u2014 the necessity of preserving an open society or of respecting the moral equality of human beings \u2014 the surge toward widening inequality is endangering the West. The culprit is not economic inequality per se. It is the political inequality that economic inequality can spawn. How will the vicious cycle we are now experiencing come to an end? These two insightful books suggest that if we don\u2019t recommit ourselves to political equality, we will become ever more closed, authoritarian societies. Economic elites should understand this. As Emmott notes, without openness, the West cannot thrive. But without equality, the West cannot last."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/world/americas/mexico-h2b-visas-tlapacoyan-carnivals.html": ["TLAPACOYAN, Mexico \u2014 Francisco Trujillo heads north each summer to do a job that few Americans want: a four-month stint operating carnival rides, mopping up vomit and sleeping in a cramped trailer with other workers.", "His annual journey to the United States was a routine shared by many in the shabby city of Tlapacoyan, about 190 miles east of Mexico City in the hills of Veracruz state, which supplies two-thirds or more of the 7,000 foreign workers hired by America\u2019s amusement sector each year.", "This year, however, Mr. Trujillo, 32, is not selling tickets for the Super Shot vertical drop or doling out funnel cakes. Caught in a debate over how many visas the United States government should issue to seasonal workers, he is among thousands of Mexicans who are stuck at home, unable to get permission to work across the border.", "\u201cThey say we are taking jobs from the Americans,\u201d said Mr. Trujillo, who has worked the last four carnival seasons in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Carnival work is \u201creally hard,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d", "As American politicians and business owners wrangle over the limits on the number of H-2B visas for unskilled, nonagricultural workers, Tlapacoyan (pronounced tla-pa-COY-an), with about 60,000 residents in the town and surrounding area, offers a glimpse of how the impasse has stung in Mexico. Last year, Mexicans received more than 70 percent of the approximately 84,000 H-2B visas issued by the United States to migrant workers worldwide.", "The lack of visas has denied hundreds of families in the city an annual income that saves them from living hand-to-mouth and deepened the problems of a town struggling, like much of the state, with high crime rates. Of an estimated 4,600 to 6,000 residents who normally work the carnival season according to city officials and recruiters, about a third have been left behind.", "Instead, they are selling tacos and driving taxis, or working for just over $1 an hour in the tangerine and banana fields that surround the town. Some use Google Translate and WhatsApp to check their visa status with their former American employers.", "Mr. Trujillo is working as a driver for a construction crew, earning about $85 a week, less than a quarter of his carnival salary.", "He used savings from his time in the United States to buy a plot of land and build a one-bedroom house, even splurging on a $350 stroller for his son, now 22 months old. This year, however, \u201cthere will be no proper Christmas, no presents, no turkey,\u201d Mr. Trujillo said. He abandoned plans to take his son to a safari park in nearby Puebla state for his birthday. \u201cI can barely make it day to day.\u201d", "Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a, 34, who has spent two seasons with an Ohio-based amusement company but has not received a visa this year, said he had put off plans to buy a couch and a washing machine for his mother.", "From the United States, Mr. Pe\u00f1a sent home as much as $300 a week from his take-home pay of about $345, eating fried chicken or cooking eggs with chili and tomato to save money. He tore down the wooden shack where he lives with his parents on the edge of Tlapacoyan and built cinder block walls. He also paid for his father\u2019s treatment for typhoid.", "As wrenching as it was to work far from his family, he said, managing without extra income was worse. \u201cThere is this anxiety that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d he said.", "The visa problems began in March when the summer allotment of H-2Bs ran out, leaving some American businesses scrambling for people to clean hotel rooms, run Ferris wheels and fish for shrimp. Demand for visas was high, said recruiters and experts, and Congress did not renew a provision that had excluded returning H-2B workers from counting against the total quota of 66,000 visas, which is split evenly between summer and winter.", "Lawmakers in May then granted the government authority to more or less double the cap on this year\u2019s quota to save \u201cAmerican business from irreparable harm,\u201d and the White House on July 17 authorized an increase of 15,000 visas, bringing the total number available close to the number issued last year.", "But business owners who have been waiting to bring seasonal workers said the requirements to apply for visas were onerous and that the extra visas were too few, too late.", "Deborah Murray, one of the owners of Murray Brothers, a carnival company based in Cincinnati, said she had scaled back this year because she could not muster 30 reliable workers. She applied months ago for 12 visas for Mexican workers; she received four last week.", "\u201cYou can never really recover,\u201d said Ms. Murray, who spoke by telephone from a Cincinnati church festival where she said she was running five rides instead of the usual 10. \u201cI\u2019ve been working since April and I\u2019m a week from August,\u201d she said. \u201cThe season is gone.\u201d", "Critics of the current H-2B system said statistics did not support claims that American labor was scarce in sectors that use a lot of the visas, like landscaping, and that employers could fill the jobs with American workers if they paid more or recruited from outside their area.", "The visa program also ties foreign workers to one employer, making them susceptible to exploitation, according to Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Some recruiters demand payment, a practice banned in the United States, which saddles workers with debt and may make them more acquiescent.", "Rather than having employers determine how many foreign workers they need, the government could set up an independent body to identify labor shortages and allocate visas, Mr. Costa said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s only fair to set the system in a way that they are not exploited,\u201d he said, referring to migrant workers. \u201cOtherwise employers will try to keep wages down.\u201d", "Most carnival workers in Tlapacoyan are hired through a pipeline run by James Judkins, a former circus performer and president of the JKJ Workforce agency, based in Harlingen, Tex., and his representative in Mexico, Victor Apolinar Barrios.", "Residents recruited at the office of Mr. Apolinar \u2014 who is currently mayor of Tlapacoyan \u2014 said they believed he had made a fortune charging workers fees to secure jobs. None would agree to be quoted, saying they were afraid of spoiling their chances of getting work in the future.", "Separately, labor advocates won tens of thousands of dollars in 2015 for workers after filing a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against a union linked to Mr. Judkins, whose sister, Deborah Judkins, was its administrator. The complaint argued that the union, the Association of Mobile Entertainment Workers, was a sham organization that undermined workers by agreeing to weekly rather than hourly rates.", "Arthur N. Read, general counsel of Friends of Farmworkers based in Philadelphia, who filed the complaint, said the settlement covered fees paid by workers to the union; a second settlement to cover backpay to workers is pending and could be far larger, he said.", "Mr. Apolinar did not respond to several calls seeking comment, and aides said he was absent when journalists visited the mayor\u2019s office, despite indications that he was present. Mr. Judkins said that his organization was very careful to follow the law and make sure no worker was charged illegal fees.", "Despite accusations of underhanded or illegal practices by employers, several carnival workers who were waiting for visas this month said they enjoyed the carnival circuit.", "Yes, there were days that stretched into the wee hours, patrons who vomited on the Zipper (a ride that involves being spun upside down in cages) and the occasional racist outburst from a parent whose child was not tall enough to board a ride. But there was also the chance to learn English, pick up some trendy, hand-me-down sneakers and leave the violence of Mexico behind.", "Eduardo Torres, 25, who has worked two seasons for Murray Brothers in fairs across Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio, said he had never imagined traveling by airplane or visiting big cities. He marveled at what he called the \u201ccool stuff\u201d everywhere and picked up all sorts of used clothing. \u201cIt was a dream come true,\u201d he said.", "For Mr. Trujillo, whose favorite job was serving lemonade and hamburgers and learning English in the process \u2014 \u201clike a little school\u201d \u2014 the carnival became a window onto a more promising existence.", "In the United States, said Mr. Trujillo, \u201cif you dream about 15 things, you can buy five.\u201d", "In Tlapacoyan, he said, you dream, too.

To set it up, request an invitation to the program on Google\u2019s webpage and wait for an email with a link to install the software. The app is available for both iPhones and Android devices.", "Inside the app, you can create Google accounts for your children, sharing information like their names and birth dates.

You can also approve or reject apps that a child is trying to download \u2014 so if you\u2019re reluctant about Snapchat or an addictive game like Boom Beach, simply block the apps. Parents can also get a weekly report to see how often a child is using a certain app, like a game, and choose to have a conversation with the child about using the software responsibly, or block the app temporarily.", "Parents can also use Family Link to create restrictions for how children browse the web. You can turn on a filter that blocks mature websites, though Google acknowledges the filter is imperfect and some offensive sites may get past it. For a more nitpicky approach, you can also require the child to get permission for each site visited, blocking the ones you disapprove of.", "Parents will probably love a feature called screen time, which can be used to set limits for how long a child can use a phone each day. For instance, you could give the child three hours of screen time on weekdays. You can also schedule regular bedtime hours that lock down the device at specific times \u2014 between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., for example.

That complies with a federal regulation in the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which forbids companies from collecting data from children under 13 without a parent\u2019s approval.", "Yet I would argue that Google should design a policy with parents\u2019 best interests in mind. It could let the parent decide when the child has demonstrated safe, responsible smartphone use and graduate from all restrictions. That might happen when the child turns 13, 15 or even 17. But the children should not be allowed to strip away settings just because they turn 13.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand why a parent would give a kid a phone and then turn off all the features through the app and then grant them all the features once they turn 13,\u201d said Ms. Knorr of Common Sense Media.

Like a lot of small internet companies, Yelp lives in a world where one company, Google, accounts for an outsize share of its business, and could destroy it at any time.

The results have information like hours, stars and customer reviews. Below that are links to reviews, articles and other sites. Like Yelp.", "Yelp\u2019s contention is that by putting its own results at the top, Google is giving itself an unfair advantage, because those results don\u2019t have to jump through the same algorithmic hoops non-Google sites are subjected to. And since Yelp says few people go beyond the first or second result, companies like Yelp are made invisible.", "Google disagrees. The company declined to comment beyond its official statement on the European fine, but it has repeatedly said that as smartphones displace desktop computers as the internet gateway, people just want the answer to their question \u2014 not a link to a site where they might have to repeat the query \u2014 and that Google\u2019s results oblige.", "Local queries \u2014 such as looking for nearby restaurants \u2014 account for roughly a third of all search traffic.

Yelp has denied those claims.", "This dispute would be moot if people were in the habit of using a variety of search engines. Google has become so universally known and depended upon that it is sometimes hard to remember that it is a company, and it exists to make money.", "But as Microsoft learned in its 1990s antitrust battle, companies can face a heap of legal problems when their platform becomes so popular that people hardly use anything else.

Worried that Google wanted to create a parallel service that would snuff out his company, Mr. Stoppelman declined to renew the license.", "Two years later, Google offered to buy Yelp for $550 million. One concern analysts raised about the proposed deal was that if Google owned Yelp, it might steer users toward Yelp instead of its organic search results \u2014 that is, the kind of steering Yelp says Google is now doing for its own benefit. The deal fell apart, however, and Google focused instead on building its own offering.", "By 2011, Google was facing inquiries by various federal and state authorities along with regulators in Europe and Asia. It had steadily added services focused on areas like local businesses, comparison shopping and travel, and companies were complaining that it was giving its own properties preferred treatment in results.", "That year, Mr. Stoppelman got worried about something else. Google, he said, was taking Yelp\u2019s reviews and using them in Google products that competed with Yelp. When he raised these concerns, he said, Google responded that it was displaying information derived from search results, and that if Yelp objected, it could simply withhold its content from the search engine.", "Given Google\u2019s market share, the response amounted to saying \u201ctake yourself off the internet,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cThat would have destroyed the company, so it was a false choice.\u201d", "Yelp took its first step into the regulatory arena that July, when Vince Sollitto, the company\u2019s senior vice president for communications and government relations, accused Google of stealing Yelp content at a conference of state attorneys general.", "The next day, according to Mr. Stoppelman, a Google executive sent him an email saying it would stop. A Google spokesman said the decision had been made long before, and was unrelated to the prosecutors\u2019 gathering. Nonetheless, Yelp concluded that there was no better way to get Google\u2019s attention than to raise the specter of regulation.", "\u201cThe pattern was that they would do something pushing the envelope or, frankly, evil, and we would complain about it privately, and they would say they would fix it, and nothing would happen,\u201d Mr. Stoppelman said. \u201cWe realized that if we were going to get what we wanted, we had to be very scrappy.\u201d", "Mr. Stoppelman appeared before a Senate panel to complain about Google\u2019s behavior. Yelp elevated Mr. Lowe to the new position of director of government affairs, a job that more or less entails flying around the world trying to sic antitrust regulators on Google. Over the next few years, Yelp hired its first lobbyist and started a political action committee. Recently, it has started filing complaints in Brazil.", "For a moment, it seemed as if Google risked major regulatory action. It was under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, and in Europe. But in early 2013, the F.T.C. decided it would not pursue a case. It later came out that an internal report had recommended stronger action, but Yelp and other companies had turned their focus back to Europe.", "\u201cI thought, this is a chance to totally refine our strategy,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.", "Mr. Lowe is from Arkansas and speaks with a slight drawl. He is passionate and garrulous and has a habit of sometimes tattooing his audience with a mix of detailed history and arcane policy points about Yelp\u2019s problems with Google. He is crushed if listeners don\u2019t find it to be as big a deal as he does.", "He said he learned some hard lessons when the F.T.C. closed its Google investigation. The first was that antitrust law is boring, complicated and political. The second was that technology is difficult to explain, even to regulators.", "Mr. Sollitto, who made the presentation at the prosecutors\u2019 meeting, said that during the trade commission\u2019s case, he had found himself making imperfect analogies, such as the one that Google was the only store in town and put all of its own products on the best shelves. Not an unusual thing for a merchant to do, he concedes, except that Google puts competitors\u2019 products on shelves that are out of reach.", "\u201cWe were having a difficult time explaining to the F.T.C. why consumers were harmed,\u201d he said.", "In March 2013, Mr. Lowe asked Yelp engineers if they could build an online simulator showing what Google would look like if its own services had to live by the algorithm dictating the position of third-party services, like Yelp.", "\u201cThey need something they can touch and experience,\u201d he wrote in an email.", "During a company hackathon, engineers created software that produced pages of search results ranked purely by an algorithm and compared them with Google\u2019s presentation. Their conclusion, which Google disputes, is that Google was providing its users with less useful information by steering them to its own products instead of results from around the web.", "That month, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, then the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief, announced he was discussing a possible settlement with Google, and asked interested parties for comments. In addition to the legal documents it had sent to the F.T.C., Yelp submitted a white paper that it said showed users preferred outside companies\u2019 results over Google\u2019s in-house products.", "This was based on the software Yelp had started developing at the hackathon, and Mr. Lowe flew to Brussels to give a demonstration to regulators. That presentation later became the basis for a website called Focus on the User.", "\u201cYou can do PowerPoints all day long, but it\u2019s hard for people to understand until they can sit in the driver\u2019s seat and come up with their own searches and see the results for themselves,\u201d Mr. Lowe said.", "By early 2014, it looked as though Europe\u2019s investigation was over as well. Mr. Almunia announced a settlement within which Google would escape a fine and a finding of wrongdoing but would agree to increase its rivals\u2019 visibility in search results. The deal fell apart when French and German officials argued that it did too little, and American companies, including Yelp, submitted studies showing scant gains for Google\u2019s competitors.", "When Mr. Almunia\u2019s term ended without a settlement, and Ms. Vestager became Europe\u2019s new head of competition, Yelp went into a full-on political campaign. Mr. Lowe started building a small European government-relations operation, which he staffed with employees from companies and consumer groups that were also pursuing complaints about Google.", "In April 2015, Ms. Vestager filed formal antitrust charges against Google, saying it had abused its market dominance by systematically favoring its own comparison shopping service over those of its rivals. In addition to a reputation for toughness, Ms. Vestager is known for knitting during meetings. Shortly after the charges were filed, one of her works, an elephant, was featured in a charity auction.", "Mr. Lowe bid for it online, and ended up spending $3,000. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I had to have it,\u201d he said.", "The European Union\u2019s various cases against Google are likely to drag on for years, and it\u2019s not clear when local search issues will become a priority.

Consider the numbers: China\u2019s 1.4 billion people, many of whom are just now getting access to smartphones and the internet, present a major commercial opportunity for the digital sector. Twitter, Google and Facebook together have billions of daily active users, and a hypothetical expansion into China could bring hundreds of millions more users to those platforms, raising their market values by many billions of dollars.

First, localization is a tremendously expensive exercise for companies that deal in data, so much so that only the world\u2019s richest firms can afford it. Second, a history of snooping by Chinese entities means not only that firms should be wary of the potential for industrial espionage, but also that the Chinese people should be worried about their right to privacy, because the Chinese government may now be able to gain access to their data whenever it desires. This is especially true because China has pronounced that if firms wish to transmit data out of China \u2014 for example, to other people, governments or overseas data headquarters \u2014 the transmittal must clear a security review by Chinese authorities, directly implicating individual privacy and free speech.", "China may hope to replace its flailing manufacturing-based economy with one focused more on technology services to bring jobs and business to the nation\u2019s many struggling metropolises, but this is not the way to do it. First, as colossal as they may be, data centers rarely result in as many new jobs as locals might expect. But perhaps even more critically, this kind of digital protectionism is unfair to the international community and to the people of China. The government\u2019s argument that the regulation will protect privacy is invalid. In the world of privacy, there are two threats: corporations and government.

Over the course of several decades, 300,000 to 700,000 female fetuses were selectively aborted in India each year. Today there are about 50 million more men than women in the country. While selective abortion of female fetuses accounts for most of the excess of men, another reason for the disparity in the population is that some people are believed to kill female infants, and some girls die because of medical or nutritional neglect. This oversupply of men is harming women and girls.", "Starting in the 1980s, the desire of some parents to have a son and at the same time have fewer children than past generations met with the widespread availability of ultrasound machines. Sonograms were used to detect the future sex of fetuses, and many women aborted fetuses that were predicted to be female.", "Despite the increasing role of women in the work force, the old idea that a son will be the breadwinner and will support parents in old age remains powerful. Although it is illegal, many parents are still forced to pay a dowry to marry their daughters. And Hindu tradition requires a son to perform certain funeral rituals for his parents.", "Despite a law adopted in 1994 that prohibits medical professionals from revealing the future sex of a fetus to a pregnant woman, people can readily obtain this information from illegal operators of ultrasound machines. The effectiveness of enforcement efforts against illegal sex-selection tests varies across the states.", "Abortion is legal in India and fairly easy to get for those who can afford it. Since ultrasound is the most common method of detecting the sex of a fetus, most abortions are surgical procedures as the pregnancy is too advanced to terminate using pills.", "Sex-selection and abortions are more common among urban, middle-class and educated people since they have more money and access to illegal providers and abortions. The prevalence of the practice varies across the country. In the southern state of Kerala, the ratio of women to men is normal, but in the northern state of Haryana there is a large male surplus. The scale of sex selection is so enormous that one demographer estimates that if current levels of sex selection persist, nearly 10 percent of Indian men will be single at age 50 in 30 years.", "Scholars have long suggested that surpluses of men in China and India will destabilize society and increase violence. Sociologists examining the results of nationally representative surveys of tens of thousands of households in India found that in communities with greater male surpluses, there was more rape, child marriage of girls, domestic violence and greater perceptions of sexual harassment.", "Although there is a statistically significant correlation between the male surplus and increase in rape of women and girls, the early marriage of girls and violence by husbands against wives, there is no certainty about its cause, as other reasons for increased violence against women cannot be ruled out.", "Popular perceptions that attribute the causes of sex selection to general \u201cson preference\u201d and \u201cdaughter aversion\u201d are not entirely accurate. Prabhat Jha, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, and his co-authors found that Indian parents who intervene typically do so at their second and third births after they have had one or two girls. After parents have one male child, they again leave to chance the sex of their next child. This suggests that most couples who are sex selecting want at least one boy and are willing to have girls.", "Some parents may desire to have female children but do not act on that preference. The Indian government could allow those parents to conceive a girl. One way to do this is by sperm sorting, a process whereby X chromosome-bearing and Y chromosome-bearing sperm are sorted.", "Thereafter, only the sperm that will form an embryo of the desired sex are artificially inseminated into the uterus. But Indian law currently prohibits sex selection using sperm sorting and in vitro fertilization even for parents who want to conceive a girl. The law should be amended to allow for pre-implantation sex selection in favor of girls.", "Current solutions to the sex-selection problem are largely failing. The surplus of male children increased from the 2001 to the 2011 Indian census. Many blame the government for failing to catch and prosecute illegal ultrasound providers. Frustrated with government inaction, some civil society groups have started guerrilla campaigns in which pregnant women seek out the sex of their fetuses, after which they report ultrasound operators that provide that information.", "Even if greater enforcement efforts are made, it is likely impossible to completely eliminate the black market for fetal sex detection. Ultrasound machines are used in routine maternal care, and it is very hard to detect acts that take place secretively. New methods of sex detection are also available on the global market \u2014 a blood test at seven weeks of gestation can now reliably predict the future sex of a child. Advertisements for sex detection tests are popping up on the internet, and the Indian Supreme Court recently ordered Google and other search engines to do more to censor them.", "Some authorities and N.G.O.s monitor the movement of pregnant women who have female children to ensure that they do not obtain abortions. In other cases, without any concrete evidence, some families are publicly shamed by what are known as \u201cmourning ceremonies\u201d if women in their family are suspected of having an abortion. It is poor women who are the targets of those problematic policies.", "Some local governments give cash payments to women when they give birth to daughters. This strategy is aimed at discouraging women from aborting female fetuses. The Indian government should go even further and encourage people to conceive girls. Certainly any cash payment scheme would change the behavior of only poor people.", "But if sperm sorting, which is 93 percent effective in conceiving girls, were made available to any woman who wanted to select in favor of a girl, we might see both poor and middle-class people conceiving girls, in that way helping to equalize the male surplus. The challenge will be to properly enforce it. While sex selection can also be accomplished through in vitro fertilization, it is a much more expensive and invasive method than sperm sorting.", "Most countries, including India, have a long way to go before women achieve equality.

I scanned the rock formations with my binoculars and then scrambled over some boulders and descended into a wash that was once a river. I guessed that only a handful of people in the world even know about the goats \u2014 they are that obscure. In the wash, I noticed the fine gravel was disturbed by a large animal. There were no droppings of wild burros, so that ruled them out. The only other large animals would be bighorn sheep, mountain lions or mule deer, but they would not compress the gravel in such an irregular pattern.", "The only thing that could have made that sign was humans. I squatted down and looked closer. There were heavy steps each way. They could have been made two days ago or two years ago. Such imprints in the desert do not go away easily. I tracked the disturbed gravel up the wash, and off in the distance was a rock wall stained the color of rust and blood. I had found the site of the rock art known as 21 Goats.", "Earlier in the afternoon, I had written in my notebook, \u201cGold Butte is beautiful but not breathtaking.\u201d I was thinking about how it compares with other great destinations of the American West such as the Grand Canyon, the Badlands or Devils Tower. Gold Butte National Monument is inhospitable desert country with some small, plain-looking mountains and buttes. It certainly has some wondrous rock formations and a rugged beauty and remote emptiness that I admire, but I did not initially think it would ever, as I wrote, take my breath away. I was wrong.", "When I spotted the goats, I made a sound that was a cross between a gasp and a hiccup. Although the site is called 21 Goats, the petroglyphs are commonly interpreted to be desert bighorn sheep, the monarch of the Mojave Desert. The bighorn is considered one of the greatest trophies among modern hunters. Among the sheep were snakey lines and bull\u2019s-eye circles.", "This collection of petroglyphs is one of the reasons Gold Butte is one of America\u2019s newest national monuments. It was designated by President Barack Obama during his last days in office using the Antiquities Act, which gives presidents the authority to create national monuments. The Gold Butte proclamation protected 296,937 acres of land. However, some people think that is too much, and that caught the attention of the Trump administration. In April, President Trump issued an executive order calling for a review of 27 monuments. He asked Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to lead the review and make recommendations to possibly rescind the monument status, reduce the acreage or let it stand. Presidents have amended national monuments, but none have ever delisted one.", "Of the monuments to be reviewed, Gold Butte may be the least known. Even Google Maps hasn\u2019t recognized its borders as a national monument yet. On the interactive map, the area of Gold Butte remains white while all the surrounding lands that have some sort of protected status are demarked in public-place green.", "While preparing for the trip, I asked around in the nearby town of Mesquite if there were any official maps for the Gold Butte area. Something that showed the topography, back roads and way points. All the answers were negative with one guy saying I should try to find \u201cone of them old B.L.M. maps,\u201d referring to the Bureau of Land Management, which manages the monument. I made do by cobbling together a sheaf of maps of varied detail that I printed off the internet. As I would later learn, there are designated routes for off-road vehicles and a main road, Gold Butte Road, which is designated as a National Backcountry Byway by the B.L.M., but as for hiking, you have to figure that out as you go along.", "I stopped at the library in Mesquite and asked if they had anything on Gold Butte. The helpful librarian guided me to a shelf of books on Nevada history, but none of them mentioned Gold Butte in their indexes. However, from behind the desk she did find a book from a local author. She handed me a 1992 copy of \u201cCrazy Ed\u2019s Sagas and Secrets of Desert Gold\u201d by the late Eddie Bounsall.", "Mr. Bounsall, a prospector and maker of build-your-own-airplane kits, educates the reader about mining and minerals in the region but also covers a lot of ground on other subjects. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed in ghosts before but in the last 22 years living in the Gold Butte area we have had many very strange supernatural incidents happen with my family and to people who either worked for us of who were just visiting,\u201d Mr. Bounsall wrote before recounting some goosebumps-inducing events. In a chapter on U.F.O.s, he presents a sure-of-himself argument that the human-shaped petroglyphs found on the rocks are space people, and the local Native American tribes have been in touch with them for a long time. He also theorizes about how the early Spanish explorers left behind hidden treasure vaults of gold and silver in Gold Butte and the surrounding region. The Spaniards figured they could always get it later, so they left symbols etched to rock walls that indicated the secret way to the motherlode.", "Suddenly, Gold Butte National Monument got a lot more interesting.", "On the way to Gold Butte, I crossed the Virgin River. On the north side of the river were two flagpoles, each with an American flag flying. Atop one pole was some metalwork that said \u201cWe The,\u201d and the pole next to it was topped with \u201cPeople.\u201d Down below on a fence, a tattered banner hung limp.

His ranch is right down the road. Across the bridge and at the turn off for Gold Butte Road, there is a gravel pull-in with some Plexiglas-covered B.L.M. signs about respecting and enjoying the desert, packing out trash and encouraging drivers to stay on marked routes. The signs are peppered with bullet holes. This is a common affliction among signs in the Gold Butte area.", "Past the Bundy Ranch and some horse farms, the road goes into an expansive valley, and another sign appears, one so new that it hasn\u2019t been shot yet. It\u2019s the only official B.L.M. sign that I saw naming this place as a national monument. This is the jumping-off point. There is no ranger station, no information kiosk, no visitors\u2019 center, no restrooms, no water, no shelter. This is also where cellphone coverage peters out.", "After this sign, the valley widens and Joshua trees, which are primarily found in the Mojave Desert, appear. It\u2019s not a woody tree but more of a fibrous sponge that stores water. I inspected a dead one, and it had the feel of a crusty coconut husk.", "While driving along, a shiny gleam in the creosote bushes caught my eye. This, of course, must be some of that Spanish silver Crazy Eddie wrote about. I stopped the Jeep and got out. Time to get paid. About 150 yards off the road, I found it: a Mylar party balloon with the words, \u201cWay to Go Grad 2017.\u201d", "While pondering how man-made rubbish can still find its way far into no-man\u2019s land, a covey of Gambel\u2019s quail flushed off to my side. They are prized game birds among Western upland hunters. Gold Butte also holds chukar partridges, found in higher elevations. It is said that you first hunt chukars for fun, and the second time you hunt them for revenge because the cardiovascular workout is so brutal.", "Gold Butte was deemed worthy of monument designation for historical and cultural assets but also for environmental and conservation reasons. It is where the Great Basin, Mojave Desert and Colorado Plateau merge. The Joshua trees are a rare and iconic American treasure and Gold Butte has plenty of them, along with its cousin, the Mojave yucca. It holds multiple subspecies of cholla and prickly pear cactuses. All of the plants take a long time to grow. The barrel cactus that dot the hillsides can live to 130 years. Near 21 Goats, the Las Vegas bearpoppy is being restored. The plant grows only in Clark County, where all of Gold Butte is located, and cannot be transplanted. Near the Devil\u2019s Throat, a giant sinkhole over a hundred feet deep, grassland is being restored after wildfires in 2005.", "The desert was surprisingly full of life. Every time I hiked through the scrub, road runners, fence lizards, kangaroo rats and blacktail jackrabbits skittered under the creosote bushes. Up above, I spotted a golden eagle soaring on the drafts, and in the distance, I caught a glimpse of a prairie falcon diving at some doomed ground-dwelling creature.", "Gold Butte is a large, flat-topped hill, and the only settlement here went by the same name. Upon my arrival at the ghost town of Gold Butte, jackrabbits bolted from every direction. At one time, this spot had a post office, store, saloon and hotel. An estimated 2,000 miners lived here \u2014 mostly in tents \u2014 during its peak in 1908. They mined copper, gold, zinc, lead and magnesite. The boom died off in 1910.", "I hiked around and found mattress frames, tangles of rusty wire, an old oven, a sink, water tanks, an old stovetop range, a collapsed corral, metal drums, a couple of concrete pads and a large mining contraption. Most of these items had been used for target practice. There are two graves surrounded by a fence of metal piping.", "On the hillside, I found a mine. The entrance to the mine was fenced off, but there was no sign stating you can\u2019t go in there, so I climbed over the fence. When I illuminated the mine with my penlight, there was an odd-shaped rock. It slithered. Maybe a panamint rattlesnake or a Gila monster. I climbed back over the fence.", "Although the ghost town left me unimpressed, the highlight of the trip was another petroglyph site near 21 Goats. It was a grouping of sandstone formations; if you imagined for a moment, you could see how the early Native Americans of Gold Butte survived within this harsh landscape. The formations provided shelter and shade and even water by way of tinajas, which are smooth-sculpted holes that can hold water for a long time.", "Hidden in the cliffs is the image of a man falling. The Falling Man is a mystery. No one is sure what it means, much like similar images in the Cave of Swimmers in the Sahara. It stands completely alone from the other rock art and this is contrasted by a nearby boulder that is completely covered with petroglyphs. It\u2019s Newspaper Rock, one of many newspaper rocks that are scattered over the deserts in the American West. It\u2019s like an ancient storyboard, but good luck making any sense of it. There are human footprints, a tortoise, more bull\u2019s-eyes, more goats, squiggly lines and a rainbow. I sat in front of it and pondered the images until thirst set in and I had to hike back to the Jeep for water.", "I\u2019m sure Crazy Ed led a hell of a life chasing Spanish hoards and prospecting for gold, but the real treasures of Gold Butte aren\u2019t buried underground. They are often right in front your face. You just need to burn some boot leather, and then at the right spot, look up. There they are. They will take your breath away.", "How to Get There", "Fly into Las Vegas, rent a four-wheel drive vehicle and head toward Mesquite, Nev., approximately 90 minutes away. On Highway 15, take exit 112 and head south on Riverside Road. Once you cross the Virgin River, you are in Gold Butte country.", "Exploring", "Some road sections of Gold Butte can be handled by a 2WD vehicle, but a high-clearance 4X4 is the smartest and safest way to explore the rugged back roads. On the dirt roads, you will have an average speed of 10 to 15 miles per hour, and your teeth will still rattle. It is very slow going on some roads.", "Pack enough food and water to last for at least three days, along with standard emergency and survival gear. Bringing a can of gasoline is also wise. The possibility of a vehicle breakdown deep in the backcountry, with no cellphone signals and the extreme heat of the Mojave Desert, can make for a dangerous situation. During my explorations of Gold Butte, I saw only two other vehicles and not a single person. The possibility of nobody coming along to help you for a very long time is real.", "Mesquite is the best town to start or end an adventure in Gold Butte. Think of it as a miniature Las Vegas. It has a handful of affordable resorts, casinos, all-you-can-eat buffets and restaurants.

That was cheaper than most flights on major carriers, including British Airways, Air France, Delta and United, which for those dates were offering economy tickets around $700 to $800. Great. Yet in this particular case, while the Norwegian fare was cheap, it wasn\u2019t the absolute cheapest because of a promotion from yet another low-cost carrier.", "XL Airways, a French low-cost carrier, had a nonstop round-trip fare from John F.

A return to New York from London on Aug. 18 was $509.90, $40 less than the previous Friday.

This was the ultimate goal.

Bachelor Nation expects the show to end with a ring on a finger, not a dramatic finale where two beautiful people in formal wear plan to continue seeing each other and just \u2026 see where it goes. This week\u2019s show left Peter and Rachel at a tearful standstill, with Peter saying that believes an engagement is a serious commitment to be married (the commonly accepted definition) and that he wasn\u2019t ready to pull the trigger, with Rachel arguing that a proposal is less final and serious than actually tying the knot \u2014 and also that she really needed him to pop the question at the end of the show.", "One of the most captivating and disquieting aspects of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d lies in how a significant proportion of the drama that\u2019s stirred up doesn\u2019t occur between the various personalities on the show, but between the contestants and the artificial demands of the show itself. Maybe Peter and Rachel could make a lasting relationship work, if they didn\u2019t have to agree to get married eight weeks after meeting on TV.", "The same goes for Eric, whose sparse romantic history puts him at an even greater disadvantage in a rush-engagement plotline.

Aaaaaand maybe Rachel would be less charmed by Bryan\u2019s canned romantic lines if only she could watch him dispense them on that old UPN show.

The bill, known as the Highly Automated Vehicle Testing and Deployment Act of 2017, is the first major federal effort to regulate autonomous vehicles, and would give the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration broad oversight of the self-driving car industry. A full committee vote on the measure is expected next week, and the bill could go before the entire House this fall.", "The Senate is also playing catch-up.

California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles recently released a series of proposed rules, and the state is beginning to modify its roads to make them easier for the sensors in autonomous vehicles to analyze. Michigan passed a package of bills last year that made it easier for auto manufacturers to experiment with self-driving cars on public roads. And Florida passed a law that legalized truly self-driving cars, with no human operator behind the wheel.", "While engineers race to bring self-driving cars to market, Silicon Valley companies and Detroit automakers have been lobbying Congress for federal laws that would replace many of the existing state-by-state regulations and allow them to experiment more freely with new autonomous systems. Ford, Google, Uber, Lyft and Volvo have teamed up to form the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, an industry group that has pressed for a clear set of national standards.", "Regulating self-driving cars is a tricky balancing act. Crack down too hard, and you risk stalling the development of a potentially lifesaving technology. Go easy, and you risk letting unsafe vehicles onto public roads before they\u2019re adequately tested. There are cybersecurity risks to address, too, since autonomous vehicles will be connected wirelessly to the internet and could be susceptible to hacking. The House bill would require manufacturers of new autonomous systems to submit security plans for their self-driving cars, as well as meet basic safety standards.", "Many states have opted for a permissive stance on self-driving cars, hoping to land a piece of an emerging multibillion-dollar industry.

But experts have warned that the self-driving car revolution could usher in sweeping economic changes, including the displacement of millions of workers. Roughly 1.7 million Americans drive long-haul trucks for a living, and another 1.7 million people drive taxis, buses and other commercial vehicles. When autonomous vehicles render many of those jobs obsolete, politicians will have a much bigger set of problems to contend with.", "\u201cGovernments have largely focused on the legality of automated driving,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. \u201cThey should also pay attention to the broader challenges and opportunities of automated driving \u2014 what it means for our lives, our governments, our land use, our cities, our social services, our jobs and how we live.\u201d", "The politics of autonomous driving will almost certainly become messier as self-driving cars edge closer to widespread use. There will be safety and security worries, intra-industry squabbles and backlash from driver unions concerned about job loss.

The attendees have plenty to talk about, with oil prices now about $48 a barrel for Brent crude. OPEC compliance with the reductions is slipping. Ecuador, an OPEC member though a small producer, said this month that it would not meet the terms of the agreement and would raise output because it needed the revenue. Iraq is also producing well over its quota. The biggest issue is that rising production from Libya and Nigeria, both OPEC members that are exempt from the agreement, is offsetting much of the impact of the cuts. Stanley Reed", "ECONOMY", "Liam Fox, the British international trade secretary, will seek to forge deeper commercial ties with the United States and Mexico this week as part of efforts to prepare for his country\u2019s departure from the European Union.

Later in the week, Mr. Fox will travel to Mexico to meet with Ildefonso Guajardo, the minister of economy, to seek ways of maintaining trade ties once Britain leaves the European bloc. The British meetings are a delicate matter for relations between London and Brussels. That is because Britain is not allowed to conclude deals on its own before it leaves the European Union.

General Motors and Ford have reported strong profits because of brisk sales of high-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles as well as steady growth in China. But industry sales have slumped in their home market this year. Fiat Chrysler is generally less profitable than its crosstown rivals. G.M. will report on Tuesday, followed by Ford on Wednesday and Fiat Chrysler on Thursday. Neal E. Boudette", "ECONOMY", "The Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-making committee is not likely to make policy when it meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed officials are deferring decisions until later in the year. The Fed already has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year as it retreats from its post-crisis economic stimulus campaign. Analysts expect the Fed to announce at its next meeting, in September, that it will begin to reduce its bond holdings, another step toward normalcy. The July meeting is largely a place holder, but the Fed will update its economic outlook on Wednesday. The crucial question is how worried are Fed officials about a recent downturn in inflation?

Royal Dutch Shell, the largest European oil company, will report on Thursday, along with Total of France and Norway\u2019s Statoil. The American giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron will follow on Friday, along with Italy\u2019s Eni. Earnings should be helped by slightly higher oil prices than last year\u2019s second quarter as well as zealous cost-cutting. But with oil prices still under pressure, analysts say, investors will want to see further spending cuts.

Experts are forecasting growth of 2.5 percent on an annual basis, above the 1.4 percent rate recorded in the first quarter but well below the 3 percent-plus pace many economists had been anticipating a few months ago.

For his birthday this summer I bought \u201cWinnie-the-Pooh\u201d read by Stephen Fry, Judi Dench, Michael Williams, Jane Horrocks and others. If it goes well, I\u2019m going to listen to \u201cA Bear Called Paddington,\u201d also read by Stephen Fry. I will of course love these, even if he falls asleep. RADHIKA JONES, editorial director, Books", "Early in my newspaper career, when I worked the overnight shift at a small-town daily, I got into the habit of listening to audiobooks for company on my commute through the empty streets. \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d \u201cThe Third Man,\u201d \u201cHumboldt\u2019s Gift,\u201d \u201cFlaubert\u2019s Parrot\u201d \u2014 I read them all this way, if \u201cread\u201d is the word, pausing occasionally to rewind the tape if my mind had wandered from the story to the job\u2019s routines: the call to the cop shop for breaking news, the trip to the presses to watch the first copies roll off. I remember those books as clearly as anything I read on paper, even if the circumstances of my listening have retroactively cast them all in the same insomniac, Edward Hopper-ish light. But by far my favorite audiobooks from that stretch were the paired novels \u201cMr. Bridge\u201d and \u201cMrs. Bridge,\u201d by Evan S. Connell, which take readers deep into the rich, roiling and conflicted interior lives of a husband and wife who to all outward appearances are exactly the kind of staid, respectable suburbanites who lay fast asleep in their imposing houses while I drove by. As read by George Guidall and Sally Darling, they are wry and well-meaning and hopeless and entirely alive. I drove home in a snowstorm early one morning, \u201cMr. Bridge\u201d on the cassette deck, and after I reached my driveway I sat with the car running and snow gradually piling up on the windshield so I could listen to the end of a chapter. Then there was a knock on my window \u2014 a plow driver had noticed me just sitting there while the engine ran, and wanted to make sure everything was O.K. \u201cEverything is fine,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI\u2019m listening to a story.\u201d GREGORY COWLES, staff editor, The New York Times Book Review", "My partner and I are tentatively planning an 11-day roundtrip road trip from Manhattan to Minneapolis at the end of next month to visit with my sister\u2019s family and sample the variety of fascinating food at the Minnesota State Fair.

Since that\u2019s a lot of time on the National Highway System through seven states, I have three potential dashboard entertainment plans. The first: Listen to audiobooks of classic works set it some of the states we\u2019re passing through, like Sherwood Anderson\u2019s \u201cWinesburg, Ohio.\u201d Since I also want to shop local at her Birchbark Books shop once we get there, spinning up the audio version of a Louise Erdrich novel is a distinct possibility and I\u2019m looking at \u201cThe Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse\u201d for starters.", "Environmental factors will ultimately affect our moods and listening choices, so that\u2019s where the second plan comes in. Bad weather and jacked-up highways will undoubtedly call for Sarah Vowell\u2019s \u201cAssassination Vacation\u201d and \u201cThe Partly Cloudy Patriot\u201d \u2014 humorous, insightful essays about traveling through America and its history, read in part by the delightful author herself with the help of some great guest narrators (Stephen Colbert! Seth Green! Catherine Keener!) along the way.", "Since this trip will be a bit of an asphalt marathon, my third plan is to just pick one epic novel for the long haul. Neal Stephenson\u2019s \u201cCryptonomicon\u201d is a favorite because it involves many topics that interest us both, like World War II codebreaking, Bletchley Park, cryptography, hackers, computers and data havens. The audiobook version clocks in around 42 hours, which should get us there and back with plot to spare. J.D. BIERSDORFER, staff editor, The New York Times Book Review", "On long summer road trips, my husband and I have discovered that mystery novels are the way to go. But after a near-miss one Sunday in Baltimore (we ran a red light, completely absorbed by the revelation of the killer) we\u2019ve gravitated to more sedate crime stories, character-driven tales that are engaging enough to keep us awake on a long stretch of highway but not dangerously so.

ALIDA BECKER, staff editor, The New York Times Book Review", "My experience with audiobooks is admittedly limited. Once, more than a decade ago, in an attempt to squeeze more reading into my day, I resolved to listen to Colm Toibin\u2019s \u201cThe Master,\u201d mostly while walking to the subway and running errands. The novel is based on Henry James\u2019s life, and I loved the mesmerizing narration of all those serpentine sentences, but trying to keep track of where those sentences were going meant that I would end up in the frozen food aisle with only a trace memory of what brought me there.", "This summer, though, my family has a road trip planned, and in order to prevent my 7-year-old daughter from commandeering the playlist (if it were up to her, Katy Perry and Carly Rae Jepsen would play on a continuous loop), I look forward to having us listen to Bill Nye\u2019s new book, \u201cEverything All at Once: How to Unleash Your Inner Nerd, Tap into Radical Curiosity and Solve Any Problem.\u201d It\u2019s narrated by Nye himself, which is ideal, since my daughter is already fond of \u201cBill Nye the Science Guy\u201d from old episodes streaming online. (Also, for anyone concerned about the threat my distractable self could pose to others, I should note that there\u2019s little chance of us ending up in the highway equivalent of the fast food aisle, since I won\u2019t be the one doing the driving.) JENNIFER SZALAI, staff editor, The New York Times Book Review", "These days, I am usually subject to the whims of my backseat contingent, who have little patience for A. Scott Berg\u2019s biography of Woodrow Wilson, which I\u2019ve been listening to in 10-minute increments for, oh, the last two years. But there are two classic audiobooks my entire family agrees on, both read by their respective authors. First, if you have any in-house fans of Roald Dahl, I highly recommend his own reading of his collected work, \u201cThe Roald Dahl Audio Collection.\u201d A caveat: The stories are sadly abridged in these versions. They are worth it anyway for the narrator, who reels off his gleefully nasty character descriptions and caustic dialogue in that distinctive Nordic-inflected British accent. Dahl\u2019s renditions of \u201cThe Fantastic Mr. Fox\u201d and \u201cGeorge\u2019s Marvelous Medicine\u201d are especially delicious. His voice lowers to a whisper on occasion; he draws out certain sentences for emphasis; and at times, gets mumbly and almost breathless as he drives through an exciting exchange of dialogue. He knows not to cross certain lines: there is no whining or screeching, and no gratuitously \u201cfunny\u201d voices. You can also listen to a Hollywood lineup of Oscar-winning talent (Kate Winslet, Dan Stevens, etc.) reading Dahl\u2019s stories on audiobook recordings issued a few years ago. But I prefer the author himself, and so does my backseat gang.", "There is no possible human resistance to E.B. White reading his own \u201cCharlotte\u2019s Web.\u201d White drawls out the story in a plainspoken manner, with the kind of East Coast accent that hardly exists anymore. His telling is devoid of silliness (even when articulating various barnyard animals) or sentimentality. He is never cute or fussy or forced. Some highlights: His goose! His Templeton! And if you don\u2019t get moist-eyed hearing his soft \u201cgoodbyes\u201d as each baby spider takes flight near the end, then you simply have no heart. The overall effect is like listening in as the author, sitting on the porch of a house in Maine, perhaps his own, reads aloud to his grandkids. So many children\u2019s books on audio these days incorporate music and other sound effects. It\u2019s never necessary and it almost never enhances the story. These two audiobooks make that case loud and clear.

But in a handful of countries, the ride-hailing company has ended up on a more conciliatory path.", "The latest example: On Thursday, Uber said it had formed a partnership with Yandex, the Russian search giant and operator of the ride-hailing service Yandex.Taxi. The two companies will combine their ride-hailing businesses in Russia and several other Eastern European countries under a new, yet-to-be-named company.", "The deal, which must receive regulatory approval, will value the new company at $3.4 billion. It will be jointly operated by Yandex and Uber, with Tigran Khudaverdyan, the chief executive of Yandex.Taxi, as chief executive of the new venture. Uber will invest $225 million, while Yandex will invest $100 million of its own and retain a majority stake in the new company.", "\u201cTogether, we will continue to build a ride-sharing service that offers a viable alternative to automobile ownership or public transportation,\u201d Mr. Khudaverdyan said in a blog post.", "The move is a rare d\u00e9tente for Uber, known for its aggressive approach to entering global markets, and it will end a costly battle between the two companies that has dragged out over the past three years since Uber arrived in Russia. It also comes during a trying time for the company, just weeks after Travis Kalanick, a co-founder, resigned as chief executive.", "But the deal reflects the intense competition Uber has sometimes faced in its aggressive overseas expansion.", "Last year, Uber realized it was outmatched in China, where the company spent billions of dollars in rider subsidies to gain a foothold against Didi Chuxing, the incumbent ride-hailing app there. After a protracted fight, Uber sold its Chinese subsidiary company to Didi Chuxing and formed a new, separate company operating in the region. Uber retains a 17.5 percent stake in that business.", "In Russia, the establishment of ride-hailing apps transformed the taxi market, which had been dominated by irregular and unlicensed services. Individuals driving personal vehicles would offer themselves as taxis, and customers would flag them, negotiating prices to be paid in cash.", "Now, the sector is more formalized, though still not as fully regulated as in Western Europe. Passengers who use services like Uber, Yandex.Taxi and another rival Gett are aware of who their drivers will be and what cars they will be driving. They are also able to pay with credit cards and receive receipts.", "And because the market had been largely informal, there have been no major protests by incumbents against the ride-hailing services, unlike in cities like London or Paris, where taxi companies and drivers are more heavily regulated.", "Still, Uber faced similar difficulties as it did in China against Yandex in Russia and the other countries in which Yandex.Taxi operates, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan. Yandex.Taxi\u2019s operations in Russia are about twice the size of Uber, according to data the Russian company released to shareholders.", "Yandex is an incumbent in a region where the government does not always welcome foreign business. Moreover, the company, often called the \u201cGoogle of Russia,\u201d owns and operates a significant mapping database, an advantage over Uber. And Yandex, a well-established internet brand in Eastern Europe, is able to heavily market its services to potential customers through its online properties \u2014 a luxury Uber does not have.", "Players on both sides say that rather than spending money fighting for market share, a deal made the most sense.", "Users will benefit from shorter wait times, the companies said, as well as more reliable service. They will also be able to take advantage of global \u201croaming\u201d; Yandex.Taxi customers may use the app in countries in which Uber operates to call cars, which will be fulfilled by Uber\u2019s drivers. Uber customers, similarly, will be able to do the same in areas in which Yandex.Taxi is the predominant ride-hailing service.", "The deal has been in the works for months, with executives like Emil Michael, Uber\u2019s former senior vice president of business, and Cameron Poetzscher, the current vice president of corporate development, determining the details.", "\u201cThis deal is a testament to our exceptional growth in the region and helps Uber continue to build a sustainable global business,\u201d Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, head of Uber in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said in a news release.", "As part of the deal, Uber will retain a 36.6 percent stake in the new company, which has the placeholder title \u201cNewCo,\u201d while Yandex will hold a 59.3 percent stake; 4.1 percent will be held by employees of the venture. Combined, it will operate in 127 cities across six countries. Between the two operations, more than 35 million rides were completed in June, responsible for more than $130 million in gross bookings.", "Winding down expensive battles among competitors will also help assuage investor concerns about Uber\u2019s spending, which over the past few years has remained high as the company burns cash to expand its ridership. Uber lost nearly $1 billion over the fourth quarter of 2016, though it has started to shore up losses in some markets; it lost $708 million in the first three months of 2017.", "Reining in spending will probably sit well with investors, who are pushing for an initial public offering, which may soon become a reality. Uber is searching for a chief financial officer and new chief executive, and it is appointing other important executive positions in preparation for an eventual move to the public markets.", "Yandex and Uber expect their deal to close by the end of the year."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-george-best-all-by-himself-and-atlanta.html": ["The series \u201c30 for 30\u201d remembers soccer\u2019s first pop icon, the Manchester United player George Best, before that team faces Manchester City.

This means establishing probable cause that the evidence sought is related to a crime.", "But for anything older than that, investigators need only a grand jury or administrative subpoena, as long as the person whose communications are sought is informed. That notification can be delayed by as much as 90 days if disclosure might have an adverse effect, such as destroying or tampering with evidence.", "Back in 1986, Congress viewed communications over six months old to be abandoned and therefore subject to reduced protection, a notion that looks quaint today when emails and texts may be held for years.", "Another provision of the statute allows investigators to obtain information from the provider about a subscriber to any electronic service, like cellphones, by seeking a court order based on \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the records are relevant to a criminal investigation. This is a lower standard than probable cause, the usual requirement for a search warrant.", "It is this lower threshold for getting information that is at issue in Carpenter v. United States, which the Supreme Court will hear in its next term starting in October.", "The defendants were convicted of organizing a string of robberies in the Detroit area where they served as lookouts by parking near the stores. The government obtained orders directing wireless carriers to provide cell site location information showing where different numbers linked to the crew conducting the robberies were at the time of the crimes. Armed with data from various cell towers, prosecutors showed at trial that the defendants\u2019 phones were a half-mile to two miles from the robberies, helping to link them to the actual perpetrators.", "The defendants sought to suppress that information, arguing that it constituted a search of their phones so that the reasonable grounds standard in the Stored Communications Act for the order did not meet the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment.", "The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati rejected that claim, finding that \u201calthough the content of personal communications is private, the information necessary to get those communications from point A to point B is not.\u201d Therefore, the defendants had no privacy interest in the information held by the carriers about their location and the constitutional probable cause requirement did not apply.", "The Carpenter case raises a fundamental question about how far the privacy protection in the Fourth Amendment, which by its terms applies to \u201cpersons, houses, papers and effects,\u201d should reach in protecting data generated by a person\u2019s electronic devices. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote in Riley v. California, a 2014 decision, that cellphones are now \u201csuch a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy.\u201d", "In Riley, the court found that a warrantless search of an arrestee\u2019s cellphone was unconstitutional, explaining that what distinguishes the device from other items that might be found on a person that the police could look at \u201cis their immense storage capacity.\u201d But rummaging through the contents of a phone or computer is not necessarily the same as getting site information that is broadcast to the carrier, especially when a person may enable it by using an app like Find My Phone.", "In a 2012 case, United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court found that the use of a GPS tracker attached to a car was a search governed by the Fourth Amendment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor explained in a concurring opinion that the privacy interests in a person\u2019s specific location required investigators to get a warrant because gathering that information \u201cenables the government to ascertain, more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and so on.\u201d", "In the Carpenter case, the justices will have to weigh whether cell site data is different from a GPS tracker because learning where a person is within about a one-mile radius may not be a sufficient invasion of privacy to come within the Fourth Amendment. Nor does obtaining the location of a cellphone reveal the content of any communication, only that a call was made, so the protection afforded by the Riley decision may not apply.", "Another case involving the Stored Communications Act that may come before the justices concerns the territorial reach of a warrant authorizing investigators to obtain emails held by Microsoft. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, in Microsoft v. United States, found that the warrant did not apply to emails stored on a server in Dublin because there was no indication in the statute that Congress intended to authorize a search outside the United States.", "The Justice Department filed a petition with the Supreme Court on June 22 asking for a review of that decision, arguing that it was \u201cwrong, inconsistent with this court\u2019s framework for analysis of extraterritoriality issues, and highly detrimental to criminal law enforcement.\u201d Those requests are often granted because the justices rely on the solicitor general\u2019s office to identify cases that have significant law enforcement implications.", "Another factor in favor of granting review is that the Second Circuit\u2019s decision has not been followed by federal district courts in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington and Wisconsin, which have enforced warrants to produce email records that may have been stored abroad. A note in the Harvard Law Review criticized the decision because it \u201cdid not acknowledge the \u2018un-territorial\u2019 nature of data.\u201d", "Microsoft is fighting the effort to apply the Stored Communications Act to electronic records held outside the United States, pointing out in a company blog post that the European Union\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation scheduled to go into effect next year will make it illegal to transfer customer data from Europe to the United States. That could put global technology organizations like Google and Microsoft in the difficult position of balancing demands for greater privacy with efforts to investigate crime that could result in large fines for failure to comply.", "Determining how digital information fits under a constitutional protection adopted when there were only \u201cpersons, homes, papers and effects\u201d that could be searched requires the Supreme Court to figure out the scope of privacy expectations in a very different world from the 18th century. The problem is that legal challenges take a piecemeal approach to a statute adopted over 30 years ago, and the courts cannot rewrite provisions that may be hopelessly out of date.", "The House of Representatives adopted the Email Privacy Act in February to modernize the protections afforded electronic communications that would require obtaining a search warrant in almost every case. That proposal met resistance in the Senate last year when Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, sought to add a provision allowing law enforcement to skip the warrant requirement in emergency situations.", "Whether the legislation can get through the current Senate is an open question, and it is not clear whether President Trump would sign off if the Justice Department opposes the bill. That may mean the Supreme Court will have to establish the broad parameters of digital privacy while Congress tries to deal with the intricacies of a world of electronic communication that continues to evolve rapidly.", "Devices connected to the internet, from cellphones to watches to personal training trackers that facilitate our personal habits and communications, are a fact of daily life, and the Supreme Court will have to start drawing clear lines around what types of electronic information are \u2014 and are not \u2014 protected by the Fourth Amendment. Simply asserting that there is a right to privacy does not provide much help in determining how far that protection should extend in a digital world."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligence-is-stuck-heres-how-to-move-it-forward.html": ["Artificial Intelligence is colossally hyped these days, but the dirty little secret is that it still has a long, long way to go. Sure, A.I. systems have mastered an array of games, from chess and Go to \u201cJeopardy\u201d and poker, but the technology continues to struggle in the real world. Robots fall over while opening doors, prototype driverless cars frequently need human intervention, and nobody has yet designed a machine that can read reliably at the level of a sixth grader, let alone a college student. Computers that can educate themselves \u2014 a mark of true intelligence \u2014 remain a dream.", "Even the trendy technique of \u201cdeep learning,\u201d which uses artificial neural networks to discern complex statistical correlations in huge amounts of data, often comes up short. Some of the best image-recognition systems, for example, can successfully distinguish dog breeds, yet remain capable of major blunders, like mistaking a simple pattern of yellow and black stripes for a school bus. Such systems can neither comprehend what is going on in complex visual scenes (\u201cWho is chasing whom and why?\u201d) nor follow simple instructions (\u201cRead this story and summarize what it means\u201d).", "Although the field of A.I. is exploding with microdiscoveries, progress toward the robustness and flexibility of human cognition remains elusive. Not long ago, for example, while sitting with me in a cafe, my 3-year-old daughter spontaneously realized that she could climb out of her chair in a new way: backward, by sliding through the gap between the back and the seat of the chair. My daughter had never seen anyone else disembark in quite this way; she invented it on her own \u2014 and without the benefit of trial and error, or the need for terabytes of labeled data.", "Presumably, my daughter relied on an implicit theory of how her body moves, along with an implicit theory of physics \u2014 how one complex object travels through the aperture of another. I challenge any robot to do the same. A.I. systems tend to be passive vessels, dredging through data in search of statistical correlations; humans are active engines for discovering how things work.", "To get computers to think like humans, we need a new A.I. paradigm, one that places \u201ctop down\u201d and \u201cbottom up\u201d knowledge on equal footing. Bottom-up knowledge is the kind of raw information we get directly from our senses, like patterns of light falling on our retina. Top-down knowledge comprises cognitive models of the world and how it works.", "Deep learning is very good at bottom-up knowledge, like discerning which patterns of pixels correspond to golden retrievers as opposed to Labradors. But it is no use when it comes to top-down knowledge. If my daughter sees her reflection in a bowl of water, she knows the image is illusory; she knows she is not actually in the bowl. To a deep-learning system, though, there is no difference between the reflection and the real thing, because the system lacks a theory of the world and how it works. Integrating that sort of knowledge of the world may be the next great hurdle in A.I., a prerequisite to grander projects like using A.I. to advance medicine and scientific understanding.", "I fear, however, that neither of our two current approaches to funding A.I. research \u2014 small research labs in the academy and significantly larger labs in private industry \u2014 is poised to succeed. I say this as someone who has experience with both models, having worked on A.I. both as an academic researcher and as the founder of a start-up company, Geometric Intelligence, which was recently acquired by Uber.", "Academic labs are too small. Take the development of automated machine reading, which is a key to building any truly intelligent system. Too many separate components are needed for any one lab to tackle the problem. A full solution will incorporate advances in natural language processing (e.g., parsing sentences into words and phrases), knowledge representation (e.g., integrating the content of sentences with other sources of knowledge) and inference (reconstructing what is implied but not written). Each of those problems represents a lifetime of work for any single university lab.", "Corporate labs like those of Google and Facebook have the resources to tackle big questions, but in a world of quarterly reports and bottom lines, they tend to concentrate on narrow problems like optimizing advertisement placement or automatically screening videos for offensive content. There is nothing wrong with such research, but it is unlikely to lead to major breakthroughs. Even Google Translate, which pulls off the neat trick of approximating translations by statistically associating sentences across languages, doesn\u2019t understand a word of what it is translating.", "I look with envy at my peers in high-energy physics, and in particular at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, a huge, international collaboration, with thousands of scientists and billions of dollars of funding. They pursue ambitious, tightly defined projects (like using the Large Hadron Collider to discover the Higgs boson) and share their results with the world, rather than restricting them to a single country or corporation. Even the largest \u201copen\u201d efforts at A.I., like OpenAI, which has about 50 staff members and is sponsored in part by Elon Musk, is tiny by comparison.", "An international A.I. mission focused on teaching machines to read could genuinely change the world for the better \u2014 the more so if it made A.I. a public good, rather than the property of a privileged few."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/books/review/jane-austen-fans-deborah-yaffe.html": ["Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music", "In The New York Times Book Review, Jane Smiley writes about three books about the legacy of Jane Austen, including Deborah Yaffe\u2019s \u201cAmong the Janeites: A Journey Through the World of Jane Austen Fandom.\u201d Smiley writes:", "On this week\u2019s podcast, Yaffe talks about \u201cAmong the Janeites\u201d; Robert Ferguson discusses \u201cScandinavians: In Search of the Soul of the North\u201d; Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world; and Gregory Cowles, Jennifer Szalai and John Williams on what people are reading.

LinkedIn was sold to Microsoft for $26 billion last year. And Apple is Apple, the most valuable company in the world.", "In most local markets, it would be a surprise if any one of these companies were floundering. But in China, the real shock is that their troubles no longer surprise anyone.", "Just in the past few weeks, Facebook had one of its most popular apps blocked by the Chinese government. LinkedIn, the globe-spanning social network of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, job recommendations and management essays, had its local boss step down amid tepid results in the country. And Apple announced a billion-dollar investment to comply with local law as it continued to watch Chinese demand for its iPhones fade.", "This summer of challenge for the three companies offers a broad illustration of just how varied the obstacles have become for foreign companies in China. They also show in stark terms why this vast market has been frustratingly difficult for outsiders.", "Tempted by the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and an increasingly wealthy population deeply intrigued by new technologies, just about every American tech company from Amazon to Zynga has taken a shot at China. But outside of Apple and a group of older companies like IBM and Intel, few have a major presence in the country today.", "\u201cIn general the China market is hard, even for Chinese companies,\u201d said Andy Tian, co-founder of Asia Innovations Group in Beijing and former general manager of Zynga China. \u201cIt\u2019s the most competitive place around for consumer services and technology.\u201d", "Over the years, internet companies like Twitter, Google and Snapchat have been blocked by censors. EBay was outmaneuvered by the local internet giant Alibaba. Groupon failed to stay afloat in the flood of copycats it inspired. Uber cut its losses after establishing a foothold and sold its local business to a Chinese rival.", "Even LinkedIn, which played ball with Chinese censors two years ago in order to get into the country, has had trouble getting traction with a local audience. \u201cThe big internet companies just don\u2019t have much of a hope here,\u201d said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide.", "American start-ups are still in the game, in particular those selling services to Chinese businesses, Mr. Tian said. But the number of big American internet firms trying to get into the country has slowed, though exact figures are hard to come by.", "There are issues beyond offending censors. The Chinese internet culture is different, and at times quirky. And the technical requirements of China\u2019s internet filters can make operating difficult. Engineers often have to find alternatives to the services technology companies rely on outside China.", "For those that overcome all that, the market is rough in a way United States companies don\u2019t normally experience, and is often tilted against outsiders.", "\u201cIt\u2019s basically like someone who has been training for Olympic taekwondo going up against a street fighter,\u201d Mr. Tian said. \u201cThe Olympic fighter is waiting for the whistle, and the street fighter already has him on the ground hitting him with elbows. There\u2019s no rules.\u201d", "More so than the others, Facebook\u2019s problem in China is simple: Neither its website nor its app is accessible in the country. Both were blocked in 2009, shortly after ethnic rioting in western China. In the autumn of 2014, the umbrella protests in Hong Kong prompted the block of Instagram, which Facebook owns.", "Around the same time Instagram went down, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg stepped up a charm campaign to try to get the social network back into China. He trotted out his Mandarin in a large public forum, invited the then head of China\u2019s internet regulator to Facebook\u2019s offices and even dined with president Xi Jinping during a state visit.", "For all his efforts, just last week the company\u2019s last major app in the country, WhatsApp, was blocked by the Chinese government. While experts say it\u2019s not clear whether it will ultimately be fully blocked, in recent days users have been unable to send images, videos and voice messages.", "At least partially responsible for the block, according to analysts, is a new cybersecurity law that went into effect on June 1. While vague, the new rules call for security checks on foreign companies and force firms to store key data in China.", "While Apple\u2019s position in China is about as different from Facebook\u2019s as possible \u2014 it has built a hugely valuable retail business \u2014 it too has been affected by the law. Just the week before WhatsApp was hit by disruptions, Apple said that to ensure it complied with the law it would begin storing data from its iCloud service in China. It also said it would work with a local Chinese company to set up a data center in southwest China as part of a $1 billion investment.", "An Apple spokeswoman referred to remarks by Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, in which he said Apple was \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about opportunities in China.", "Yet keeping Beijing satisfied is only part of the challenge for Apple. With more and more Chinese smartphone makers selling high-quality smartphones cheaply, the company\u2019s sales in the country have slid over the past two years. In the second quarter ending April 1, the company\u2019s revenue in greater China fell 14 percent, even as the market remains critical. Greater China accounts for 21 percent of the company\u2019s sales, making it Apple\u2019s most important market after the United States.", "In a new tack for Apple in China, just last week it created a new position, general manager for greater China, and appointed a longtime manager, Isabel Ge Mahe, to the position. Ms. Ge Mahe was born in China, speaks Mandarin and has deep engineering experience. The company is also in search of a greater China policy head after its former head, Jun Ge, recently resigned, according to two people familiar with the matter.", "If Apple is trying something new, LinkedIn is showing that what had been an accepted model within China is no guarantee of success. Unlike Apple, which as a hardware company is considered less threatening by the Chinese government, LinkedIn had to go along with a bargain other internet companies have refused.", "In 2014 the company agreed to start censoring \u2014 much as Google had done almost a decade before it eventually left China \u2014 and formed a partnership with two influential Chinese venture capital investment funds to create a separate China operation. While the self-censorship drew complaints from users, other technology companies looking to get into China came to see LinkedIn\u2019s approach as a model.", "By bringing in well-connected investors, it was able to ensure its communications with the Chinese government were in capable hands. It also focused on the particulars of the local market. It hired Derek Shen, a successful Chinese entrepreneur and Google veteran, to run its China operations separately. Mr. Shen, in turn, created a stand-alone app to bring LinkedIn, a service built around email and computers, to China\u2019s smartphone-dependent population.", "Three years on, the results have been mixed. Troubles have included missing sales targets and failing to attract enough users, according to four former and current employees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak officially. LinkedIn\u2019s local app, Chitu, also failed to attract the hundreds of millions of would-be users who have less exposure to the international work force and live in China\u2019s smaller cities.", "While in most countries LinkedIn simply runs its network as it does in the United States, in China that proved difficult. In China, many of the people the company wants to attract use only smartphones, and communicate on messaging apps instead of email. Mr. Shen decided to try a specialized app catering to those patterns. Yet it had to compete with entrenched social networks, like WeChat, and gained little traction.", "In June, the company also announced the departure of Mr. Shen and is still in the process of looking for his permanent replacement. A LinkedIn spokesman said the decision that Mr. Shen would leave was mutual, and his decision was motivated by a desire to join a more entrepreneurial effort.", "Holding LinkedIn back wasn\u2019t so much the ferocious local competition or the regulatory hurdles, but Chinese internet culture itself. Many are simply not in the habit of publicly sharing their professional connections, and it has been hard to convince them, said analysts and those who worked at LinkedIn China.", "A business person in China may blush at making a Rolodex public because it is so personal, and also incredibly valuable. And publicly updating a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 can be misconstrued by an employer as a signal that an employee is looking for a new job.", "Also, with a corruption crackdown ongoing in China, showing the relationships that allow business leaders to get things done can be a liability.", "As a result, professional relationships are often managed on a more conventional social network that allows for greater privacy: WeChat. Though at its heart a messaging app, it has a function like Facebook\u2019s newsfeed where people can post. Also widely used are group chats, where school alumni, embittered ex-employees or parents of a local school can keep up with the latest gossip or get a few potential candidates for a new position they have to fill.", "With the social side of business life on WeChat, many local services have focused more on the posting of job openings.", "\u201cIt may not be so much that LinkedIn is having trouble in China because they\u2019re a foreign company,\u201d said Mark Natkin, founder of tech research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they\u2019re having trouble in China because this is not the model people want to use here.\u201d Most use Tencent messaging services like WeChat or QQ \u2014 another Tencent messaging service originally built for desktop computers \u2014 to connect for business instead, he added.", "That cultural difference has kept a broader swath of the Chinese from joining LinkedIn. Two former employees said that they had quotas of posts they had to write on LinkedIn China\u2019s website each week to help boost activity. One of them, who said she used to write five to 10 posts a week, said it often seemed futile because most people used WeChat for professional discussions. Along with group chats, articles and even long messages easily go viral with people sharing them between groups, or on their moments, roughly the equivalent of a Facebook wall.", "A spokesman said the program encouraging employees to post was voluntary.", "Selling to customers without experience in international business was often an exercise in explaining why people would want to post their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online, one former employee said. As a result most of LinkedIn\u2019s best Chinese consumers were companies with major international operations like Huawei and the drone company DJI.", "Xu Mengya, a former marketing employee at LinkedIn China, said that although there were far fewer LinkedIn users in Australia than China, the network there was much more active. She attributed the difference to a more distinct work-life divide, where people use Facebook to communicate with friends and family, and LinkedIn with work connections. In China, she said, everyone uses WeChat for both.", "As LinkedIn continues to press ahead, its new legacy may be less its model for going into China, and instead a willingness to accept a more modest type of success \u2014 underscoring the reality that for the world beaters of Silicon Valley, getting into China is only a first step in what can become a long slog.", "Although it failed to attract the huge number of users that companies like Alibaba and Tencent have, LinkedIn has attracted a large number of China\u2019s international professional class.", "In his departure note, Mr. Shen noted as a sign of its success the fact that the company had 32 million users in China. While that may be less than 5 percent of China\u2019s total internet-using population, a spokesman for the company said it showed the venture was living up to expectations. The company has also attracted more than 1,000 clients since coming to China less than four years ago, he said.", "\u201cSo they haven\u2019t achieved nothing, they can congratulate themselves on making a start and not having been lapped by any local competitor,\u201d Mr. Natkin said.", "Still, the current and former employees said there were other problems. LinkedIn\u2019s ad and recruiting rates are far more expensive than local competitors, making it hard to sell, according to two former employees.", "Simply to get in, LinkedIn needed to create a new operation partially owned by well-connected local investors. Yet the logic also followed that an independent China business would indeed be more independent, allowing it to respond more quickly to local challenges without the myriad phone calls at odd hours required to coordinate with headquarters. But the structure also had a negative side. Benefits and quotas at LinkedIn China were also different from the rest of the company, sometimes damaging morale, the two people also said.", "Ultimately however, Ms. Xu said LinkedIn\u2019s original sin was simply being too late and not necessary enough. \u201cThe root of the problem is that Chinese do not need a social platform for work. It is a fact in China that all social activities related to work are on WeChat,\u201d she said.", "\u201cIn China, LinkedIn has turned into a hiring website \u2014 a high-end version of domestic hiring sites,\u201d she said, referring to the many local sites that specialize in listing job opportunities.", "\u201cThis has led to a lack of activity because it has lost its social side.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/arts/television/david-lynch-weaves-film-history-into-twin-peaks-the-return.html": ["The artist and filmmaker David Lynch has an uncanny ability to create work that doesn\u2019t just evoke dread and discomfort \u2014 it can make a viewer actually feel that dread and discomfort. \u201cLynch is a director of mood and texture, the queasier the better,\u201d the critic J.

While the series might not be garnering record-breaking ratings, it generates lively conversation on social media, and minutes after Part 8 aired on June 25, fans were weighing in not only on how unusual it was, even by \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d standards, but also on the movies to which it appeared to nod.", "In the 1997 book \u201cLynch on Lynch,\u201d Mr. Lynch called Stanley Kubrick \u201cone of the all time greats,\u201d and in Part 8, the slow-motion, black-and-white shot of the blinding blast and attendant mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb brings to mind the finale of Kubrick\u2019s 1964 mutually-assured-destruction satire \u201cDr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,\u201d which can be streamed via Amazon Video, iTunes, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.", "But Mr. Lynch\u2019s perspective penetrates further into the smoke and fire of the blast, locating, it seems, the origins of the evil that the central characters of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d are in constant battle with. This extraordinary sequence, using both a stationary camera and one that tracks forward with grim relentlessness, is scored with the Polish modernist composer Krzysztof Penderecki\u2019s \u201cThrenody for the Victims of Hiroshima.\u201d Mr. Lynch is hardly ever this literal, and we can take the use of the music as a token of sincerity with respect to the horrors of nuclear war. It\u2019s also worth noting that Kubrick used Penderecki\u2019s music \u2014 a different piece \u2014 in his 1980 adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s novel \u201cThe Shining.\u201d And of course Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d (1968) uses the work of another Eastern European modernist, Gyorgy Ligeti. The inside-the-blast sequence in Part 8 has a good deal in common with the near-finale of \u201c2001\u201d \u2014 the astronaut Dave Bowman\u2019s journey to \u201cJupiter and Beyond the Infinite.\u201d (\u201c2001\u201d is best seen on as big a screen as possible, but it is available to stream for a fee via the same platforms as \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201d)", "The very variable imagery inside the mushroom cloud, from hellish flames to what could be out-of-focus black-and-white shots of swarms of insects in front of a car windshield, has affinities with the work of Stan Brakhage and other avant-garde filmmakers. But it\u2019s also distinctly Lynchian; the director\u2019s use of strobe effects probably has less to do with the influence of other filmmakers than it does with his fascination with electricity and alternating current, evident in \u201cEraserhead,\u201d which can be streamed on the Criterion Channel of the service Filmstruck, and in many of Mr. Lynch\u2019s short films, three of which are also available on that site. In Part 8, the strobing and stuttering fast-motion action is particularly frantic when the Woodsmen make their first appearance. These are menacing characters, seemingly from a different dimension (one was seen in the 1992 film \u201cTwin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\u201d). Their faces look blackened by soot; they appear and disappear in fast motion and jump cuts, milling around a convenience store. All this seems to be happening inside the mushroom cloud.", "Once the Woodsmen alight to Earth in 1957, and one of them, an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth, approaches terrified citizens with the query \u201cGotta light?,\u201d the show starts to resemble an old-school horror movie. One Twitter user, Bobby Castro, posted two remarkably similar images, one from Part 8 with a Woodsman approaching a car window, another from \u201cCarnival of Souls,\u201d with an undead gentleman approaching its heroine.", "\u201cCarnival,\u201d a low-budget American film made in Kansas in 1962, is a cult picture available for viewing on the Criterion Channel. It tells the story of a young woman who very improbably survives an auto accident and then takes off to a job as a church organist in Utah. She\u2019s constantly interrupted by the undead. It\u2019s a remarkably eerie picture whose unnerving atmosphere is actually enhanced by the stilted B-movie quality of the acting.", "The sequence of the Woodsmen terrorizing a New Mexico town where the atomic test occurred a decade earlier indulges plenty of Mr. Lynch\u2019s nostalgia for American diners and doo-wop, but once the fellow who keeps asking for a light can get his hands on an actual human, the violence and gore ramp up, with a coincidental echo of \u201cCity of the Living Dead,\u201d a 1980 extreme grindhouse film directed by Lucio Fulci, available on the horror-movie streaming service Screambox or for rent on Hulu.", "\u201cThe Atomic Cafe,\u201d a 1982 found-footage documentary about atomic testing, nuclear war and the peculiar attitudes American culture had toward them, is also a worthwhile companion piece to Part 8, and can be rented from YouTube, Amazon Video and Google Play. Of course Part 8 \u2014 whose affinities stretch from the thriller \u201cThe Night of the Hunter\u201d (1955) to Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s surreal \u201cEnter the Void\u201d (2009) (both of which are available to rent on Amazon, Google, iTunes and YouTube; \u201cVoid\u201d is a featured film on Hulu) \u2014 is not the only part of the new \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d with cinematic resonances. In Part 4, Wally (played by Michael Cera), the son of Deputy Andy Brennan and his wife, Lucy, becomes a goofily comic riff on Marlon Brando\u2019s persona in the 1953 motorcycle-gang drama \u201cThe Wild One,\u201d which can be rented to stream from Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.", "It\u2019s probably not Mr. Lynch\u2019s overt intention to steer his latest \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d vision through so much eclectic film history, but the presence of this material and the viewer\u2019s ability to access what may or may not be its sources certainly make the experience of watching the program that much richer and stranger."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/technology/waymo-scales-back-claims-against-uber-in-driverless-car-dispute.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Waymo, the autonomous vehicle business that operates under Google\u2019s parent company, dropped several patent claims against Uber on Friday, scaling back some of its major allegations in a bitter lawsuit over driverless technology.", "In a federal court filing, Waymo said it was dropping three of its four claims over Uber violating its patents related to light detection and ranging sensor technology, or lidar.

The curiosity was that several broadband companies \u2014 the very same companies that pushed to rewrite the rules that undergird net neutrality \u2014 put out statements suggesting that they, too, supported the aims of the protesters.", "\u201cWe support permanent, strong, legally enforceable net neutrality rules,\u201d said Comcast, the nation\u2019s largest cable company, which once successfully sued the F.C.C. to overturn net neutrality policies.

The text of the letter actually supports the new F.C.C. policy, but hey, it\u2019s the thought that counts, I suppose.", "So what\u2019s going on here? Net neutrality \u2014 rules meant to ensure that broadband companies treat all internet traffic equally and don\u2019t, for instance, block certain services or charge them to get priority access \u2014 has been at the center of a heated tech-policy battle for more than a decade. It\u2019s a fight between internet companies \u2014 the Googles, Facebooks and Netflixes of the world \u2014 and broadband companies that control the pipes coming into your home. The battle is abstruse, but the stakes are high: Both sides say the future of the internet depends on getting these rules right.", "So why, now, are broadband companies suggesting that they support the aims of the other side?", "There are two possibilities: A cynic might argue that it\u2019s just puffery, that the broadband industry is simply trying to present a friendly image to an outraged online horde. Or you might take them at their word.", "When I asked them for comment, representatives for AT&T, Comcast and Verizon pointed to their statements.

And they say the proper venue for that compromise is Congress, not the F.C.C. Legislation rather than regulation, they said, would create a permanent new legal grounding for network neutrality rules, ending the fight once and for all.", "So which is it, cynicism or an earnest attempt to move the debate forward? Well, maybe their motivation doesn\u2019t matter. Here\u2019s one idea for longtime proponents of network neutrality: Call the broadband companies\u2019 bluff, if that\u2019s what it is. Maybe it is time to push Congress, rather than the F.C.C., to take up the neutrality fight \u2014 and maybe, finally, end the debate for good.", "The reasoning here is pretty straightforward. Under Ajit Pai, President Trump\u2019s pick for F.C.C. chairman, the pro-neutrality side is unlikely to get much of what it wants from the commission anyway. In Congress, some key Republicans have signaled a willingness to draft neutrality rules. The new rules from Congress are almost certain to fall short of the ideal outcome from neutrality advocates; they will also probably be weaker than the sweeping regulatory system drafted by Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman under President Obama. But that is to be expected; there is a Republican Congress, a Republican president and a deregulatory mood ascendant in Washington.", "But broadband companies also face enormous consumer pressure to keep their networks functioning well. On the Day of Action, many internet companies showed worst-case scenarios that could come out of the death of net neutrality rules \u2014 trickle-slow load times and an internet marked by paid bundles, like the return of cable TV on your computer. Broadband companies, which are already quite hated by their customers, aren\u2019t likely to be keen on seeing those scenarios come to pass \u2014 and would therefore willingly support legislation that prevents such horrors, said Michael Powell, a former F.C.C. chairman who is now the president of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, a broadband trade association.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a premise out there that we are itching to block, itching to create slow lanes, but we\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cI\u2019ve had this conversation with every C.E.O., and it\u2019s not because they\u2019re good people or are philanthropists. They\u2019re as self-interested as Google or anybody else, but they believe they\u2019ve found a good business selling internet access on open, unobstructed pipes.

But as she left Dropbox in 2014, she didn\u2019t know what she would do next.", "At 32, she wanted a better way of deciding where her career would go. She wanted an environment where she could freely explore new ideas among her peers without feeling the pressure to start another project immediately.", "As the months passed, she never quite found that kind of personal think tank, but she came to realize that many old friends and colleagues felt much the same way. Her next project became an effort to help people find their next project.", "The result is South Park Commons. Housed in an old townhouse on the oval park at the heart of the San Francisco tech scene, the Commons is a selected community of entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers and others. Ms. Sanghvi describes it as tech\u2019s answer to the Bloomsbury Set or Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Junto club, a means of shaping new ideas through conversation and shared experience.", "It\u2019s also a way of preparing for the future.", "\u201cYou get a couple of shots in life to do something meaningful and impactful. Why not take the time to identify that?\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said during a recent conversation inside the Commons, a high-ceilinged space decorated by local artists. \u201cIt is very easy to fall into the traps of Silicon Valley \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s start a company,\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s invest\u2019 \u2014 without giving it a second thought.\u201d", "Founded a little more than 18 months ago, the Commons aims to fill a hole in the tech landscape. Northern California is littered with incubators and accelerators, organizations like Y Combinator and Techstars that help small companies develop and grow. This is something different, a community you can join before you have founded a company or even when you have little interest in founding one.", "The Commons is a bit like the hacker spaces that have long thrived in the Valley \u2014 places where coders and makers gather to build new software and hardware \u2014 but it moves beyond that familiar concept. Its founder, for one thing, is a female engineer turned entrepreneur turned executive.", "The group, which includes 25 to 30 people at any given time, is one small piece of the Northern California tech scene, but it arrives at a crucial moment. Silicon Valley is a place in transition, thanks to a shifting economic landscape, the rise of artificial intelligence and other technologies, and new pressure to embrace a more diverse range of people.", "Today\u2019s tech industry also provides an extra degree of economic freedom, said Ms. Sanghvi, whose husband, Aditya Agarwal, also has a long history in Silicon Valley and is now the chief technology officer at Dropbox.", "Many tech workers were stuck with their companies for years, waiting for an initial public offering. Now they can easily sell their shares on private markets, and that means they have more opportunity to explore new ventures. At the same time, the path to the next venture is less obvious, as companies shift toward very different types of technology, most notably artificial intelligence, or A.I., which is rapidly changing the way the world builds software.", "Increasingly, Silicon Valley is embracing what are called deep neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. These have become an enormously effective way of recognizing objects in images, and words spoken into smartphones, but they also find uses in fields including security, health care and robotics.", "The rub is that the talent needed to build and deploy these techniques is scarce, so much so that the likes of Google and Facebook are running classes to educate their employees in this new way of doing things. The Commons provides both a physical and a social environment where others can learn in similar ways.", "Ms. Sanghvi recruits people to the Commons solely by word of mouth, and they join merely by showing up and contributing a few hundred dollars in dues, to pay for items like coffee, snacks and paper towels and to fund regular events at the townhouse.", "When Cinjon Resnick arrived at the Commons last year after moving to San Francisco from New York, it was already cultivating an interest in neural networks and other A.I. techniques. He was among those who spent several months exploring the field, reading and discussing the latest research papers, and organizing lectures and workshops at the Commons.", "Many groups strive for this dynamic of exploration and dialogue, but for Mr. Resnick, the Commons succeeded. \u201cIt\u2019s a loosely structured place where people can come and form ideas,\u201d he said during a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all wanted.\u201d", "Eventually, Mr. Resnick landed a residency at Google Brain, Google\u2019s central artificial intelligence lab. Three others joined OpenAI, a competing lab founded by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.", "Virtual reality, biotechnology and other new movements may drive similar changes across the Valley, and the Commons is built to embrace it all; Ms. Sanghvi and others recruit members precisely because they are different. While Mr. Resnick and others explored A.I., David Kosslyn and Ian Thompson worked with virtual reality. Nikil Viswanathan and Joseph Lau built the meeting app Down to Lunch. Kanjun Qiu built a recruiting company, Sourceress.", "But this arrangement has other byproducts. Ms. Qiu is one of three female founders who have emerged from the Commons. Though Ms. Sanghvi said the organization still needed more women, her presence and the group dynamic are at least a step toward that future.", "\u201cThis is collaborative learning,\u201d said Nilanjana Dasgupta, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who studies how social environments affect career paths, particularly in science and technology. \u201cThat can feel more satisfying for women in a culture like Silicon Valley.\u201d", "Mr. Resnick and other alumni of the Commons say this vibe exists because Ms. Sanghvi takes such a strong hand in guiding her creation. With a style both endearing and remarkably direct, she runs the community the way a good parent raises a child.", "She pays for the townhouse, giving the group a place to meet and work each day, and she lays down the rules. She demands regular lunches, dinners and other events, like the early lecture on A.I. from a Silicon Valley veteran, Keith Adams, who is the chief architect of Slack, or a recent presentation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable organization started by Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan.", "\u201cEvents give you an excuse to talk to each other,\u201d Ms. Sanghvi said. \u201cThey make you feel like you\u2019re working on something together.\u201d", "But she also sets limits. Anyone who builds a company that grows to more than five people graduates. She does not want the Commons to become just another accelerator.", "The trick lies in keeping the current vibe going and, better yet, mimicking its approach across the Valley. For the Commons, that means more independence from Ms. Sanghvi, a way for the group to attract members and raise funds on its own.", "Ms. Sanghvi said she might find a way to get the Commons a tiny percentage of any start-up that emerged from the townhouse or she might seek sponsorship from big businesses or nonprofits.", "That may or may not change the Commons.

She became active in the anti-abortion movement there, traveling to attend the March for Life, a huge annual gathering of anti-abortion activists in Washington. But although her faith felt revived, she began \u2018\u2018living a double life,\u2019\u2019 she told me, casually dating a much older restaurateur, whom she described as a \u2018\u2018billionaire.\u2019\u2019 In late October 2015, a month before graduation, she found out she was pregnant.", "She had always looked forward to pregnancy, even the silly rituals like posting maternity photos to Facebook.

She didn\u2019t want to marry her boyfriend or be attached to him forever through co-parenting. And being a single mother, she feared, would make it harder to attract the kind of \u2018\u2018good Catholic guy\u2019\u2019 she hoped to settle down with eventually.", "About a week later, she made a decision that nearly one million American women make each year: She would have an abortion. After reading about the abortion pill online, she made an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic a block from her downtown apartment. She would rather face her forgiving God, she thought, than her anti-abortion family and friends. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t want the baby, but I also didn\u2019t want to have the abortion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018I just wanted it all to not exist, which is kind of what the pill allows a woman to think can happen.\u2019\u2019", "The \u2018\u2018abortion pill\u2019\u2019 is really two separate drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol, taken 24 to 48 hours apart.

At the top of the screen she saw a toll-free number and the words \u2018\u2018Abortion Pill Reversal: It may not be too late.\u2019\u2019 She picked up the phone.", "Stettler didn\u2019t know it at the time, but the website that she stumbled across represents a new front in the abortion wars, part of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s decades-long insistence on women\u2019s indecision, ignorance and regret around their abortion decisions. When the abortion pill became available in the United States in 2000, 12 years after it was approved in France, activists on both sides of the debate predicted that what was then called RU-486 would revolutionize the abortion landscape. One Planned Parenthood medical director told a journalist in the late 1990s that he expected medication abortions to make up 30 percent of all abortions within three or four years. Anti-abortion leaders, meanwhile, foresaw the procedure\u2019s becoming effectively invisible, and therefore difficult to confront directly. George W. Bush, then the Republican nominee for president, said he feared the new protocol would \u2018\u2018make abortions more and more common.\u2019\u2019", "Neither prediction proved true. A graph of the abortion rate since Roe v. Wade in 1973 looks something like a long playground slide viewed from the side. There\u2019s a steep climb up to the peak of 1981, and then a gentle but significant slope downward. In 2014, the number of abortions in the United States dropped below one million for the first time since 1975. Nor did medication abortion immediately transform how those dwindling numbers of abortions were administered. A decade after RU-486\u2019s arrival in the United States, fewer than 18 percent of abortions took place via medication, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even among women whose pregnancies were eligible for the abortion pill \u2014 at the time, eight weeks\u2019 gestation or less \u2014 almost three-quarters underwent surgery instead.", "As public discussion about abortions has focused on surgical abortions, the anti-abortion movement has notched victory after victory, chipping away at abortion access through a constellation of state laws that heavily regulate clinics, starve providers of funds and require women to undergo \u2018\u2018counseling\u2019\u2019 or waiting periods before procuring the procedure. As a result, at least 162 abortion providers closed or stopped offering the service between 2011 and 2016, according to a Bloomberg analysis, while just 21 new providers opened. In the Midwest and the South, more than half of all women live in counties with no abortion provider at all.", "But today, 17 years after RU-486 was approved, medication abortion is approaching its initial promise \u2014 or threat, depending on your point of view. American women now end their pregnancies with medication almost as often as they do with surgery, according to data analyzed last fall by Reuters. And last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued new label guidelines making the abortion pill more accessible than ever. Mifepristone is now recommended up to a gestational age of 10 weeks; the new guidelines also reduced the number of required doctor visits and the recommended dosage. The experience of taking a few pills in private is on the cusp of becoming what we mean when we say \u2018\u2018abortion.\u2019\u2019", "This steady rise of medication abortion, or what the anti-abortion movement calls chemical abortion, presents the movement with a significant challenge, one that has turned out to be more complicated than the fear that abortion would become more common. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve consistently lost the debate when the debate has been over the status of human life immediately after conception,\u2019\u2019 says the historian Daniel K. Williams, author of the 2016 book \u2018\u2018Defenders of the Unborn: The Pro-Life Movement Before Roe v. Wade.\u2019\u2019 Medication abortions take place relatively early in pregnancy, and they are eliminating many of the images and narratives \u2014 the abortionist\u2019s instruments, the impersonal clinic \u2014 that have historically served as persuasive scare tactics. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really thought through these things all that carefully, and we\u2019re still fighting, with good reason, the battle over surgical abortion,\u2019\u2019 says Charles Camosy, the anti-abortion author of the 2015 book \u2018\u2018Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018With chemical abortion, we\u2019re not where we need to be.\u2019\u2019", "What the anti-abortion movement has thought through carefully is how to tell stories about abortion\u2019s impact. Early activists, who were mostly Catholics, were almost solely concerned with saving the life of the fetus. Feminists arguing for choice, in turn, made a convincing case for their own rights \u2014 and accused people opposed to abortion of not caring about women at all. In the years after Roe v. Wade, however, some of the millions of women who procured newly legal abortions began to complicate that conflict by speaking publicly about their own experiences and emotions, including their regrets. Anti-abortion activists founded \u2018\u2018abortion recovery\u2019\u2019 organizations and advanced the idea of \u2018\u2018post-abortion syndrome,\u2019\u2019 a relative, they claimed, of post-traumatic stress disorder. By the 1990s, emphasizing abortion\u2019s supposed harms to women had become a full-fledged strategy, one that changed both the public face of the anti-abortion movement and its self-identity. Today many young anti-abortion activists frame their work as feminist; the theme of last year\u2019s March for Life was \u2018\u2018Pro-Life and Pro-Woman Go Hand in Hand.\u2019\u2019 Promoting abortions as murder had always carried the uncomfortable implication that the women who procured them were killers. In the revised narrative, \u2018\u2018the women are viewed as essentially victims,\u2019\u2019 Williams says. \u2018\u2018The argument is always that they didn\u2019t have the knowledge they really needed.\u2019\u2019", "And \u2018\u2018abortion pill reversal\u2019\u2019 implies exactly that \u2014 that a woman made an uninformed decision and has now thought better of it. The brainchild of a San Diego doctor named George Delgado, \u2018\u2018reversal\u2019\u2019 is a medical protocol that floods a woman\u2019s body with progesterone, the so-called pregnancy hormone, within hours after she has taken mifepristone, the drug that begins a medication abortion. \u2018\u2018If you have something that\u2019s poisoned a specific spot in your body and we know what the antidote is, then you just take the antidote,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has enthusiastically promoted reversal to its members. For all the challenges that the abortion pill poses to the anti-abortion movement, it turns out to have at least one unexpected benefit: The hours between the two doses of medication represent an extra decision point to interrupt and redeem. \u2018\u2018With a surgical abortion, once the instrument enters the uterus, then it\u2019s over,\u2019\u2019 Delgado says. Medication abortion, by contrast, gives women \u2018\u2018a second chance at choice.\u2019\u2019", "In a cramped office north of San Diego one recent afternoon, Delgado showed off a framed photo of a 7-year-old girl he has never met but whose life he is often credited with saving. Delgado is the medical director of Culture of Life Family Services, which operates a \u2018\u2018crisis pregnancy center\u2019\u2019 that provides anti-abortion counseling to pregnant women, and a separate family-medicine practice where Delgado spends most of his time. A sign in front, right across from a Planned Parenthood clinic, read \u2018\u2018Free Ultrasound.\u2019\u2019", "Delgado was raised Catholic, but it wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s that he began thinking in earnest about how his faith should affect his work as a doctor. In the early years of his career, he prescribed hormonal birth control and performed vasectomies. But he stopped doing both after he read Pope Paul VI\u2019s encyclical \u2018\u2018Humanae Vitae\u2019\u2019 in the late 1990s. The document, written in 1968 at the height of the sexual revolution, is a holistic statement on the sacredness of all human life, from conception to death. It also firmly restated the church\u2019s teaching against most forms of birth control. When Delgado read it, he felt deeply convicted. \u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t being consistent in how I was living my life and how I should be living my life according to my faith,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018From then on, I decided everything I would do would be consistent with what God wanted me to do.\u2019\u2019", "In 2004, he traveled to Nebraska to pursue certification in Natural Procreative Technology, a Catholic-friendly approach to women\u2019s reproductive health. Developed by an anti-abortion OB-GYN named Thomas Hilgers who was also inspired by \u2018\u2018Humanae Vitae,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018NaProTechnology\u2019\u2019 eschews most forms of birth control and fertility treatments and relies instead on tracking widely used \u2018\u2018biomarkers\u2019\u2019 like cervical mucus and body temperature. At Hilgers\u2019s Pope Paul VI Institute in Omaha, Delgado learned to use progesterone to treat issues like repeated miscarriage and postpartum depression. The next year, he moved from the Bay Area to San Diego to join Culture of Life, a Catholic clinic founded by local longtime anti-abortion activists named Ken and Marie Finn.", "In 2009, Delgado says, he received a call from an acquaintance who ran an anti-abortion ministry focused on counseling women outside abortion clinics. A young woman in El Paso, Tex., had just taken the first pill to begin a medication abortion and immediately regretted it. She found the activist\u2019s phone number online and called in a panic. Was there any way to undo her mistake? By this time, Delgado had been using progesterone for years to treat women dealing with fertility issues. And he knew that mifepristone, the first drug in the abortion-pill protocol, works by blocking progesterone from the uterus. Couldn\u2019t an extra dose of progesterone overcome the mifepristone? Within hours, he sketched out a plan to inject the woman with 200 milligrams of progesterone and to con\u00adtinue giving the progesterone until the end of the first trimester. Through a national network of NaProTechnol\u00adogy-friendly doctors, he quickly found a doctor in El Paso who had the right form of the hormone available in her office and was willing to try it. The fetus survived, and the baby girl was born healthy.", "Delgado later found out that a doctor in North Carolina, Matthew Harrison, had received a similar call from a crisis pregnancy center in 2006 and independently made the same guess about progesterone counteracting the effects of the mifepristone. That fetus, too, survived, after the mother received progesterone injections through her 26th week of pregnancy. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t make a whole lot of noise about it because I knew that people would try to write it off,\u2019\u2019 Harrison says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not like we have women every day knocking on our door to reverse abortions.\u2019\u2019", "Over the next few years, however, Delgado and Harrison occasionally heard from doctors and activists who wanted to know more about their interventions. In 2012, Delgado put up a simple website and opened a hotline for women to call for information about reversal. That year, he and Mary Davenport, a doctor in the Bay Area, started contacting a few other doctors who had performed reversals with progesterone. They soon published a small case series in the journal Annals of Pharmacotherapy. The article, just four pages long, describes seven pregnancies treated with progesterone after mifepristone. Two of the abortions completed, but four of the fetuses survived. (One woman evaded the doctors\u2019 attempts to follow up.) \u2018\u2018The experience of these patients suggests that medical abortion can be arrested by progesterone injection,\u2019\u2019 Davenport and Delgado concluded. \u2018\u2018If further trials confirm the success without complications of this or similar protocols, it should become the standard of care for obstetrician-gynecologists, family physicians and emergency-department physicians to attempt mifepristone reversal on patient request.\u2019\u2019", "Delgado\u2019s hotline received just 28 calls in all of 2012. But the volume increased over the years: 200 calls in 2013, more than 400 in 2014 and more than 600 for each of the last two years, according to the reversal program\u2019s executive director, Sara Littlefield. Today 17 nurses across the country take shifts answering the calls, which are routed to their cellphones. When a call comes into the hotline, the nurse\u2019s job is to connect the caller as quickly as possible with a local doctor willing to administer the reversal protocol. The program has a network of about 350 doctors who are familiar with it and prepared to see patients. If the caller doesn\u2019t live within driving range of one of those providers, the hotline nurse immediately starts calling local doctors and hospitals to explain what reversal is, hoping to find a sympathetic provider. Catholic hospitals are usually a good place to start.", "Within the last few years, Delgado and Harrison have become something like celebrities within the anti-abortion movement. Conservative media outlets report on reversal at length in flattering terms, and several of the women who have undergone the procedure have begun telling their stories in public, too. Delgado has delivered presentations at events hosted by the National Right to Life Committee and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, where he serves on the board. Harrison and Delgado also started promoting \u2018\u2018emergency abortion pill reversal kits,\u2019\u2019 glorified instructional pamphlets intended for emergency rooms and crisis pregnancy centers. One fan gave Harrison a T-shirt that read \u2018\u2018Reversed RU-486. Now reverse Roe vs Wade.\u2019\u2019", "A vanishingly small percentage of women decide they want to reverse a medication abortion halfway through. In fact, regret is quite rare when it comes to abortions in general. A 2013 study found that although women experienced a wide range of often conflicting responses to the procedure, relief was the most common emotion one week after. A later study found that women who had abortions were also confident in their decisions beforehand \u2014 more confident than people who decide to get reconstructive knee surgery, for example. \u2018\u2018Most women are certain of their decision when they present for care,\u2019\u2019 says the study\u2019s lead author, Lauren Ralph, an epidemiologist at the Univer\u00adsity of California, San Francisco. Their certainty is largely unchanged by waiting periods and mandated counseling, which suggests \u2018\u2018women do not change their minds.\u2019\u2019 Ralph also found that women who do experience uncer\u00adtainty are more likely to already believe a myth about abortion, such as that it causes breast cancer.", "But the anti-abortion movement has found stories about it impossible to resist. Headlines in conservative magazines and websites highlight the pregnant woman\u2019s epiphany after taking mifepristone: \u2018\u2018All at Once It Hit Me That I Had Just Made the Worst Decision Ever,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018After Taking the Abortion Pill, She Knew She Made a Mistake, But Her Baby Was Saved When This Happened,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Reversing Regret.\u2019\u2019 It doesn\u2019t get much more memorable than a tale of near-death, a sudden awakening and salvation.", "Cynthia has one of those stories. (She asked me not to use her last name to protect her son\u2019s privacy.) Cynthia was 18 in 2010 when she found out she was pregnant, and she knew immediately that she would take the abortion pill. \u2018\u2018I, myself, would never have even considered it if it was just like the surgical abortion,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently, settled into a sleek white armchair in the sunny counseling room at Culture of Life. Taking a few pills, by contrast, sounded easy \u2014 almost like birth control. \u2018\u2018You just take it, and it\u2019s over.\u2019\u2019 But after taking the mifepristone, she told her mother what she had done, and her mother confessed her daughter\u2019s half-completed abortion to a priest. The priest called Delgado and also went to Cynthia\u2019s house to talk to her. Delgado, meanwhile, invited Cynthia to come in for an ultrasound the same day to see if the fetus was still alive. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s just see,\u2019\u2019 her boyfriend urged her.", "In Cynthia\u2019s memory, it wasn\u2019t the pressure from a priest, a doctor, her mother and her boyfriend that changed her mind. It was the ultrasound. \u2018\u2018When I saw the heartbeat, I mean, truly everything changed,\u2019\u2019 she recalled in the clinic, a large wall decal behind her reading \u2018\u2018I Can Do Hard Things.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t even a question anymore.\u2019\u2019 After the ultrasound, Delgado\u2019s wife, who is a nurse, injected her with 200 milligrams of progesterone; she was the first patient whose medication abortion Delgado himself \u2018\u2018reversed.\u2019\u2019 She delivered a healthy baby boy named Christian at 36 weeks gestation.", "Women who regret their abortions, and are willing to speak publicly about it, have long been valued spokeswomen for the anti-abortion message. But reversal offers a twist to those stories: a happy ending. It also represents a concrete action that women can take to atone for their initial mistake. \u2018\u2018This gives them the actual physical way in which they can in effect reverse their regret,\u2019\u2019 says Jody Lyne\u00e9 Madeira, a professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law who has written about the rhetoric of abortion and regret. \u2018\u2018She can say she did everything she can to stop it once she changed her mind.\u2019\u2019", "For all of reversal\u2019s anecdotal power, however, the science itself is still disputed. While Delgado claims that flooding a woman\u2019s body with progesterone saves the fetus, other doctors say that in many cases the fetus would have survived if the woman simply declined to take the second pill, misoprostol, after the initial dose of mifepristone. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a strongly worded statement against reversal in 2015 that said the fetus would survive 30 to 50 percent of the time. Dr. Daniel Grossman, a prominent reversal skeptic and director of the research group Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, at University of California, San Francisco, published a literature review that same year in the journal Contraception. He concluded Delgado and Davenport\u2019s case series was of \u2018\u2018poor quality with few details,\u2019\u2019 and that embryonic survival after mifepristone is as high as 46 percent. The question, in other words, is whether the progesterone protocol is effectively just a placebo. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no evidence that any kind of treatment is better than doing nothing,\u2019\u2019 Grossman says.", "Davenport, Delgado and Matthew Harrison recently published their own literature review in Issues in Law & Medicine, a journal that often features anti-abortion perspectives. When they looked at studies in which the mifepristone dose was comparable to the current F.D.A. regulations, they found survival rates of less than 25 percent. Delgado and Davenport are also preparing a larger case series for publication later this year, which they say will include about 350 women. Delgado says it shows that the most effective progesterone protocol results in an embryo survival rate between 60 and 70 percent. No one has seen that research yet, although conservative media outlets have recently started promoting the results. Critics say that even if those numbers are valid, they aren\u2019t what they seem. Many women who decide to take progesterone undergo an ultrasound first, to see if the pregnancy remains viable; those whose fetuses have died do not go forward with reversal, which means the initial pool of subjects is skewed toward women whose pregnancies had a good chance of continuing even without progesterone. Delgado declined to share a draft of his paper and told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the percentage of women included in the case series who underwent ultrasounds.", "Although the research remains immature, not everyone is quick to dismiss its basic medical logic. \u2018\u2018It makes biological sense,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Harvey Kliman, director of the reproductive and placental research unit at the Yale School of Medicine. \u2018\u2018I think this is actually totally feasible.\u2019\u2019 Kliman, who has published research on progesterone and miscarriage, is in favor of abortion rights, and made clear he wasn\u2019t advocating widespread use of the treatment. But if one of his daughters came to him and said she had somehow accidentally taken mifepristone during pregnancy, he said, he would tell her to take 200 milligrams of progesterone three times a day for several days, just long enough for the mifepristone to leave her system: \u2018\u2018I bet you it would work.\u2019\u2019 The protocol, however, has attracted almost no interest from the mainstream medical community, in part because the presumed audience is so small.", "But while Delgado and his associates labor to legitimize reversal, some state lawmakers are racing ahead of them. Since 2015, legislators in 10 states have introduced bills requiring doctors to inform women procuring the abortion pill that they can change their minds after taking the first dose. \u2018\u2018These laws are essentially forcing physicians to tell their patients about a treatment that is unproven and essentially kind of encouraging them to participate in an unmonitored research experiment,\u2019\u2019 Grossman says. In Utah, Gov. Gary Herbert signed a bill in March that requires women receiving the pill to be informed that mifepristone alone does not always end a pregnancy; a similar law went into effect in South Dakota last year. Arkansas requires women to be informed that \u2018\u2018it may be possible to reverse the effects of the abortion if the pregnant woman changes her mind.\u2019\u2019 A 2015 Arizona law passed but was then revised to strip its mention of reversal. Similar bills were debated in Colorado, California, Indiana, Idaho, North Carolina and Georgia. Americans United for Life, an influential lobbying group, flagged its model legislation on reversal as a strategic focus for 2017.", "When Marie Stettler called the reversal hotline back in 2015, a nurse quickly made her an appointment with a local doctor who would give her progesterone the next morning. On the way home from her first treatment, hopeful, she stopped and bought a bottle of prenatal vitamins. But three days later, she started bleeding heavily. The pregnancy was over. Stettler struggled with grief and guilt for months. After her due date, she attended a retreat for \u2018\u2018post-abortive\u2019\u2019 women run by a Christian ministry, which included a memorial service presided over by a priest. Stettler played the piano and sang an original song she had written for the baby, who she decided was a girl and named Remy. \u2018\u2018True joy is never found in the things we love in passing,\u2019\u2019 she sang. \u2018\u2018But in a sacrifice so pure, we find love everlasting.\u2019\u2019", "In time, she found a different kind of redemption. The nurse who answered the reversal hotline stayed in touch with her after her pregnancy ended, praying with her over the phone when she felt despondent. She started volunteering for the hotline, talking to women in the same position she was once in. And in March, she moved to San Diego to start working full time as the nurse manager at Culture of Life. She sees the work she does now as something like atonement. \u2018\u2018I knew that Remy\u2019s life had to stand for something,\u2019\u2019 she told me. God has a plan, she added, \u2018\u2018for literally every life, living or dying in his arms.\u2019\u2019", "The anti-abortion movement has effectively promoted the idea that many women regret their abortions. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, considered a wild card on abortion questions, waxed eloquent on the topic in his ruling in Gonzales v. Carhart, a 2007 case that upheld the ban on \u2018\u2018partial-birth\u2019\u2019 abortion. \u2018\u2018It seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in the majority opinion. \u2018\u2018The state has an interest in ensuring so grave a choice is well informed.\u2019\u2019 That assumption undergirds huge swaths of contemporary abortion law: waiting periods, mandatory ultrasounds and requirements that doctors give women more (sometimes dubious) information about the procedure and its effects. The idea seems to be that many women understand what an abortion is only after they have one.", "The entire legal strategy of \u2018\u2018protecting\u2019\u2019 women seemed to be in jeopardy last year, however, when the Supreme Court, in Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, struck down Texas\u2019 harsh clinic regulations developed under the guise of safeguarding women\u2019s health. Some legal experts predicted the ruling would force the anti-abortion movement to refocus its attention from the mother\u2019s health and emotions, back to the fetus itself. But reversal legislation suggests the anti-abortion movement isn\u2019t giving up so fast. In fact, the movement seems to be \u2018\u2018doubling down on the emphasis on women,\u2019\u2019 says Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and author of the 2015 book \u2018\u2018After Roe: The Lost History of the Abortion Debate.\u2019\u2019 Stories from individual women who struggle with remorse remain a powerful weapon in the anti-abortion arsenal, and the abortion rights movement has often stumbled in its attempts to respond. \u2018\u2018Because there are so many stories that the pro-choice side wants to represent and has to represent, to cover its bases, it sounds weaker and less coherent than pro-life \u2018abortion harms women, women regret abortion,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Madeira says. \u2018\u2018That cohesive message is always much stronger and more unified.\u2019\u2019", "Promoting legislation like the recent crop of reversal bills can be its own reward, Ziegler says, even if the laws are eventually struck down or the protocol turns out to be ineffective. Just raising the question of uncertainty and regret affects the abortion pill\u2019s reputation. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re changing cultural norms about what people think about this kind of abortion,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018You can do that regardless of what the research ultimately shows.\u2019\u2019"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/asia/north-korea-execution-sites.html": ["SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For two years, from a cramped office in central Seoul, activists and volunteers from five countries have been doing something never tried before: creating interactive maps of places where North Korea is thought to have executed and buried prisoners.", "Over the years, defectors from the isolated country have testified to widespread human rights violations there, including what United Nations investigators have determined were extrajudicial executions of political prisoners and others. But there has never been a coordinated attempt to locate where those killings took place because the country remains off limits to outside rights investigators.", "On Wednesday, activists affiliated with the Transitional Justice Working Group, a human rights group based in Seoul, announced their initial findings, identifying more than 300 sites where executions are thought to have occurred and 47 sites believed to have hosted cremations and burials, places where as many as 15 people may have been executed and their bodies dumped together or left \u201clike trash.\u201d", "\u201cIt is not unreasonable to assume that mass grave sites in existence today will still be there years from now,\u201d said Sarah A. Son, the group\u2019s research director. \u201cAs we have seen in many other post-conflict settings around the world, people will want to know what happened to family members, and an accurate historical record will need to be created as part of the process of recovery, particularly on a scale such as that in North Korea.\u201d", "Armed with Google Earth satellite imagery, the group has interviewed 375 North Korean defectors, asking them to help locate sites so that international rights officials can one day visit them to investigate, exhume bodies, secure forensic evidence and possibly bring charges against perpetrators.

Over at Pandora, the chief executive stepped down, marking the end of an era for the struggling music company.

Air traffic control systems? Hackable. Bridges and dams? Hackable. Nuclear power plants? Also hackable. In fact, one victim of this most recent cyberattack was the Chernobyl nuclear power facility, where the computers that monitor radiation were taken offline by the attack, forcing employees to inspect radiation levels by hand.

In other words, Google might have to eat out at restaurants one or two times fewer this month, but over all this is more of an annoyance than an existential crisis for it \u2014 at least right now.", "Kevin: This is not a death knell for Google, but I also think it may be a harbinger of a much bigger and more interesting discussion to come here in the United States. I actually think 2018 might be the year we see American antitrust regulators start going after some of these companies for anticompetitive practices, especially when it comes to the advertising market. According to one estimate, Facebook and Google together accounted for 99 percent of revenue growth in digital advertising last year in the United States.

Soon after, other partners offered to leave, and the firm was unable to finish raising another large fund of investor money, effectively shuttering Binary\u2019s future investing efforts.", "Now we\u2019re seeing all sorts of fallout, as other women in tech are calling out the bad behavior of men in the industry.", "Is this a true turning point to the industry? Is it possible women may feel more empowered now to speak out against bad actors? Or do you think things will go back to gross business as usual in Silicon Valley after this news cycle passes?", "Kevin: I thought you might ask about this. After all, what reader wouldn\u2019t want to see two male reporters give their commentary on gender discrimination in Silicon Valley?", "But I do think something is changing in the business world broadly, and Silicon Valley is the latest expression of that shift. I\u2019m very glad that women who have been wronged are speaking out in greater numbers and that their complaints are being taken seriously.", "But I\u2019m cynical that these companies\u2019 responses have anything to do with an ethical awakening. It\u2019s not crazy to suspect that what is driving these firms (and bigger companies like Uber, a ride-sharing start-up you may have heard of) to purge themselves of bad actors isn\u2019t morals, but opportunism. In Uber\u2019s case, the toxic workplace culture became an issue only once it began affecting recruiting and investor sentiment. In the Caldbeck case, can you imagine a venture capital firm successfully soliciting pitches from female founders after an incident like that?", "I guess what I\u2019m saying is: Show me a tech company that goes public with its bad behavior totally unprompted, with no reporters asking and no damning expos\u00e9s about to hit, and I\u2019ll consider the possibility that maybe this isn\u2019t all about money.", "Mike: Ah, Kevin, you\u2019re becoming just as cynical as I am.

Ms. Wing was a tall, lean, attractive, athletic and musically talented Stanford University student when she decided to donate her eggs to help pay for her education. Through her multiple donations, five healthy children were born to three formerly childless families.", "When her mother asked if egg donation was safe, Ms. Wing said she was told it was. What she did not know at the time was that no one had ever looked beyond the short-term effects of the many hormone injections needed to stimulate the release of multiple eggs at one time.", "Four years after her third donation, Ms. Wing, then 29, learned she had metastatic colon cancer. Despite the best available treatment, she died at 31 in 2003, just days after completing the music for an opera called \u201cLost\u201d that was presented three weeks later in New York.", "Ms. Wing\u2019s cancer may have been totally unrelated to her egg donations. But given that Ms. Wing had been a health-conscious young woman with no family history of colon cancer or genes associated with this disease, Dr. Schneider wondered if the extensive hormone treatments her daughter had undergone might have stimulated growth of the cancer and if other egg donors might also be at risk.", "Alas, she soon discovered, it was impossible to know because no one was keeping track of the medical or psychological fate of egg donors. Once donors walk out the door, they are essentially lost to medical history.", "Dr. Schneider began vigorously advocating for establishment of an egg donor registry that could benefit not only the thousands of healthy young women whose eggs help others get pregnant, but also the growing number of women who want to postpone pregnancy and choose to have their eggs frozen for future use.", "But 14 years after her daughter\u2019s death, there is still no one tracking the fate of egg donors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collects information on in vitro fertilization, but not on those who donate their eggs either anonymously or to family members or friends unable to get pregnant with their own eggs.", "There are not even reliable data on the number of egg donors. The best statistic I could find was the number of donor eggs that were used for in vitro fertilization, which increased to 18,306 in 2010 from 10,801 in 2000.", "Fertility clinics and egg-donor agencies advertise broadly, especially on college campuses and even on New York subways, for donors, who are typically paid $5,000 to $10,000 for each donation, even more if the woman satisfies a fertility client\u2019s specifications. One woman wrote in The Atlantic that she had responded to an offer for $25,000 in The Yale Daily News for \u201ca young woman over five feet five, of Jewish heritage, athletic, with a combined SAT score of 1500, and attractive.\u201d", "Donor eggs are typically used for women seeking pregnancy who may have undergone early menopause, have poor egg quality, a history of genetic disease, a hormonal imbalance, ovaries that fail to respond to stimulation, or are over the age of 40.", "\u201cEgg donors are just not on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d Dr. Schneider, who lives in Tucson and is certified in internal medicine, addiction medicine and pain management, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sperm donation, which doesn\u2019t involve hormone injections or any invasive treatments. In my opinion, egg donors need to be treated like all other organ donors \u2014 their health should be monitored.\u201d", "What we have now are only anecdotal reports of women who served as egg donors and later developed cancer. For example, five years before Ms. Wing\u2019s untimely death, two doctors at a London fertility clinic described in the journal Human Reproduction the \u201ctragic case of a young woman who died of cancer of the colon after successfully donating eggs to her younger sister.\u201d They noted that long-term safety concerns about egg donation had been raised in the British Medical Journal (now BMJ) in 1989, given the high levels of hormones administered to donors.", "The London doctors, K.K. Ahuja and E.G. Simons of Cromwell Hospital, called upon the British Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority \u201cto confirm that ovarian stimulation in volunteer egg donors does not increase the risk of cancer over and above the background rate.\u201d But this has yet to be done.", "Earlier this year, in Reproductive Biomedicine Online, Dr. Schneider and two co-authors reported on five cases of breast cancer among egg donors, four of them women in their 30s and all five of whom had no apparent genetic risk for the disease. None of the women had been given any information about long-term risks of egg donation, because no such information exists.", "The authors pointed out that single cases do not establish whether hormone stimulation of egg donors increases the risk of various cancers, and reiterated Dr. Schneider\u2019s earlier pleas for \u201cthe need to create egg donor registries that will facilitate long-term studies on egg donors.\u201d", "Similar risks might also exist for women who are able to supply their own eggs for in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F. They undergo the same hormone treatments as egg donors. However, these women, who are typically older and may have endocrine or other abnormalities, are not a reliable group for determining long-term risks for young, healthy egg donors.", "Dr. Schneider and co-authors expressed concern as well about another group of women: those whose eggs are harvested and preserved for their own future use. They undergo the same hormone treatments, perhaps more than once if not enough healthy eggs are obtained on a first attempt. If successful, egg freezing can enable women to delay pregnancy and remain in the work force until well beyond normal childbearing years.", "Some companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft, now cover the cost of fertility treatments, in some cases including egg freezing, which can cost about $10,000 plus $500 to $1,000 a year for storage. Facebook, for example, is said to offer a $20,000 egg-freezing benefit for women employees.", "But until more is known, Dr. Schneider has written, \u201cAll women who undergo ovarian stimulation, especially more than once, should be told that their long-term health risks are unknown.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/science/moon-express-landers.html": ["A Florida start-up that is striving to become the first private company to put a spacecraft on the moon revealed an ambitious road map on Wednesday for a regular delivery service to send payloads there and elsewhere in the solar system.", "Moon Express of Cape Canaveral, Fla., was founded in 2010 to win the Google Lunar X Prize, a competition offering a $20 million prize for the first private venture to get to the moon with a robotic lander by the end of 2017.", "Robert D.

Julie Arnold, a spokeswoman for Moon Express, said the lander would be a little bigger than the R2-D2 robot from the movie \u201cStar Wars.\u201d", "The design change was made so that the lander would fit in a smaller rocket that Moon Express now plans to use for the first mission. \u201cThat\u2019s considered our starter vehicle, our entry-level vehicle, to reach the moon,\u201d Dr. Richards said.", "The MX-1E then becomes like a Lego piece, allowing Moon Express to use it as a building block for larger spacecraft.", "\u201cSpace vehicles and landers have traditionally been custom designed for each purpose,\u201d Dr. Richards said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve designed is a common core approach.\u201d", "Moon Express\u2019s second mission would use a larger spacecraft that looks like two soda cans, one stacked on top of the other, essentially two MX-1Es. One is almost the same as the lander on the first mission. The second module \u2014 without landing legs \u2014 is a propulsion stage that would enable the spacecraft to reach the moon\u2019s south pole, where ice persists inside craters that are eternally in shadows. .", "Ice is a valuable resource for future human settlements, beyond providing water to drink. Water molecules broken up into hydrogen and oxygen could not only provide air for astronauts to breathe, but also rocket propellent. The ice at the bottom of the craters probably preserves molecules from the earliest days of the solar system, too, which could be a boon for scientists.", "That same configuration, called MX-2, could also be sent as far away as the moons of Mars, but to land on Mars would require a more complex, more expensive vehicle beyond Moon Express\u2019s current designs. \u201cIt can get basically anywhere in the inner solar system,\u201d Dr. Richards said, meaning the neighborhood from the sun to Mars.", "Two additional configurations would put together multiple building block propulsion modules in larger moon landers. A propulsion module at the center could serve as a smaller vehicle that could blast off from the moon, bringing back rocks and soil samples to Earth.", "The cost of building and launching a MX-1E is less than $10 million, Dr. Richards said. NASA missions, by comparison, typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars.", "\u201cWe want to collapse the cost of getting to the moon and by doing so, there is going to be a brand new market that is going to emerge,\u201d Dr. Richards said.", "He said he hoped that in the years to come, Moon Express would be launching at least twice a year.", "Moon Express is not the only company betting on the moon, which has been largely overlooked since the end of NASA\u2019s Apollo missions four decades ago.", "The Google Lunar X Prize was intended to spur commercial endeavors, but the pace of progress has been slower and harder than organizers anticipated with the deadline extended twice.

He alone knew everybody in the room. He was the one who had brought Barcelona and Juventus together for the match that night, and he is the one who will host a similar scene on Saturday, when Barcelona plays Real Madrid in Miami.", "Who is Charlie Stillitano? The salt-and-pepper-bearded and perpetually gregarious son of a New Jersey cookie factory worker, Stillitano, 57, might be the most powerful, most well-connected soccer power broker you\u2019ve never heard of.", "How connected?

Instead, he makes his living in soccer as the chairman of Relevent Sports, the promoter that put on the Barcelona-Juventus match in East Rutherford and 11 others across the United States this summer. The tournament, collectively known as the International Champions Cup, and including a corresponding Asian version in China and Singapore, has quickly become the most high-profile summer exhibition tour in the world.", "The connections that Stillitano brings to the tournament, and that have made it a success, mean he is full of stories like Bradley\u2019s. So many of them, in fact, that he frequently interrupts the telling of one to begin another, making even a few hours with him a veritable matryoshka doll of Charlie stories.", "He will tell you about playing against Bradley in high school and alongside him at Princeton. He will introduce you to Martin O\u2019Connor, a lawyer whose clients include the former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and who has known Stillitano since they became fast friends as 13-year-olds.", "He will tell you all about dining with Ferguson \u2014 \u201cSir Alex says the best restaurant in NJ is Charlie\u2019s house,\u201d Bradley texted \u2014 or how he served as a ball boy at a 1973 friendly in Jersey City between Lazio and Santos, the Brazilian club then featuring Pel\u00e9. The stories have become so synonymous with Stillitano that if you Google the Santos friendly to check a fact, you\u2019ll find a number of the top results about the match are Stillitano\u2019s recalling it for other reporters.", "This is Stillitano the salesman, the marketer. A man who has remade his career selling European teams on the commercial promise of America, and American sports fans on the promise of top-level soccer. And it is temping to conclude that with his stories, Stillitano is selling you, too. But this isn\u2019t entirely true, because he has the track record to back him up.", "He will ask Pirlo to spend time with you, and Pirlo will dutifully comply, shifting his daughter onto his lap so you can ask him about the value of preseason friendlies.

In a different setting, he might introduce you to Ferguson, an irascible Scot who calls Stillitano \u201cgood people\u201d and \u201clovable\u201d in two of his books.

(That he began with an Italian club was not accidental; Stillitano is the son of an immigrant, and he eagerly and effortlessly shifted between English and Italian with his guests at the Juventus game.) The company put on matches for four years but filed for bankruptcy in 2005, owing creditors more than $2 million. Its biggest outstanding creditor was the United States Soccer Federation, to which ChampionsWorld had to pay sanctioning fees for each match it ran.", "ChampionsWorld sued, arguing that U.S. Soccer and Major League Soccer \u2014 which once employed Stillitano as the general manager of its New Jersey team, the MetroStars \u2014 had conspired to drive the company out of business. After a seven-year legal battle in which ChampionsWorld lost at both the Court of Arbitration for Sport and in federal court, the sides settled out of court.", "\u201cWhen I went bankrupt there were a lot of people kicking me when I was down,\u201d Stillitano said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a job as a dishwasher in soccer.\u201d He found refuge at Creative Artists Agency, just as it was making a large push into sports, and founded the World Football Challenge.", "Two important things happened with the World Football Challenge. Inter Milan and Chelsea won almost every possible trophy the season after participating in the 2009 edition, and the Dolphins owner Stephen M. Ross saw a 2011 Chivas-Barcelona match in his new team\u2019s stadium in Miami. That proved a preseason United States tour was rigorous preparation for the season, and the Miami match, which drew a crowd of about 70,000, persuaded Ross to hire Stillitano and his partner, Jon Sheiman, away from C.A.A. to create what would become the International Champions Cup.", "\u201cAfter I had the team, I said: \u2018Hey, I have this empty stadium. How do I get into this?\u2019\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeople in this country want to see the stars, that\u2019s what they\u2019re mostly interested in, and seeing the great teams in the world. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll really pay for and go see.\u201d", "Ross\u2019s vision was to turn what was effectively a ticket-selling operation into one that sold the television rights to the matches globally and sealed large sponsorship agreements \u2014 a proposition that was, potentially, far more lucrative. After losing millions of dollars during its first four years, the I.C.C., Ross said, will turn a profit this year.", "The marquee matchup is between Barcelona and Real Madrid in Miami, the first time the rivals have played each other outside Spain in over 30 years. Unlike the other matches in the I.C.C. this year \u2014 all of them glamorous matchups like Barcelona-Juventus, or Real Madrid-Manchester United, or United-Manchester City \u2014 Barca-Real is being sold not so much as a game but as a dayslong festival. A \u201cSuper Bowl experience,\u201d in the words of one Relevent executive.", "It is a model Relevent hopes to repeat, perhaps soon; Barcelona\u2019s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, said last week that the teams were already discussing doing it again. Stillitano will surely be happy to arrange it.", "When Barcelona defeated Juventus by 2-1 on Saturday night at MetLife Stadium, it did so in front of 82,104 fans and on the strength of two goals by Neymar, its star Brazilian forward. The largest soccer crowd in New Jersey history saw two teams play their first-choice starters for at least 45 minutes, and Juventus pressed hard for the tying goal until the final whistle.", "\u201cWe cringe when managers say it\u2019s just a training session,\u201d Stillitano said, one day after the new Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde dismissed the match \u2014 his first in charge at the club \u2014 as \u201cnot an official competition.\u201d", "Maldini, the former A.C. Milan and Italian national team defender who works as an I.C.C. ambassador, disagreed. \u201c82,000 fans?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a friendly. There is no friendly game at this level.\u201d", "This is what Stillitano and Relevent Sports want American soccer fans to believe: that the I.C.C. is a serious endeavor and a fixture on the soccer calendar, not a glorified exhibition tournament or a brazen cash grab.", "\u201cI think it is incumbent to ensure that we keep improving the quality of the matchups themselves, and keep positioning the I.C.C. as really the big reveal,\u201d said Matt Higgins, the co-founder and chief executive of RSE Ventures, which owns Relevent Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time when everyone who has been thirsting for soccer to return gets a taste of the most important narratives.\u201d", "It is up to Stillitano to book the actors, and to sell the narratives, but he has been in the game long enough to know that when you have all the biggest names in soccer in one place, the buzz takes care of itself. The most important narrative on Saturday was whether Paris Saint-Germain would succeed in an audacious bid to pry Neymar away from Barcelona. Martin Kallen, the chief executive of UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe, joked that he was in town just to \u201csee which players are on the Barca roster.\u201d", "For Stillitano, watching Neymar\u2019s Barcelona torment the Juventus back line, it didn\u2019t really matter how the Neymar drama ended, only that everybody was talking about him.", "After all, Paris Saint-Germain is playing in the International Champions Cup, too.", "This isn\u2019t the only professional soccer currently being played this summer in the United States, of course. Major League Soccer is in the middle of its regular season, and an important regional championship, the Gold Cup, just finished a three-week run.", "Soccer United Marketing, M.L.S.\u2019s marketing arm, owns the commercial rights to both of those properties, as well as various others, and that makes them direct competitors of Relevent for consumers who may not even be aware of that battle. Both sides say nice things about each other \u2014 the phrase \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d was used repeatedly in recent weeks by executives on either side \u2014 but in the end they are pushing two fundamentally different visions of soccer in America.", "Major League Soccer believes that the I.C.C. is a two-week sideshow and that it has the deeper relationship with American soccer fans. Relevent Sports counters that American fans want to see the highest level of the sport, and points to full stadiums for its matches as proof that it is right. While the pie of revenue in American soccer may be growing, it is hard to believe each company doesn\u2019t covet the chance to cut into the other\u2019s share.", "In the meantime, Stillitano is more concerned with decidedly first-world soccer problems. And sometimes appeasing billion-dollar clubs and making all of their leaders feel as if they\u2019re his favorite isn\u2019t as easy as it looks.", "Take, for example, the swimming pool. Both Real Madrid and Manchester United wanted to be based at the University of California, Los Angeles, which created a problem with facilities. More specifically, both teams wanted to use the same swimming pool after training sessions.", "To resolve the issue, Stillitano first went to the Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, and told him Relevent would build a pool for his team. But Zidane wasn\u2019t having any of it. So Stillitano went to his good friend Mourinho, the United manager, with the same offer.", "\u201cJos\u00e9 said, \u2018I trust you,\u2019\u201d said Stillitano, who admitted that he then faced the frightening reality that he had no idea how to build a pool, or even if U.C.L.A. would allow him to do it. (The university did, and the pool was built.)", "In many ways, the pool was symbolic; in the I.C.C.\u2019s fifth year, and in Stillitano\u2019s second decade of putting on friendlies, Relevent has logistics like that down to a science. But despite Ross\u2019s deep pockets, and despite Relevent\u2019s long-term deals with some teams, soccer remains a relationships business.", "And nobody has stronger relationships than Charlie Stillitano."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/technology/personaltech/adding-new-fonts-to-the-computer.html": ["Q.

I\u2019ve spent the last year researching the future of the corporate campus \u2014 not with the goal of accommodating the desires of all those curious tourists, but through the lens of urbanism. The project has explored how the Bay Area\u2019s workplaces might become more socially, economically and sustainably efficient, but also how applying new ways of thinking about the design, form and location of these buildings could help create a sense of place. It\u2019s become somewhat urgent \u2014 the world\u2019s leading innovation region is seeing many warning signs that its continued success is not a given.

Do consider the broader context.", "The built environment of the Valley does not reflect the innovation that\u2019s driving the region\u2019s stratospheric growth; it looks instead like the 1950s. Looking at aerial views of midcentury campuses like the Eero Saarinen-designed Bell Labs next to contemporary ones like Apple, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell the midcentury structures from the 21st-century ones.", "Designing job centers this way contributes mightily to the region\u2019s ever-worsening traffic. If you found yourself stuck on Highway 101 between San Francisco and San Jose, you\u2019d really see what Silicon Valley looks like for many.

Zoning makes building near transit difficult if not illegal and makes a mix of uses (like housing, retail and work) nearly impossible.

(To help us sort out this swirl, Freed has thoughtfully prefaced her tale with a list of dramatis personae.)", "If on its surface \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d is a warts-and-all repudiation of the late-in-life female empowerment yarn as typified by the movies \u201cEnchanted April\u201d and \u201cShirley Valentine,\u201d the gimlet-eyed Freed is intent on something deeper and more unsettling. Can we ever really absent ourselves, even briefly, from the important people in our lives? Is it lunacy to think we have an essential self \u2014 a self that exists outside our relationships to other people? Why is freedom so terrifying?", "Though Freed is too smart to give away the answers to these questions, she puts the best encapsulation of their essential paradox into the mouth of the least reflective of the book\u2019s major characters. \u201cI want something without a word for it,\u201d Bess tells Ruth toward the end of the novel. \u201cI always have.

So chockablock is \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d with unregenerate characters saying off-putting or vile things to one another that this pantywaist reader occasionally longed for the quietudes found in the work of that other chronicler of women of a certain age, Barbara Pym, who can get a lot of mileage out of, say, an ambiguous smile from a local vicar at a jumble sale.", "But as we know from Freed\u2019s 2005 essay collection, \u201cReading, Writing and Leaving Home: Life on the Page,\u201d Freed, who grew up in Durban, South Africa, is not one to pull her punches. In that book she recounts how she once regaled dinner party guests with a somewhat enhanced account of her husband\u2019s snoring; she asserts that it\u2019s a writer\u2019s duty to deliver the goods, even if those goods offend. (Her husband left the room in a huff.) In the case of \u201cThe Last Laugh,\u201d which takes a satirical stance toward a genre that teeters on the divide between charm and treacle, Freed\u2019s take-no-prisoners aesthetic would seem to be called for. And so, in the land of olive oil Ruth and her friends find mostly vinegar. That said, I wasn\u2019t sure that I needed to know that Gladness, one of the book\u2019s few likable characters, suffers from constipation, or that Dionysos\u2019 wife has \u201can uneven set of cigarette teeth,\u201d or that Dionysos himself has \u201csmall, white, hairy fingers\u201d and wears a truss.", "Yet these are smallish quibbles. In the end, Freed\u2019s candor works to lift the veil off the misperception that life after 60 consists mostly of conversations about sciatica or ceaseless and slightly abject devotion to a tiny, shivery dog. Not for these ladies the lavender-redolent consolations of dozing off in old age\u2019s quiet meadow. No, Ruth and Bess and Dania\u2019s sojourn on their paradisal-looking island is full of tension \u2014 a tension that might beg the phrase \u201can exercise in suffering.\u201d People cheat.

It works with both Apple and Android devices and has a battery life of about a day. Like the Apple Watch, it charges when you click on to a magnetic pad, connects to your phone via Bluetooth and also works with Wi-Fi. It comes in three finishes (polished steel, brushed steel and full black), and it has 30 different straps for men and 30 for women, which snap on and off with a satisfying ease.", "So far, so not surprising.

To me, it seems, largely, to be solving problems that aren\u2019t actually there, and creating new ones. (Like: How do you justify talking to your forearm in a public space?)", "But the Vuitton watch is a small step forward in certain areas.", "First, the watch face (which can be customized like a handbag in myriad ways \u2014 with various dials, with different color stripes, with Vuitton\u2019s monogram, with your monogram), never entirely goes dark. It fades a bit in sleep mode, but unlike, say, the Apple Watch, it does not become a black hole when your arm is at rest, thus obviating the need to wave said arm around endlessly to wake it up and so not look like an adult version of a \u201cStar Trek\u201d transporter.", "In addition, the Tambour, like the new mechanical Tambour Moon, has a convex side case, which allows maximum face diameter with minimum weight. So even though it\u2019s quite chunky for a watch, it is less chunky than some of its smart peers (42 mm in diameter, as opposed to 46 mm). That said, it still looks like a smartwatch.", "Second, it contains a cool proprietary app associated with the Louis Vuitton city guides. The watch will know where you are at what time and, like a very good concierge, will be able to recommend the best nearby restaurant or bar or shop in seven world capitals. It also has a special travel app, which can track the progress of any flight and let you know of delays, gate changes, wait times and so on.", "The downside is you have to give it access to all your ticket information, which seems to me somewhat suboptimal from a privacy point of view. But when you do, Vuitton will sign a pledge stating that it will not share or use the information for any purpose other than helping you plan your travel.", "Third, it works in China. Vuitton has made special deals with local platforms like Weibo so that the corresponding platforms in the West will automatically switch for usage when appropriate. This is important to Vuitton, because the Chinese are its largest global watch consumer group, and to the rest of us, because if you\u2019re going to invest in a smartwatch, it would be very frustrating to have it not work while on a trip to one of the world\u2019s political and economic powers.", "The problem is the value proposition.", "The steel Tambours cost about $2,450, with the black version ringing in at $2,900. And though the operating system will receive the usual updates and could theoretically last five years or more, like any smartphone, its practical life span (i.e., the point at which it becomes obsolete because there\u2019s just a much cooler, newer option) is about two years. Maybe three.", "And $2,450 every two years \u2014 which, if you are a gadget freak, and most people attracted to this kind of watch probably are, is what you will be paying as you chase the next gen iteration \u2014 seems like an awful lot of money. Not to mention antithetical to the promise of luxury, and a brand like Vuitton, which is that its bags last \u2026 well, forever.", "After all, in acknowledgment of that somewhat truncated life span, most fashion smartwatches sell in the $200 to $350 range. The Apple Watch Sport starts at $269, and the Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s starts at $1,149. The Tag Heuer Connected is about $1,600, but unlike that watch, which was introduced with the promise that once it became pass\u00e9, owners could bring it in for credit toward an analog watch, the Vuitton smartwatch comes with no trade-up or -in incentives. Mr. Burke does not see it as an issue.", "\u201cIt\u2019s more akin to buying a pair of shoes,\u201d he said.

The Indonesian government currently conducts training for migrant workers before they go abroad, but it focuses on languages and practical skills. The preparation should also incorporate modules about religious extremism, and describe recruitment by radical groups as a form of exploitation because jihadis often extract money from migrant workers.", "More important, social networks for Indonesian workers abroad must be strengthened so that migrants have a community to turn to other than radical groups online. Pengajian could play a role \u2014 so long as their leaders are trained to counsel individuals vulnerable to radicalization without alienating them, much less driving them out, as happened with Ayu.", "Indonesian Muslim business associations in Hong Kong and elsewhere may also have a part to play. They could be encouraged by the Indonesian consulate to set up ventures with migrant workers, allowing workers who are attracted to extremist views to be exposed to other perspectives in a collegial setting.", "Such exposure has proved effective in other contexts. For example, a reformed terrorist in Lamongan, in East Java, has set up a livestock cooperative bringing together former radicals and nonradicals, and that proximity reportedly helped change some of the jihadis\u2019 views over time. Programs could be put in place in Hong Kong to get radical domestic workers involved in, for example, businesses selling Muslim garments and Islamic herbal medicine, goods in high demand among migrants.", "The causes that lead migrant maids and nannies to join jihad are complex. Deportations and arrests are no solution; if anything, they are a sign of failure, evidence that radicalization has already occurred. The Indonesian government\u2019s recent decision to block Telegram is an ineffectual form of prevention because it targets the means of radicalization rather than its sources.

Today nearly two-thirds of the federal budget covers so-called mandatory spending: Medicare and other health expenditures, Social Security payments, unemployment benefits, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Eventually, Lyft sees this as a way to supply its network with more cars to service riders, provided by partners like Waymo, General Motors and more.", "I\u2019m curious to hear your take on this, but my inclination is to believe it\u2019s a smart enough play by Lyft. If you believe that autonomous vehicles are the future \u2014 and literally almost every major company in transportation believes this is the case \u2014 then you need to position your business for a day in which there are more robot drivers than human ones. That could benefit Lyft, as they could take a larger cut of revenue from each ride they complete. (Admittedly, there are many other costs associated with driverless tech, to be clear.)", "However, Lyft just isn\u2019t as well funded as Uber, the $70 billion behemoth that is developing its own self-driving tech in house.

Sure, I understand wanting to have a stake in a transformative technology. But self-driving is a supercompetitive field right now. Every car company and every large tech company is working on self-driving software. And some of the biggest and most advanced self-driving companies \u2014 including Waymo, the Google spinoff, and MobileEye, which was just purchased by Intel \u2014 have signaled that their primary interest is to sell their tech to other companies.", "In other words, self-driving looks as if it\u2019s shaping up like the cloud business. There\u2019ll be two or three big providers that will sell tech to lots of different transportation companies. And those transportation companies \u2014 whether they\u2019re carmakers or shared-ride providers like Lyft or some other type of business \u2014 will build many different kinds of businesses using that licensed technology, just like Netflix stores its videos on Amazon\u2019s cloud.", "So it\u2019s weird to me to see all these transportation companies spending so much to create their own tech.

But his words are unlikely to slow down European efforts to expand people\u2019s control over their digital lives.", "Europe is at the heart of a global debate over the way companies like Google and Facebook, as well as national intelligence agencies, handle people\u2019s digital data. Some regulators in the 28-member bloc have called on companies and governments, particularly that of the United States, to comply with the region\u2019s tough privacy regulations.", "\u201cThose who want to play in our backyard must play by our rules,\u201d Viviane Reding, a member of the European Parliament from Luxembourg and a former top European Union official, said on Monday at a privacy conference in Berlin. \u201cProtection of our personal data shouldn\u2019t have a national barrier.\u201d", "Ms. Reding is an author of a European Union privacy law that will go into force in 2018. It will be able to impose fines of up to 4 percent of a company\u2019s global revenue for the most serious breaches of European data protection rules. Those penalties would apply to any company \u2014 even if it has no physical presence in Europe \u2014 that has customers within the European Union.", "At issue are communications via cellphones, as well as data generated in social media, online searches and e-commerce purchases.", "The protections pursued in the European Union include the so-called right to be forgotten, detailed by the bloc\u2019s highest court, which requires search giants like Google to remove links to online information in some cases.", "And Europe\u2019s national privacy regulators have vowed to take a tough line against a new pact between the United States and the European Union that is intended to ensure the relatively unimpeded flow of personal data across the Atlantic. The national regulators are wary of the ability of American law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor data to fight crime or terrorism.", "But American agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, argue that they actively monitor companies\u2019 access to individuals\u2019 digital data. They say that American privacy safeguards \u2014 including the United States Constitution \u2014 often provide better protection than the rules in other jurisdictions, including those in Europe.", "\u201cWe care about Europeans\u2019 privacy,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Obama said in Hanover, \u201cnot just Americans\u2019 privacy.\u201d", "Many European officials acknowledge that the region\u2019s privacy laws share many similarities with those in the United States.

On one floor, plants cover walls, making the office look like a jungle. Elsewhere is a Ping-Pong table.", "The young and the creative have been the engine that drove the advertising industry for decades. But those who once flocked to the business with dreams of making the next standout television commercial are no longer drawn to the industry in the same way. Some view advertising as stodgy \u2014 who wants to make a 30-second TV commercial when everyone they know is cutting the cord? \u2014 and some are lured by the riches and prestige of the technology industry.", "The result is that even storied agencies like McCann, which has produced campaigns such as the 1971 \u201cHilltop\u201d ad for Coca-Cola, now find themselves desperate for young people at the moment when the traditional advertising industry is struggling as never before to adapt to a changing media landscape that these same young people are shaping.", "\u201cThe biggest threat \u2014 and one of the biggest things that we talk a lot about \u2014 is not only attracting but retaining young talent because there are so many more options,\u201d said David Droga, the creative chairman and founder of the agency Droga5. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost people to Facebook.

Cue the employee happy hours, table tennis and free snacks. But the advertising industry faces much deeper issues that cannot be fixed with cosmetic changes.", "Cool new technologies like virtual reality have imperiled the art of the television commercial, which is still, in many ways, the bread and butter of advertising agencies. The proliferation of online ads has made advertising anathema. And money provides little incentive: Last year, the average salary for entry-level employees at agencies was about $35,500, according to the 4A\u2019s, an industry trade group. About 25 percent of the industry makes less than $50,400 a year.", "\u201cBeanbags and softball matches and a cool Twitter handle doesn\u2019t make young people want to work at your office,\u201d Mr. Droga said. To attract young people, he added, advertising agencies need to produce exciting work again, which many have stopped doing.", "Perhaps just as important, the advertising industry seems unable to shake the perception that it is stuck in the past. In a recent lawsuit that has shaken up the business, a woman accused the chief executive of J. Walter Thompson, one of the oldest agencies in the world, of rampant racist and sexist behavior, describing comments and scenes that seemed straight out of the 1960s \u201cMad Men\u201d era. The lawsuit has raised questions about gender and racial diversity and has prompted the industry to acknowledge longstanding problems with its culture.", "Even as many agency executives insist that their companies are still the best place for creative minds to shine, they are finding it more difficult to maintain their ranks. Turnover at advertising agencies is higher than in competitive industries like technology and management consulting, and the gap increased 10 percent in the last year, according to a study from LinkedIn and the 4A\u2019s.", "A lot is at stake: If agencies cannot recruit and retain top young talent, the craft of traditional advertising \u2014 an important part of culture for better or worse \u2014 could disappear.", "\u201cWe have to fill the pipeline with young talent,\u201d said Tony Weisman, chief executive in North America for the agency DigitasLBi. If agencies fail to recruit and keep top young employees, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to become archaic.\u201d", "Losing young talent is a problem other industries face as well. Established news organizations are losing people to relatively new outfits like Vice and BuzzFeed. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have made sweeping changes to their junior-banker programs in part because ambitious college graduates were turning to Silicon Valley.", "But while Wall Street can match the pay at places like Google and Facebook, advertising agencies cannot. So instead, they are trying to match some of the perks.", "The creative agency Deutsch offers free snacks and a barista at its New York office and free lunch at its Los Angeles office, moves that Mike Sheldon, the agency\u2019s chief executive in North America, said were modeled after Google. The agency also provides yoga classes, boot camp workout classes and wine tastings. The agency Ogilvy & Mather has beers on the first Friday of every month. McCann allows employees to brew their own beer that is then named after clients. One, named for the military contractor Lockheed Martin, is called Stealth Stout.", "Some agencies are also revamping their offices to look more like start-ups, with open seating plans and plush chairs. The agency BBDO has created a separate space in its New York office, called Xlab, where restless minds can experiment with virtual reality and drones. (In a bit of a twist, BBDO also happens to be behind the General Electric campaign aimed at getting young people to work for the company.)", "To reinforce that advertising is an actual career rather than a consolation prize or a steppingstone to something better, agencies like Ogilvy & Mather, Deutsch, Droga5 and DigitasLBi are also bolstering their training and mentorship programs.", "The changes are geared toward attracting and retaining people like Allan Holmes, 29, who joined the agency Leo Burnett in Chicago after graduating from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2011, but now works at Facebook\u2019s Creative Shop, the company\u2019s in-house agency. He said he was attracted to Facebook, which he joined roughly two years ago, because it had the \u201csame sort of energy\u201d as a start-up. And what got him most excited initially, he said, was his personal connection to the company \u2014 he met his girlfriend and best friend on social media. \u201cThe platforms mean everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely important.\u201d", "In the end, perks may do little to combat the advertising industry\u2019s loss of cachet.", "\u201cPeople no longer have that innate desire and that instinctive desire to be in our business,\u201d said Jay Haines, a founder of Grace Blue, a search firm that works with the advertising industry.", "But that does not mean the advertising agencies are going to stop trying.", "At IPG Mediabrands \u2014 like McCann, a part of Interpublic Group, one of the biggest ad holding companies \u2014 the pop hits were already cranked way up on a recent morning.

But it\u2019s a good deal more than that. The book is a pair of biographies (Snare, Vel\u00e1zquez), a series of critical essays, a history of King Philip\u2019s IV court, a cold-case mystery, a courtroom drama, an adventure story, a travelogue, a floor wax, a dessert topping.", "Whatever it is, it\u2019s extremely accomplished \u2014 a gleaming work of someone at the peak of her craft.", "Perhaps one of the most profound questions the book asks is: What on earth about a painting could so thoroughly rob a man of his senses that he\u2019d forsake his livelihood, his family, his most precious worldly stakes?", "\u201cI have looked at this portrait till my sight has become dazzled,\u201d Snare wrote in 1847. \u201cI have thought of it till my mind has grown confused.

Between the summer of 1849 and the fall of 1850, he abandoned his wife and four children and headed for New York, where he would show the painting at various venues along Broadway until it was no longer novel.

She makes sure that readers understand one of his most extraordinary gifts: \u201cCreating the illusion that the people you see are equally aware of your presence.\u201d", "In Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s hands, painting becomes a kind of theater, in which we, the bewitched spectators, are playing a vital and almost supernatural part.", "And Ms. Cumming revels in the miracle of his technique, noting how the slickness of a fellow in one of his portraits \u2014 who may or may not have been his barber \u2014 is conveyed solely \u201cby a mark about the size of this little letter i\u201d on his left eyelid. \u201cSomething in that mark suggests recoil,\u201d she writes. \u201cVel\u00e1zquez doesn\u2019t trust his sitter.\u201d", "But that\u2019s the most this self-effacing painter will ever do to convey his mistrust. He\u2019s modest to the point of self-annihilation.

One reason sales have been falling, analysts believe, is that people are increasingly worried about sugar, even the naturally occurring kinds.", "Finally, there are the environmental questions about the single-serve model pioneered by coffee companies such as Keurig and Nespresso, which creates a throwaway container with each serving. Every glass of Juicero juice needs its own pack, which is shipped from Los Angeles to the customer, although Mr. Evans said he was developing a compostable pack.", "To succeed, Juicero will have to buck these trends, and also clear a more pedestrian hurdle \u2014 persuading people to pay a premium for another kitchen doodad. \u201cSeven hundred dollars for a small cooking appliance is extremely high,\u201d said Virginia Lee, beverage analyst for Euromonitor. \u201cThere are a lot of appliances competing for counter space, never mind the wallet.\u201d", "Expensive as it is, what Mr. Evans has packed into that counter space is rather remarkable. Inside the machine is a series of gears and metal plates that exert 8,000 pounds of pressure on packs of chopped fruits and vegetables.", "To make a glass of juice, you insert a pack ($4 to $10 each) into the machine, close the door and press a button. There are five flavors, including Sweet Roots (carrot, beet, orange, lemon and apple) and Spicy Greens (pineapple, romaine, celery, cucumber, spinach, parsley and jalape\u00f1o).", "Each pack has a QR code on it. A camera in the machine scans the code on each pack and, using Wi-Fi, checks in with an online database. If the pack is no longer fresh, or has been deemed contaminated, the machine won\u2019t press it. If the pack is O.K., the gears start turning and out squirts the juice.", "So far, so complicated. But the real logistical feat is behind the scenes. To create those packs in the Los Angeles plant, workers receive truckloads of produce from nearby organic farms, triple-wash it, then chop it into specific shapes (carrots are finely diced, while beets are chunkier).", "A specialized machine then fills each pack. The packs are then sent by FedEx to users, who order them using Juicero\u2019s smartphone app.", "Mr. Evans and his investors speak of Juicero being a \u201cplatform\u201d for a new paradigm of food delivery. And they speak of commercial sales. Already, chain restaurants including Le Pain Quotidien have agreed to use Juicero. The hope is that bigger companies will put machines in their office kitchens, too.", "At this point, however, the investors betting millions don\u2019t have any sales data to reassure them. Instead, they have little more than Mr. Evans\u2019s enthusiasm for juice. He drinks it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He is so committed to a largely liquid diet that he rarely consumes water.", "\u201cOrganic cold-pressed juice is rainwater filtered through the soil and the roots and the stems and the plants,\u201d he said. \u201cYou extract the water molecules, the chlorophyll, the anthocyanin and the flavonoids and the micronutrients.

He even asked whether the classification category \u201cConfidential,\u201d which no two government agencies seem to define the same way, should be eliminated.", "In fact, Mr. Obama\u2019s distinction between genuine secrets and vaguely secret material echoes arguments that The New York Times and other news media organizations made after the WikiLeaks disclosures, some of which were published in The Times. A substantial percentage of the 250,000 cables consisted of articles published in local news media.

The redaction argument, department officials say, was won by the intelligence agencies, which feared that some of the information came from satellite surveillance.", "It turned out that this intelligence was published days after the exchange of emails, meaning that the data sent to Mrs. Clinton could not have come from those sources.

Which rural districts in India should receive rice at subsidized prices? All these decisions require not just knowing poverty exists, but pinpointing areas of greatest need.", "But until very recently, the data commonly used to answer these questions came almost exclusively from countrywide surveys, which are expensive and logistically challenging.

To verify this dubious economic miracle, we can turn to NASA, which has produced revealing nighttime satellite images.

North Korea is not the only country where satellite photos tell a story that differs from the one told by official data. A seminal paper in the American Economic Review found estimates of income growth in many places that differed from official data by as much as three percentage points annually.", "Satellite photos provide a level of geographic specificity that national accounts do not. Another set of researchers used visual algorithms (related to those that recognize your face on Facebook or help navigate cars) to analyze these images pixel by pixel. Through this process, they could quantify poverty in each square kilometer of Uganda.", "Satellite photos provide other useful information. In rural areas, we can see crops in the ground, allowing us to estimate harvest size \u2014 even before the actual harvest. This data gives us a direct window into an essential part of the economic lives of many of the world\u2019s rural poor. The information can be used to build early warning systems for crop failure, to create crop insurance or target other forms of assistance.", "There are many other important, unconventional sources of data. Consider cellphones. For most of the world\u2019s poor, each call and text has a very noticeable and real monetary cost.", "The economist Joshua Blumenstock at the University of Washington uses cellphone metadata (who calls whom, when and for how long) to measure wealth. For instance, people who make calls at certain times of the day are wealthier, and people who make lots of short calls tend to be poorer than people who make fewer, longer ones. In a paper in Science, using data from Rwanda, he quantifies poverty at very high levels of resolution, focusing not just on individual villages but on individual people.", "Of course, all these data sources \u2014 satellites, cellphones and many others \u2014 work even better in concert. Flowminder is a nonprofit organization that has taken on this challenge of combining data.", "We are beginning to see tangible benefits. For example, GiveDirectly, a nonprofit group that gives cash to the poor, now uses satellite imagery to identify villages where thatched roofs signal that they may need help. \u201cRemote sensing data can be powerful, especially when combined with cheap classification tools like crowdsourcing or machine learning,\u201d says Paul Niehaus, co-founder of the organization. \u201cThey\u2019ve let us strip cost and time out of the process.\u201d", "The World Bank recently held its Big Data Innovation Challenge. Many of the winners used novel data sets to improve measurement and decision making, and their titles paint vivid, if wonky, pictures: \u201cImproved Real Time Decision Making of Infrastructure Investments for the Philippines by Linking Geo-Spatial Road Network Data With Rich Geo-Tagged Social Data Collected Through Mobile Phones\u201d and \u201cCombining Taxi GPS Data and Open-Source Software for Evidence-Based Traffic Management and Planning.\u201d", "Some of these projects are about changing how we use old sources of data. Typically we take surveys to determine which variables are most correlated with poverty, such as having a thatched roof or a dirt floor or not having a toilet. These variables are then added up to form a score that ranks households. Those with the highest rank may be deemed eligible for help, whether it is a microloan, a food subsidy or a cash transfer.", "But this kind of simple score card does not take advantage of the latest technologies. For example, in the United States, modern credit scoring agencies do not simply add a few variables. They use predictive algorithms to scour data for complex relationships most associated with default, which are then combined into a tailored prediction of credit risk. Why should the financial services industry, where mere dollars are at stake, be using more advanced technologies than the aid industry, where human life is at stake?", "A winning World Bank Innovation Challenge project, with which I collaborated, aims to close this gap. Melissa Adelman, an economist at the World Bank and one of the lead researchers in our project, says: \u201cExisting surveys may contain much more information for poverty measurement than is actually used. We\u2019re exploring how many more of the poor could be identified and targeted for services by using machine-learning tools. It\u2019s exciting because those better algorithms are essentially free to use, so the benefit-to-cost ratio of any gain in targeting will be very large.\u201d", "All of these efforts improve efficiency.

Does the candidate have the kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning, or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions?", "It\u2019s easy to criticize the length of American campaigns, and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party\u2019s nominee. But in a weird way, the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test. Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a 90-minute test, a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions, listening to bad advice or saying something stupid.", "In early 2008, a person would have had plenty of reason to be skeptical about whether Barack Obama, who had served in the Senate for about three years and had never run anything larger than his Senate office, had the leadership chops to run the entire federal government. The fact that he ran his primary campaign more effectively than Mrs. Clinton was one piece of evidence that he did.", "The American campaign system has evolved over the years without any master plan. But whenever you groan about yet another state primary or long debate, look at it this way: If you were on the search committee to hire a C.E.O., you would want the longest, hardest simulation you could get. And in your role on this very large search committee, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re getting."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/us/why-parental-leave-policies-are-changing.html": ["A news article posted on Tuesday, San Francisco Approves Fully Paid Parental Leave, by Thomas Fuller, described a groundbreaking law that will give parents six weeks of fully paid leave when they have a new baby. Readers responded vigorously on Facebook, some to applaud the law and others to chide the United States for not offering such benefits as a matter of course.", "Here, three reporters for The New York Times \u2014 Jodi Kantor, an enterprise reporter who has written about gender, politics and the workplace; Noam Scheiber, a labor reporter based in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief \u2014 discuss their views on new family leave laws in California, New York and corporate America and what they might augur in terms of national policy.", "First up, Jodi Kantor.", "Dear Noam and Thomas,", "Here\u2019s a mashup of what I used to hear, as a reporter and parent, about the prospects for ever having state-mandated parental leave in the United States:", "Paid family leave may be desperately needed, but it\u2019s a political pipe dream. Democrats are unwilling to fight for it. The business world will never go for it. The United States just has terminally shoddy parental leave policies. (Cue dirgelike music and new parents giving longing glances to countries like Sweden, which grants 480 days of paid leave.)", "But now \u2014 every day \u2014 the statements above are becoming a little less true.", "On Tuesday San Francisco approved six weeks of fully paid leave for new parents. Last week, New York State adopted a measure that will phase in 12 weeks of paid family leave, which can be used to care for ailing relatives as well as new babies (the pay for higher-income workers will be partial; details here.) Similar laws have been passed in California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Washington State. Washington D.C. may be next; Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota are possibilities, too.", "To be clear, we\u2019re not talking about the arms race in the corporate and technology worlds to provide deluxe doses of paid parental leave \u2014 like the whole year that white-collar workers receive at Netflix. Those are voluntary corporate policies. We\u2019re discussing laws that will cover far more people: if you\u2019re a supermarket checkout clerk in Albany, your employer will for the first time be legally required to give you paid leave.", "So why is this finally happening now, and so fast? The push for paid parental leave has no clear leader. Aside from some long-dedicated activists and White House support, there\u2019s barely an organized movement at all. This isn\u2019t like the gay marriage effort, with a well-planned multiyear strategy and deep-pocketed financiers.", "One answer is demographics. Nearly 70 percent of mothers with children under 18 now work, according to the Labor Department. More than three-quarters of single mothers are sole breadwinners. The need for paid leave is more urgent and desperate than ever before.", "Another reason: generally speaking, workers are going to pay for the leave themselves, through small paycheck deductions similar to those taken out for familiar government programs like Medicare and Social Security. Most of the new programs are funded by tiny contributions, a dollar or two a week, that will be collected by the employer and paid out to the employee when the leave is taken. This is why opposition is pretty low \u2014 the government isn\u2019t footing the bill, and aside from possibly hiring temporary help to fill in for employees on leave, neither are businesses. The San Francisco law is an exception, requiring larger employers to fill in workers\u2019 paychecks beyond what the state-run system contributes.", "So, for the first time in United States history, we can start to see what a system of state-mandated parental leave might look like, beyond postpartum disability pay. By Swedish standards, it would still look like a messy patchwork, with wild swings in coverage depending on where you live and work, and plenty of gaps and exclusions. But we\u2019ve never had much of a system at all, so this is still a huge shift \u2014 especially since every one of the new laws covers paternity leave for men.", "Next, Noam Scheiber", "Dear Jodi,", "I completely agree: the quick succession of the New York and San Francisco measures suggests we\u2019re on the verge of something big here.

The Working Families Party, which was founded in New York in 1998 to pull Democrats to the left on economics, has made a concerted effort to elevate the issue since 2007, and the party is now active in a dozen states. The community organizing that party leaders and activists did back then \u2014 and the polling they consulted \u2014 identified paid leave as a cause that would excite both low-income and middle-class workers, especially women.", "The Rockefeller Family Fund has been active in funding research and advocacy work around the country on this issue and related ones, like paid sick leave.", "That said, the movement seems more dispersed, organic, and generally leaderless than the effort to advance marriage equality, as you point out. So we can\u2019t chalk it all up to a vast left-wing conspiracy.", "I\u2019d argue that economics is a big part of the story. In particular, and maybe a bit paradoxically, I think we\u2019re seeing the result of a tight labor market for those near the top, coupled with wage stagnation and downward mobility in the middle and at the bottom.", "For the high-earners, there\u2019s the arms race you talked about, with companies like Netflix and Google g expanding their leave policies to compete for top talent. But once companies lavish these benefits on highly sought engineers, it\u2019s not easy to stop there. You\u2019ll recall that Netflix initially excluded hourly workers from its policy of up to one year of paid leave, only to partially reverse course a few months later and offer hourly workers several months of parental leave at full pay amid mounting pressure from advocacy groups.", "And why were hourly workers so exercised about this? Again, economics. In the middle and bottom of the income spectrum, you have a generation\u2019s worth of stagnating and even declining real wages (except for a brief period in the mid-to-late 1990s), making it more and more necessary for middle- and working-class households to send two earners into the work force. But with two adults at work and the family dependent on both of their incomes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to take time off to care for a baby or a parent.", "As the Working Families Party likes to put it, the manufacturing worker who once made $20 or $30 an hour could support his whole family on that income, making it possible for his wife to raise the children or care for a parent.", "Now that he and his wife both have to work at Wal-Mart \u2014 and still bring home less money combined than he once did alone \u2014 they\u2019re out of luck when that baby arrives.", "Long story short, when workers who are struggling thanks in part to the lack of paid leave see more affluent workers getting heaping portions of it, it\u2019s no surprise that they start to demand something similar. Consider it a uniquely American form of consciousness-raising.", "One final (mercifully noneconomic) factor I\u2019d cite, which you and I have both written about: fathers, and their increasing determination to be involved in child-rearing. I think college-educated men our age \u2014 we\u2019re both Gen Xers \u2014 are the first generation of American men for whom it\u2019s more socially embarrassing to be A.W.O.L. when it comes to diaper-changing and school drop-offs than it is to be active participants. It\u2019s only natural that these fathers are, in turn, demanding workplace policies that accommodate their family obligations (as are their spouses, on their behalf). And you can\u2019t underestimate the political influence of a bunch of upper-middle-class 30- and 40-somethings.", "Put it all together, and I\u2019d expect the trend to keep accelerating.

Excluding purchases made with a wildly popular app by Starbucks, the amount of mobile payments would most likely be well below that $8.7 billion, payment industry experts say.", "Other customers coming out of Whole Foods that morning gave several reasons for not paying with their phones.

Thumbprint authentication and passcodes can make it almost impossible for a thief to use a stolen phone to pay for something.", "By contrast, a stolen credit card, or information from the card, can be easily misused until the theft is suspected or reported.", "Services like Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay use technology that allows the phone to make a credit card payment without transmitting the card\u2019s details into the store\u2019s payment system. This makes such services safer than, say, a card swipe, in which the card\u2019s number enters the store\u2019s systems and can be vulnerable to hackers.", "But because card users generally do not have to pay fraudulent charges, the more secure nature of phones may not ultimately be the big draw that leads consumers to use them more for payments.", "Another way to increase use might be to make paying with a phone far quicker than using a card. Services like Apple Pay are designed to be fast. But at some stores, the customer still has to sign when using such services. And even when that isn\u2019t the case, taking out a phone and making a payment is probably not that much faster than using a card.", "Many payments specialists say they believe that for mobile payments systems to take off, they have to reduce costs for retailers. Seeing the savings, retailers may then offer their customers benefits for using their phones to pay, like rewards programs.

The Fed has already signaled that it isn\u2019t planning a second step on the road to higher rates any earlier than June. The Fed will also not update its economic forecasts at this meeting, and the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will not hold a news conference. Those who closely watch the Fed will parse the post-meeting statement for clues. Everyone else can safely pass over this one.

Barclays, Deutsche Bank, the British lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group and Banco Santander of Spain are all expected to update investors on their results. The first quarter hasn\u2019t been kind to banks this year as uncertainty in the financial markets and problems in the oil and gas industry have weighed on results at the biggest American banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.

Chad Bray", "ECONOMY", "On Thursday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its initial estimate of economic growth in the first quarter of 2016. Wall Street is looking for a growth rate of 0.6 percent, well below the 1.4 percent annual rate of growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The likely slow pace of expansion comes despite healthy hiring, and if the economy did indeed stumble early this year, it would repeat the pattern of first-quarter deceleration seen in 2014 and 2015. As was the case in those years, most economists expect growth to quicken in the current second quarter. Nelson D.

In the late 1990s, the Justice Department and European Union regulators accused Microsoft of illegally trying to extend its dominant position in operating systems to Internet browsers and search. (Microsoft ultimately settled the cases.)", "But the rapid rise of mobile and tablet devices has pretty much rendered all that irrelevant. The latest version of Internet Explorer still has the largest market share for desktop Internet browsers, but it has only a negligible share for fast-growing mobile and tablet devices, where Google Chrome is far ahead.", "Technological change has also undermined the superficial similarities between the old Microsoft case and the new Android one. Back then, consumers who wanted a rival browser like Netscape to run on their Windows operating system rather than the (free) Explorer had to go to a store, pay for a disk with a rival program and then install it.", "Today, a free rival browser is a tap away.

He can always give you something else, which is a little dangerous, because you lose all sense of time. Every new take, you get something else on top of the greatness you already had.

There\u2019s a lot of concern about how that is influencing our present-day experience and also about what that will do for the new generation. Sherry Turkle writes about this, and I think we can see in many kids a kind of thinness of interaction where they\u2019re not spending the kind of face-to-face time that you might want them to.

So, if awe is not happening in the digital world that would decrease our ability to reach out to other people and the natural world.", "I\u2019ve been exploring this in different ways, one of which was examining whether there\u2019s a hybrid approach to these challenges. When my son was around eight or nine, he was with me in in the middle of a very suburban part of Florida, visiting his grandparents, and we went in a little rowboat. There was a little, tiny nook of mangroves. He had my video camera. He was shooting a little documentary, very funky and kid-like, swinging the camera back and forth.", "But then we went to an area where there were some herons nesting in the mangroves, deep inside the shrubbery.

I posted it on YouTube and put it on my blog.", "You could hear his voice when he zoomed in and caught the image of the bird. It was a great moment, where you could hear his breath. He had that awe moment you were just talking about. But he was then sharing it digitally. He told the story in a way that was facilitated by digital media.", "If those stories can evoke this sense of connecting to something larger than our personal, separate selves, I think that\u2019s just fantastic. That\u2019s going to be the challenge, I think, for all of us in the immediate future.", "I remember once talking to a photographer who would go out to these wild places, like the North Pole.

There\u2019s nothing I can do about it, so I\u2019m going to change my focus of attention and not pay attention to this thing that makes me feel so helpless.

This is as true for BBC and The New York Timesas everyone else. To grab attention now, there\u2019s a torquing towards the caricature. In some ways, a sustainability mechanism now is to develop the capacity to know what\u2019s real. We had it so easy in the old days. We didn\u2019t have to think.

How did it get into their consciousness? Trace it back. Where did this factoid come from?", "This is more about news information than about some of the things you were just talking about feeling. But I think it gets people into the mode of stopping and thinking about how they thought something. Did the Yankees win or lose? How did I learn that fact today? Where did it come from? Tracing these things back to their source is helpful. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s a way to learn how the web works. Someone tweeted something, and that was blogged by someone else, and then it goes somewhere else. You can actually trace things pretty far back if you take a few minutes. It\u2019s a way to become aware of how ideas are moving around.", "It would be interesting to do that with a feeling the same way. I\u2019m bummed out. Where did that come from?

Integration is how we make sense of our lives. You\u2019re linking different aspects of your life across time, different aspects of your relational life, and even different aspects of your brain together. And that linkage of differentiated parts across all those levels, not just in the brain, is called integration.", "Integration creates, basically, equanimity. It creates a sense of well-being. It creates all sorts of improvements in the way your physiology works.", "This relates to something I write about at the end of the Brainstorm, which is the notion of a \u201cmwe.\u201d Mwe is the combination of an individual \u201cme,\u201d but you\u2019re also equally, just differentially, a connected person. You\u2019re connected to other people, your family, your friends, your teachers, the larger human family\u2014in fact, the family of all living beings, the whole Earth.

It doesn\u2019t have to be one or the other. An integrated identity would be both a \u201cme\u201d and a \u201cwe.\u201d It allows you to enjoy this body and really love the world in which you live.", "Kind of a hybrid approach to things. One of the things you pursued or explained when I saw you at the Garrison was something you described as the \u201cwe map.\u201d Two aspects of that struck me as valuable to a broader sustainability discussion. One is, maybe with intentionality, that\u2019s where you could see the upside of social networks online. There are social networks that are physical, of course, but the idea of the \u201cwe map\u201d seems compatible with a constructive use of social media to build that sense of you that\u2019s not within your body. That\u2019s your sense of community.", "I think there\u2019s untapped potential to use these tools to have a bigger potential of \u201cwe-ness,\u201d to make sure that ideas are shared and shaped where they\u2019re needed most, or to build collaborative conversations. But there are so many competing uses of the same portals, such as selling stuff and saying mean things. It\u2019s hard to know which will win out.", "There\u2019s huge potential for it. If we can start to expand our conversations about what the self is, then I think people will be using all of their incredible creative potential, especially the adolescents coming up, to realize that you can find all sorts of ways of changing the relationality that we have to the planet to make it more robust for the well-being of the whole community.

I think it\u2019s going to be a win/win situation. I think people are going to feel better, because it\u2019s really more about the truth. And all of the studies show a sense of well-being comes when you\u2019re really a part of something larger than your private bodily self. We just need to work collaboratively to make it happen.", "One other thing that comes to mind is the time I spent at the Vatican in 2014 at the meeting that preceded the encyclical and then writing about the pope\u2019s involvement in the climate question.

Our choices are moral and their functions are feelings as much as facts.

But what he really wanted was a trap that behaved unpredictably. That would really throw his friends off guard. How to do it, though? He obsessed over the problem.", "Then it hit him: the animals! Minecraft contains a menagerie of virtual creatures, some of which players can kill and eat (or tame, if they want pets). One, a red-and-white cowlike critter called a mooshroom, is known for moseying about aimlessly. Jordan realized he could harness the animal\u2019s movement to produce randomness. He built a pen out of gray stones and installed \u201cpressure plates\u201d on the floor that triggered a trap inside the maze. He stuck the mooshroom inside, where it would totter on and off the plates in an irregular pattern.", "Presto: Jordan had used the cow\u2019s weird behavior to create, in effect, a random-\u00adnumber generator inside Minecraft.

On-screen, he steered us over to the entrance to the maze, and I peered in at the contraptions chugging away. \u201cMy art teacher always says, \u2018No games are creative, except for the people who create them.\u2019 But she said, \u2018The only exception that I have for that is Minecraft.\u2019\u2009\u201d He floated over to the maze\u2019s exit, where he had posted a sign for the survivors: The journey matters more than what you get in the end.", "Since its release seven years ago, Minecraft has become a global sensation, captivating a generation of children.

It\u2019s more like a destination, a technical tool, a cultural scene, or all three put together: a place where kids engineer complex machines, shoot videos of their escapades that they post on YouTube, make art and set up servers, online versions of the game where they can hang out with friends. It\u2019s a world of trial and error and constant discovery, stuffed with byzantine secrets, obscure text commands and hidden recipes. And it runs completely counter to most modern computing trends. Where companies like Apple and Microsoft and Google want our computers to be easy to manipulate \u2014 designing point-and-click interfaces under the assumption that it\u2019s best to conceal from the average user how the computer works \u2014 Minecraft encourages kids to get under the hood, break things, fix them and turn mooshrooms into random-\u00adnumber generators. It invites them to tinker.", "In this way, Minecraft culture is a throwback to the heady early days of the digital age. In the late \u201970s and \u201980s, the arrival of personal computers like the Commodore 64 gave rise to the first generation of kids fluent in computation. They learned to program in Basic, to write software that they swapped excitedly with their peers. It was a playful renaissance that eerily parallels the embrace of Minecraft by today\u2019s youth. As Ian Bogost, a game designer and professor of media studies at Georgia Tech, puts it, Minecraft may well be this generation\u2019s personal computer.", "At a time when even the president is urging kids to learn to code, Minecraft has become a stealth gateway to the fundamentals, and the pleasures, of computer science.

What will the Minecraft generation become?", "\u201cChildren,\u201d the social critic Walter Benjamin wrote in 1924, \u201care particularly fond of haunting any site where things are being visibly worked on. They are irresistibly drawn by the detritus generated by building, gardening, housework, tailoring or carpentry.\u201d", "Playing with blocks, it turns out, has deep cultural roots in Europe. Colin Fanning, a curatorial fellow at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, points out that European philosophers have long promoted block-\u00adbased games as a form of \u201cgood\u201d play that cultivates abstract thought. A recent paper Fanning wrote with Rebecca Mir traces the tradition to the English political philosopher John Locke, who was an early advocate of alphabet blocks. A century later, Friedrich Froebel \u2014 often called the inventor of kindergarten \u2014 developed block-\u00adbased toys that he claimed would illustrate the spiritual connectedness of all things. Children would start with simple blocks, build up to more complex patterns, then begin to see these patterns in the world around them. Educators like Maria Montessori picked up on this concept and pioneered the teaching of math through wooden devices.", "During the political cataclysms of the 20th century, European thinkers regarded construction-\u00adplay not merely as a way to educate children but also as a means to heal their souls. The Danish landscape architect Carl Theodor Sorensen urged that areas in cities ruined by World War II be turned into \u201cjunk playgrounds,\u201d where children would be given pickaxes, hammers and saws and allowed to shape the detritus into a new civilization, at child scale. (Several were in fact created in Europe and were quite popular.) In Sweden, educators worried that industrialization and the mechanization of society were causing children to lose touch with physical skills; they began teaching sloyd, or woodcrafting, a practice that continues today.", "When Fanning first saw Minecraft, he felt a jolt of recognition. Nearly all these historical \u00adimpulses were evident in the game. \u201cIt\u2019s striking to me how much this mirrors the appeal and the critical reception of Minecraft,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Scandinavian toys, the material of wood has had a really long association with notions of timelessness and quality and craftsmanship.\u201d In Minecraft, as he notes, wood is one of the first resources new players gather upon entering the game: chopping trees with their avatar\u2019s hand produces blocks of wood, and from those they begin to build a civilization. Children are turned loose with tools to transform a hostile environment into something they can live in.", "Block-play was, in the European tradition, regarded as a particularly \u201cwholesome\u201d activ\u00adity; it\u2019s not hard to draw a line from that to many parents\u2019 belief that Minecraft is the \u201cgood\u201d computer game in a world full of anxiety about too much \u201cscreen time.\u201d In this way, Minecraft has succeeded Lego as the respectable creative toy. When it was first sold in the postwar period, Lego presented itself as the heir to the heritage of playing with blocks. (One ad read: \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see children playing with Lego \u2014 Lego play is quiet and stimulating. Children learn to grapple with major tasks and solve them together.\u201d) Today many cultural observers argue that Lego has moved away from that open-\u00adended engagement, because it\u2019s so often sold in branded kits: the Hogwarts castle from \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d the TIE fighter from \u201cStar Wars.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Buy the box, open the box, turn to the instruction sheet, make the model, stick it on the shelf, buy the next box,\u2019\u2009\u201d the veteran \u00adgame designer Peter Molyneux says in a 2012 documentary about Minecraft. \u201cLego used to be just a big box of bricks, and you used to take the bricks, pour them on the carpet and then make stuff. And that\u2019s exactly what Minecraft is.\u201d", "As a Swede, Markus Persson, who invented Minecraft and founded Mojang, grew up amid such cultural influences and probably encountered sloyd in school himself. In Minecraft, Persson created what Fanning calls \u201ca sort of digital sloyd.\u201d", "Persson, now 36, was a child of the \u201980s computer scene who learned to program when he was 7 on his father\u2019s Commodore 128. By the time he was in his 20s, he was working for an online photo-\u00adalbum site and programming games in his spare time at home, an apartment littered with game CDs and soda bottles. He released the first version of Minecraft in 2009. The basic play is fairly simple: Each time you start a new game, Minecraft generates a unique world filled with hills, forests and lakes. Whatever the player chops at or digs into yields building blocks \u2014 trees provide wood, the earth dirt and stone. Blocks can be attached to one another to quickly produce structures. Players can also combine blocks to \u201ccraft\u201d new items. Take some stone blocks, add a few pieces of wood, and you make a pickax, which then helps you dig more quickly and deeper, till you reach precious materials like gold, silver and diamond. \u201cMobs,\u201d the game\u2019s creatures (\u201cmob\u201d is short for \u201cmobile\u201d), can be used for crafting, too. Kill a spider, and you get spider silk, handy for making bows and arrows.", "In its first year, Minecraft found popularity mostly among adult nerds. But sometime in late 2011, according to Alex Leavitt, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California, children discovered it, and sales of the game exploded. Today it costs $27 and sells 10,000 copies a day. (It\u2019s still popular across all age groups; according to Microsoft, the average player is between 28 and 29, and women make up nearly 40 percent of all players.) Persson frequently added new features to the game, like a \u201csurvival mode,\u201d in which every 20 minutes evening falls and monsters attack \u2014 skeletons shooting arrows, \u201ccreepers\u201d blowing themselves up when they get close to you \u2014 forcing players to build protective shelters. (\u201cCreative mode\u201d is just about making things.)", "Persson also made it possible for players to share their works. You could package your world as a \u201cmap\u201d and post it online for others to download and move around in. Even more sophisticated players could modify Minecraft\u2019s code, creating new types of blocks and creatures, and then put these \u201cmods\u201d online for others to use. Further developments included a server version of Minecraft that lets people play together on the Internet inside the same world. These days, kids can pay as little as $5 a month to rent such a server. They can also visit much larger commercial servers capable of hosting hundreds or thousands of players simultaneously. There is no single, central server: Thousands exist worldwide.", "The game was a hit. But Persson became unsettled by his fame, as well as the incessant demands of his increasingly impassioned fans \u2014 who barraged him with emails, tweets and forum posts, imploring him to add new elements to Minecraft, or complaining when he updated the game and changed something. By 2014, he\u2019d had enough. After selling Minecraft to Microsoft, he hunkered down in a $70 million mansion in Beverly Hills and now refuses to talk about Minecraft any more.", "I wanted to know whether the European tradition of block-play had influenced him, but Persson politely declined to be interviewed. Via a public reply to me on Twitter, he explained that he \u201csold Minecraft to get away from it.\u201d", "Nearly everyone who plays Minecraft, or even watches someone else do so, remarks on its feeling of freedom: All those blocks, infinities of them! Build anything you want! Players have re\u00adcreated the Taj Mahal, the U.S.S. Enterprise from \u201cStar Trek,\u201d the entire capital city from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d It\u2019s the most obvious appeal of the game. But I first started to glimpse how complex Minecraft culture can be when I saw what kids were doing with what\u2019s called \u201credstone,\u201d the game\u2019s virtual wiring. My two sons had begun using it: Zev, who is 8, showed me an automated \u201cpiston door\u201d and stone gateway he built. Gabriel, who is 10, had created a \u201cminigame\u201d whose actions included a mechanism that dropped anvils from a height, which players on the ground had to dodge.", "Redstone transports energy between blocks, like an electrical connection. Attach a block that contains power \u2014 a redstone \u201ctorch,\u201d for example, which looks like a forearm-size matchstick \u2014 to one end of a trail of redstone, and anything connected to the other end will receive power. Hit a button here, and another block shifts position over there. Persson ingeniously designed redstone in a way that mimics real-world electronics. Switches and buttons and levers turn the redstone on and off, enabling players to build what computer scientists call \u201clogic gates.\u201d Place two Minecraft switches next to each other, connect them to redstone and suddenly you have what\u2019s known as an \u201cAND\u201d gate: If Switch 1 and Switch 2 are both thrown, energy flows through the redstone wire. You can also rig an \u201cOR\u201d gate, whereby flipping either lever energizes the wire.", "These AND and OR gates are, in virtual form, the same as the circuitry you\u2019d find inside a computer chip. They\u2019re also like the Boolean logic that programmers employ every day in their code. Together, these simple gates let Minecraft players construct machines of astonishing complexity.", "One day this winter, I met Sebastian, a 14-year-old, at his home in New Jersey, where he showed off his redstone devices. One was a huge \u201ctrading post,\u201d a contraption that allows players on either side of a large wall to trade items through an automated chute. It required a large cluster of AND gates, he said, and took him several days to figure out.", "\u201cHop down here,\u201d he said, moving down into a subterranean pit beneath the apparatus and looking around. (In Minecraft, you see the world from the viewpoint of your in-game avatar.) It was like being in the bowels of a factory: the redstone sprawled in all directions. He pointed out different parts of the wiring, rattling off components like an architect at a construction site. \u201cComing in from these two wires are the lever inputs from the side \u2014 and from over here, the other side. And what these do is, when they\u2019re both on, they power a piston, which pairs redstone to this block up into this tower dispenser.\u201d", "Mastering redstone requires rigorously logical thinking, as well as a great deal of debugging: When your device isn\u2019t working, you have to carefully go over its circuitry to figure out what\u2019s wrong. One fifth \u00adgrader I visited, Natalie, was assembling a redstone door on her iPad while I watched. But nothing happened when she flicked the \u201con\u201d lever. \u201cI did that wrong,\u201d she said with a frown, and began tracing her way through the circuit. Eventually the problem emerged: A piece of redstone was angled incorrectly, sending the current in the wrong direction.", "This is what computer scientists call computational thinking, and it turns out to be one of Minecraft\u2019s powerful, if subtle, effects. The game encourages kids to regard logic and if-then statements as fun things to mess around with. It teaches them what computer coders know and wrestle with every day, which is that programs rarely function at first: The work isn\u2019t so much in writing a piece of software but in debugging it, figuring out what you did wrong and coming up with a fix.", "Minecraft is thus an almost perfect game for our current educational moment, in which policy makers are eager to increase kids\u2019 interest in the \u201cSTEM\u201d disciplines \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math. Schools and governments have spent millions on \u201clet\u2019s get kids coding\u201d initiatives, yet it may well be that Minecraft\u2019s impact will be greater. This is particularly striking given that the game was not designed with any educational purpose in mind. \u201cWe have never done things with that sort of intent,\u201d says Jens Bergensten, the lead Minecraft developer at Mojang and Persson\u2019s first hire. \u201cWe always made the game for ourselves.\u201d", "Other Minecraft features resemble the work of software engineers even more closely. For example, programmers frequently write code and control their computers through a bare-bones interface known as the \u201ccommand line,\u201d typing abstruse, text-\u00adbased commands rather than pointing and clicking. Many programmers I know complain that while the point-and-click world has made computers easier to use for everyday people, it has also dumbed us down; kids don\u2019t learn the command line the way they would have back when personal-\u00adcomputer use emerged in the \u201970s and \u201980s. This is partly why newcomers can find programming alienating: They\u2019re not accustomed to controlling a computer using only text.", "But Minecraft, rather audaciously, includes a command line and requires players to figure it out. Type \u201ct\u201d or \u201c/\u201d while playing the game, and a space appears where you can chat with other players or issue commands that alter the environment. For example, typing \u201c/time set 0\u201d instantly changes the time of day inside the game to daybreak; the sun suddenly appears on the horizon. Complex commands require a player to master chains of sophisticated command-\u00adline syntax.", "One day last fall, I visited Gus, a seventh \u00adgrader in Brooklyn. He was online with friends on a server they share together, engaging in boisterous gladiatorial combat. I watched as he typed a command to endow himself with a better weapon: \u201c/give AdventureNerd bow 1 0 {Unbreakable:1,ench:[{id:51,lvl:1}],display:{Name:\u201cDestiny\u201d}}.\u201d What the command did was give a bow-\u00adand-\u00adarrow weapon to AdventureNerd, Gus\u2019s avatar; make the bow unbreakable; endow it with magic; and name the weapon Destiny, displayed in a tag floating over the weapon. Gus had plastered virtual sticky-\u00adnotes all over his Mac\u2019s desktop listing the text commands he uses most often. Several commands can be packed into a \u201ccommand block,\u201d so that clicking on the block activates them, much as clicking on a piece of software launches it.", "Mimi Ito, a cultural anthropologist at the University of California, Irvine, and a \u00adfounder of Connected Camps, an online program where kids play Minecraft together, has closely studied gamers and learning. Ito points out that when kids delve into this hackerlike side of the game \u2014 concocting redstone devices or creating command blocks \u2014 they often wind up consulting discussion forums online, where they get advice from adult Minecraft players. These folks are often full-time programmers who love the game, and so younger kids and teenagers wind up in conversation with professionals.", "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the places where young people are engaging with more expert people who are much older than them,\u201d Ito says. These connections are transformative: Kids get a glimpse of a professional path that their schoolwork never illuminates. \u201cAn adult mentor opens up these new worlds that wouldn\u2019t be open to them,\u201d she adds. Of course, critics might worry about kids interacting with adults online in this way, but as Ito notes, when there\u2019s a productive task at hand, it\u2019s similar to how guilds have passed on knowledge for ages: knowledgeable adults mentoring young people.", "Ito has also found that kids\u2019 impulse to tinker with Minecraft pushes them to master real-world technical skills. One 15-year-old boy I interviewed, Eli, became interested in making \u201ctexture packs.\u201d These are the external shells that wrap around 3-D objects in the game, like a drape thrown over a table: Change the pattern on the drape, and you can change what the object looks like. Designing texture packs prompted Eli to develop sophisticated Photoshop skills. He would talk to other texture-\u00adpack designers on Minecraft forums and get them to send him their Photoshop files so he could see how they did things. He also began teaching himself to draw. \u201cI\u2019d be downloading the mod,\u201d he says, \u201clooking at the original texture and saying, \u2018O.K., how can I make this a little more cartoony?\u2019\u2009\u201d Then he would put his own designs up on the forums to get feedback, which, he discovered, was usually very polite and constructive. \u201cThe community,\u201d he says, \u201cis very helpful.\u201d", "While Minecraft rewards this sort of involvement, it can also be frustrating: Mojang updates Minecraft weekly, and sometimes new updates aren\u2019t compatible with an older version. Players complained to me about waking up to discover that their complex contraptions no longer worked. One player spent weeks assembling a giant roller coaster whose carts were powered by redstone tracks only to have an update change the way rails functioned, and the entire roller-\u00adcoaster mechanism never worked again. Others ruefully described spending months crafting cities on their own multiplayer servers, only to have a server crash and destroy everything.", "For Ito, this is all a culturally useful part of the experience: Kids become more resilient, both practically and philosophically. \u201cMinecraft is busted, and you\u2019re constantly fixing it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that home-brew aesthetic. It\u2019s kind of broken all the time. It\u2019s laggy. The kids get used to the idea that it\u2019s broken and you have to mess with it. You\u2019re not complaining to get the corporate overlord to fix it \u2014 you just have to fix it yourself.\u201d This is a useful corrective to other software. \u201cIPhone apps are kind of at the opposite end,\u201d Ito says. \u201cAnd the way that kids react when things are broken in the Apple ecosystem versus the Minecraft ecosystem is totally different. With [Apple] it\u2019s, \u2018Why are they broken?\u2019 Whereas with Minecraft it\u2019s like \u2014 \u2018Oh, they messed with something again, it\u2019s broken, we have to go figure out what they changed.\u2019 There\u2019s a sort of resignation to that the fact that you\u2019re tinkering all the time.\u201d", "Because Minecraft is now seven years old, Ian Bogost will soon have students at Georgia Tech who grew up playing the game. The prospect intrigues him. \u201cI\u2019m very curious to see what their attitude to technology is,\u201d he says.", "Two years ago, Ava, a fifth grader who lives on Long Island, whom I met through her aunt, a friend of mine, tried Minecraft for the first time. She started a \u201csurvival\u201d world and marveled at the jagged hills receding into the distance. But like most new players, she had no idea what to do. Night fell, mobs arrived and a skeleton staggered toward her. She mistakenly assumed it was friendly. \u201cI was like, Oh, hi, how are you?\u201d Ava says. \u201cAnd I died after that.\u201d", "Minecraft is an incredibly complex game, but it\u2019s also \u2014 at first \u2014 inscrutable. When you begin, no pop-ups explain what to do; there isn\u2019t even a \u201chelp\u201d section. You just have to figure things out yourself. (The exceptions are the Xbox and Play\u00adStation versions, which in December added tutorials.) This unwelcoming air contrasts with most large games these days, which tend to come with elaborate training sessions on how to move, how to aim, how to shoot. In Minecraft, nothing explains that skeletons will kill you, or that if you dig deep enough you might hit lava (which will also kill you), or even that you can craft a pickax.", "This \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d ethos resulted from early financial limitations: Working alone, Persson had no budget to design tutorials. That omission turned out be an inadvertent stroke of genius, however, because it engendered a significant feature of Minecraft culture, which is that new players have to learn how to play. Minecraft, as the novelist and technology writer Robin Sloan has observed, is \u201ca game about secret knowledge.\u201d So like many modern mysteries, it has inspired extensive information-\u00ad\u00adsharing. Players excitedly pass along tips or strategies at school. They post their discoveries in forums and detail them on wikis. (The biggest one, hosted at the site Gamepedia, has nearly 5,000 articles; its entry on Minecraft\u2019s \u201chorses,\u201d for instance, is about 3,600 words long.) Around 2011, publishers began issuing handbooks and strategy guides for the game, which became runaway best sellers; one book on redstone has outsold literary hits like \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d by Donna Tartt.", "\u201cIn Minecraft, knowledge becomes social currency,\u201d says Michael Dezuanni, an associate professor of digital media at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Dezuanni has studied how middle-\u00adschool girls play the game, watching as they engaged in nuanced, Talmudic breakdowns of a particular creation. This is, he realized, a significant part of the game\u2019s draw: It offers many opportunities to display expertise, when you uncover a new technique or strategy and share it with peers.", "The single biggest tool for learning Minecraft lore is YouTube. The site now has more than 70 million Minecraft videos, many of which are explicitly tutorial. To make a video, players use \u201cscreencasting\u201d software (some of which is free, some not) that records what\u2019s happening on-screen while they play; they usually narrate their activity in voice-\u00adover. The problems and challenges you face in Minecraft are, as they tend to be in construction or architecture, visual and three-\u00addimensional. This means, as many players told me, that video demonstrations have a particularly powerful explanatory force: It\u2019s easiest to learn something by seeing someone else do it. In this sense, the game points to the increasing role of video as a rhetorical tool. (\u201cMinecraft\u201d is the second-\u00admost-\u00adsearched-\u00adfor term on YouTube, after \u201cmusic.\u201d)", "That includes Ava on Long Island \u2014 who, after being killed by skeletons, began watching \u201csurvival mode\u201d videos to learn how to stay alive. Soon she had mastered that, and also discovered the huge number of YouTube videos in which players review \u201cminigames,\u201d little challenges that some Minecraft devotees design and load onto servers for others to play. (In one popular minigame, for example, players are shown a sculpture made of blocks and then try to copy it exactly in 30 seconds.) For young Minecraft fans, these videos are a staple of their media diet, crowding out TV. Ava\u2019s mother is genially baffled by this. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she told her daughter when I visited them last fall. \u201cWhy are you watching other people play the game? Why don\u2019t you just play?\u201d", "Ava had recently started her own YouTube channel with her friends Aaron and Patrick, where they play and review minigames. Her father set up a high-\u00adquality microphone on a telescoping arm bolted to the computer desk; her sister drew Ava a white sign that says: \u201cRECORDING.\u201d (Its back says: \u201cNOT RECORDING JUST WANT YOU TO BE QUIET.\u201d) As the family\u2019s gray cat wandered around Ava\u2019s keyboard, she dialed up Patrick on a Skype video call.", "When they record a video, they improvise freestyle banter while playing, and simply start all over again if something goes awry. (Which, Patrick said dryly, \u201chappens often.\u201d) So far they have 19 subscribers and have posted 21 videos.", "She played a recent video for me, in which they tried to navigate a difficult map filled with lethal, flowing lava. Their conversation is loose and funny; it\u2019s like listening to two talk-\u00adradio hosts, or perhaps the commentary over a game of basketball \u2014 if the commentary were delivered by the athletes themselves, while they play.", "Considered as a genre, YouTube Minecraft videos are quite strange. They take elements of \u201chow to\u201d TV \u2014 a cooking show, a home-\u00adrenovation show \u2014 and blend them with the vocal style of podcasting, while mixing in a dash of TV shows like \u201cOrange County Choppers,\u201d where ingenious mechanics parade their creations.", "\u201cI don\u2019t even know that I know how to properly classify them,\u201d says Ryan Wyatt, the head of gaming content for YouTube. Minecraft videos offer a glimpse of the blurring of the line between consumers and creators. Probably two-thirds of the kids I interviewed had started their own Minecraft channels on YouTube. Most of them were happy when even a handful of friends and family watched their videos.", "Some Minecraft broadcasters have become genuinely famous, though, and earn a good living from their work. These superstars aren\u2019t children, generally; they\u2019re young adults, like Joseph Garrett, known as Stampy Cat, a 25-year-old Briton with seven million YouTube subscribers. One of my children\u2019s favorite Minecraft broadcasters is a user named Mumbo Jumbo, another Briton, whose real name is Oliver Brotherhood, known for his instructional videos on using redstone. He is 20 and began posting his videos online when he was 16, he says. At first he did it for fun, until one video \u2014 which showcases 20 complex opening-\u00addoor devices \u2014 became an unexpected hit, netting him one million views. \u201cIt\u2019s not the next \u2018Gangnam Style,\u2019 but it was pretty good,\u201d Brotherhood says. As more fans found him, he began posting daily and now spends 50 hours a week shooting videos and replying to fans. Brotherhood delivered newspapers while in school, but a year ago his YouTube ad revenue outstripped it.", "\u201cI told my mom, \u2018I\u2019m quitting my paper round,\u2019 and she said, \u2018Why?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I do a YouTube channel, and it\u2019s earning me more.\u2019\u2009\u201d When his mother looked at his channel, she saw it had more than 40,000 subscribers and more monthly traffic than the corporate newspaper sites she consults for.", "Next year he plans to study computer science in college. \u201cIn the redstone community,\u201d he says, \u201ca lot of people around me are programmers.\u201d Teaching himself coding is much like learning Minecraft, he found; you experiment, ask questions on Internet forums. He described his YouTube channel on his college application, and that, too, \u201cseems to have helped,\u201d he says. The university accepted him without even seeing his final school grades.", "Last year, London, a 12-year-old in Washington State, set up a server so he could play Minecraft with friends. He left it public, open to anyone \u2014 which led to chaos when some strangers logged on one day to start \u201cgriefing,\u201d blowing up his and his friends\u2019 creations with TNT. He shut down the server and, a bit wiser now, started a new one with some strict rules. This one included a \u201cwhitelist,\u201d so only players pre\u00adapproved by London can log in, and a plug-in \u2014 a piece of code that changes how the server works \u2014 that prevents players from destroying what others have made.", "Most online games don\u2019t require kids to manage the technical aspects of how gamers interact. A hugely popular commercial game like World of Warcraft, for example, is played on a server run by its owner, Blizzard Entertainment. Game companies usually set the rules of what is and isn\u2019t allowed in their games; if you grief others, you might be banned by a corporate overlord. Or the opposite might happen: Abuse might be ignored or policed erratically.", "But Minecraft is unusual because Microsoft doesn\u2019t control all the servers where players gather online. There is no single Minecraft server that everyone around the world logs onto. Sometimes kids log onto a for-\u00adprofit server to play mini\u00adgames; sometimes they rent a server for themselves and their friends. (Microsoft and Mojang run one such rental service.) Or sometimes they do it free at home: If you and I are in the same room and we both have tablets running Minecraft, I can invite you into my Minecraft world through Wi-Fi.", "What this means is that kids are constantly negotiating what are, at heart, questions of governance. Will their world be a free-for-all, in which everyone can create and destroy everything? What happens if someone breaks the rules? Should they, like London, employ plug-ins to prevent damage, in effect using software to enforce property rights? There are now hundreds of such governance plug-ins.", "Seth Frey, a postdoctoral fellow in computational social science at Dartmouth College, has studied the behavior of thousands of youths on Minecraft servers, and he argues that their interactions are, essentially, teaching civic literacy. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these kids, and they\u2019re creating these worlds, and they think they\u2019re just playing a game, but they have to solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity,\u201d Frey says. \u201cThey have to solve the tragedy of the commons.\u201d What\u2019s more, they\u2019re often anonymous teenagers who, studies suggest, are almost 90 percent male (online play attracts far fewer girls and women than single-\u00adplayer mode). That makes them \u201cwhat I like to think of as possibly the worst human beings around,\u201d Frey adds, only half-\u00adjokingly. \u201cSo this shouldn\u2019t work. And the fact that this works is astonishing.\u201d", "Frey is an admirer of Elinor Ostrom, the Nobel Prize-\u00adwinning political economist who analyzed the often-\u00adunexpected ways that everyday people govern themselves and manage resources. He sees a reflection of her work in Minecraft: Running a server becomes a crash course in how to compromise, balance one another\u2019s demands and resolve conflict.", "Three years ago, the public library in Darien, Conn., decided to host its own Minecraft server. To play, kids must acquire a library card. More than 900 kids have signed up, according to John Blyberg, the library\u2019s assistant director for innovation and user experience. \u201cThe kids are really a community,\u201d he told me. To prevent conflict, the library installed plug-ins that give players a chunk of land in the game that only they can access, unless they explicitly allow someone else to do so. Even so, conflict arises. \u201cI\u2019ll get a call saying, \u2018This is Dasher80, and someone has come in and destroyed my house,\u2019\u2009\u201d Blyberg says. Sometimes library administrators will step in to adjudicate the dispute. But this is increasingly rare, Blyberg says. \u201cGenerally, the self-\u00adgoverning takes over. I\u2019ll log in, and there\u2019ll be 10 or 15 messages, and it\u2019ll start with, \u2018So-and-so stole this,\u2019 and each message is more of this,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd at the end, it\u2019ll be: \u2018It\u2019s O.K., we worked it out! Disregard this message!\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Several parents and academics I interviewed think Minecraft servers offer children a crucial \u201cthird place\u201d to mature, where they can gather together outside the scrutiny and authority at home and school. Kids have been using social networks like Instagram or Snapchat as a digital third place for some time, but Minecraft imposes different social demands, because kids have to figure out how to respect one another\u2019s virtual space and how to collaborate on real projects.", "\u201cWe\u2019re increasingly constraining youth\u2019s ability to move through the world around them,\u201d says Barry Joseph, the associate director for digital learning at the American Museum of Natural History. Joseph is in his 40s. When he was young, he and his friends roamed the neighborhood unattended, where they learned to manage themselves socially.

Minecraft serves as a new free-\u00adranging realm.", "Joseph\u2019s son, Akiva, is 9, and before and after school he and his school friend Eliana will meet on a Minecraft server to talk and play. His son, Joseph says, is \u201cat home but still getting to be with a friend using technology, going to a place where they get to use pickaxes and they get to use shovels and they get to do that kind of building. I wonder how much Minecraft is meeting that need \u2014 that need that all children have.\u201d In some respects, Minecraft can be as much social network as game.", "Just as Minecraft propels kids to master Photoshop or video-\u00adediting, server life often requires kids to acquire complex technical skills. One 13-year-old girl I interviewed, Lea, was a regular on a server called Total Freedom but became annoyed that its administrators weren\u2019t clamping down on griefing. So she asked if she could become an administrator, and the owners said yes.", "For a few months, Lea worked as a kind of cop on that beat. A software tool called \u201ccommand spy\u201d let her observe records of what players had done in the game; she teleported miscreants to a sort of virtual \u201ctime out\u201d zone. She was eventually promoted to the next rank \u2014 \u201ctelnet admin,\u201d which allowed her to log directly into the server via telnet, a command-\u00adline tool often used by professionals to manage servers. Being deeply involved in the social world of Minecraft turned Lea into something rather like a professional systems administrator. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to take charge of anybody who\u2019s breaking the rules,\u201d she told me at the time.", "Not everyone has found the online world of Minecraft so hospitable. One afternoon while visiting the offices of Mouse, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that runs high-tech programs for kids, I spoke with Tori. She\u2019s a quiet, dry-\u00adwitted 17-year-old who has been playing Minecraft for two years, mostly in single-\u00adplayer mode; a recent castle-\u00adbuilding competition with her younger sister prompted some bickering after Tori won. But when she decided to try an online server one day, other players \u2014 after discovering she was a girl \u2014 spelled out \u201cBITCH\u201d in blocks.", "She hasn\u2019t gone back. A group of friends sitting with her in the Mouse offices, all boys, shook their heads in sympathy; they\u2019ve seen this behavior \u201ceverywhere,\u201d one said. I have been unable to find solid statistics on how frequently harassment happens in Minecraft. In the broader world of online games, though, there is more evidence: An academic study of online players of Halo, a shoot-\u2019em-up game, found that women were harassed twice as often as men, and in an unscientific poll of 874 self-\u00addescribed online gamers, 63 percent of women reported \u201csex-\u00adbased taunting, harassment or threats.\u201d Parents are sometimes more fretful than the players; a few told me they didn\u2019t let their daughters play online. Not all girls experience harassment in Minecraft, of course \u2014 Lea, for one, told me it has never happened to her \u2014 and it is easy to play online without disclosing your gender, age or name. In-game avatars can even be animals.", "How long will Minecraft\u2019s popularity endure? It depends very much on Microsoft\u2019s stewardship of the game. Company executives have thus far kept a reasonably light hand on the game; they have left major decisions about the game\u2019s development to Mojang and let the team remain in Sweden. But you can imagine how the game\u2019s rich grass-roots culture might fray. Microsoft could, for example, try to broaden the game\u2019s appeal by making it more user-\u00adfriendly \u2014 which might attenuate its rich tradition of information-\u00adsharing among fans, who enjoy the opacity and mystery. Or a future update could tilt the game in a direction kids don\u2019t like. (The introduction of a new style of combat this spring led to lively debate on forums \u2014 some enjoyed the new layer of strategy; others thought it made Minecraft too much like a typical hack-and-slash game.) Or an altogether new game could emerge, out-\u00adMinecrafting Minecraft.", "But for now, its grip is strong. And some are trying to strengthen it further by making it more accessible to lower-\u00adincome children. Mimi Ito has found that the kids who acquire real-world skills from the game \u2014 learning logic, administering servers, making YouTube channels \u2014 tend to be upper middle class. Their parents and after-\u00adschool programs help them shift from playing with virtual blocks to, say, writing code. So educators have begun trying to do something similar, bringing Minecraft into the classroom to create lessons on everything from math to history. Many libraries are installing Minecraft on their computers.", "One recent afternoon, I visited the Bronx Library Center, a sleek, recently renovated building in a low-\u00adincome part of the borough. A librarian named Katie Fernandez had set up regular Minecraft days for youths, and I watched four boys play together on the library\u2019s server. Fernandez had given them a challenge: Erect a copy of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in 45 minutes. Three of them began collaborating on one version; a younger boy worked on his own design. The three gently teased one another about their skills. \u201cNo, no, stop!\u201d shouted one, when he noticed another building a foot of the Arc too wide. \u201cRyan, this \u2014 like this!\u201d They debated whether command blocks would speed things up. As the 45th minute approached, they hadn\u2019t quite finished their Arc, so they gleefully stuffed the interior with TNT, detonated it and hopped onto different games.", "Over in the corner, the fourth boy continued to labor away at his Arc.

How\u2019s it going? I\u2019ve been in Africa for three weeks. I bet you missed me a lot. It must be difficult to try to decipher the week\u2019s tech news without me to guide you along. Well, dry your eyes, I\u2019m back!", "Mike: I started going to therapy to deal with your absence. Turns out you and I are fine, but I have a whole lot of other issues. I hope we have good insurance.", "Farhad: So, on to the news. Remember the huge battle between the F.B.I. and Apple over the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist\u2019s phone? It all sort of fizzled this week: CBS News reported that after the F.B.I. finally got into the phone (without Apple\u2019s help), it found nothing of significance on the device.", "Mike: LOL. After all that, nothing. It\u2019s almost too perfect of an ending to the saga.", "Farhad: But nothing didn\u2019t come cheap! The bureau spent at least $1.3 million to get into the phone, James Comey, the F.B.I.\u2019s director, told a security conference this week.", "Has anyone spent so much for so little before? I mean, other than what our bosses pay you?", "Mike: I considered the free sandwiches left in the conference rooms at N.Y.T. HQ to be part of my \u201cbenefits package.\u201d", "Farhad: O.K., so there were a lot of corporate earnings this week. Let\u2019s run through them in a flash. The first three tell a familiar story \u2014 the era of personal computers is well and truly over.", "IBM reported a huge decline in revenue and profit, but the numbers were in line with what analysts were expecting. Intel, on the other hand, whiffed on its earnings numbers, and it announced layoffs of 12,000 workers, around 11 percent of its work force. And if Intel didn\u2019t prove that surviving the crash of the PC business isn\u2019t easy, Microsoft came along to underscore the point, announcing a dip in sales and profits.", "Mike: I still have no clue what these companies are going to do to, like, stop firing people. I guess just become a lot smaller?", "Oh also, I started watching back episodes of \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d on Netflix and man, that show rules. It deals with the rise of the PC and the era when IBM, or Big Blue, reigned supreme. A different era entirely.", "Farhad: Oh \u2014 I kind of hated it. Anyway, newer tech companies aren\u2019t faring any better. Google also missed analysts\u2019 earnings expectations, in part because of lower prices paid for Internet ads. And Google was hit by another storm \u2014 European regulators announced the start of what looks to be a long-running investigation into whether the company is using its Android operating system to block competitors from users\u2019 phones.", "Finally, there was Yahoo, the perennial basket case of the web industry. Its earnings report was also dismal: revenue fell 11 percent since last year, and the firm lost $99 million in the quarter. But the report was essentially overshadowed by Yahoo\u2019s efforts to sell its Internet businesses. Bids for those beleaguered assets were due this week; among the contenders are Verizon and a few private equity firms. Yahoo\u2019s board will now have to look through the bids to figure out which, if any, could save this ailing patient. Wish them luck!", "Mike: Poor Yahoo executives will only have their tens of millions of dollars in prenegotiated severance packages to turn to for comfort after their company is sold for parts. What a tragedy.", "Meanwhile I\u2019m literally buying cases of ramen on Amazon to save money.", "Farhad: But let\u2019s leave today\u2019s tech giants \u2014 and your dinner plans \u2014 aside for a bit. Instead let\u2019s talk about tomorrow\u2019s giant: Uber. As you reported, the ride-sharing company settled a long battle in California and Massachusetts this week over the legal status of its drivers. So does this finally put to rest the controversy over Uber\u2019s practice of keeping its drivers as contractors rather than employees?", "Mike: In short, not really. The settlement \u2014 which still is subject to the acceptance of the judge presiding over the case \u2014 applies only to California and Massachusetts drivers. There are still lawsuits in a bunch of other states, including Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania. I\u2019m sure more will pop up over time, since everyone loves to sue a company with deep pockets.", "Here\u2019s what matters: Aside from the $100 million Uber said it would pay drivers involved in the suit, the company conceded to a bunch of new rules and policies that make things at least slightly better for drivers.", "For one, drivers can ask for tips now, something they weren\u2019t able to do before (unlike Lyft, where they can get tips inside the app). Uber will also create a union-style \u201cdrivers association\u201d in California and Massachusetts \u2014 just don\u2019t call them unions! \u2014 so that drivers can air their grievances. And drivers won\u2019t automatically be deactivated for canceling too many trips over time.", "That seems like a list of ways Uber can defend itself in other states in which it faces lawsuits. Essentially, the further away Uber gets from acting like actual employers with drivers \u2014 that is, the less control it exerts over the work force \u2014 the more room it has to call its drivers \u201cpartners\u201d and not employees.", "Farhad: Those actually sound like pretty good reforms. If Uber does use this settlement as a template for other states, it seems like it could be creating what some labor experts had been calling for when this contractor-versus-employee dispute first came along \u2014 a new, third category of employment that sat somewhere between full-time and independent contractor work.", "This settlement sounds a bit like that situation: Uber drivers get some perks of employment, including people to complain to, and some measure of job security (even if it\u2019s probably pretty weak). But they don\u2019t get to be full employees \u2014 meaning the company does not have to pay them benefits, and the drivers are free to work as much or as little as they\u2019d like.", "Am I wrong to see this as a pretty good middle-of-the-road fix to a thorny problem that had been vexing lots of on-demand companies?", "Mike: Only partly! As usual.", "The counterargument for some of this is that Uber can still shut drivers out of the app for short periods of time if they make too many trip cancellations. That\u2019s a level of control that one could argue should be reserved for an employer-employee relationship.", "Anyway, the moral of the story is this seems to have been largely defused, though not entirely over and done with. Watch other states and the subsequent litigation closely.", "Good to have you back in town! Also, thank you for the bag of biltong you brought back.

In the 21st century, it is not impossible to imagine an Internet revolution beginning in China.", "That possibility is, as with so many aspects of China, a function of scale.

Even the justice system succumbed to the sway, confining pedestrians to crosswalks and letting drivers who mowed them down get off with fines and community service.

A succession of chief executives, the latest being the Google veteran Marissa Mayer, have failed to find an effective answer.", "That has drawn a number of activist investors over the years that have sought to shake up the company.

At Marvell, the activist investor won four board seats and will have a say in the selection of the company\u2019s next chief executive.", "Some on the receiving end of Starboard\u2019s campaigns have eventually formed cordial relationships with the hedge fund.

City Hall, with its Beaux-Arts architecture and government-grade wait times, can feel like an anachronism.", "Ms. Trauss may be a plugged-in millennial, but she loves it. \u201cEven in this modern era of, whatever, the Internet and people like interacting in a place that\u2019s no place at all, City Hall is still a center,\u201d she said.", "One recent afternoon, she spent an hour on the hard wooden benches in the chamber of the Board of Supervisors. She was there to make a two-minute public comment in favor of a dull-but-important proposal to streamline the permitting process for some affordable-housing projects.", "Three days later she was back, this time to support a \u201cdensity bonus\u201d \u2014 a proposal to let developers build taller buildings in exchange for including more affordable housing as well. When she arrived, Mr. Campos, from the Board of Supervisors, was blasting the proposal from the City Hall steps, surrounded by 70 or so supporters.", "Ms. Trauss and another member of her group stood opposite and held up signs that said \u201cStop Affordable Housing.\u201d This was meant to be ironic. Their point was that Mr. Campos was opposing legislation that would create more market-rate housing \u2014 but also more affordable housing.", "Nobody seemed to get it, so Ms. Trauss went inside City Hall to add her name to a list of people making public comments before the planning commission. Her chance to speak would be hours away, so she trekked around City Hall, past bronze busts and wedding parties, in search of a quiet place to take a lunch break. She was joined by a man whose legal name is Starchild.", "Starchild is the sort of only-in-San Francisco character you end up making friends with if you spend enough time at City Hall. He works nights as an \u201cerotic service provider.\u201d Asked if this meant he was a prostitute, he said, \u201c\u2018Prostitute\u2019 is O.K. as long as it\u2019s said in a respectful way.\u201d Starchild spends his days campaigning for libertarian causes and running doomed campaigns for office.", "The two ate on a marble ledge and discussed police brutality, pretrial detention and whether it was possible for an anarchist to be in favor of soda taxes. A short while later, Ms. Trauss headed back to a waiting room, where she took a selfie for the @SFyimby Twitter account and began a two-and-a-half-hour wait for a few more minutes at the public-comment microphone.", "\u201cThis is my life,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d", "Many longtime San Franciscans view groups like BARF as yet another example of how the technology industry is robbing San Francisco of its San Francisco-ness. Far from the hippies of the 1960s, many of today\u2019s migrants lean libertarian \u2014 drawn by start-up dreams or to work for the likes of Google or Apple, two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. They tend to share a belief, either idealistically or na\u00efvely, depending on who is judging, that corporations can be a force for social good and change.", "But BARF members are so single-minded about housing that they can be hard to label politically. They view San Francisco progressives as, in fact, fundamentally conservative. That is because, to the group members at least, progressive positions on housing seem less about building the city and more about keeping people like them out.", "On a drizzly Sunday in December, Ms. Trauss hosted the SF YIMBYParty Congress, a gathering of pro-housing groups held at a Market Street co-working space full of start-up touches like mismatched furniture, a foosball table and lots of white men. Toward the beginning, a debate broke out about whether they should call themselves moderates to distinguish themselves from progressives.", "Ms. Trauss joked that she liked moderate because you can shorten it to mod, and mod sounds cool. Mr. Wiener, the supervisor, disagreed, noting that in San Francisco, a moderate Democrat \u201cmight have a Bernie Sanders sticker on their car.\u201d", "One man, who seemed exasperated by the discussion and the idea of using his Sunday to talk about politics, said, with more colorful language, that he did not give a hoot about progressives versus moderates \u2014 he just wanted some darn housing.", "The tech boom takes much of the blame for soaring housing prices. But the pro-development movement has less to do with tech as an industry, and everything to do with newcomers as a class.", "Brian Hanlon, a federation member who regularly attends Board of Supervisors meetings with Ms. Trauss, has a day job doing administrative work for the United States Forest Service. Two years ago, when he started worrying that his claim to an $835-a-month room in a rent-controlled apartment might be in jeopardy, he reacted in classic San Francisco fashion. He started marching in anti-eviction protests next to people beating drums and signs that said things like \u201cTech = Death.\u201d", "But he quickly broke ranks. Many of his fellow protesters also opposed building new apartments \u2014 putting him at odds with them.", "\u201cThey want to be on the side of tenants, but they don\u2019t have any real plan for how do we become a welcoming metropolitan area for new people who don\u2019t have money,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cTheir plans are only to allow current incumbent renters to stay in their place, presumably until they die and some rich person comes along.\u201d", "The progressive movement has played a guiding role in creating the quirky and picturesque San Francisco that many people love today. Progressives battled plans to crisscross the city with freeways and opposed urban renewal programs that destroyed black neighborhoods. They have fought for, and won, rent-control protections and funding for affordable housing, along with various open-space amenities that many newcomers take for granted.", "The question is how to handle a long-run demographic reversal in which cities across the country have regained population following years of \u201cwhite flight\u201d to the suburbs. After losing population for two decades through the 1970s, San Francisco resumed growth in the \u201980s and has only accelerated from there.", "\u201cThere\u2019s that book, \u2018What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?\u2019\u201d said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of SPUR, an urban policy research organization. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with San Francisco? Why is it that in a city that\u2019s two-thirds renters we have adopted a housing policy that is horrible for renters?\u201d", "The challenge for groups like BARF is that, politically speaking, they have a lot of persuading to do. The free-market talk might sound great to a recent Stanford graduate, but San Francisco is in a moment when corporate buses are regarded as instruments of a tech invasion bent on turning people who can\u2019t code into a food-delivering underclass. The idea that everything would be better if only the city threw up more tall buildings is a hard sell.", "Of the 11 propositions on San Francisco\u2019s ballot in November, seven were either directly or indirectly related to high home prices and the influence of the technology industry. Michael Hankinson, a Harvard Ph.D. candidate who is studying land-use and housing prices, surveyed voters for his dissertation and found renters skeptical that new development would do anything other than raise prices.", "For instance, a recent proposal to temporarily stop market-rate development in the city\u2019s Mission District, a gentrifying neighborhood popular with technology workers, failed citywide. But Mr. Hankinson found that a majority of renters favored it because they did not think that new development would do anything for them \u2014 and feared that it might, somehow, get them evicted.", "\u201cBARF has to convince renters that neighborhood change will benefit them in the long run,\u201d he said. Today, when eviction is a hot party topic, most renters are unwilling to take that gamble.", "So Ms. Trauss is taking her campaign to the courts. In December she sued the city of Lafayette, Calif., an East Bay bedroom community, after it took a parcel that had been set aside for higher-density apartments and office buildings and rezoned it for single-family homes instead.", "She wrote the petition herself, saying the move violated the California Housing Accountability Act, a 1980s law and \u201canti-Nimby\u201d statute that limits cities\u2019 ability to downsize housing developments. Recently, she hired a lawyer to litigate the case.", "Asked about Ms. Trauss\u2019s lawsuit, Steven Falk, Lafayette\u2019s city manager, said the city actually faced another lawsuit over the same development.

Here\u2019s an edited excerpt of our conversation.", "Q. What was the most surprising thing you found during your research?", "A. Emily Willingham: A lot of studies point to the father as having a deeper level of sleep deprivation. This is U.S.-specific, and the reason for it, it\u2019s thought, is that not only are they wakened throughout the night, but also they get up and they go to work the next day. Even when family leave is offered to men, studies indicate that a lot of them don\u2019t take advantage of it. One of the upshots of that is that men have a steep level of sleep deprivation, while women who can stay at home with the infant can sleep when the baby sleeps and get slightly more sleep during the day. That was a surprise to me. Of course, that\u2019s an average, and it\u2019s based on this one kind of experience, where a mother is on maternity leave and a father is back at work. It\u2019s not a reflection of individual experience, and there aren\u2019t a lot of studies on different family models, where the mother is back at work right away.", "Tara Haelle: The surprise for me was in the section on alcohol and pregnancy. I went into it with the belief that the research showed that a glass of wine or so once a week was no big deal and probably wasn\u2019t going to have a big effect, especially after the first trimester. If you look at the epidemiological studies, then that\u2019s true. You\u2019re not going to find studies that show a clearly reduced IQ point or lower behavioral scores where the parent had exactly one glass of wine a week. But knowing now what alcohol does in the body, where it goes and what barriers are and are not there and how it influences the body at the cellular level, I think women need to know that even small amounts of alcohol might have more of an effect than they might have realized or been led to believe.", "What topics are most confusing for expectant parents?", "Emily Willingham: One of the most confusing things is that screening tests, like cell-free DNA sampling, are mistaken for being diagnostic when they\u2019re not. The vast majority of tests that women will take during pregnancy are screening for a likelihood or a probability. They will give you a number \u2014 you have this level of risk of carrying a fetus with a certain condition. The next step is to pursue diagnostic testing. The screening is not definitive, but a lot of people feel a ton of anxiety over whether to do the screening, how to interpret the screening, what to do next.", "We found a study that evaluated the results in 1,471 cell-free DNA samples, and found three false positives for Down syndrome. There are also false positives, and results that can\u2019t be used \u2014 and unusable results are more common in pregnancies where there are chromosomal abnormalities. It\u2019s really important to go on to the next step, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.", "Is there any new advice for parents in the delivery room?", "Tara Haelle: There\u2019s much stronger evidence today that delaying cord clamping by 30 seconds to two minutes increases the iron stores in your newborn. Especially if the baby is going to be exclusively breast-fed, that will potentially help keep the iron stores higher throughout breast-feeding and you may not need to supplement with iron because of that. Those extra seconds just get more cord blood into the baby.", "Is the research on sleep training supported by science?", "Emily Willingham: There have been several randomized controlled trials showing that it\u2019s effective in the short term.

As an amateur jockey he won the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris in 1888, and working for Lord Derby he was the British flat racing champion trainer in 1906, 1911 and 1912. \u201cThe story goes that a long time after buying Mesnil Warren he made a good bet on one of his horses, Sansovino, winning the Epsom Derby in 1924, and that with the money he made he decided to build a large extension,\u201d Mr. Lambton said. \u201cWhether this actually happened we really don\u2019t know, but what is true is that my grandmother, Cicely Lambton, knew the architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, and so he was commissioned to design the new wing.\u201d", "Lutyens, who designed the Cenotaph war memorial in London\u2019s Whitehall, as well as much of New Delhi, India, was also a prolific furniture designer, and in the United States is perhaps best known for his teak garden bench. For a time he was also at the heart of the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain, which brought an emphasis on the use of quality materials and decorative design at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.", "\u201cThe Lutyens wing was originally designed to provide extra guest bedrooms and further staff accommodation,\u201d Mr. Lambton said. \u201cIt does sit well with the original building and has some interesting features of its own, such as plastered parts of external guttering, which look rather like interior cornicing.\u201d", "Mr. Lambton\u2019s grandfather died in 1945 and his wife, Cicely, continued to live at Mesnil Warren until 1972, when the 10,372-square-foot house was taken over by his son, Teddy Lambton, who was also a racehorse trainer.", "\u201cI pretty much grew up here from the age of 10 and remember my parents completely refurbishing it in the 1970s. My father died in 1983; then when my mother died in 1996, my wife, Lisa, and I, who were living in London at the time, decided to move up here with our family,\u201d said Mr. Lambton, who is a former lord mayor of Newmarket and is now training to be a psychotherapist.", "\u201cIt has been fun: We have enjoyed living somewhere that you can fill with family and friends and not even know they are there. The guest areas are all easy to maintain and to separate from the rest of the house if you wish to.\u201d", "Red brick-built Mesnil Warren sits in approximately two and a half acres of land and once included a stable yard. Today the grounds comprise areas of landscaped garden, as well as garaging and workshop areas, a tennis court and a summer house.", "The property has 11 bedrooms, as well as a self-contained two-bedroom apartment, across three stories of accommodation. The Lutyens wing, which was added to the north side of the house, has some typically Arts and Crafts features, including an upper floor under the roof and attractive dormer windows. The rest of the property retains its classic Victorian style.", "Four bedrooms, including the 414-square-foot master bedroom, which has its own bathroom and dressing room, are on the second floor of the original part of the building. Above, on the third floor, is the apartment, which has two bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen. There is also a sitting room of approximately 330 square feet, which opens onto a balcony.", "\u201cFrom here and from the master bedroom below you have the most amazing view out over the garden and on to the Gallops behind, where you can see the racehorses training every morning,\u201d Mr. Lambton said.", "The ground floor of the newer part of the house includes the 393-square-foot kitchen breakfast room, as well as a study, family room and various storage and utility areas. A rear staircase leads up to two guest bedrooms and a second-floor drawing room of approximately 480 square feet, which has exterior steps down to the garden. On the third floor there are five more guest bedrooms and two bathrooms.", "Among the most impressive rooms in the older part of the property is the grand drawing room of approximately 700 square feet. This has a high paneled ceiling, an elegant fireplace and an arch adorning a bay window. The 412-square-foot dining room is also a splendid space and, like the entrance hall to the house, is graced with paintings of some of the famous racehorses that were trained by Mr. Lambton\u2019s father and grandfather.", "\u201cWhile this house could suit all sorts of people, I expect that whoever buys it is likely to have more than a passing interest in racing,\u201d Mr. Lambton said. \u201cWhat they are buying into here is a part of the racing history of Newmarket.\u201d", "James Barnett, head of country residential at Savills Cambridge, the real estate agent marketing the property, described Newmarket as \u201cthe home of English racing,\u201d but said it was also desirable for its proximity to Cambridge, about 13 miles away.", "\u201cCambridge continues to grow and many new companies are moving to the city, including biotech, pharmaceutical and technology companies, such as AstraZeneca, Apple and Google,\u201d he said.", "Noting the array of available properties in both Cambridge and Newmarket, Mr. Barnett called this one \u201cexceptional, in part because it has a Lutyens- designed wing.\u201d", "\u201cProperties built or modified by Lutyens are highly prized,\u201d he said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/business/a-windfall-for-chobani-employees-stakes-in-the-company.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/technology/fcc-approves-broadband-subsidy-for-low-income-households.html": ["WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved a $9.25 monthly broadband subsidy to help millions of low-income households connect to the Internet, in a move aimed at bridging the digital divide.", "Three of the agency\u2019s five commissioners voted for the subsidy plan, with two against. The approval, which comes as part of the reform of a fund known as the Lifeline program, is the latest push by the F.C.C. to treat broadband like a public utility. High-speed Internet has become increasingly crucial to households, used for doing homework, finding and maintaining employment, and completing other basic tasks.", "The vote ensures that \u201cAmericans can access the dominant communications platform of the day,\u201d said Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C.", "During the agency\u2019s meeting on Thursday, the F.C.C. also moved forward on a proposal to create the first broadband privacy rules that would let consumers choose whether AT&T and Comcast could collect and share data about them.", "But the Lifeline vote was the more heavily scrutinized agenda item. Today, one in five people do not have access to broadband at home, and the vast majority of those disconnected are poor. Only about 40 percent of people earning less than $25,000 a year can afford broadband while 95 percent of all households making over $150,000 have high-speed Internet at home, the F.C.C. said.", "Starting in December, those eligible for programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and tribal and veterans benefits, will be able to apply for the subsidy. The funds can be used for wireless or fixed-wire broadband. The F.C.C. said it would aim to keep the budget of the subsidy program under $2.25 billion, money that is provided through line-item charges on wireless and Internet bills.", "Among the biggest concerns is how financially disadvantaged families are being strained by their inability to connect to the Internet at home. Seven out of 10 schools assign homework that requires Internet access, for example. Most jobs are posted online, and applications for employment are increasingly becoming online-only.", "\u201cThis meets the 21st-century needs for those most vulnerable,\u201d said Mignon Clyburn, a Democratic commissioner.", "The vote over the Lifeline plan was delayed for three hours because of back-and-forth between the two Republican commissioners and the three Democratic commissioners over the program\u2019s details. The Republican commissioners, who ultimately voted against the subsidy, said the F.C.C. needed to put a lower and hard cap on the Lifeline program\u2019s budget. Started in 1985 to bring phone services to low-income families, Lifeline later added subsidies for mobile phone services, but some homes started double-billing the program and the budget for the fund ballooned.", "\u201cThe commission\u2019s failure to clean up the waste, fraud and abuse in the program puts the entire enterprise in jeopardy,\u201d said Ajit Pai, a Republican F.C.C. commissioner.", "The F.C.C. plans to appoint a third-party administrator to check for double-billing or other instances of fraud.", "The agency\u2019s two Republican commissioners also voted against the broadband privacy rules, which have drawn strong protest from cable and telecom firms. But the three Democratic commissioners voted in favor, pushing the rules toward a monthslong period of public comments and consideration.", "Comcast has protested the agency\u2019s privacy proposal, pointing to several recent regulatory decisions that target Internet service providers. The company said that broadband providers had not harmed consumers by abusing their collection and sharing of data. Comcast also pointed to Google and Facebook as more concerning, saying those Internet companies are unregulated, even as their businesses rely on the collection of consumer data for targeted advertising.", "\u201cThe unfortunate result of the F.C.C.\u2019s extreme regulatory proposals will be more consumer confusion and less competition, and a bunch of collateral damage to innovation and investment along the way,\u201d said David Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast.", "Consumer advocacy groups cheered the vote for Lifeline.", "\u201cInexpensive options for access have dwindled, not grown,\u201d said Hannah Sassaman, a director at Media Mobilizing Project. \u201cA broadband subsidy for Lifeline will transform access to this basic human right in American cities, where such access is necessary to apply for even the lowest-wage jobs.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/technology/all-eyes-on-facebook-to-lift-techs-dismal-spirits.html": ["It\u2019s up to Facebook to bring some light to what has been a dark and stormy tech earnings season.", "The world\u2019s biggest social network is scheduled to report quarterly results on Wednesday, and it is projected to post strong revenue growth and continued additions to its user base.

The algorithm that drives Pied Piper, the MacGuffinish string of computer code around which the series revolves, has existed since the first episode. Yet this season, it is no closer to existing in the real world. The show\u2019s young code-writing heroes are still running like gerbils from one white knight or black hat to another, generating lively misadventures but no revenue. Everything happens, and nothing happens.", "Actually, one major thing changes in Season 3, and its effect on the show\u2019s messy, casual vibe is an open question.

Through a series of events that won\u2019t be spoiled here, the Pied Piper programmers find themselves moving into new offices that are a parody of Google-style adolescent luxury (snack machines, made-to-order breakfasts). Their nights are still spent at the house, though, and by the third episode events point toward a possible return of operations to their Palo Alto garage.", "The season picks up where the previous one ended, repeating the moment when Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch), the chief brain and chief executive of Pied Piper, tells his crew, \u201cI just got fired.\u201d The subsequent maneuvering, in which everyone but Richard \u2014 and his acolyte Jared (Zach Woods) \u2014 acknowledges that he\u2019s better suited for a different role, is a showcase for Mr. Middleditch\u2019s delineation of the ubergeek personality: strangled awkwardness that barely holds in check overpowering arrogance and rage. It also allows for the introduction of the fine comic actor Stephen Tobolowsky as Jack Barker, the fake-folksy new executive with whom Richard has to do battle for the soul of Pied Piper. (In a repeated gag, Richard tentatively gives his interpretations of how things are going, and Mr. Tobolowsky, as Barker, responds with variations on his trademarked, high-pitched \u201cOh, GOD no!\u201d)", "The show continues to score points off the real Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of unapologetic excess \u2014 forced to track down Jack, Richard finds him monitoring two of his thoroughbred horses engaging in some extremely graphic breeding \u2014 and to generate laughs from the interplay of the misanthropic Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) and the miserable Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani), the show\u2019s Norm and Cliff. It also continues to demonstrate a knack for making business and technology strategies a comprehensible and effective component of its storytelling, as Richard encounters a sales force that wants to turn Pied Piper into a faceless commodity sold to soulless corporations. (Less admirably, it continues to indulge in lazy stereotyping and easy, unfunny jokes when it comes to Asian characters like Jimmy O. Yang\u2019s heavily accented Jian-Yang and occasionally even Dinesh.)", "\u201cSilicon Valley\u201d is, among other things, a morality play, with Richard and his crew endlessly battling the forces that would strip away the democratizing, world-changing features of Pied Piper (which are mostly obscure and swaddled in tech speak) and that sniff at the notion of five adult friends living, working and smoking together in a suburban ranch house. That insistence can get a little tedious, and it\u2019s worth noting that the smartest, funniest moments of Season 2 involved the craven Gavin Belson (wonderfully played by Matt Ross), chief executive of the evil Google-esque behemoth Hooli, as he fought to stave off ruin. That subplot is fainter but still present, as Gavin uses a loophole to dismiss an entire division and announces, \u201cIt is I who must remain and bear the heavy burden of their failure.\u201d In comedy as in life, the villains are usually the most fun."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/technology/personaltech/blogging-on-the-road.html": ["Q.

The story began with the widow, whose name is Yolanda Signorelli von Braunhut. She is a onetime heir to the considerable fortune still generated by her husband Harold\u2019s iconic invention, Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys. As her lawyer told it, she was now isolated, cash-starved, often without electricity or running water on a palatial estate on the Potomac River in southern Maryland. Having retreated to a single room in the old mansion, she was prepping for her second freezing winter, barricaded by thick quilts, her bed next to a fireplace stocked with split wood. From this bunker, Signorelli von Braunhut has been waging legal combat against Sam Harwell, chief executive of a big-time toy company whose name seems straight out of a Chuck Jones cartoon: Big Time Toys.", "In his tiny office in Sayville, on Long Island, Timmons spoke in clipped, near-noir tones, handing me a five-page summary of the case, eager to executive-produce the plotline. \u201cThe heart and soul of this case is trademark infringement,\u201d he said. Signorelli von Braunhut \u201cbelieves in the concept of justice,\u201d he continued, \u201cand when you have that on your side, then you can get through the day.\u201d", "A few years after her husband\u2019s death in 2003, Signorelli von Braunhut licensed out part of the labor of his multimillion dollar Sea-Monkey enterprise, mostly packaging and distribution, to Big Time. If you\u2019ve ever been 8 years old, then you know that Sea-Monkeys arrive in a small plastic aquarium with several small packets that include the tiny brine-shrimp critters, which reanimate once you add water \u2014 by way of a secret formula that Signorelli von Braunhut keeps locked in a vault in Manhattan.", "The original deal held that Big Time would supply everything except the specially engineered critters \u2014 and the accompanying packets, which von Braunhut would manufacture and sell separately to Big Time, which would then bundle the full kits and handle the sales. Also in the contract was a second deal \u2014 to buy the company, including the secret formula. It allowed Big Time to pay a straight-up $5 million fee and then $5 million more in installments. Three winters ago, Big Time called up the widow and announced that it considered its previous payments for the packets to be a kind of layaway deal for the company and that, as far as Big Time was concerned, it now owned the Sea-Monkey franchise.", "Signorelli von Braunhut first sued in 2013, and last year Timmons filed a further complaint accusing Big Time of breach of contract and trademark infringement. Big Time\u2019s national law firm, Epstein Becker & Green, sent me a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming instead that the widow improperly terminated the contract. In a particularly contemporary twist to the melodrama, Big Time\u2019s court filings revealed that it was now buying knockoff Sea-Monkeys from China.", "\u201cThis is a David and Goliath story,\u201d Timmons said, only \u201cwithout a slingshot.\u201d Timmons shrugged as if to invite me to look around. His office is, to be generous, snug. There was barely enough room for me. It was surprising that the door doesn\u2019t bang his desk as in that Alan Cumming gag from this season\u2019s \u201cThe Good Wife.\u201d Timmons is a tall, thin man with some Nicolas Cage-iness to him.

His annual Halloween masked ball attracted hundreds of \u201cmusicians, dancers and artists,\u201d all of whom came in their most flamboyant costumes. Some attended, if only to meet one of his five beautiful daughters.", "The second-youngest, Yolanda, was particularly stunning and began a film career in the mid-1960s.

When I finally screwed up the courage to ask Signorelli von Braunhut about her previous career, she casually said: \u201cIn those days, they might have been racy, but today? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Which is true. If anything, her brief movie career looks presciently campy \u2014 less like porn than like a Mike Myers parody titled, \u201cCool It Baby\u201d (which is also the title of a 1967 Signorelli von Braunhut film).", "On paper, including the legal summary Timmons gave me, the issues of Yolanda von Braunhut v.

We met at Timmons\u2019s office and then walked down to the Aegean Cafe (\u201cSteaks Seafood Pasta\u201d) on Main Street for a luncheon. Von Braunhut is a very good looking woman whose age I was just too chicken to ask. But if she was 18, as she told me, when she started her film career in 1966, then she\u2019s about 70 now. She is trim and decades-younger looking in skintight jeans and an equally engaged V-neck top, reminiscent of the ageless Sophia Loren or Raquel Welch. She has an artful muss of dark hair framing a smile that\u2019s slow to form but amplified by flirtatious eyes that sparkled at the end of each sentence.", "Over a salad, she said she was eager for me to understand the inventive genius of her husband, Harold. Beginning in the 1950s and \u201960s, he took out patents on 196 different inventions, gadgets and toys. That whole last page of zany novelties found in comic books for years was the domain of Harold von Braunhut. He also raced motorcycles under the name the Green Hornet. He was a sometime television producer and the agent for one of those guys who high-dived into a wading pool with 12 inches of water. He was a magician who worked under the name the Great Telepo. She said he also invented the Direct-a-Mat \u2014 a device into which you punched your destination in New York City, and the machine told you the fastest subway route \u2014 half a century before Google Maps.", "Sea-Monkeys were von Braunhut\u2019s most lucrative toy (and still are: In 2006, according to the filings in this lawsuit, sales were $3.4 million). Part of what made Sea-Monkeys successful was a scientific breakthrough Harold von Braunhut claimed he achieved in the early years. In 1960, after observing the success of Uncle Milton\u2019s Ant Farm, von Braunhut first started shipping Instant Life \u2014 simple brine shrimp that could travel in their natural state of suspended animation. This was the era when a good idea with smart marketing was the dream: D.F. Duncan\u2019s yo-yo, George Parker\u2019s Monopoly game, Ruth Handler\u2019s Barbie. Around the same time, the big-time toy company of the day, Wham-O, started selling a similar product called Instant Fish, which was an immediate dud.", "\u201cThey didn\u2019t work because the formula wasn\u2019t thought through properly,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said. Wham-O\u2019s product was actually African killifish, which were supposed to come back to life when rehydrated. But they didn\u2019t. \u201cSo it really hurt sales for Harold, too.\u201d", "Wham-O\u2019s 1960 failure led von Braunhut to reintroduce his creation with new science and a new concept. He worked with a marine biologist named Anthony D\u2019Agostino, and using a process he flamboyantly called superhomeogenation, they created a hybrid brine shrimp that could more easily survive the United States Postal Service and be more likely to flourish after reanimation. They worked with the brine-shrimp species artemia salina, and because they made their breakthrough at Montauk\u2019s NYOSL, the New York Ocean Science Laboratory; they called their new hybrid artemia \u201cnyos.\u201d (I contacted D\u2019Agostino at his home, but his wife said he was seriously ill and couldn\u2019t come to the phone.)", "According to Richard Pell, who maintains an aquarium of Sea-Monkeys at the Center for PostNatural History in Pittsburgh (alongside displays about spider-silk-producing goats and other attractions), \u201cThey were selectively bred in the early \u201970s so that they would have this extra long dormant cycle in their egg state, and they were able to increase that yield so that you get that satisfying swarm.\u201d Pell admits he\u2019s worried these days. \u201cThe new ones come from China,\u201d he said, \u201cand they are technically not Sea-Monkeys because they don\u2019t come from that original culture developed by Harold and Dr. D\u2019Agostino.\u201d", "Over coffee, Signorelli von Braunhut talked about this formula for altering the shrimp as one of her husband\u2019s greatest scientific breakthroughs, his greatest invention. Timmons himself jumped in to add that Harold\u2019s genius was with \u201cthe science to get them to live for a prolonged period of time.\u201d She agreed and said, \u201cYes, he went through tremendous efforts to make sure that they \u2014 should I elaborate on that?\u201d and then Timmons said, abruptly, no. Whenever the science came up, in fact, Timmons shooed me away.", "Signorelli von Braunhut met her husband in the late 1960s, when she happened to be in the audience for a taping of a television program he was producing for the magician Joseph Dunninger. \u201cHarold was such an exciting person,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said, explaining why she set her movie career aside. \u201cShow business was kind of a tough thing, and I am not into all that myself. I liked being around Harold and the Sea-Monkeys.\u201d So she went to work for him, and later they married.", "While Dunninger has been largely forgotten, the couple\u2019s fortuitous meeting on his set came at a crucial juncture in the development of American magic and marketing. Dunninger served as a bridge that led away from live performance \u2014 dating to old-school vaudevillian stagecraft \u2014 and toward the small stage of television, where magic was more patter than prestidigitation, more pizazz than performance. Harold von Braunhut was the perfect person to attend to this shift, as he was, in a sense, a kind of marketing Jedi master.", "Remember Amazing Hair-Raising Monsters (a bald troll printed on a card that grew green mineral locks when watered)? That was von Braunhut\u2019s, and although his novelty toys were, once they arrived, a bit disappointing, the marketing of them was a wonder of what we\u2019d all come to know as informercialism. His Crazy Crabs were nothing more than hermit crabs in a little cardboard box, but the ad copy described another world: \u201cAs gentle as a pussycat, it lives on LAND instead of water, DOES NOT BITE unless mishandled.\u201d And: \u201cIt loves to be touched and petted, and enjoys running from hand to hand, swinging from your fingers or just cuddling on your shoulder like an adorable tame parrot.\u201d", "With Sea-Monkeys, von Braunhut took his marketing to new levels. He spun off numerous whimsical books with all kinds of imaginary advice for caring for the tiny critters. You could coddle them with Sea-Monkeys \u201cBanana Treat\u201d or \u201cCupids Arrow\u201d Mating Powder. (Inside joke for the arthropodologists: Sea-Monkeys don\u2019t always need mates.) There were timely variations of the toy. There was a Space Sea-Monkey kit, and a Sea-Monkey Speedway that deployed giant eyedroppers to create racecourses. The same equipment was repurposed into kits for Sea-Monkeys Ski-Trials, Sea-Monkeys Fox Hunt and Sea-Monkeys Mystery Robo-Diver. In 1992, CBS broadcast a Sea-Monkey TV show starring, naturally, Howie Mandel. To this day, there is a website for Sea-Monkey zealots, who exchange Sea-Monkey lore and kitschy enthusiasms.", "What made Braunhut\u2019s work so edgy, so American, was just how wickedly far he\u2019d journey \u2014 far past the product itself \u2014 into the fictional. I remember X-Ray Spex (also von Braunhut\u2019s), with that promise of seeing girls naked beneath their clothes, as my first shattering disillusionment with the world of adults and all their horrible lies. Signorelli von Braunhut told me that Harold\u2019s purest novelty was his Invisible Goldfish. \u201cIt was a glass bowl with some sea plants,\u201d she said, \u201cand a sign that said, \u2018Invisible Goldfish: Do Not Feed.\u2019\u2009\u201d The kit came with a printed guarantee that you\u2019d never see them.", "Not everyone appreciated the joke. In the 1970s, at the height of a nationwide focus on consumer protection, New York\u2019s attorney general, Louis Lefkowitz, went after von Braunhut. \u201cThe suit against Harold by Louie Lefkowitz,\u201d Signorelli von Braunhut said, \u201cargued that Sea-Monkeys were fraudulent, because it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d", "A federal judge who reviewed Lefkowitz\u2019s case was amused by the attorney general\u2019s intense concern. According to the judge, Lefkowitz argued that the novelty\u2019s marketing included von Braunhut\u2019s claim that \u201cSea-Monkeys are covered by \u2018Limited Group Sea-Monkey Life Insurance Policy.\u2019\u2009\u201d Lefkowitz demanded that von Braunhut cease \u201cthe usage of the name \u2018Sea-Monkeys\u2019 in the sale of brine shrimp\u201d because they \u201cwere not miniature monkeys, and are not a miracle or anything new scientifically.\u201d Finally, Lefkowitz beseeched the courts to \u201cenjoin the issuance of insurance policies covering \u2018Sea-Monkeys.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "In the legal record, it\u2019s not clear that Lefkowitz got any further than this legalistic tantrum, but Signorelli von Braunhut remembers a judge\u2019s coming down on the side of whimsy. \u201cSea-Monkeys were vindicated,\u201d she said. The judge compared the issue to \u201csponge cake \u2014 it\u2019s not a sponge; and butterflies are not made of butter.\u201d", "But apparently, this fundamental question about Sea-Monkeys was not settled. In the scores of files that have already been entered into court for the current litigation, one is an affidavit by Sam Harwell, the chief executive of Big Time Toys. He is a very powerful man in Nashville, not only because he owns a big-time toy company but also because his wife, Beth Harwell, is the speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Harwell declined to return my phone calls, but Big Time has continued to sell Sea-Monkeys, to Walmart and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, even after Yolanda claimed a breach of contract and quit sending out the specially formulated shrimp.", "In this affidavit, Harwell explains precisely why he outsourced his Sea-Monkeys to China. He declares that there are seven recognized species of artemia brine shrimp and that artemia nyos \u201cclaimed by plaintiffs is not one of them,\u201d because it is a hybrid. Regular old, salt-lake brine shrimp \u2014 at least in terms of their size and life expectancy \u2014 \u201care indistinguishable from the pouches supplied by plaintiffs.\u201d", "In essence, Harwell is making a kind of existential case about the fundamentals of American marketing, and a familiar one. He\u2019s practically picking up where Lefkowitz left off by arguing that there is no there there, Sea-Monkey-wise. It\u2019s all part of the confidence game. Part of the sham. It\u2019s humbug. And if the issues in Harwell\u2019s affidavit go forward, then that is what may be on trial. Humbug.", "When P.T. Barnum, the great 19th-century impresario of public entertainment (and co-founder of the Barnum & Bailey Circus) popularized that word \u2014 \u201chumbug\u201d \u2014 he was talking exactly about things like Sea-Monkeys. Most assume, as Harwell might, that the word is synonymous with total nonsense and absolute fraud. But that overgeneralization misses Barnum\u2019s sly nuance. \u201cHumbug\u201d is not a lie, the great promoter used to say: \u201cNo humbug is great without truth at bottom.\u201d It\u2019s unfair to say that Barnum peddled pure fantasy. Great humbug simply took off from a small truth and used that to show people what they wanted to see. In his own way, P.T. Barnum was the greatest cognitive scientist of the 19th century. He understood that when you pit humbug against harsh cold reality, reality doesn\u2019t stand a chance. Knowing this explains so much \u2014 World Wrestling, Taco Bell, Donald Trump.", "Humbug is as American as Ritz-Cracker apple pie. Which is why Sea-Monkeys are involved in a lawsuit now and why Barnum got tangled up in one in his time, litigating the nature of humbug. The case involved one of the biggest tourist attractions after the Civil War: the 1869 discovery of the Cardiff Giant in a little town of that name near Syracuse. Just as nowadays, there was an argument between rationalists and people of faith about the science of the Bible, in this case, whether the giants described in the Scriptures were real. (People forget that the reason God flooded the entire earth during the time of Noah is that angels and humans kept having lots of illicit sex and inadvertently created a race of deranged giants.)", "At the time, \u201cfossil\u201d had become one of the buzzwords in the popular battle between Darwinian scientists and angry pastors. So a cigar maker named George Hull thought it would be entertaining to fabricate a fossil of one of Noah\u2019s giants. He had a 10-foot man secretly sculpted, treated it to look old and then buried it in rural New York State, where he contrived to have it found. Instantly, massive crowds of astounded Christians started pouring into town, eager to see biblical proof in the petrified man with the 21-inch-long feet and the six-inch nose and all the other proportionate appendages. Hull made lots of money charging 50 cents a viewing. But as his wealth grew, he became nervous that the hoax would blow up. So he sold the Cardiff Giant to a consortium of businessmen, headed by a man named David Hannum.", "P.T. Barnum instantly offered the consortium $50,000 to buy the Cardiff Giant, no doubt convinced that humbug of this magnitude really deserved his marketing skills. Hannum declined, but he clearly did not appreciate just whom he was up against. Barnum had his own copy carved and rushed his giant to New York City. At one point the fake giant and the knockoff fake giant were being exhibited two blocks from each other. Barnum\u2019s marketing drew much larger crowds. And even as Hull, the original forger, publicly confessed that the original Giant was a fake, Hannum took Barnum to court. The judge, of course, ruled in favor of Barnum \u2014 you can\u2019t be sued for calling a fake a fake. Humbug won, and the Giants toured for years afterward. Before the judge\u2019s 1870 ruling, Hannum still believed in his giant\u2019s authenticity and fumed about the popularity of Barnum\u2019s, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u201d Many mistakenly ascribe the remark to P.T. Barnum himself. And it\u2019s understandable.

Large metal gates decorated with prancing wrought-iron Sea-Monkeys open to a number of No Trespassing signs. About a mile down the road, it turned into farmland, with a barn and a scalloped wood bridge decorated with large festive red bows crossing a pond gleaming with bright chartreuse scum.

Joe Orlando, who would later achieve fame at DC Comics and Mad Magazine, illustrated the cover art. The image itself is famous. You know it: a Sea-Monkey family with three antennas wagging on their heads and long paddle tails lounging outside their underwater castle.

The real innovation may never have been the secret formula of his brine shrimp but the cognitive ignition of those four perfect words of distilled humbuggery: Amazing Live Sea-Monkeys.", "That alone might well have been enough to loft Harold von Braunhut into the pantheon of toy inventors, alongside Uncle Milton Levine, D.F.

Four decades ago, the word had much more in common with Latin American liberation theology than it did with \u201cLean In.\u201d In 1968, the Brazilian academic Paulo Freire coined the word \u201cconscientization,\u201d empowerment\u2019s precursor, as the process by which an oppressed person perceives the structural conditions of his oppression and is subsequently able to take action against his oppressors.", "Eight years later, the educator Barbara Bryant Solomon, writing about American black communities, gave this notion a new name, \u201cempowerment.\u201d It was meant as an ethos for social workers in marginalized communities, to discourage paternalism and encourage their clients to solve problems in their own ways. Then in 1981, Julian Rappaport, a psychologist, broadened the concept into a political theory of power that viewed personal competency as fundamentally limitless; it placed faith in the individual and laid at her feet a corresponding amount of responsibility too.", "Sneakily, empowerment had turned into a theory that applied to the needy while describing a process more realistically applicable to the rich. The word was built on a misaligned foundation; no amount of awareness can change the fact that it\u2019s the already-powerful who tend to experience empowerment at any meaningful rate.

It\u2019s about pleasure, not power; it\u2019s individualistic and subjective, tailored to insecurity and desire. The new empowerment doesn\u2019t increase potential so much as it assures you that your potential is just fine. Even when the thing being described as \u201cempowering\u201d is personal and mildly defiant (not shaving, not breast-feeding, not listening to men, et cetera), what\u2019s being mar\u00adketed is a certain identity.

Dove, the Patient Zero of empowerment marketing, has lifted its sales to the tune of $1.5 billion with its \u201c#RealBeauty\u201d campaign, cooked up by executives who noticed that few women like to call themselves beautiful and saw in that tragic modesty a great opportunity to raise the profile of the Dove brand.", "When consumer purchases aren\u2019t made out to be a path to female empowerment, a branded corporate experience often is.

The ready partici\u00adpation of well-off women in this strat\u00adegy also points to a deep truth about the word \u201cempowerment\u201d: that it has never been defined by the people who actually need it.

On March 8, International Women\u2019s Day, Kim Kardashian posted an essay on the topic to her subscription-only website, in response to the backlash over a naked selfie she had posted \u2014 criticism leveled mainly by women who drink their empowerment a different way.", "\u201cI am empowered by my body,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am empowered by my sexuality.\u201d Quickly, her focus turned global: \u201cI hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world.\u201d", "On that day, corporate empowerment came to a teleological summit in the hands of Kardashian, who\u2019s not as different from Sheryl Sandberg as she may seem. Like Sandberg, Kardashian is the apotheosis of a particular brand of largely contentless feminism, a celebratory form divorced from material politics, which makes it palatable \u2014 maybe irresistible \u2014 to the business world.", "The mistake would be to locate further empowerment in choosing between the two.

They would become a weapon, to be used against me.", "Q. In the past few years, is it becoming easier or more difficult for North Koreans to evade the Chinese police?", "A. More difficult. In the past, at least North Korean defectors could make fake [Chinese] ID cards, but those fake ID cards right now don\u2019t work. Because they\u2019re checking them with a machine, so more people are getting caught.", "Q. Do you think there will be political change in North Korea?", "A. No dictator can last forever. History shows that in the end people around the dictator bring about change. Of course a lot of high-ranking officials don\u2019t want change, because they want to keep power. But there are other good people who want change. I believe they are waiting for the chance.", "China has such an important role.

If you tell, after all, it\u2019s your sister who will have to explain to her son why she has kept this fact from him and face his likely reproaches (spoken or not) for her infidelity to the man your nephew always thought of as his father. There\u2019s also a serious chance her ex-husband will find out, which could lead to more distress, not least because it may disrupt his relationship with the man he raised as his son. And consequences aside, there\u2019s the simple, forceful fact that you gave your word.", "The best outcome, I suspect, is one in which you persuade your sister to tell her son herself. Aim for that. She surely knows her son better than you do and will have views about how the revelation would affect him; she\u2019ll also have views about how to manage their relationship afterward.

Period. Most teachers find cursory treatment of letters distasteful, but this is one way for teachers to make clear how much time they devote to their jobs outside the workday.

Public education is a major responsibility of our communities; we need dedicated teachers and working conditions that sustain them. Still, if writing carefully composed college admissions letters is part of the job, not doing so is an undeclared work stoppage that penalizes students, who are not to blame for the failures of the school board. Many teachers, precisely because they are dedicated professionals, would have a hard time bringing themselves to do it. They know that kids who lose scholarships or admittances as a consequence may have no chance of a do-over.

I was also truthful when I told him that without surgery he would definitely die soon but comfortably, and that the only, albeit slim, chance of surviving this event would be going immediately to the operating room. His family was hours from our hospital. He decided to proceed with surgery and indeed died from complications.", "My question: Is it ethical to refuse to operate on a patient like this, knowing that he had declined surgery in the past?

Even if his earlier doctor\u2019s clear recommendation was for surgery, declining elective repair was still the patient\u2019s choice to make. So was pursuing the emergency, low-odds surgery with you. Medical treatment is not the prerogative of people who make good choices.", "You suggest three reasons for refusing him surgery. First, because he made the wrong decision earlier. Second: It was a waste of resources. Third: His death was painful for you. The first and third reasons sit badly with me. It\u2019s not your job to judge the earlier decisions of your patients \u2014 you don\u2019t withhold surgery from an accident victim who neglected to wear a seatbelt \u2014 and as a surgeon, you\u2019re obliged to do the best you can for your patients, even if it discomforts you.", "I have some sympathy, though, with the second reason. The costs of treating people are borne by all of us, through taxes and insurance premiums. We cannot spend all our resources on medicine. So we have to make decisions about what we will and won\u2019t do. Difficult and expensive surgery with a very low probability of prolonging life is the sort of thing that we can reasonably decide we won\u2019t do. That tenet wouldn\u2019t normally apply to surgery for ruptured aortic aneurysms, which I gather has a mortality rate of about 50 percent. (Not good, but not terrible.) Yet there may be procedures for which the ratio between resources and results is wildly lopsided.", "Decisions like these, however, aren\u2019t to be made on the fly by a single physician.

She, her husband and their two children curl up on the sofa and stream a service they like at a synagogue in Ohio. \u201cAt services around here, I always felt a little lonely without my entire extended family,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cWatching online with my kids, I feel like I get back some of the feeling of togetherness I was looking for.\u201d Friends of hers have set up a Google Hangout where they light Sabbath candles together.", "On the Internet, all are included: distant relatives and friends, elderly aunts and sick grandparents can be virtually drawn into a physical gathering they may otherwise miss. This used to happen post facto, when photographs were mailed; now celebrants keep cellphones by their side throughout dinner, posting images as they eat. But it can take away some of the intimacy and informality.", "\u201cA 22-year-old woman complained to me that she used to love coming home for the holidays,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, author of \u201cReclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age.\u201d Once her mother started posting all the photos online, she missed the privacy. \u201cBefore, she could relax and be a child again, but now she feels like she has to put on makeup and be on her best behavior.

I\u2019ve tried to be more festive in April, National Poetry Month, posting several odes to verse. On National Siblings Day (April 10), while everyone else displayed sweet childhood photos of sisters hugging, I went gung-ho on Twitter: \u201cWhen I was a child, my older brother would pin me down and let long tentacles of saliva dangle menacingly in my face. #HappySiblingsDay.\u201d A bunch of total strangers favorited it, and I felt good."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/t-magazine/art/artists-studios-amalia-ulman-jared-madere-neil-beloufa-darja-bajagic.html": ["Once, an artist holed up in her paint-spattered loft and created in solitude.

She admits that collectors and artist friends \u2014 who mostly work in shared warehouses \u2014 find her setup a little odd. And yet Ulman likes her studio in downtown L.A. for the same reason she likes hotel rooms: She can\u2019t get distracted by trying to personalize the space. She feels obliged to keep the office tidy, to avoid potential awkwardness when the cleaner comes at 6 p.m. And she feels pressured to keep her schedule. \u201cEveryone is working,\u201d she explains, \u201cso I feel like I have to do the same thing.\u201d", "Of course, this is only part of the story. Ulman is best known for the five-month performance \u201cExcellences & Perfections\u201d (2014) that told, through a series of carefully crafted selfies on Instagram, the story of a narcissistic young woman\u2019s coming of age and descent into drugs. Followers of Ulman\u2019s Instagram feed, @amaliaulman, have recently watched the unfolding of a mysterious new series: Here are photos of Ulman sitting in her office wearing Mary Jane shoes; homemade advertisements for Shiseido; New Yorker-style cartoons featuring a woman with a pigeon sidekick. The idea behind the new works, she says, is to explore the way \u201cwe become caricatures of ourselves online.\u201d", "The office itself has become an important character in the new photographs, in which she exaggerates, among other traits, her workaholic tendencies. (In one short Instagram video, she films her reflection in the building\u2019s elevator doors as she chants, exhausted, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d until the doors open.) She makes these videos and photos spontaneously as she works. \u201cInstead of planning the photograph, I plan the whole scene, and just spend some time there,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey\u2019re always better if they\u2019re actually selfies,\u201d she continues, \u201cand if I\u2019m like, actually tired.\u201d", "Jared Madere\u2019s studio \u2014 a large garage filled with free Craigslist furniture and curious artifacts opposite a building site in the Bronx \u2014 is, in some ways, exactly what one might expect for a young artist trying to make it in New York City. And yet the space is also a rebellion for Madere, 29, whose entire career has been spent fleeing the very idea of permanence and stability, both in the materials he uses and the spaces in which he lives and works \u2014 which, until recently, included the RV that is now parked inside, awaiting its next adventure.", "Madere bought the van in 2014 after he learned his Bed-Stuy landlord might raise the rent on his apartment, and it became not only his home, but a kind of trademark: He drove it to Miami Basel in 2013 and, for a party at the Whitney last year, parked it outside the museum, inviting visitors inside a mobile exhibition space.", "Until his commission for the Whitney earlier in 2015, Madere had bypassed having a studio by making most of his installations in the gallery spaces in which they were to be shown. He likes to work with organic, delicate materials \u2014 flowers, cherries, dripping wax, motor grease \u2014 that behave in unpredictable ways. Starting out as an artist, he discovered another advantage of working with unlikely media \u2014 that the more outlandish the request (for \u201cthree kilos of raspberries,\u201d say), the more likely it was that a curator or gallery would leap to his aid, helping to source and transport the necessary materials.", "The Bronx space represents a maturation for the artist, who has since moved on to more conventional living quarters, and who has been working on a series of metal figures. Still, there are signs everywhere of Madere\u2019s love of things that move, decompose and shine: a TV set playing a looping tournament of the hoversled game Wipeout, a rolling projection of medieval manuscripts on the wall, flowers in glittery vases. \u201cMy friend recently told me that the reason why humans like shiny stuff is because they\u2019re always trying to locate a water source,\u201d Madere says, and points to a back wall, where shimmering Mylar drapes ripple under an electric fan, a waterfall of fabric.", "The Algerian-French artist Ne\u00efl Beloufa, 31, sometimes jokes that he can no longer work in his own studio because it has been gentrified. He is, of course, responsible for its transformation. Two years ago, having taken over an entire former factory building in the Paris suburb of Villejuif that he had been sharing with other artists for the previous four years, Beloufa decided to make \u201cOccidental,\u201d a film he had been contemplating for almost a decade. To transform the vast warehouse into the film set, he and a team of 16 constructed over two stories a series of interiors including hotel bedrooms, corridors, a kitchen, an office and a lobby, replete with potted plants and ubiquitous waiting-room furniture.", "Beloufa is known for sculptures that employ technological devices such as surveillance cameras and videos, and for films that merge documentary and fiction, often starring nonactors. \u201cOccidental,\u201d his first real feature, is different, starring professionals and made with a bigger budget. The film\u2019s complex narrative begins when a hotel receptionist becomes suspicious of two men who present themselves as an Italian couple but who seem neither Italian nor gay. For this Hitchcockian thriller of identity politics, Beloufa wanted the d\u00e9cor to be \u201970s and drab, evoking the look of what he calls \u201cpostcolonial tourism.\u201d", "And yet the project is, one senses, more than a film. Beloufa, who characterizes himself as \u201cvery analytique,\u201d likes the idea that he is creating an alternate, miniature art world \u2014 one in which he isn\u2019t pressured by \u201cthe institution.\u201d (He used the proceeds from his own past sales to fund the film rather than taking a commission from a museum.) Beloufa\u2019s studio is a self-sufficient society; he works on all his projects with the same team, which includes high-school friends and fellow artists who are paid the same salary as he pays himself: It is studio as cooperative. Last fall, after filming wrapped, he tore down half the set, mounting an exhibition \u2014 partly on the set, partly in a series of newly constructed white cubicles \u2014 for the artists who had, at one time or another, passed through the warehouse, celebrating the community it had nurtured. \u201cTransforming the studio into an arts center was a way of saying, \u2018I don\u2019t need the institution,\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cThe institution needs us.\u201d", "Just as there are two sides to Darja Bajagic\u2019s haunting, peculiar art, so there are two sides of her studio. First, there is the traditional paint-spattered atelier with shelves of cans of latex wall paints and canvases piled on the floor. Then there is the office, clean and tidy and a little hidden away. It is here that Bajagic, 26, finds the images that she appropriates in her paintings: photos from 1990s horror-porn magazines with names like Draculina, murderabilia, pictures from barely legal websites, portraits of murdered and missing women. \u201cI do sometimes worry about my Google search history,\u201d she admits.", "The juxtapositions of old and new media and spaces are a result of Bajagic\u2019s splintered artistic influences. In her first months as a student at Yale, Bajagic made formally disciplined, near-monochromatic paintings in grays and whites and hyperlink blue, works so muted that her tutors repeatedly asked her what they were all about. At the same time, almost as a hobby, Bajagic was collecting images she found online of women \u2014 a habit she had developed as a lonely teenager, using them to create false profiles to chat to men online. Her solution to the problem of how to animate her paintings was to combine her two interests, literally pasting images from her online research on top of the canvases she had been working on. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to annihilate the history behind the pictures that I use,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019m trying to recontextualize them.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/technology/facebook-aims-to-drive-down-tech-prices-to-expand-its-reach.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, is clear about his vision for his company: He wants to triple the size of his social network, which now has 1.6 billion members.", "But to reach that new audience, he has to find a way to change telecommunications networks to make connecting to the Internet more affordable, since many of those would-be Facebook users live in developing countries.", "That could be bad news for the companies that make equipment for those networks, whether they are Silicon Valley giants like Cisco Systems or little widget makers that produce the parts to tie different pieces of the network together.", "\u201cThere is definitely going to be some pressure, some consolidation\u201d for many tech equipment suppliers, said Akshay Sharma, research director at the technology advisory firm Gartner. \u201cIf you\u2019re in hardware, you\u2019re going to reduce head count from thousands to maybe 10 people, a hundred at most.\u201d", "No doubt, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s grand \u2014 some would say grandiose \u2014 vision could take years to realize.

In 2000, for example, Sun Microsystems was worth $110 billion thanks to demand for its computer servers and workstations. A decade later the company was sold for $7.4 billion. Sun fell to cheaper competition from Linux, the popular open-source code that now runs many of Facebook\u2019s servers.", "When Facebook reveals the financial results for its most recent quarter on Wednesday, investors will no doubt scrutinize how much the company is spending, particularly since Mr. Zuckerberg has promised to invest more money in searching for new users.

(Warning: Catholic inside baseball below.)", "The Catholic Church\u2019s teaching on marriage is often mischaracterized, but here\u2019s a brief, probably-incomplete attempt at explanation. Following the words of Jesus and its own longstanding traditions, the church holds that valid sacramental marriages \u2014 that is, between two baptized Christians \u2014 are inherently indissoluble, meaning that in such circumstances a second marriage is (from the Catholic perspective) an impossibility, and Catholics who remarry after a civil divorce are actually committing the sin of adultery. This, in turn, has implications for the reception of communion, which is not supposed to take place if an individual is persisting in grave sin: A divorced Catholic can receive communion (so long as they aren\u2019t responsible for abandoning a spouse who wants them to return, or engaged in some other form of grave, unrepented sin), but a divorced-and-remarried Catholic should not, unless they intend to live with their new spouse as brother and sister instead of man and wife.", "Now: This strict teaching coexists with a less strict \u2014 and potentially much less strict \u2014 definition of what constitutes a valid marriage. Historically, Catholic marriages could be annulled (that is, declared to have been invalid from the beginning) for a fairly narrow range of reasons \u2014 a failure to consummate the union, consanguinity, the existence of a previous marriage, etc. But in recent decades, especially in the frequently-divorcing West, the range of justifications for annulling a marriage has expanded to include a much larger range of factors, psychological and emotional and intellectual, which might demonstrate that one or both members of a couple entering into a marriage basically didn\u2019t understand what they were getting into, didn\u2019t have a fully Christian understanding of the sacrament or fully Christian intentions to live it out, and thus weren\u2019t capable of the kind of true consent that a true marriage definitionally requires. And the (incorrect, but understandable) popular view of the annulment process as a kind of \u201cCatholic divorce\u201d flows from this more expansive list of reasons why a marriage might be declared null and void, and from the more expansive consequences: The United States, ground zero for the approach, has 6 percent of the world\u2019s Catholics and about 60 percent of the world\u2019s annulments.", "Not surprisingly, the wisdom of this expansive approach is vigorously debated within the church. It\u2019s been defended on the grounds that with the weakening of Christianity in Western culture and the apparent failure of Catholic catechesis among the young, modern couples really are much more likely to enter into sacramental marriages without really understanding what they\u2019re doing; it\u2019s been criticized as reflecting a kind of \u201canthropological pessimism\u201d that understates \u201cthe innate human capacity to marry\u201d even in cultural contexts unfriendly to the institution.", "But the debate notwithstanding, nobody denies that an annulment process of some kind is compatible with the traditional Catholic view of marriage\u2019s indissolubility, and I think that most critics of the American way of annulment would concede that a form that considers psychological and cultural factors, while prone to practical abuses, doesn\u2019t introduce any inherent logical tensions into the church\u2019s teaching on marriage. (There\u2019s also no question that in a multi-religious society where people move more often between faiths, situations that were once rare \u2014 Google \u201cPauline Privilege\u201d for an example \u2014 are likely to become more commonplace, and church rubrics need to become more flexible to deal with them.)", "So the church has a certain amount of room to change its policies and practices (whether wisely or not; I\u2019m bracketing that issue) on annulments without necessarily calling doctrine into question. If, for instance, following next year\u2019s synod of bishops (which is focused on family life), Pope Francis were to take steps to expand, alter and streamline the annulment process in ways that might ultimately bring American-style annulment rates to other parts of of the Catholic world \u2014 well, there would undoubtedly be criticism and lively argument about the wisdom of the move, but it wouldn\u2019t create a theological crisis for Catholic conservatives, or call into question the authority of his office.", "However, what\u2019s being proposed and discussed and debated among some of the church\u2019s bishops and cardinals \u2014 with, it would seem, the blessing of the pope \u2014 is something significantly different: An official mechanism whereby a divorced and remarried Catholic could, without having their previous marriage declared invalid, do penance for any sins involved in their divorce and then receive communion without their new marriage being a moral impediment to reception of the host. In practice, this would move the church in the direction of Eastern Orthodoxy, which has traditionally allowed pastoral exceptions for second marriages, but it would so in a more ambiguous way \u2014 effectively creating a kind of second tier of marital unions for Catholics, whose existence the church would decide to \u201ctolerate\u201d (in the words of Cardinal Walter Kasper, the leading voice making the proposal) but \u201cnot accept.\u201d", "Now one can debate the practical effects of such a proposal (I have various thoughts, but again, I\u2019ll save them). And one certainly can, as the Orthodox and many Protestant churches do, make reasonable theological and biblical arguments for accepting second marriages in some form. But here\u2019s the crucial problem: The test for changes to Catholic practice isn\u2019t just supposed to be \u201cwhat practical consequences are likely to ensue?\u201d and the bar that such changes need to clear isn\u2019t just supposed to be \u201cwhat can be reasonably defended by thoughtful Christians?\u201d Rather, the primary test and crucial bar alike are supposed to be \u201cwhat can be reasonably defended in the light of what the Roman Catholic Church has historically affirmed and taught?\u201d", "Seen in that light, it is very hard for me to understand how this kind of change wouldn\u2019t create some pretty significant internal problems for Catholic doctrine as currently and traditionally understood. Saying, with Cardinal Kasper, that second marriages can be tolerated but not accepted implies a zone of human conduct that one might call \u201ctolerable sinfulness,\u201d which is an idea that church teaching does not currently support. (And which if it did support would have all kinds of moral and doctrinal implications, extending well beyond this particular debate.) And whatever individuals and pastors decide to take upon their own consciences, declaring the reception of communion licit for the remarried-but-not-annulled in any systematic way seems impossible without real changes \u2014 each with its own potential doctrinal ripples \u2014 to one or more of three theologically-important Catholic ideas: The understanding that people in grave sin should not generally receive the Eucharist, the understanding that adultery is always a grave sin, and/or the understanding that a valid sacramental marriage is indissoluble.", "Which in turn would mean that if he actually made this kind of change \u2014 and, as I said in the column, I do not think he will, but it is being debated with his apparent encouragement, so the possibility has to be addressed \u2014 Pope Francis would be either dissolving important church teachings into what looks to me like incoherence, or else changing those same teachings in a way that many conservative Catholics believe that the pope simply cannot do.", "Now I am obviously neither a theologian nor a church historian, so my judgments on an issue like this are hardly (ahem) infallible. But in following the controversy, the arguments that this sort of move would not require a doctrinal change seem fairly weak. There is the claim that it would be a strictly disciplinary change, not a dogmatic one \u2026 but unlike many other disciplinary issues (from Friday fasts to priestly celibacy), this seems like a case where the discipline is more or less required by a doctrine or doctrines, and to alter one is to at least strongly imply an alteration in the others. There is also the invocation of practices from the early centuries of the church, when some second marriages may have been handled in this manner, and the suggestion that under such a reform the church would be simply returning to an ancient practice. But the entire theory of the development of dogma, which is central to defenses of continuity in Catholic teaching, would seem to militate against the idea that the consistent witness (and to this layman, it really does look pretty consistent) of the second millennium of Catholic history, complete with martyrs and dogmatic definitions, can safely be set aside because of some highly ambiguous cases from the first millennium.", "Now these are not points that would trouble many liberal Catholics, who often reject the intertwined ideas of consistency in Catholic doctrine and papal infallibility, and for whom the idea of a pope willing to alter doctrine might be a consummation devoutly to be wished. But for conservative Catholics, many of whom have spent the John Paul and Benedict eras arguing that on a range of controversial questions the whole issue isn\u2019t just that the church shouldn\u2019t change, but that it can\u2019t \u2026 well, if a change like this did happen, however hedged and with however many first millennium antecedents invoked, that conservative argument would at the very least look weaker than it did during the last two pontificates.", "And since it isn\u2019t a small argument \u2026 since the church\u2019s claim to a constant, non-contradicting authority lies close to the heart of why many conservative Catholics are conservative Catholics \u2026 well, that\u2019s why the \u201cschism\u201d possibility seems worth raising, because hard-to-process theological shocks are where institutional fractures often start. It\u2019s one thing for conservative Catholics to serve as a kind of loyal opposition during this pontificate \u2014 to learn to doubt a pope, or disagree with his rhetoric or decision-making, while remaining faithful to the office and the church. It\u2019s quite another if one of those papal decisions seriously calls into question the doctrinal continuity that\u2019s the very root of conservative-Catholic loyalty. And there just isn\u2019t a recent model apart from the Lefebvrist schism for how that kind of more-Catholic-than-the-pope dissent would practically work.", "But once again, I could be completely wrong, about either the problematic nature of the shift being discussed or the likely conservative reaction to the change. All I can say for certain is that a development like this would leave me more doubtful than before about the consistency of Catholic doctrine and the nature of the church. But I\u2019m not sure what to read into these feelings: While I obviously fall into the conservative camp in the Catholic culture wars I\u2019m also on the less-rigorous, more-latitudinarian end of the conservative-Catholic spectrum, so I tend to expect that what unsettles me should unsettle the more rigorous even more \u2026 but it could also be that if I were more rigorous I\u2019d be more trusting and less suspicious, and less likely to see (invent?) discontinuities where they might not actually exist. I\u2019m not sure \u2026", "\u2026 But I am sure that I\u2019ve said enough here, so I\u2019ll leave off. Interesting times.

Still, the comparison to Walmart goes only so far. Walmart\u2019s operating profit margin is 5.6 percent. Amazon\u2019s is a minuscule 0.7 percent. Walmart has been consistently profitable since its earliest days, but for Amazon, bumper profits have always been just beyond the horizon.", "So analysts and investors have tended to measure Amazon based on revenue rather than profits. On that basis, Amazon\u2019s price looks fairly reasonable: Its price to sales ratio is just over 2.

It was 40 percent two years ago and now it\u2019s close to 20 percent.\u201d He said there were plenty of other Internet companies growing in the midteens to 20 percent, including Google, Priceline and eBay, and they\u2019re much cheaper. \u201cReality is starting to settle in,\u201d he said.", "And Professor Greenwald noted that product sales \u2014 the core of Amazon\u2019s business \u2014 grew by only 18 percent in the quarter, and the projections for the next quarter also suggested slower revenue growth. \u201cAnd profits were a disaster,\u201d he added.", "Still, should the Walmart analogy cool, Amazon always seems to have another story. This week, it unveiled a deal to stream some HBO programs over the Internet, and it has been commissioning original programming.

In addition, Ms. Mayer was awarded $12.47 million worth of restricted stock in early 2013 that had grown to $23.7 million by year-end.

Ms. Mayer\u2019s trusted lieutenant, Henrique de Castro, who was hired to assist the turnaround, was recently fired as chief operating officer.", "Still, Ms. Mayer has some achievements at Yahoo. She has revamped products and replaced much of Yahoo\u2019s staff while reversing two years of losses in the number of people using its sites and services. All told, it\u2019s too soon to know what will happen to Yahoo, and certainly those gains are not what is driving its stock price up right now.", "For now, however, Yahoo still holds its crown jewel, its stake in Alibaba.", "Yahoo initially bought 40 percent of the Chinese company in 2005. Yahoo sold part of it back to Alibaba in 2012 for $7.6 billion, but retained a 24 percent stake.", "Since then, Alibaba has been growing rapidly and is expected to go to market in the coming months in an I.P.O. that may value the company at more than $150 billion, and Yahoo\u2019s stake at $36 billion.", "The noise over the Alibaba I.P.O. has drowned out nearly anything Yahoo says about its own business.", "Even when Yahoo recently announced the decline in quarterly earnings, its stock jumped as much as 9 percent. It didn\u2019t hurt that Yahoo also reported that Alibaba\u2019s revenue growth had risen 66 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.", "An analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey has calculated that Alibaba now adds about $29 to every Yahoo share, assuming that the Chinese company is valued at $150 billion after its I.P.O. Yahoo\u2019s stock closed on Tuesday at $35.83 a share.", "Simply put, without Alibaba, Ms. Mayer\u2019s options would probably be close to worthless and her package would be worth about $10 million.", "In other words, Alibaba has most likely added most of the money to Ms. Mayer\u2019s pocket, money from her pay package, a pay package intended to provide performance incentives.", "What did Ms. Mayer do for this windfall? Sure, she is working hard and getting early results, but not at Alibaba. The Chinese company is managed by Jack Ma and his partners. It appears to want little to do with Yahoo, and has been pushing for Yahoo to sell its stake down. Indeed, as part of an Alibaba I.P.O., Yahoo has agreed to sell 40 percent of its stake, but can hang on to the rest indefinitely.", "Ms. Mayer is not alone in her fortunate payday. Mr. de Castro received $58 million when he was pushed out less than a year and a half after his hiring. His pay package when hired was calculated to be worth $17 million by Yahoo.", "Such paydays illustrate that it is often good fortune \u2014 a rise in the stock market or a turn in the economy \u2014 rather than individual performance that accounts for the bulk of executive pay.", "Despite the good luck of Ms. Mayer and others, option and incentive compensation persist, spurred by government subsidies through favorable tax treatment and the fact that, unlike cash, stock compensation appears to cost the company very little to award. Not only that, companies are not required to disclose how much they miss the mark in awarding initial compensation.", "It\u2019s time to recognize that stock-based compensation can often be no more than casino chips. Stock is easy for a board to hand out without regard to the true cost, creating a huge win for executives in a game stacked in the chief\u2019s favor.", "Ms. Mayer\u2019s case is extreme, but it shows it is time to rethink all stock compensation.

After graduating, Mr. Liddle sought to expand the paper\u2019s reach. He registered The Koala as a for-profit business in 2005 and contacted students at San Diego State, where they secured student association status and office space. Briefly, the papers existed in an ambiguous universe: as both business and university organizations. Critics lobbied administrators to revoke student association status at U.C.-San Diego, and eventually at San Marcos. The conflict was moot at San Diego State. Staff members were accused of alcohol- and drug-related violations and its university affiliation pulled.

They are rebels without causes or activist leaders, mindless consumers or cultural kingpins, digital natives or na\u00effs. Enter Danah Boyd, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research and a research assistant professor at New York University. In life, Boyd retains the spirit of a youthful rebel, with her pierced tongue and name spelled in anti-Establishment lowercase. And perhaps in part thanks to its author\u2019s identification with youth, \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated\u201d avoids many of the typical either-or clich\u00e9s about adolescence. Boyd\u2019s new book is layered and smart.", "In each chapter, Boyd addresses various panics about teenagers. She describes how they live virtually today, meeting on Skype rather than in the den, mall or park; texting one another through classes, sharing relationship drama on Facebook. She understands why adults are concerned about teenagers becoming screenagers but also what teenagers get out of their screen lives. Boyd palpably cares for her subjects.", "\u201cI often heard parents complain that their children preferred computers to \u2018real people,\u2019 \u201d Boyd writes. In her research, however, she discovered that they would much rather hang out with their friends in person. But they can\u2019t. \u201cToday\u2019s teenagers have less freedom to wander than any previous generation.\u201d Many American teenagers attend schools outside their neighborhoods, live in gated communities and are advised (often by their parents) to fear strangers. Curfew and loitering laws further tack kids to their bedrooms. According to Boyd, the American bourgeoisie is more devoted to buying free-range meat than raising free-range children. In this anodyne, restricted America, social media is the only way teenagers can effectively get a life.", "To parents or educators who believe social media is dangerous, Boyd argues that there\u2019s no reason to believe \u201cdigital celibacy\u201d will help teenagers become smarter, happier or healthier. If adults worry that their children are falling in love with their operating systems (as in Spike Jonze\u2019s film \u201cHer\u201d), she offers a more positive spin. Teenagers go online \u201cto take control of their lives and their relationship to society,\u201d she writes. \u201cSocial media \u2014 far from being the seductive Trojan horse \u2014 is a release valve, allowing youth to reclaim meaningful sociality as a tool for managing the pressures and limitations around them.\u201d Boyd\u2019s lesson is this: If the concern is that kids are spending too much time online, the best response isn\u2019t merely to pull the plug. Parents, teachers and even urban planners might try to think about giving kids physical freedom, leisure time and more public spaces to gather to actually change their digital habits.", "The book also offers a thoughtful and useful chapter on privacy and technology, where Boyd writes with insightful pith, \u201cPrivacy doesn\u2019t just depend on agency; being able to achieve privacy is an expression of agency.\u201d", "This chapter and others are tethered to a central media studies tenet about teenagers (and fan boys and girls): Young people have more power and capacity than we might think. Youth and other networked communities are not simply passive consumers or pliant sex objects. Instead, they are cultural creators and arbiters who are, at least partially, controlling and scripting their own lives and experiences.", "Boyd writes brilliantly about teenagers\u2019 main weapon against privacy invasion, which she calls \u201csocial steganography.\u201d They practice a sort of interpersonal encryption when using social networks. For instance, parents might read but not fully understand teenagers\u2019 posts and messages because they\u2019re using in-jokes, nicknames, code words, subliminal tweeting or \u201csub-tweeting\u201d so tweets become \u201cmeaningless to clueless outsiders.\u201d I might find it silly if a 16-year-old from New Jersey on Facebook says she is 95 years old and from Easter Island. However, Boyd sees young people dissembling about their age or geography as the technological equivalent of writing messages with invisible ink. According to her, these personae are often modes of self-protection (from adult sexual predators, for instance) and also self-expression. \u201cRather than finding privacy by controlling access to content,\u201d she writes, \u201cmany teens are instead controlling access to meaning.\u201d", "Boyd is a passionate futurist. Indeed, \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated\u201d can be too bullish about growing up networked. She tends not to be explicitly critical of the fact that these teenagers have to navigate advertisements 24/7 and often become advertisements for themselves on social networks. To my mind, this is one of the most pernicious elements of social media. In addition, as today\u2019s default setting for all of us is publicity, privacy is costly and time-consuming (think about the time it takes to change settings or encrypt, for example). The recent revelations of how deeply our privacy is violated online by the N.S.A. as well as by data-mining corporations (which include Google and Facebook) have horrified some Americans. But we haven\u2019t even begun to imagine what it means to grow up thinking that your every email and text message is very likely being recorded.", "To her credit, Boyd acknowledges that teenagers\u2019 power \u2014 especially the edge obtained by cyber-manipulating identity and privacy \u2014 has its limits. Young people are sometimes exploited and bullied virtually. In addition, their privacy can be invaded in unexpected ways, through what Boyd calls \u201ccollapsed contexts.\u201d Their hidden online identities can be revealed accidentally on social media, where otherwise unconnected people can overlap. These crosshatched worlds can be particularly challenging, Boyd writes, for teenagers who occupy radically different worlds. For instance, a teenager she interviewed was still \u201cworking through her sexuality\u201d and was terrified of being outed inadvertently to her conservative parents by her online chat history. Other young people were worried that their use of social media might accidentally allow their hidebound religious parents to discover their buried identities.", "The idea of \u201ccollapsed contexts\u201d is just one way that Boyd\u2019s book helps us understand our new environment. \u201cIt\u2019s Complicated\u201d will update your mind.", "IT\u2019S COMPLICATED\nThe Social Lives of Networked Teens\nBy Danah Boyd\n281 pp. Yale University Press. $25."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/opinion/creating-a-two-speed-internet.html": ["Dividing traffic on the Internet into fast and slow lanes is exactly what the Federal Communications Commission would do with its proposed regulations, unveiled this week.

The rules would also prohibit broadband companies from blocking content by, for example, making it impossible for users to access a service like Skype that competes with their own products.", "If a majority of the five-member commission approves the proposal next month, it will be open to public comment before being finalized later this year. If adopted, this measure would be a huge victory for phone and cable companies that have consistently argued that services like Google, which owns YouTube, that transmit a lot of data should pay fees for the use of broadband networks.", "But the viability of those networks are based on decades of public investments in the Internet, the companies\u2019 use of public rights of way and, in the case of some companies, a long government-sanctioned monopoly over telephone service. Public interest groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Public Knowledge oppose the creation of two-tiered Internet service because it offers no public benefit, but would squelch innovation.", "Officials at the F.C.C. said on Thursday that the proposed rule is the fastest way for the commission to respond to a January ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that struck down previous rules barring broadband companies from blocking content or engaging in \u201cunjust and unreasonable discrimination.\u201d", "They argue that under the \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d standard, the agency will be able to review deals to make sure phone and cable companies do not abuse their market power (in most markets, there are only one or two service providers).

It should decide to classify broadband as a telecommunications service, which would allow it to prohibit companies like Verizon and Comcast from engaging in unjust or unreasonable discrimination.

Bush administration.)", "Mr. Wheeler is seeking public comment on this option, but he is not in favor of it.

Today, Mr. Laurie said, volunteers simply do not have the time to run that kind of audit.", "The problem, Mr. Raymond and other open-source advocates say, boils down to mismatched incentives. Mr. Raymond said firms don\u2019t maintain OpenSSL code because they don\u2019t profit directly from it, even though it is integrated into their products, and governments don\u2019t feel political pain when the code has problems.", "With OpenSSL, by contrast, \u201cfor those that do work on this, there\u2019s no financial support, no salaries, no health insurance,\u201d Mr. Raymond said. \u201cThey either have to live like monks or work nights and weekends.

I don\u2019t think there is one right answer; good start-up development is always a balance of speed, testing, and quality.

President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan is depicted uncharacteristically concerned. Ehud Olmert of Israel appears to be reading from a speech \u2014 an appealing work that can bring to mind a self-portrait by another, visionary amateur painter, the composer Arnold Schoenberg.", "Mr. Bush has an uncanny ability to translate photographs into more awkward images enlivened by distortions and slightly ham-handed brushwork. His skill  may be disconcerting for people who love painting and dislike the former president, but still, everyone needs to get a grip, especially those in the art world who dismiss the paintings without even seeing them.", "If Mr. Bush\u2019s portrait of Mr. Putin were an anonymous find in a thrift shop, most of us would happily snap it up. That these works are by Mr. Bush makes them more complicated, and useful as another lens with which to examine the personality and legacy of a man who may remain the greatest known unknown of his own presidency. They mostly confirm the version of Mr. Bush we are familiar with: a man who is extremely comfortable in his own skin, who is seemingly open and charming but also closed and opaque. And don\u2019t forget slyly self-deprecating.", "When asked about the bathing paintings in interviews ramping up to the exhibition, Mr. Bush distanced himself from them \u2014 and indirectly ridiculed anyone who took them seriously \u2014 by saying that he had only painted them to shock his teacher, the noted Dallas painter Gail Norfleet.", "Perhaps the biggest surprise of the show \u2014 contrary to the common caricature of laziness during his years in the White House \u2014 is that Mr. Bush has taken to painting with something amounting to driven passion, and is working very hard at it. Still Bushian nonchalance is not completely absent. The images seem legible and familiar, as if, as some have suggested, they were the first to pop up on Google.", "But this show is about much more than Mr. Bush\u2019s art. Nearly every painting is flanked as closely as Secret Service agents by big color photographs of the former president greeting, meeting and hanging out with its subject and also barricaded behind big vitrines holding often lavish official gifts. Mr. Putin presented Mr. Bush with watercolors of all American presidents bound in bejeweled velvet that suggest bad Faberg\u00e9. From the Dalai Lama, he received a traditional Tibetan white greeting scarf and from Ms. Merkel a multi-tiered Christmas cr\u00e8che. All this gives people uninterested in the paintings plenty else to look at, even if it\u2019s standard presidential-library fare.", "And of course, like everything else in the \u201cThe Art of Leadership: A President\u2019s Personal Diplomacy,\u201d the paintings place the former president on the world stage, where everyone is acting. Mr. Bush has not painted the people closest to him, who were instrumental in bringing him to power and shaping his presidency, namely Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld. Instead, he has painted a world of smiles and friendship that can rarely be taken as the whole story. The show reflects an attempt both to burnish the Bush presidency and distract us from its failures, as his brother Jeb, a former governor of Florida, may be readying his own campaign for the presidency.", "In the end, these works remain very much on the surface, in character perhaps with Mr. Bush and his presidency. That may paradoxically say more about art than about Mr. Bush. They remind us of art\u2019s insidious function as evidence and of its almost inevitable tendency to tell at least some of the truth, if not the whole truth.

Those are the parents Lyra and Cora have; those are qualities they themselves will gain. If blind optimism and a certain sense of hubris are also part of the package, well, there are worse faults, and maybe one of them is spending more time dreaming of adventure than experiencing it, particularly if it includes sheltering our children from experiencing any risk at all.", "In spite of our bedtime reading, we are not a family who sails across oceans.

Any use of debt was temporary; afterward, the federal government promptly balanced its budget.", "This book will be music to the ears of budget hawks everywhere. \u201cAmerican economic history does not support the idea that a strong economy depends on chronic federal borrowing,\u201d White writes.

Got that?", "But Aereo\u2019s days in obscurity are over. By Tuesday afternoon, Aereo was the No. 1 ranked \u201chot search\u201d on Google. That\u2019s because that morning, the Supreme Court heard the broadcasters\u2019 lawsuit against Aereo. The Washington Post put the fight on its front page, CNN did live stand-ups before and after the hearing, and reporters flocked to the court to grab all available seats.", "(Some seats were better than others \u2014 my obstructed view allowed me to see just five of the nine justices, but at least I had a majority.

The justices upheld a Michigan constitutional ban on affirmative action in admissions, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor read from the bench her searing dissent on the case. And before Aereo, the court heard an hourlong argument about an Ohio case that involved elections, abortions and free speech. A fight over dime-size antenna farms that let you watch the N.F.L. on your laptop seemed trifling by comparison.", "But the Aereo case has technology aficionados and media reporters in a tizzy, partly because it has a little bit of everything: legacy media hanging on to cherished business models, an insurgent with a crafty workaround and perhaps most important, the first big test at the Supreme Court of who owns and has rights to things that are stored in the cloud.  ", "The justices themselves displayed various degrees of understanding about the service, with Justice Sotomayor asking how it was different from her Roku (very) while Justice Antonin Scalia wondered whether Aereo would be able to just start grabbing HBO (it won\u2019t).", "Again and again, Aereo has been tagged as a Rube Goldberg-like invention.

As arguments proceeded, you could see the justices grappling with the implications attached to the start-up: was it a cable company, was it a cloud storage enterprise, and most important, was it distributing the broadcasters\u2019 programming to the public and if so, should it pay the price for doing so?", "The American Broadcasting Company, or ABC, is the named party in the lawsuit, and the network and its rivals fear that a win for Aereo will hurt their ability to receive retransmission fees from the cable providers that carry their service.", "Media reporters were not the only ones who showed up for the legal fireworks \u2014 the media moguls queued up too.

James Murdoch, the co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, attended. Former Senator Christopher J. Dodd, who now faces off against his own digital insurgency as chief of the Motion Picture Association of America, was also present.

The report indicated that the percentage of cord-cutting households in the United States increased to 6.5 percent in 2013 from 4.5 percent in 2010.

From a high of 10,588 square miles in 2004, deforestation dropped to 1,797 square miles in 2011; the number of metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere dropped as well, from 1.1 billion metric tons in 2004 to 298 million metric tons in 2011. These successes resulted from aggressive enforcement of the country\u2019s 1965 Forest Code, and a 2006 soy moratorium, a voluntary pledge brokered by the Brazilian government, agribusiness and environmental groups to prevent trade in soybeans cultivated on deforested land.", "Soybeans aren\u2019t the only cause of deforestation in Brazil, but they are a major factor. Brazil is now the world\u2019s second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States. Soybeans have been a boon to Brazil\u2019s economy, and global demand is growing. Under intense pressure from agricultural interests, Brazil\u2019s Chamber of Deputies approved legislation in July 2012 that rolled back many provisions of the 1965 Forest Code, reduced the amount of reserve areas in the Amazon and gave amnesty to past violators. To her credit, Brazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, thwarted some of the most damaging provisions of the new legislation, but the rate of deforestation still rose.", "The soy moratorium has been extended until the end of 2014, by which time Brazil plans to have in place new mechanisms to monitor soybean cultivation on deforested land. These mechanisms must be backed by credible enforcement. And developed countries need to do more to help Brazil, Indonesia and other nations whose forests are at risk protect a resource in which everyone has a stake."], "https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/the-broadband-revolution-is-not-nigh/": ["", "Is America on the cusp of a broadband revolution?

At the same time, we have to compete with the big boys for everything, most critically talent. But we can\u2019t afford big salaries and bonuses, in-house chefs, trips to inspiring conferences in exotic locations, or an office with floors connected by slides. How can we compete?", "I started Posse a few years ago with an idea and a dream. After 12 months, I raised our first round of capital ($1.5 million) and was able to start hiring. I knew that my focus had to be on creating the right culture. Posse was a challenge: I had to attract the best talent, and I needed them to be passionate and productive.", "I started strongly; my first few hires were senior people from Google and Virgin who accepted pay cuts of up to 50 percent. They wanted to be a part of building something they believed in, and they could see that at Posse their ideas would be heard and they would have a chance to make an impact. I put a lot of effort into establishing a great culture up front, and the company got off to a roaring start. It seemed easy. Three years in, I\u2019ve learned that the real challenge is maintaining that culture.", "Last year was our toughest. When our office lease came up for renewal in April, we couldn\u2019t afford to commit to another two years, so we moved into a garage under a friend\u2019s office. I spent 70 percent of my time in San Francisco, away from the team, trying to raise money. We had dwindling cash reserves, a product that had not yet connected and an exhausted team. The downward spiral began: As progress slowed, morale declined, and progress slowed even further. The team just wasn\u2019t proud of its work. Several people left, and I wasn\u2019t around to motivate the others.", "When our financing finally closed in December, I knew I\u2019d have to do something to point that spiral upward.

Even with a fresh round of capital, we were not going to achieve much with this culture.", "Yet in the last three months, I\u2019ve been able to turn things around.

Every week that this continued, I was wasting money.", "First, I tried hauling everyone into my office, one by one, and having a stern word with them about office hours and negativity.

Didn\u2019t they have any respect?", "After discussing the problem with a mentor, I decided to try a different tack: transparency. I would communicate with everyone, every day, by putting out a free company breakfast of cereal, fruit, fresh bread and baked treats each morning at 9. Over these breakfasts, everyone shares their achievements from the day before and talks about their plan for the day to come. I give a motivational talk and allow anyone to ask any question about the company. Oh, and the last person to arrive handles the clean up.", "It\u2019s a great opportunity for me to hear everyone\u2019s ideas and keep the team after our goals. For about $4 per person per day, and 35 minutes of my time each morning, team breakfasts have had a giant impact on productivity. We have rebuilt our sense of community, and there are few complaints now because concerns are addressed. And it\u2019s most unusual for anyone to arrive later than 9.30.", "2. Don\u2019t beg people to stay.", "I\u2019ve always dreaded those occasions when team members ask, \u201cRebekah, can we have a quick chat?\u201d It means one of two things: They want more money or they\u2019re planning to quit. In recent times, I have been more likely to hear the latter (everyone knows we don\u2019t have much money). I used to take staff resignations as a personal failure. I\u2019d look for what I\u2019d done wrong to make them want to leave, promise to change and beg them to stay.", "But I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s healthy for a company to allow people who want to leave, to leave. Zappos famously pays bonuses to new employees to quit, because the company doesn\u2019t want anyone hanging around who isn\u2019t committed. Some of our team members were tired: They had hammered away at Posse for two years and didn\u2019t have the drive for it anymore. They wanted a job that paid more money for fewer hours and one they didn\u2019t have to think about when at home. I\u2019m now O.K. with that. In fact, I think it\u2019s great. Every time someone quit, I was able to find a fresh, enthusiastic replacement. Yes, it can be painful when someone leaves, but over all I encourage people who are thinking about leaving to go. New energy, even from one or two people, can make a world of difference.", "3. Location matters.", "Only recently did I fully realize the importance of our environment. I worked in the garage office for four weeks and hated it. I couldn\u2019t wait to escape at the end of the day. I started looking for new premises as soon as we closed our funding round, and I found a new spot in a great location above some trendy shops and cafes. I cut a deal with the mayor\u2019s office, which wanted to draw creative young companies like ours into the area, and we ended up paying less in rent than we had been for the garage. We ran an online competition for interior design students to fit out our office on a budget of $2,000. More than 10 entered, and the winner has completed an amazing job, making our space feel like a palace. It\u2019s a delight to arrive at work in the morning, and I often find myself working late into the evening with several members of the team. People don\u2019t mind sticking around.", "4.

Tens of thousands of new users really lifted our spirits. We threw a party to celebrate the product introduction in our swanky, new office and invited more than a hundred friends, investors and customers. The team felt proud to work at Posse; so, I\u2019ve started planning for one major progress moment every six to eight weeks. It could be a public relations introduction, an event, a presentation at a conference. It\u2019s something the team can work toward and celebrate.", "Start-ups usually fail because they run out of money or energy; last year we came close to doing both. Culture, as I quickly learned, cannot be dictated. While mandating work hours doesn\u2019t lift productivity, inviting everyone to breakfast does. While start-ups don\u2019t have the money to build a culture the way Google does, they can attract people who want to make a difference, who want their ideas to be heard, who want to be part of a team that has fun and respects each other.

There was no \u201cDouble Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,\u201d a strategy made famous by Google in its quest to avoid taxes.", "Instead, back in 1999, Caterpillar, helped by its audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, decided that to sharply reduce the American tax on profits from the sale of parts sent from the United States to customers around the world, it had to do little more than take the name of the American parent off the invoices and put in the name of a Swiss subsidiary.", "So even though the parts might have never come within a thousand miles of Switzerland, the profits accrued to the Swiss subsidiary. And Caterpillar negotiated a deal to tax those profits well below Switzerland\u2019s norm. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, put the rate at 4 to 6 percent.", "That cut the Caterpillar tax bill by $300 million a year.", "Was that legal? Opinions differ. Professors called by the subcommittee said it was not. A professor retained by Caterpillar said it was, and company officials told the subcommittee they had complied with the law. Documents released by the subcommittee showed, however, that some at Caterpillar had been worried about the strategy and that the company took steps to reduce slightly the amount of profit being diverted, hoping that would make the strategy more likely to pass muster.", "In any case, the Internal Revenue Service does not seem ever to have challenged it, even after a former Caterpillar tax official filed a whistle-blower lawsuit. That suit was settled on undisclosed terms.", "What was most notable about the Caterpillar strategy was its sheer lack of creativeness. \u201cThis is boring as an intellectual matter,\u201d said Edward D. Kleinbard, a tax law professor at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff at the congressional Joint Tax Committee.

None of them seemed interested in the question of who should pay taxes if the companies do not. Nor was there the slightest indication of agreement with Senator Levin that corporate citizens, like individual ones, had an obligation to help pay for their government.", "Instead, the preferred cure was to cut the corporate tax rate \u2014 now 35 percent, though virtually no multinational company pays anything near that amount. The country must become more competitive in attracting these companies, the senators said.", "Under current law, United States companies can defer taxes on foreign income until that income is brought home. The Caterpillar case, perhaps inadvertently, provides an example of how that can work in practice to give breaks to those that need them the least. Caterpillar has had to bring some of its profits home and pay taxes on them, because it needed the money here. Apple seems to have not had that problem.", "Much of the problem with taxation of multinational companies is that, as Professor Kleinbard put it, \u201cThe tax system treats foreign subsidiaries as if they were independent actors,\u201d which they are not.", "The law deals with transfer pricing issues \u2014 transactions between two parts of the same company \u2014 by requiring they be conducted as if they were arm\u2019s-length transactions. One of the funnier parts of the hearing was Senator Levin\u2019s long, and ultimately unsuccessful, effort to get a Caterpillar official to admit the obvious \u2014 that the company would never have made a similar deal with an unaffiliated company.", "The ideal solution would be for multinational companies to face multinational tax authorities that share the goal of ensuring that a company pays its fair share of taxes and agree on ways to divide up the money. Perhaps that could be based in part on where the ultimate purchaser was, and in part on where the company was based or had significant operations.", "Large countries have agreed that something should be done, and the Group of 20 has asked the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to work on a \u201cBEPS\u201d project, for \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting.\u201d Chances of an effective action plan seem small.", "In the Caterpillar case, the deal the company struck with Switzerland enabled that country to collect low taxes on profits that \u2014 based on the kind of analysis an ordinary person might use \u2014 clearly had nothing to do with Switzerland. Caterpillar has no production or parts warehouses in Switzerland. One of the side benefits of the deal Caterpillar cut with Switzerland was to reduce the taxes it paid to France and Belgium, where Caterpillar does have plants.", "So Caterpillar found a way to pay less in those countries, where it relies on government services like police protection and provision of infrastructure, by paying a different country.", "The Caterpillar hearing raised another interesting issue. PricewaterhouseCoopers is not only the consultant that put together Caterpillar\u2019s tax strategy, it is the company\u2019s longtime auditor.", "Current rules allow an auditor to perform both tasks as long as it believes that the tax policies it proposes are \u201cmore likely than not\u201d legal.

James Bowers, a tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who was involved in proposing and carrying out the tax strategy, also advised the audit team, whose duties included judging whether the tax strategies were too aggressive.", "PricewaterhouseCoopers sees no problem in that. \u201cThere is nothing that would preclude the same person from being involved with providing advice to the client and that same person providing subject matter support to the audit team,\u201d Samuel L.

He noted that it would be other partners, including the audit partner, who made final decisions on the audit.", "Senator Levin is retiring at the end of this year and will be sorely missed. His hearings have done much to highlight abuses of the current tax laws, abuses that should be prevented when the tax law is revised. He may also have done a service for investors.

We are very sure that our emotions, whatever they are, are nothing compared to their emotions, and we are very conscious that the story isn\u2019t about us.\u201d", "Known originally as the International Maritime Satellite Organization, Inmarsat was created in 1979 by the 88-member International Maritime Organization, an arm of the United Nations, and charged with providing a seamless global network for basic ship-to-shore voice and data communications, including free emergency services for ships in distress.", "Over the next 30 years, its offering expanded to include hand-held satellite phones and other land-based mobile services as well as air-to-ground technology that today is installed on roughly 90 percent of the world\u2019s fleet of transoceanic wide-body jets.", "Unlike employees of better-known tenants of an area of east London known as the \u201cSilicon Roundabout\u201d \u2014 Amazon, Google, Facebook and Intel all have offices nearby \u2014 Inmarsat\u2019s workers are less accustomed to seeing their company\u2019s name in the headlines. Instead of beanbag chairs and Foosball tables, its common areas are decorated with scale models of satellites and multistage rockets.", "Inmarsat was converted into a private company in 1999, and member states were granted shares that many quickly sold or transferred to national telecom operators. Several attempts at a public share offering failed after the global dot-com bubble burst in 2000, and the company was eventually bought by Apax Partners and Permira, two European private equity firms, for an estimated $1.5 billion. Inmarsat was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005 in an initial public offering that valued the company at more than 1.3 billion pounds, or $2.4 billion, at the time.", "Inmarsat\u2019s market capitalization has since nearly tripled, to about \u00a33.4 billion. Maritime communications still generate more than half of sales, while land-based services and bandwidth leasing \u2014 activities heavily dependent on government and military contracts \u2014 together represent about 30 percent of revenues. With a 48 percent share of the world\u2019s mobile satellite communications market, Inmarsat is twice the size of its nearest competitor, Iridium of the United States.", "Aeronautical services are Inmarsat\u2019s smallest, but fastest growing, business; they generate revenues of $114 million in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.", "Even as the recent economic downturn has slowed international shipping traffic and many government contracts have dried up because of budget constraints, Inmarsat has been investing $1.6 billion in upgrading its satellite network to provide even greater capacity and higher data transmission speeds.", "The first of this new generation of satellites, called Global Express, was launched into orbit in December, and it will be joined by two more this year. Capable of running 100 times faster than its current systems, Global Express could enable new services like airborne videoconferencing or 3-D in-flight movies \u2014 as well as real-time streaming of location and performance information from a plane.", "It is the disappearance of Flight 370, of course, that has revived debate in the aviation industry about the feasibility of continuous tracking of the nearly 100,000 flights that crisscross the skies each day.", "Most airlines have until now been reluctant, though, to assume the costs of using even the scaled-down satellite tracking technology that Inmarsat and some other companies already offer. And air safety authorities have been slow to consider requiring airlines to install such equipment.", "The latest version of Inmarsat\u2019s aircraft broadband system is already capable of sending intermittent positioning and other cockpit data alongside the in-flight Internet and satellite phone services sold to passengers. Roughly 5,000 planes are fitted with the technology, Mr. Pinto said. But because the system has not yet been certified by regulators as a safety feature \u2014 that is expected late next year \u2014 many airlines continue to rely on older, cheaper technology. The lack of positioning data from Flight 370 led to Inmarsat\u2019s laborious attempt to estimate the plane\u2019s trajectory, an analysis that had never been done before.", "Inmarsat\u2019s engineers say they have extracted as much information as possible from the plane\u2019s final messages. As they continued to follow developments in the search, Mr. Pinto and his colleagues said they were pleased to have been able to contribute their expertise. But the loss of Flight 370 has also spurred a sense of mission to join with other industry players to press for change.", "\u201cIt has galvanized us internally to advertise what the technology can do, with the right sort of regulatory environment and willingness from stakeholders,\u201d Mr. Pinto said. \u201cThe technology is there to prevent the uncertainty that we face in this event from being repeated.\u201d"], "https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/the-many-classes-of-google-stock/": ["", "That is not because the company is worth less than it was.

Those Class C shares will get the GOOG symbol, while the Class A shares will trade under the symbol GOOGL.", "Why bother? The new Class C shares have no voting rights. The Class A shares have one vote each, but collectively those votes are dwarfed by the 10-votes-per-share Class B shares. Those shares, which do not trade in the public market, are owned by Google insiders, who will also get Class C shares in the distribution.", "As originally proposed by the company, the move would have made it easy for Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and the chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, to cash in a large part of their holdings without giving up their voting control. But that ability has been limited after the company settled a class action suit filed by angry (Class A) shareholders, and reached agreements with the three top officials to limit their sales.", "In essence, for every share of Class C they sell, they must also convert one Class B share into Class A. Presumably they will sell that share as well. So their voting rights will fall as they would have under the old structure, when they would have converted Class B shares into Class A shares before selling them.", "But Google is expected to issue primarily Class C shares in the future, for acquisitions and in grants of share options. So the total number of votes will not be rising, and that will delay the day when the company\u2019s leaders lose voting control of the company. Currently they own less than 16 percent of the company\u2019s shares, and have 61 percent of the votes.", "Google shares closed on Wednesday at $1,135.10. Trading on a when-issued basis, the new Class C shares closed at $567, and the new Class A shares closed at $568.07.", "An interesting question is whether the Class A shares will trade for much more than the Class C ones. That might be expected to happen, on the theory that limited voting rights are worth more than none, even if neither class of share has any real control over the company. But the company has promised to compensate Class C holders in a year if there is a substantial difference in price, and that could hold down the difference.", "One change all this has wrought is in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Until now, it has always contained 500 different stocks. Now it will contain 501, since it will include both Class A and Class C Google shares. (Among other things, this means that index funds will not have to buy or sell any Google shares to continue to reflect the overall index.)", "At Google\u2019s annual meeting on May 14, shareholders will be able to vote on a shareholder resolution calling on the company to switch to a one-share, one-vote system. Rarely has a shareholder vote been less suspenseful. With the Class B shares able to vote, the founders can easily vote down the proposal.", "But it could nonetheless serve as something of a vote of no confidence in those leaders if a large part of the Class A shares vote for the idea of one share, one vote."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/business/an-economic-gauge-imperfect-but-vital.html": ["In \u201cG.D.P.: A Brief but Affectionate History,\u201d Diane Coyle, a British economist, conveys a sophisticated understanding of an economic standby, the quarterly measure of gross domestic product.

Both public and private decision makers need some idea of how well the overall economy is doing. Small changes in G.D.P. make a big difference. At 4 percent growth a year, for example, the economy will double in 17 years; at 2 percent, it will take 35 years. A 1 percent decline is a national calamity; a 2.5 percent gain is something for politicians to crow about.", "The most common definition of G.D.P. is consumer spending, plus investment spending, plus government spending, plus exports, minus imports. The count relies on timely surveys of transactions, compiled in the United States by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis, with a cast of thousands.", "In 2008, the United Nations published its System of National Accounts as the global standard for computing G.D.P. Those rules run 722 pages, with an additional 400 pages of commentary. Devilishly complex, the rules involve innumerable estimates and arbitrary decisions about what does and doesn\u2019t fit. Only a handful of specialists fully understand the system, Dr. Coyle writes, and only a few dozen nations fully carry it out.", "The Bureau of Economic Analysis listed G.D.P. as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. It was devised during the Great Depression when the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was desperate for a gauge of how the failing economy was faring. That early version proved invaluable during World War II, when the nation needed to decide how to apportion its scarce resources between wartime and civilian priorities.", "That new technique reflected the economy of the time, a manufacturing economy much different from today\u2019s. The G.D.P. is a measure best fitted to mass production of hardgoods. Not for nothing is it called the gross domestic product. It fares less well in gauging the value of services, which have swollen to dominate today\u2019s economy. And lacking market prices as a guide, it does even worse in measuring the output of government, now a driver of the economy.", "A major omission is the work we do for ourselves: cooking, cleaning, painting a room, taking care of children or an aging relative. Pay a gardener to mow your lawn, and that\u2019s part of the G.D.P.; do it yourself, and it\u2019s not. If all such tasks were included, and priced at the going wage, their contribution to the G.D.P. would be tremendous.", "Nor does G.D.P. count the underground economy, conducted out of sight of regulators and tax collectors, even though this unofficial sector provides many jobs and is often highly entrepreneurial. Estimates are that in some countries the \u201cinformal\u201d economy amounts to a quarter of total output, and considerably more in the third world. (In the United States, the estimate is 7 percent.)", "From the very first, arguments have raged over whether the G.D.P. measures the right thing. Shouldn\u2019t we count the increase in national well-being as opposed to national production? Some economists have argued that items they consider negative, like spending on armaments of war, advertising huckstering and stock market speculation, have no place in a measure of national betterment.", "The G.D.P. finesses those imponderables. If a transaction is priced in dollars, it goes into G.D.P., with no ethical debate over its contribution to human welfare. The G.D.P. accommodates both what we spend on producing electricity by burning dirty coal and what we spend on pollution abatement to keep the air clean.", "Dr. Coyle concludes that while imperfect, the G.D.P. is good enough as a measure of how fast the economy is growing and better than any alternative. It is closely correlated with things that do contribute to happiness. (Nobody is happy in a recession.)", "\u201cWe should not be in a rush to ditch G.D.P.,\u201d Dr. Coyle writes. \u201cYet it is a measure of the economy best suited to an earlier era.\u201d", "For one thing, it fails to count the value of the staggering growth in consumer choice. Where once we had three television networks, we now have 1,000 channels; greater choice equals greater freedom, she declares. It does poorly in measuring the Internet economy, in which so many benefits \u2014 like Google searches \u2014 are offered free. It badly lags behind the headlong pace of innovation and creativity. It struggles with the true value of a host of products or services that didn\u2019t exist before. To the degree that it misses those new benefits to consumers, it understates the pace of economic growth.", "Most seriously, she writes, G.D.P. tells us nothing about whether we are eating our seed corn. Does today\u2019s growth come at the expense of tomorrow\u2019s? Are we consuming our natural \u2014 and human \u2014 resources without replacing them? She urges that we add a regular, official indicator of \u201csustainability.\u201d", "Be warned, though, that Dr. Coyle\u2019s little book is a short history, not a primer. It is not baby steps. Though her writing is often a marvel of clarity, at times she takes on topics that are best understood only if you already know what she\u2019s talking about. Sometimes the book takes too many shortcuts.", "The best example is her conviction that current measures of G.D.P. greatly exaggerate the importance of financial services to overall economic output.

That, at least, is the best I can extract from the six abstruse pages spelling out the detail.

Auto\u00admated scanning systems are slowly phasing out the checkout clerk, while Tesla is hoping to sell its zippy plug-in cars straight to customers, eliminating the salesman. (And soon those cars might drive themselves.) Mturk and its competitors, like CrowdSource, are intended for the menial jobs that still require a flicker of human intelligence and that computers can\u2019t replicate, like deciding whether a photograph is safe for work or understanding a thick, slang-laden accent.", "The platform has prompted much consternation for being a sort of outsourcing service that drives down wages. Estimates of hourly earnings generally come out to $5 or less, or around two-thirds of the current federal minimum wage \u2014 a good-enough sum, perhaps, for the India-based workers who supply about half the labor on the site but not so much for the other half who are based in the United States. More than one commentator has described Mturk as a \u201cdigital sweatshop.\u201d", "But even more troubling is the fact that crowdsourcing platforms are hurrying along the automation of more and more of these tasks. Erik Brynjolfsson, a co-author of the popular book \u201cRace Against the Machine,\u201d cites image recognition as one obvious place where humans have helped robots replace them. Crowdworkers can collect pennies for identifying adorable cats in photographs, and then companies take that data and improve software that identifies adorable cats with a marginal cost that approaches zero. \u201cWe\u2019re at a real inflection point in terms of artificial intelligence and machine learning,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cThings are speeding up.\u201d", "Indeed, many Turkers are actively helping to put themselves out of jobs. \u201cYesterday it was spam moderation,\u201d said Panos Ipeirotis, a professor of business at New York University. \u201cAnd today it\u2019s transcriptions and translation. Once we help computers solve the problem of today, we move on to more challenging tasks. Maybe in 10 years, it\u2019s something we think of as completely out of the range of computers right now.

Ultimately, it\u2019s a virtuous cycle, because it frees humans up to work on higher-value tasks. But technological change can also cause huge economic dislocations. And right now, the great fear is that robots are taking over jobs faster than humans can adjust. High-tech firms may be the most vibrant part of the economy, but they just don\u2019t require the manpower of former blue-chip companies. \u201cAt the height of its power, the photography company Kodak employed more than 140,000 people and was worth $28 billion,\u201d writes the computer scientist Jaron Lanier in \u201cWho Owns the Future?\u201d \u201cBut today Kodak is bankrupt, and the new face of digital photography has become Instagram. When Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people.\u201d Lanier describes the future of automation as big-data \u201cpuppetry,\u201d where the actions of humans are replicated once the set of data is big enough.", "White-collar jobs were once deemed mostly immune to such automation, but that is no longer true, either. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist, and Michael Osborne, a professor of machine learning, at Oxford University estimate that about half of American jobs \u2014 sailors, paralegals, you name it \u2014 are susceptible to automation. \u201cSoftware substitution, whether it\u2019s for drivers or waiters or nurses\u201d is coming, Bill Gates said recently at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \u201cTwenty years from now, labor demand for lots of skill sets will be substantially lower. I don\u2019t think people have that in their mental model.\u201d", "Journalists have often thought of themselves as impervious to automation, but there are creeping signs that the robots have come for our gigs too. Last month, after an earthquake woke up Los Angeles, the first post on the temblor at The Los Angeles Times gave the basic information and carried one Ken Schwencke\u2019s byline. \u201cThis information comes from the USGS Earthquake Notification Service and this post was created by an algorithm written by the author,\u201d it noted at the end.", "Yet that does not necessarily mean that half of all journalists \u2014 or half of all Americans, for that matter \u2014 will lose their jobs to the robots, never to reclaim them. Economists refer to this fear as the \u201clump of labor\u201d fallacy, the incorrect assumption that there is a finite amount of work to be done, and that the more robots do, the less there will be for the rest of us. In the past, after all, humans have proved remarkably adept at thinking up new things to do when plows, cows, steam trains and dishwashers arrived to help free up some of our time.", "This time around, however, there is a notable difference. With computers getting so much better, faster and faster and faster, there might be a rough period of transition as median wages keep falling for American families. Workers \u2014 especially those without college degrees \u2014 will continue to find themselves less and less valuable in the marketplace. \u201cThe big challenge for us as individuals, and as a society, is to race with machines, rather than racing against machines,\u201d Brynjolfsson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some catastrophic failure of imagination, failing to think of more ways to put that vast middle class of people to work and to employ them more productively.\u201d", "The challenge, in other words, is for humans to allow software, algorithms, robots and the like to propel them into higher-and-higher-value work. For journalists like me, that might mean letting computers take over on earnings reports, weather, earthquake warnings and flash sports scores \u2014 and doubling down on narratives, investigations and analytical pieces.

Even some strip clubs are testing alternative currencies; one in New York offers its own \u201cdance dollars.\u201d", "And some businesses have actually benefited from the move away from cash. A 2009 study of New York taxis found that drivers\u2019 tips rose when they started accepting credit cards, to an average of about 22 percent from 10 percent.", "The drop in the use of cash in the United States has been driven by a rise in the use of credit and debit cards. But more consumers are turning to mobile payments, using their smartphones to buy items as ordinary as a cup of coffee. Mobile payments doubled in the last year, according to Forrester Research, which predicts that the market will continue to grow 43 percent annually through 2018.", "But the rise in mobile payments will not necessarily lead to a cashless society, but rather a society with less cash. People will still use cash for quick transactions like paying their babysitter or the person who shovels their snow. Some New York restaurants stubbornly cling to the cachet of their cash-only status. And criminals favor cash because its anonymity makes it harder to track.", "Mobile payments are still a nascent market.

As the co-owner of Third Rail Coffee, a small chain of cafes in Manhattan, Mr. Ricardo can react quickly to the shifting needs of his customers.", "His first Third Rail location, a tiny shop in the West Village, had an unusual customer when it first opened: Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of the mobile payment system Square. Mr. Dorsey argued for the benefits of using Square, like the ease of setup and the low transaction fee of 2.75 percent. But Third Rail catered mainly to New York University students who were in a rush to get to class, and Mr. Ricardo preferred cash because anything else would slow business.", "When he opened a second shop, this one in the East Village, he found a community with a different lifestyle, so he opted to go with Square to process credit card payments. \u201cI felt like we were losing too much business,\u201d he said. The new location had more shelf space, too, and could carry more merchandise. \u201cThe ticket items are a little higher, so it\u2019s a little less reasonable to expect that people will have cash.\u201d", "Mr. Ricardo says he is waiting to see what technology customers adopt. \u201cIt\u2019s like a foregone conclusion in people\u2019s minds that cash will diminish over time, but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said.", "The field is crowded with competitors.

Text-to-give donations are more successful, he said, but they tended to be driven by special events like a concert to raise money after a disaster. Another drawback is a $10 limit on donations.", "Major Busroe said the Salvation Army has also created an online red kettle program, which brought in $2.4 million last year, an increase of 14 percent, but just a fraction of the Salvation Army\u2019s overall fund-raising.

The collusion, according to the engineers, kept their pay lower than it would have been had the companies actually competed for talent.", "The suit, brought after the Justice Department investigated the anti-recruiting scheme in 2010, has many riveting aspects, including emails and other documents that tarnish the reputation of Silicon Valley as competitive and of technology executives as a new breed of \u201cdon\u2019t-be-evil\u201d bosses, to cite Google\u2019s informal motto.", "The case essentially alleges white-collar wage theft.

Everyone seems to be collecting it, analyzing it, making money from it and celebrating (or fearing) its powers. Whether we\u2019re talking about analyzing zillions of Google search queries to predict flu outbreaks, or zillions of phone records to detect signs of terrorist activity, or zillions of airline stats to find the best time to buy plane tickets, big data is on the case. By combining the power of modern computing with the plentiful data of the digital era, it promises to solve virtually any problem \u2014 crime, public health, the evolution of grammar, the perils of dating \u2014 just by crunching the numbers.", "Or so its champions allege. \u201cIn the next two decades,\u201d the journalist Patrick Tucker writes in the latest big data manifesto, \u201cThe Naked Future,\u201d \u201cwe will be able to predict huge areas of the future with far greater accuracy than ever before in human history, including events long thought to be beyond the realm of human inference.\u201d Statistical correlations have never sounded so good.", "Is big data really all it\u2019s cracked up to be? There is no doubt that big data is a valuable tool that has already had a critical impact in certain areas. For instance, almost every successful artificial intelligence computer program in the last 20 years, from Google\u2019s search engine to the I.B.M. \u201cJeopardy!\u201d champion Watson, has involved the substantial crunching of large bodies of data. But precisely because of its newfound popularity and growing use, we need to be levelheaded about what big data can \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 do.", "The first thing to note is that although big data is very good at detecting correlations, especially subtle correlations that an analysis of smaller data sets might miss, it never tells us which correlations are meaningful. A big data analysis might reveal, for instance, that from 2006 to 2011 the United States murder rate was well correlated with the market share of Internet Explorer: Both went down sharply. But it\u2019s hard to imagine there is any causal relationship between the two. Likewise, from 1998 to 2007 the number of new cases of autism diagnosed was extremely well correlated with sales of organic food (both went up sharply), but identifying the correlation won\u2019t by itself tell us whether diet has anything to do with autism.", "Second, big data can work well as an adjunct to scientific inquiry but rarely succeeds as a wholesale replacement. Molecular biologists, for example, would very much like to be able to infer the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their underlying DNA sequence, and scientists working on the problem use big data as one tool among many. But no scientist thinks you can solve this problem by crunching data alone, no matter how powerful the statistical analysis; you will always need to start with an analysis that relies on an understanding of physics and biochemistry.", "Third, many tools that are based on big data can be easily gamed. For example, big data programs for grading student essays often rely on measures like sentence length and word sophistication, which are found to correlate well with the scores given by human graders. But once students figure out how such a program works, they start writing long sentences and using obscure words, rather than learning how to actually formulate and write clear, coherent text. Even Google\u2019s celebrated search engine, rightly seen as a big data success story, is not immune to \u201cGoogle bombing\u201d and \u201cspamdexing,\u201d wily techniques for artificially elevating website search placement.", "Fourth, even when the results of a big data analysis aren\u2019t intentionally gamed, they often turn out to be less robust than they initially seem. Consider Google Flu Trends, once the poster child for big data. In 2009, Google reported \u2014 to considerable fanfare \u2014 that by analyzing flu-related search queries, it had been able to detect the spread of the flu as accurately and more quickly than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A few years later, though, Google Flu Trends began to falter; for the last two years it has made more bad predictions than good ones.", "As a recent article in the journal Science explained, one major contributing cause of the failures of Google Flu Trends may have been that the Google search engine itself constantly changes, such that patterns in data collected at one time do not necessarily apply to data collected at another time. As the statistician Kaiser Fung has noted, collections of big data that rely on web hits often merge data that was collected in different ways and with different purposes \u2014 sometimes to ill effect. It can be risky to draw conclusions from data sets of this kind.", "A fifth concern might be called the echo-chamber effect, which also stems from the fact that much of big data comes from the web. Whenever the source of information for a big data analysis is itself a product of big data, opportunities for vicious cycles abound. Consider translation programs like Google Translate, which draw on many pairs of parallel texts from different languages \u2014 for example, the same Wikipedia entry in two different languages \u2014 to discern the patterns of translation between those languages. This is a perfectly reasonable strategy, except for the fact that with some of the less common languages, many of the Wikipedia articles themselves may have been written using Google Translate. In those cases, any initial errors in Google Translate infect Wikipedia, which is fed back into Google Translate, reinforcing the error.", "A sixth worry is the risk of too many correlations. If you look 100 times for correlations between two variables, you risk finding, purely by chance, about five bogus correlations that appear statistically significant \u2014 even though there is no actual meaningful connection between the variables. Absent careful supervision, the magnitudes of big data can greatly amplify such errors.", "Seventh, big data is prone to giving scientific-sounding solutions to hopelessly imprecise questions. In the past few months, for instance, there have been two separate attempts to rank people in terms of their \u201chistorical importance\u201d or \u201ccultural contributions,\u201d based on data drawn from Wikipedia. One is the book \u201cWho\u2019s Bigger? Where Historical Figures Really Rank,\u201d by the computer scientist Steven Skiena and the engineer Charles Ward. The other is an M.I.T.

But no existing body of data will ever be large enough to include all the trigrams that people might use, because of the continuing inventiveness of language.", "To select an example more or less at random, a book review that the actor Rob Lowe recently wrote for this newspaper contained nine trigrams such as \u201cdumbed-down escapist fare\u201d that had never before appeared anywhere in all the petabytes of text indexed by Google. To witness the limitations that big data can have with novelty, Google-translate \u201cdumbed-down escapist fare\u201d into German and then back into English: out comes the incoherent \u201cscaled-flight fare.\u201d That is a long way from what Mr. Lowe intended \u2014 and from big data\u2019s aspirations for translation.", "Wait, we almost forgot one last problem: the hype.

They still talk about the bar owner who shot his waitress in the chest late one night and served just six months in jail after saying it was an accident. Then there was the story about the man who arrived home one night only to notice that his wife, who had been in the back seat, was no longer in the car. Her body was found on the side of a road along the route he\u2019d taken. Charges were never filed.", "We own a house near Narrowsburg, but I never knew anybody who died mysteriously, until one day a couple of weeks before Christmas 2008, when I saw a picture of a burning house on the front page of our town paper with the headline \u201cLocal Woman Dies in Fire.\u201d The woman was Catherine Novak, a cheery neighbor I\u2019d known since 2004. For a year, we each had a kindergartner in the local school and a toddler at home. We had been lured to the area, about two hours from New York, by real estate bargains in a beautiful but isolated and depressed community. We soon learned, though, that we had traded urban problems for country ones. Heating oil was expensive, septic tanks leaked and cars needed constant maintenance. In September, the summer residents returned to the city and the restaurants closed. By January, we lived for the salt truck and the social diversion of drives to Walmart and the McDonald\u2019s PlayPlace. I was hoping to high-tail it back to Manhattan as soon as I could, but Catherine was committed to making a life there.", "I rarely saw her husband, Paul. He worked in Queens as a paramedic and slept in the city three or four nights a week. Occasionally he showed up at school events wearing a uniform with the caduceus and F.D.N.Y. patches on the shoulders. The Iraq war was entering its second year, and an American flag flapped from their porch. In those post-9/11, wartime days, it was possible to assume he might be some kind of hero.", "The last time I saw Catherine was late in the summer of 2008. We had moved back to Manhattan and went up to the country only on weekends. I was packing the car when she and her daughter, who was 9, pulled up in the late-afternoon sunlight. I hadn\u2019t seen her for several years. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d she called as she climbed our front steps. \u201cI need a job. My husband\u2019s having an affair.\u201d She said it with a light laugh. We talked a bit, but I was in a hurry to get back to the city. I left, promising to pass her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to corporate H.R. I never heard from her again.", "The morning Catherine died, Dec. 13, 2008, was unusually cold, with temperatures dipping into the 20s, a biting wind chill and flurries of snow. Before dawn, a neighbor rose to make coffee and saw the Novaks\u2019 house across the road engulfed in flames. More-distant neighbors noticed the light and initially thought the sun was rising. By the time fire trucks arrived, the red-and-white house had collapsed. Later that day, investigators used a backhoe to excavate frozen ash, and in the gray light of early afternoon, reached the basement floor, where Catherine was on her back, arms outstretched, charred in situ like a figure from Pompeii. She was 41. The body of the family dog, Aladdin, was nearby, locked in a kennel.", "People in Narrowsburg were suspicious for the usual reasons: Her husband had left her for a younger woman. They were fighting about money. She never kept the dog in the kennel when she was home. And that night, her two children were more than 100 miles away at their father\u2019s apartment on Long Island.", "Examiners determined that the dog died of smoke inhalation, but an autopsy found that the level of carbon monoxide in Catherine\u2019s lungs was too low to kill her. They concluded that she died after debris from the fire crushed her chest. The lead fire investigator considered Catherine\u2019s death suspicious but couldn\u2019t prove that the fire wasn\u2019t accidental. Ten days after the fire, Paul Novak passed a lie-detector test, and a few months later he collected about $800,000 in insurance money and left his job.", "The case was closed. Anyone in town who thought Catherine might have been the victim of a crime straight out of a Raymond Chandler novel filed away their suspicions with the waitress and the dead wife by the side of the road.", "What Narrowsburg didn\u2019t know about the Novaks, Queens did. Catherine was raised in Glendale, a neighborhood of low apartment buildings and one- and two-family, aluminum-sided homes behind chain-link fences. The fourth and youngest child, she and her family moved from apartment to apartment while her struggling parents scraped together money for parochial school. She put herself through Marymount Manhattan College doing accounting and other odd jobs and became a semiprofessional volunteer, a woman people could count on to help clean the schoolyard, decorate the church hall and run the blood drive.", "When she was 19, she joined the Ridgewood Volunteer Ambulance Corps, first becoming a dispatcher and then earning her certification as an E.M.T. She rode the ambulance a few times, but she wasn\u2019t strong enough to lift stretchers, and eventually she became a Certified First Responder instead. She married an E.M.T. named Michael Ansbach, and they built a life around the adrenaline-fueled emergency world. But if Catherine enjoyed the drama of paramedic life, she was no thrill junkie. At home she was the responsible partner who balanced the books and checked the fire alarms monthly. When the marriage ended in divorce after four years, she started dating businessmen.", "Then in the summer of 1996, Catherine went to an ambulance-corps barbecue and met a tall, dark-bearded paramedic named Paul Attila Novak, the first and only son of an Austrian mother and a Hungarian father who each immigrated to Queens during the Cold War. Novak\u2019s mother told me Paul was \u201ctender, like his father\u201d and that he was drawn to emergency-medic work after volunteering to drive the elderly to treatment. But many people found him cool and unemotional. Catherine\u2019s best friend, Margaret Hershman, didn\u2019t like Novak from the start. \u201cHe was big-time antisocial, and he gave me the creeps,\u201d she said. Catherine, though, \u201creally loved him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was big. He was strong. And she was dedicated. And she made a lot of excuses for him.\u201d", "A career paramedic, Novak had been working for Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, in Queens, for about five years and was one of the hospital\u2019s more seasoned ambulance drivers. He could steer a speeding truck under the sinuous elevated J train and racked up numerous certified saves \u2014 awards for successful resuscitations. His partners told me that he was known as the guy who could \u201cget things done,\u201d thanks to his connections to hospital administrators, but that meant that if you angered him, you might have your file pulled by the higher-ups and inspected for infractions. To his colleagues, he was a solid medic with a reputation for fearlessness. He collected and reconfigured motorcycles to make them faster. He once brought in a video of himself speeding through the upstate woods at 160 m.p.h.", "Novak didn\u2019t strike his colleagues as unusual, but that may have been because what passed for \u201cnormal\u201d behavior among paramedics at Jamaica was already slightly askew. It was something about the combination of life-or-death situations coupled with long periods of boredom. According to Jordan Press, a former paramedic and sometime ambulance partner of Novak\u2019s, sex in ambulances and prescription-drug abuse were common between calls. He described how he once took so much Percocet that he found himself on a call unable to remember how he got there. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange business to be in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s this invisible world that nobody knows about. You have all these people who get involved in bizarre situations all the time. When you are in it, you have no idea. But everybody who leaves, they say, \u2018What the [expletive] was that?\u2019 \u201d", "Press said Novak often idled the ambulance near Wi-Fi hot spots so he could download triple-X images. \u201cPaul had a porn fascination like something I have never seen before. He has some type of void in him that he was trying to fill with objects and porn. Objects and porn. He could never be satiated. It was automatic, like I automatically hit Google news.\u201d", "He rarely talked to women and had only one serious girlfriend, from high school, who was an E.M.T. They were briefly engaged but broke up, and she married someone else. A few years later, she committed suicide. Paul, hearing the emergency call on the scanner and recognizing the address, responded and, in the lingo, pronounced her at the scene.", "The pairing of Paul Novak and Catherine Lane never made much sense to the other paramedics. She was frugal and had an accountant\u2019s sense of responsibility about balanced books. He was always broke, blowing his income on electronics and motorcycles. On Valentine\u2019s Day 1997, they married. A year later, Novak filed for bankruptcy. According to some people close to Catherine, she never had any problems with debt before, but in 2003, she filed for bankruptcy too.", "By then they were living in Narrowsburg, in Sullivan County, with their 3-year-old daughter, Natalee, in the inexpensive home they had bought. He would sleep in Queens a few times a week, and she would stay in the country and raise their children.", "\u201cShe always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom,\u201d her mother, Christina Daws, says. \u201cShe really wanted to have a house so that her children could say, \u2018That\u2019s where I grew up.\u2019 \u201d", "In Narrowsburg, Paul and Catherine were not like the many New Yorkers buying up and renovating cheap farmhouses or congregating around one another\u2019s ponds on summer weekends with wine from the new shops on Main Street. Their house needed work, but very little got done because money was tight. After their son, Nicholas, was born in 2003, Catherine\u2019s family visited for the christening, celebrating amid the reek of overflowing septic in the yard. Catherine \u201cput a brave face on it,\u201d her mother said.", "Catherine plunged into local civic life. She volunteered at the school, served on its board and acted as a deacon at the Lutheran church. A lifelong Girl Scout, she led Natalee\u2019s troop. But the cracks in her marriage were starting to widen. When Novak talked to the police after the fire, the investigator wrote, \u201cNovak indicated that his relationship between him and Catherine struggled when he was placed not only behind the needs of the children but also with her volunteer work with the Lutheran Church and the Girl Scouts.\u201d", "In the fall of 2007, a fresh face appeared at the Jamaica ambulance garage: Michelle LaFrance, a voluptuous 25-year-old, was completing the paramedic certification program at Stony Brook University with a stint on an ambulance. Born and raised on Long Island, the daughter of an Avis car-rental executive, she\u2019d been volunteering on ambulances since she was a teenager. But she was also troubled. LaFrance attempted suicide at 15, and by 20 she had a cascade of ailments that included cardiac arrhythmia, fibromyalgia and premenstrual-distress disorder. She was on a variety of medications, including painkillers and antidepressants.", "LaFrance was assigned to \u201cride the bus\u201d with Novak and Press. After a one-night stand with Press, she began an affair with Novak, their romance stoked, in part, by the adrenaline of emergencies. She later testified that after she intubated a patient for the first time, she texted Novak: \u201cHey I got my first intubation!\u201d Then, she told the court, \u201cwe met for drinks so I could celebrate; that was the first time I kissed him.\u201d", "On Jan. 16, 2008, a date LaFrance remembered because she insisted Novak backdate his separation agreement to it, they slept together. In March, Paul told Catherine he had never loved her. A few weeks later, LaFrance phoned the Narrowsburg house in the middle of the night, asking for him, and Catherine finally knew the truth.", "Novak moved into an apartment with LaFrance in Glen Cove, on Long Island, and Catherine filed for divorce. He agreed to pay $1,700 a month in child support and take the children every other weekend. But the separation was far from amicable. To LaFrance, Novak seethed that Catherine was a \u201cfat, ugly troll\u201d and a terrible mother. They started fighting on the phone about money and the children. Novak threatened to file for custody.", "To her Narrowsburg friends, Catherine was the picture of motherly devotion. She took two part-time jobs, at the school and a local church camp, telling people she wanted to save money for the children\u2019s college educations. She had Natalee and Nicholas perform home fire drills and videotaped them, clips of which the prosecutors showed at the trial. Before she let the kids visit Long Island, she vetted LaFrance by taking her out to a local diner and asking her to help shop for Nicholas\u2019s birthday cake.", "A newly single mother on a quiet country road, Catherine never talked about fear. But two weeks after Novak moved out, she paid a neighbor\u2019s husband to change all the locks.", "After Catherine\u2019s death, Novak used the insurance money to buy a house in Palm Coast, Fla., with an in-ground saltwater pool, and moved there with his children and LaFrance. They didn\u2019t marry, although he bought her an engagement ring. Instead, they fought. One afternoon in April 2012, more than three years after Catherine\u2019s death, LaFrance, who had moved out of Novak\u2019s house, called the New York State Police and said she wanted to talk about Catherine\u2019s case. Investigators flew to Florida and interviewed LaFrance for more than six hours. Five months later, after building their case, authorities arrested Novak and charged him with murder and arson.", "Almost every weekday last August and September, Paul Novak, dressed in a dark suit, walked in chains from the Sullivan County jailhouse to the courthouse, the two buildings attached by razor wire and a chain-link fence. Three zaftig blondes sat behind him in court \u2014 his mother, his sister and his new girlfriend, Kathleen DelGrosso, a software designer he met on Match.com, who moved in with him in 2011, a year before he was arrested. Catherine\u2019s mother, brother and a revolving cast of her relatives sat on the other side of the aisle. Reporters showed up every day, putting the story on the front page of area newspapers, and \u201cDateline NBC\u201d producers wandered in and out. Around Narrowsburg, the headlines stunned neighbors and friends, the gruesome details of Catherine\u2019s death leaving them in tears or cursing Novak under their breath.", "A pair of Sullivan County prosecutors \u2014 the current officeholder and his predecessor wearing a hearing aid as well as a sling from recent shoulder surgery \u2014 told the jury that Novak\u2019s motive was greed. LaFrance, the star witness, now certified as an E.M.T. in Florida, had immunity from prosecution. She testified for five days, alternately cocky, teary or obsequious. She couldn\u2019t remember exactly when Novak disclosed his plan, she said, but she went along with it, hoping \u201cto make life easier.\u201d They visited Catherine the week before the fire, under the pretense of picking up a motorcycle. Novak sneaked downstairs and unlocked the basement door to prepare for the following week.", "\u201cHe was gonna do this and save the children,\u201d she testified. \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly the conversation. He had me convinced that Catherine was the bad guy and he was the good parent and his kids were abused and his kids were miserable and we need to save the kids.\u201d", "\u201cDid he tell you anything about what he needed to do about Catherine before Dec. 12?\u201d the district attorney asked her.", "\u201cThat he needed to kill her.\u201d", "\u201cDid you do anything to stop it?\u201d", "\u201cNo, I did not,\u201d she said, weeping.", "In the weeks after the fire, when the state police interviewed some Jamaica Hospital paramedics about Novak, none expressed any suspicions, one investigator told me. Perhaps they were fearful; perhaps they wanted to protect him. But once the trial was underway, several had to testify. They described how Novak never made a secret of hating his wife and had been talking about ways to dispose of bodies and commit the perfect crime.", "The parade of burly Queens ambulance drivers gave the small courthouse audience a glimpse into an urban subculture so inured to death and violence that they were oblivious to the casual callousness and misogyny of their own testimony. Press \u2014 who was subpoenaed but never called to testify \u2014 told me, \u201cI still find myself thinking, Well, she\u2019s dead, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d He then has to remind himself that Novak killed her. \u201cYou see so many dead bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just another dead body. And I know that\u2019s how Novak saw it.\u201d Novak complained so much about Catherine that Press jokingly suggested that he \u201csend her to Somalia on a church mission, she\u2019d never come back,\u201d he said. \u201cHe comes back to me the next day and says, \u2018I looked it up about Somalia, and it wouldn\u2019t work.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Are you [expletive] kidding me?\u2019 \u201d", "One paramedic, Ed Palmer, testified that he overheard Novak telling Catherine on the phone, \u201cYou may be the mother of my children, but I can still kill you.\u201d At the time, Palmer left the room, he said, to give his buddy \u201csome privacy.\u201d Another partner, Don Medley, testified that he was standing around the garage one day when Novak said that fire was the best way to get rid of a body. Willy Gonzalez, a veteran paramedic, one of the few with more experience than Novak, told me that he was riding in an ambulance with Novak one night as he was going through his computer. \u201cSuddenly he has this brainstorm: \u2018You know how to commit the perfect crime?\u2019 \u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking at him, at first taken aback, and I say, \u2018No, how?\u2019 \u2018Fire! Get rid of the evidence!\u2019 I was like, \u2018O.K.\u2019 \u201d", "At the time, Novak\u2019s colleagues testified, they thought his talk was just part of the black humor that got them through the shift. \u201cAt the garage, everyone talks about death and bodies all the time,\u201d Palmer told jurors. Some of them later came to think, though, that Novak had been vetting them, looking for someone to help with his plan.", "Eventually he did find his accomplice, a 6-foot-9 giant named Scott Sherwood, whose lifelong battle with bipolar disorder and daily intake of large doses of psychiatric medications \u2014 Adderall, Celexa, Seroquel, Trazodone \u2014 were no secret among his friends at Jamaica Hospital. He was emotional and fell apart easily when he was on call, especially if the case involved a child. \u201cHe would be crying and everything,\u201d Press said about Sherwood. \u201cI would be like: \u2018Come on, dude, you know we gotta get through this night. There\u2019s another one around the corner.\u2019 \u201d", "Sherwood, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in a deal that could result in a shorter sentence in exchange for his testimony against Novak, told jurors that he empathized with Novak\u2019s plight, because he had experienced an ugly divorce himself. He was barely staying afloat paying alimony and child support for a son he was not allowed to see. When Novak said he needed to \u201cdo something\u201d about Catherine so he wouldn\u2019t \u201cend up like me,\u201d Sherwood testified, he agreed to help.", "On the night of Dec. 12, the prosecutors and their witnesses told the jury, Novak and LaFrance were in their home in Glen Cove with the children. LaFrance gave Natalee and Nicholas each a Benadryl strip before bed to make sure they slept through the night. Then Sherwood arrived, and the three went upstairs, where Novak had a variety of chemicals, a glass bowl and lots of ice. The plan was to make chloroform, which they would use on Catherine, then light the house on fire and make her death look like an accident.", "\u201cAnd now there\u2019s three Jamaica paramedics standing around making chloroform,\u201d LaFrance told the jury. \u201cAnd everybody\u2019s O.K. with it.\u201d", "Sherwood then drove Novak upstate, stopping at a Walmart, where Novak bought a beanie cap, some duct tape and a pair of suede gloves. Novak directed Sherwood to park behind a barn about a mile from Catherine\u2019s house. Novak left, and Sherwood sat in the car and waited. An hour later, Novak reappeared from the woods, peeled off a pair of scrubs, got back in the car and said, \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d They drove off as a glow illuminated the rolling hills.", "\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Novak repeated when he arrived home, according to LaFrance. A week later, he finally told her the details. He lured Catherine to the basement by setting off a fire alarm, then applied the home-brewed chloroform, but it didn\u2019t work. So he strangled her. \u201cHe told me they were rolling around on the floor, and she was begging for her life, saying, \u2018Think of the kids!\u2019 \u201d LaFrance testified. \u201cAnd the only thing he said the whole time was, \u2018I\u2019m doing this for the kids.\u2019 \u201d", "After his confession, LaFrance said, their relationship soured. She drank to forget what happened. One night, she got so drunk that she stripped and walked into a neighbor\u2019s house. The police were called, and it took six of them to handcuff her to a tree. She woke up in the hospital the next morning, unable to remember the previous night.", "\u201cIt was supposed to be this paradise,\u201d she told the jurors about their life in Florida. \u201cWe saved the kids, we are going to be living happily ever after. And it was a disaster.\u201d", "In 2011, she moved into a condo in a nearby town and started having nightmares about Novak. \u201cI heard footsteps coming up the stairs, I felt the bed move and I knew it was Paul coming in to kill me. I was waiting and waiting, and he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d", "She began dating a local sheriff\u2019s deputy in the spring of 2012. She told him about the crime, and he urged her to call the New York police.", "At the trial, Novak was represented by a New York criminal defense attorney named Gary Greenwald. As he paced back and forth in front of the jury, he laid out the defense\u2019s theory: LaFrance, wanting Novak and his children to herself, killed Catherine, with the help of Sherwood, whom she seduced. The only hope he had of convincing a jury of this theory was to discredit LaFrance. She denied that she slept with Sherwood, but Greenwald repeatedly reminded jurors that she had affairs with a number of married men and returned often to a comment she made to the police about having had sex with \u201chalf of Mattituck,\u201d the Long Island community where she once lived. Greenwald spent days going line by line through her and Sherwood\u2019s lengthy medical and psychological records. The tactic drew out the proceedings, turning the trial into one of the longest in Sullivan County\u2019s history. A majority of the jurors had no more than high-school diplomas; most were absent from much-needed jobs. Two were excused as the proceedings went a month over schedule.", "On the last day of Novak\u2019s defense, Greenwald called to the stand what he described as a \u201ckiller witness\u201d: Paul\u2019s daughter, Natalee, then a month shy of 14. After Novak\u2019s arrest, the Florida Department of Children and Families put Natalee and Nicholas in the custody of Novak\u2019s mother and new girlfriend to keep them in the same home and schools, a decision Catherine\u2019s family didn\u2019t challenge, because they were worried about further disrupting the children\u2019s lives. Chewing her lip on the witness stand, Natalee told the jurors that her mom and dad loved each other and that the last time she saw her mom alive, she was hugging her dad goodbye. She wept as she spoke.", "But the jury had already heard the testimony of LaFrance and Novak\u2019s colleagues describing how much he had hated Catherine. They had also seen a picture of Sherwood\u2019s license plate as he sped through a toll on the George Washington Bridge at 6:39 a.m. on Dec. 13. There was also the prosecution\u2019s own killer witness: Elise Hanlon of the New York Fire Department. On the 12th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, after the judge held a moment of silence to remember New York\u2019s lost first responders, Hanlon took the witness chair. A stout, unflappable blonde, she testified that she was a lieutenant and paramedic based in Queens. She started dating Sherwood around 2004, and they married in September 2012, two weeks before he was arrested.", "Hanlon knew her boyfriend drove Novak to Narrowsburg on the night of Dec. 12, 2008. About two weeks after the fire, she testified, she confronted Novak, and he admitted that he killed Catherine. Hanlon never called the police. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my boyfriend to be arrested,\u201d she testified.", "On Sept. 27, 2013, a jury of eight men and four women found Novak guilty on all charges, including first- and second-degree murder, arson, burglary, grand larceny and insurance fraud. He took the news impassively, as expressionless as he was when LaFrance described how he made the chloroform and when his daughter cried on the stand. He was later sentenced to life without parole.", "Leaving the courtroom for the last time, some jurors looked shellshocked. \u201cYou have three bipolar, sex-crazed adrenaline junkies\u201d \u2014 Novak, LaFrance and Sherwood \u2014 \u201ccoming from the madness of the paramedic world known as Jamaica Hospital,\u201d one juror said to reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s like this nest. It\u2019s like \u2014 I don\u2019t even know how to begin to describe it.\u201d", "Toward the end of the trial, I returned to the scene of the crime. Queen Anne\u2019s lace and goldenrod bobbed in the shallow depression that marked where the house had stood. A shagbark hickory and a dying pine shaded the tiny red-and-white garage, painted to match the house. For four years, neighbors and friends were unable to pass the rusty mailbox and overgrown concrete driveway on County Road 25 without a feeling of unease. Now people around town were starting to talk of closure. Catherine\u2019s death was no longer one of those terrible mysteries we wondered about and tried to put out of our minds. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there can be closure when someone is torn out of so many people\u2019s lives,\u201d said the Rev. Phyllis Haynes of St. Paul\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Church, where Catherine was a member. \u201cBut what has happened is that all of us can breathe a little easier without that niggling little poke in our hearts and minds that there wasn\u2019t something quite right about her death.\u201d"], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/consumers-are-still-seeing-seams-in-the-mobile-wallet/": ["LIBBY CATHEY and her sorority sisters fumbled with pesos as they split the bill at Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, over spring break last month.", "But the return trip was painless. For the cab ride from the airport to New York University, two of her sorority sisters took out their smartphones and, with a few taps, reimbursed her for their portions of the fare in a few seconds. This, according to a cadre of start-ups and big corporations, is how consumers will pay for everything in the future, from babysitters to four-star dinners, as checks become cumbersome and exact change harder to find.", "New payment apps are trying to replace your physical wallet with a seamless, Internet-connected experience known as the mobile wallet. But these technologies \u2014 from giants like PayPal, Google and Chase as well as upstarts like Venmo and Square \u2014 are still in their early stages, and as they vie for attention and users, many consumers are failing to see the point, according to a report released in late March by the Federal Reserve.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d said Ginger Schmeltzer, the senior vice president for emerging payments at Fiserv, a financial services technology company. \u201cUntil there are consumers demanding to use whatever the payment option is on their mobile devices, or until there is a compelling cost saving or revenue increase that businesses feel comfortable about, the real turning point in mobile payments is not going to happen.\u201d", "The Fed found that 17 percent of smartphone owners used their devices at least once to make a payment in a store last year, compared with 6 percent of smartphone owners in 2012.", "Those like Ms. Cathey who used their devices to transfer money to other people\u2019s accounts made up 15 percent of smartphone owners last year, the Fed reported. (A little more than half of the adults in the United States own smartphones, according to a survey last June by the Pew Research Center.)", "Many of the money transfer services (or peer-to-peer payment services, as the industry calls them) do not release data about their regularly active users. PayPal, for one, says that more than two million people around the world made peer-to-peer transactions on a monthly basis last year.", "But the numbers in the Fed survey, which include people who have tried the services just once or twice, point to the hurdles facing the mobile wallet on its quest for widespread use.", "Such services do have their converts. Ms. Cathey, 20, a junior at N.Y.U. and the president of the university\u2019s chapter of Delta Phi Epsilon, uses \u201cVenmo\u201d as a verb. She and her sorority sisters rely on the app to pool money for events.", "After entering their debit card and bank account information, users of Venmo can easily send money to others in their network. The service, which includes a social element, \u201cmade money matters not so awkward anymore,\u201d Ms. Cathey said.", "College students are often early adopters of technologies that become widely popular, as Facebook demonstrated. Venmo appears to be a favorite at N.Y.U., where members of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity use it to pay dues. Another start-up, Clinkle, is aiming to appeal to college students, though it has yet to widely release an app and had a couple of high-level staff departures in March.", "Although Silicon Valley has bet hundreds of millions of dollars in the last few years that the mobile wallet will go mainstream, many of these services are still in early stages.", "One service, Square Cash, does not collect any revenue. Venmo, a five-year-old start-up based in Manhattan, also earns no revenue when users pay their friends. Venmo did buy itself some time to develop new products and gain users: It became part of eBay last year when PayPal, an eBay subsidiary, bought its parent company, Braintree. (Venmo\u2019s cryptic ads featuring an unsmiling man named Lucas began appearing on the New York subway late last year.)", "Another obstacle for Venmo and similar apps is that all parties to a transaction need to be willing to use the service. Digitally splitting a bill at a restaurant, for instance, might seem easy, but this use is \u201cstill very much in its infancy, and very small,\u201d said Ron Shevlin, a retail banking analyst at the Aite Group, a research firm.", "The other major use of the mobile wallet \u2014 making payments in stores, often by tapping or scanning a smartphone near the register \u2014 has been slow to catch on. But proponents of these services say they appeal to shoppers and businesses because they may incorporate loyalty programs and can reduce the time it takes to pay.", "The widely acknowledged leader in adopting this technology is Starbucks, which says that 14 percent of all transactions in its stores are conducted through mobile devices. Starbucks, which has a close partnership with Square, the payment start-up run by Jack Dorsey, a co-founder of Twitter, says that paying with a smartphone is simply more convenient.", "\u201cYou\u2019re more likely to have your phone in your hand when you\u2019re in line at Starbucks than you are to have your credit card in your hand,\u201d said Adam Brotman, the company\u2019s chief digital officer. \u201cSo it\u2019s actually more convenient to use your phone.\u201d", "This reasoning fails to impress Andrew Kortina, the co-founder of Venmo, who says that mobile payments in stores will not catch on unless they offer something that traditional cash or credit card payments don\u2019t. That could mean, say, allowing shoppers to skip the checkout line and walk out with an item with a few taps on their phone, as is already possible in Apple stores. Or perhaps automatically delivering items to a shopper\u2019s home. (Starbucks says it plans to introduce a way for customers to order ahead with their smartphones and pick up their coffee in stores.)", "\u201cThinking about replacing a cash register with something else is the wrong framework,\u201d Mr. Kortina said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much more you could do with a phone.\u201d", "One evangelist of the mobile wallet, Carey Kolaja, the vice president for global product solutions at PayPal, said she tried to go as long as possible without using cash.

Ms. Gould is a writer whose first novel will come out this summer, and the apartment belongs to her friend Sadie Stein, a contributing editor for The Paris Review. Both hang out with a young, literary, food-obsessed crowd, and they had met up with two friends to eat baked mustard chicken and that creamed spinach, debating and paying tribute to a writer whose work overflows with stove-centered gatherings just like this one. ", "Ms. Colwin was an author, self-described \u201crefined slob\u201d and passionate, idiosyncratic home cook who died in 1992, when the members of this salon were still in grade school. During her life, she gained a reputation first and foremost as a novelist and a composer of delicately calibrated short stories. But in the years since her death, at the age of 48, her following has only grown, and her highly personal food writing, collected in the books \u201cHome Cooking\u201d and \u201cMore Home Cooking,\u201d has attracted a new, cultishly devoted generation of readers. Her musings, anecdotes and quirkily imprecise, not-altogether-reliable recipes show up with regularity on food blogs. Which only makes sense, because even though Ms. Colwin expressed wariness about technology and cranked out her essays (most of them for Gourmet magazine) on a mint-green Hermes Rocket typewriter, there is something about her voice, conveyed in conversational prose, that comes across as a harbinger of the blog boom that would follow.", "\u201cI think of her as kind of a proto-blogger,\u201d said Mitchell Davis, executive vice president of the James Beard Foundation, which in 2012 inducted Ms. Colwin into its cookbook hall of fame. \u201cI would say she\u2019s a transitional figure between M. F. K. Fisher and Julie Powell.\u201d", "Ruth Reichl, the writer, editor and former New York Times restaurant critic, said: \u201cYou want to be in the kitchen with her \u2014 that is her secret. She is the best friend we all want. She never talks down to you.\u201d", "In turn, friendships have formed around her work. Ms. Stein, 32, first picked up \u201cHome Cooking\u201d when she was 9 or 10; her parents had it around the house in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. \u201cI quietly commandeered the book for my own use,\u201d Ms. Stein recalled. Years later, a shared passion for the Colwinesque view of food and life brought her together for those dinners with Ms. Gould; Ruth Curry, who works in publishing; and Lukas Volger, a cookbook author and entrepreneur.", "Acolytes like Ms. Stein and Ms. Gould don\u2019t merely read Laurie Colwin. They revisit her passages over and over again, and develop a guardian-angel-style attachment to her. When Ms. Reichl arrived at Gourmet as editor in chief, in 1999, she discovered in her office a cache of about 400 letters from mourning fans who had written to the magazine after Ms. Colwin\u2019s death. Ms. Reichl\u2019s \u201cvery first act\u201d as editor, she said, was to have the letters messengered over to Colwin\u2019s husband, Juris Jurjevics, a founder of the Soho Press publishing company who lives these days in Park Slope, Brooklyn.", "Most professional food writers can only dream of connecting with an audience in that way. \u201cWhen I first went to Gourmet, every writer that came in said that he or she wanted to be the next Laurie Colwin,\u201d Ms. Reichl said.", "To Ms. Colwin\u2019s partisans, her essays stand out as an antidote to glowy, glossy magazine photos in which carefree, beautiful people savor a spread of gastronomic wonder around picnic tables on some farm in Umbria, with shafts of Spielbergian sunlight illuminating the scene. By contrast, Ms. Colwin\u2019s world is one of hangover cures, dinner parties gone awry, an apartment so minuscule that its inhabitant has to clean dishes in the bathtub, and the appeal of simple, unstylish grub like boiled beef, black beans, lentil soup and potato salad.", "\u201cShe\u2019s like the anti-Martha Stewart,\u201d Ms. Reichl said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection.\u201d", "It would be easy to describe Ms. Colwin\u2019s recipes as American comfort food, but that categorization doesn\u2019t get at their essence. They\u2019re more like an eccentric form of autobiography. As you approach them, Ms. Stein said, \u201cyou have to know her tastes are weird.\u201d", "Among those who did know her, Ms. Colwin was a catalytic force. Vibrant and vigilantly observant, she drove fast, despised elevators, collected colanders, specialized in spot-on mimicry and had what might be called a Proustian enthusiasm for domestic splendor.", "\u201cShe was a great cook, but the fiascos were kind of fabulous,\u201d Mr. Jurjevics recalled. \u201cShe cooked haggis once that was like the advertisement for \u2018Alien,\u2019 with the cracked egg.\u201d", "She held strong opinions \u2014  about crockery, English food, romantic protocol, the lovers of her friends \u2014 and she didn\u2019t hesitate to express them. \u201cShe did not approve of writers who were self-dramatizing,\u201d said Scott Spencer, a novelist and friend of Ms. Colwin\u2019s. \u201cAnd she did not approve of difficult, inhospitable, challenging, overly fancy kinds of food. It was a culinary philosophy that may have been born of necessity, since her fridge was the size of a suitcase and her stove had four small burners and a balky oven \u2014  and the oven was mainly used for storage.\u201d", "When Mr. Spencer met her, Ms. Colwin lived alone on Bethune Street, in the West Village, in an apartment that became known, in her essays, as the Lilliputian place where she explored the gastronomy of the hot plate. Somehow she gave parties, \u201cperching us here and there throughout her room as if we were pieces of human scrimshaw with which she decorated her cozy quarters,\u201d Mr. Spencer recalled in an email.  ", "Her friend Willard Spiegelman, now a professor of English at Southern Methodist University, recalled her parties as feeling \u201calmost entirely improvisatory,\u201d with Ms. Colwin dashing out at the last minute to find some flowers, watercress, a chicken. \u201cLaurie\u2019s primary interest was never in food per se,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was food as a way of gathering people together.\u201d", "Later on, Ms. Colwin and Mr. Jurjevics moved into an apartment on West 20th Street. (They married in 1983.) \u201cShe was not somebody who went out a great deal,\u201d recalled her friend Alice Quinn, now the executive director of the Poetry Society of America. \u201cBut she loved, loved, loved having people over to her home.\u201d The food she served was \u201calways very simple,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. Guests might have found flank steak, watercress salad, chocolate cake.", "That lack of pretension continues to endear her to readers.

But you can eat very well.\u201d", "Ms. Samadzadeh, a 26-year-old programmer and editor behind a blog called Needs More Salt, encountered Ms. Colwin after falling in love with a recipe for tomato-and-corn pie that was published on the blog Smitten Kitchen. (Deb Perelman, the creator of Smitten Kitchen, said that Ms. Colwin\u2019s work is \u201cso relatable that you feel like it could have been written five minutes ago.\u201d) Before long, Ms. Samadzadeh found herself gorging on Ms. Colwin\u2019s books, trying out the scattershot recipes and silently asking herself a question at one life juncture after another: \u201cWhat would Laurie Colwin do?\u201d", "Rosa Jurjevics asks herself the same question. Now nearing 30, Ms. Colwin\u2019s daughter, also a writer, rents an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant where she holds onto her mother\u2019s favorite French mug, serving bowls, photos, recipe binders.", "Ms. Jurjevics was only 8 when her mother died, overnight, of a heart attack. For fans of Ms. Colwin\u2019s essays, she is a pivotal figure: the girl who made \u201cspider webs with the fancy chicken-trussing strings, which I do remember doing,\u201d she said. She was there to witness the process of her mother\u2019s experiment with the legendary \u201cblack cake,\u201d a Caribbean dessert whose ingredients steep in their own fruit-dense flavors for months.", "In some ways, Ms. Colwin prefigured a lot of what the food world is obsessed with now: organic eggs, broccoli rabe, beets and homemade bread, yogurt and jam. \u201cShe was so ahead of her time with the organic stuff,\u201d Ms. Jurjevics said. \u201cThat was so hard growing up, I\u2019ve got to say. I was the kid with the weird lunch.\u201d", "On the other hand, the surge in food media might have befuddled her. \u201cI wonder what she would have made of so many things,\u201d Ms. Jurjevics mused. \u201cWould she have a computer? Would she email people? She was so particular about everything. Would she blog? I wonder, would she compulsively Google herself?\u201d", "Ms. Jurjevics can\u2019t always relate to the predominantly heterosexual, comfortably upper-middle-class demimonde captured in her mother\u2019s fiction, but she picks up her mother\u2019s voice, her phrasing, her opinions, her way of looking at the world, on every page of \u201cHome Cooking\u201d and \u201cMore Home Cooking.\u201d", "She has gone back to those books countless times.

The Federal Reserve is engaged in an extraordinary campaign to spur growth. Short-term interest rates are near zero, and the Fed is also soaking up assets to pull down long-term interest rates. On the fiscal policy side of the ledger, the government is running a deficit, though it is falling rapidly. The recovery is tepid and the labor market damaged.", "Next, the economic expansion of the Bush years. The government ran deficits, a product of an increase in spending and steep tax cuts.

To help the economy right now, for instance, he argued for huge infrastructure spending, especially since money is cheap and so many construction workers are out of a job.", "Regulations, trade policy and investments in workforce training and education are also important to overcoming secular stagnation, he said. \u201cRegulation that requires the more rapid replacement of coal-fired power plants will increase investment and spur growth as well as helping the environment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn a troubled global economy, it is essential to ensure that a widening trade deficit does not excessively divert demand from the U.S. economy.\u201d", "It is worth stepping back to think about how radical Mr. Summers\u2019s prescription is. Deficits are anathema to most Republicans. And Democrats widely believe that government spending should fall as the economy recovers. President Obama, for instance, frequently boasts about how much the deficit has declined on his watch.", "I asked Mr. Summers what was behind secular stagnation, and he said he was still thinking through all of its causes. But globalization, automation, income inequality and changes in corporate finance might be important factors, he said.", "Income is now more concentrated in the hands of the rich. Those well-off households tend to save and invest higher proportions of their earnings than middle-class or low-income families do.

My community is gone. I\u2019m getting out. But the sad fact is: I didn\u2019t really leave the Lower East Side. It left me.\u201d", "While it\u2019s certainly no secret that downtown institutions, like CBGB and the Knitting Factory, have been disappearing one by one for years, Mr. Patterson\u2019s pending departure is further proof, as if more proof were needed, of the difficulties artists face in surviving the seemingly irreversible tide of gentrification. What does it suggest that a man who endured the crack epidemic, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and at least a dozen arrests can no longer stand what the city has become?", "\u201cWhat Clayton is telling us is that his world is gone and that he\u2019s going too,\u201d said Alan Kaufman, a writer and a friend of Mr. Patterson\u2019s. \u201cThis ought to send up a red flag for someone. It\u2019s remarkable, really. It\u2019s kind of like Atget quitting Paris.\u201d", "Almost from the moment he arrived from Calgary, Alberta, in 1979, Mr. Patterson\u2019s world has been the downtown demimonde of squatters, anarchists, graffiti taggers, tattoo artists, junkie poets, leathered rock \u2019n\u2019 rollers and Santeria priests. When he and his companion, Elsa Rensaa \u2014 she, too, is an artist \u2014 landed in New York, they took an apartment on the Bowery where their $450 monthly rent was paid by their jobs producing commercial art prints, and where one of their neighbors was the not-yet-famous painter Keith Haring.", "Four years later, the couple bought the building where they live today \u2014 once a dressmaker\u2019s shop, at 161 Essex Street \u2014 at a time when Art in America magazine described the neighborhood as a \u201cblend of poverty, punk rock, drugs, arson, Hell\u2019s Angels, winos, prostitutes and dilapidated housing.\u201d This was the culture that Mr. Patterson seized as his subject, wandering the area on endless expeditions with his camera and gradually acquiring an archive of ephemera that grew to include graffiti stickers, concert posters, images of tattoos, thousands of hours of audiotape and videotape and empty heroin bags he had picked up off the streets.", "Gentrification can often gestate invisibly for years, and in the mid-1980s, as Mr. Patterson founded the Tattoo Society of New York and opened up the Clayton Gallery on the first floor of his home, The Village Voice was already reporting that major developers like Helmsley-Spear were investing millions of dollars on vacant lots and abandoned buildings in the neighborhood. Even as local rents began to rise, Mr. Patterson\u2019s arts space was showing work by nontraditional artists like Hasidic Jews and the leader of a local motorcycle gang. Here were the conflicted seeds of an eventual transformation: On the one hand, corporate money was pouring in; on the other, Mr. Patterson was making custom baseball caps for rebel celebrities like Matt Dillon and Gus Van Sant.", "Then, on Aug. 6, 1988, hundreds of downtown residents clashed with the police in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village. The nominal issue was a 1 a.m. curfew imposed on the park, which had turned into an encampment of the homeless and a gathering place for what were described by many as skinheads, drifters and rowdy youths. As darkness fell, officers in riot gear descended on the crowd, and a nightlong melee followed. The park that night turned into something like \u201ca war zone,\u201d The New York Times reported; more than 100 complaints of police brutality were lodged; and Mr. Patterson caught it all on tape.", "It was, in a sense, the height of his career as a documentary artist. The networks showed his footage on the nightly news, and journalists and academics called on him for quotes. While Mr. Patterson was able to capitalize on the attention and channel it into projects that later included a well-received photo exhibition, \u201cL.E.S. Captured,\u201d and a multivolume history of the Lower East Side\u2019s Jews, for him the riot marked the moment when the city\u2019s business interests and security apparatus joined forces and, in so doing, made New York unlivable.", "It took another quarter-century for progressives in the city to catch up with Mr. Patterson, who stayed in New York despite its metamorphosis, with an obstinate belief that if he couldn\u2019t counteract the creeping corporatization, he could at least manage an existence on its margins. Twenty-five years is a long time to live on hope; but a few months ago, just as it had finally died, something happened to restore it.", "But first, there were more losses.", "In July 2011, the Mars Bar, a notorious dive on East First Street that Mr. Patterson frequented, closed its doors and turned into a TD Bank branch. A few months later, the Life Cafe, where an acquaintance, Jonathan Larson, wrote a portion of the musical \u201cRent,\u201d was suddenly shut down. Last year, it was the artists\u2019 bar Max Fish, which decamped to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, prompting a devastated Twitter fan (not Mr. Patterson) to write: \u201cFinal nail to the post-punk guts of upper Ludlow Street\u2019s coffin.\u201d", "But perhaps the cruelest blow of all was the death last May of Taylor Mead, an artist and actor who rose to fame in the 1960s after starring in a series of underground films by Andy Warhol. At age 88, Mr. Mead was forced from his home on Ludlow Street, where he had lived for more than 30 years, after battling his landlord, who was converting the building into market-rate apartments. He moved to Colorado and within a month he had died of a stroke. When Mr. Patterson got the news, he was crushed.", "\u201cThe fact is, no one gave a damn about Taylor Mead,\u201d he said, \u201cand what it made me realize was just how vulnerable people in this city are \u2014 even well-known and well-loved people. I might think that I\u2019m the king of the world, but the truth is there\u2019s no appreciation here for what I do or what I\u2019ve done.\u201d Mr. Patterson was increasingly afraid of ending up like Mr. Mead: \u201cHocked up on the curb,\u201d as he put it, \u201clike a gob of bad meat.\u201d", "Complicating matters, his partner, Ms. Rensaa, had been suffering from memory loss since she sustained a blow to the head in the chaos of Sept. 11. Last fall, two intruders broke into their home while Mr. Patterson was out, and although Ms. Rensaa was not harmed, the experience scared her half to death. Mr. Patterson himself isn\u2019t getting any younger \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m an overweight male,\u201d he complained, \u201cat the end of the road\u201d \u2014 and so this winter, he decided it was high time to fashion an escape plan. He immediately thought of Bad Ischl, a spa town in Austria, where he has been involved with the Wildstyle tattoo and music festival for nearly 15 years.", "If the notion of a New York fixture like Mr. Patterson moving to a chalet in the Alps struck some in his circle as unfathomably strange, it nonetheless possessed a certain logic. There exists in Bad Ischl, Mr. Patterson contends, a creative community of artists, writers, tattoo designers and musicians that \u201cis very much alive.\u201d Then, too, he happens to be big in Austria \u2014 unlike in New York. \u201cThey love me over there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think of me as America\u2019s No. 1 underground photographer.\u201d", "Still, as the news of his retreat leaked out, the downtown avant-garde shuddered with amazement and despair. \u201cClayton is the neighborhood \u2014 or what\u2019s left of it,\u201d said Ron Kolm, a poet, editor and bookseller who once worked at the Strand with Patti Smith. \u201cI guess I always figured that he\u2019d be the last one standing, surrounded by tall buildings. This really is the end of an era.\u201d", "To Daniel Levin, who directed \u201cCaptured,\u201d a 2008 documentary about Mr. Patterson and his work, the plan to leave New York was further evidence of the city\u2019s cultural decline. \u201cSadly, ironically, New York is displacing the people that made it what it was,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThe entire city has become a playground for money, wealth and sterilized housing, and that\u2019s not what\u2019s traditionally made it interesting.\u201d", "Then again, Mr. Patterson has reached that point in life when the youthful allure of being interesting has slowly given way in importance to the more mature comforts of belonging. Bad Ischl, on the River Traun, has a population of 14,000 people. \u201cIt\u2019s a very small village \u2014 everybody knows everybody,\u201d said Max Hirnb\u00f6ch, a tattoo artist there who met Mr. Patterson in 1995.", "While Mr. Hirnb\u00f6ch wondered how his friend would adjust \u2014 \u201cthe mountain air, no crime at all\u201d \u2014 he assumed that Mr. Patterson would eventually fit in. \u201cThe last time he was here, I gave him a traditional Bad Ischl hat and I have to say he looked quite good in it,\u201d Mr. Hirnb\u00f6ch said. \u201cClayton is already part of our family. And we are going to take care of him.\u201d", "It was at this point, just as Mr. Patterson\u2019s Austrian adventure was starting to take shape, that the city surprised him. One night, not long ago, he was at Katz\u2019s Delicatessen, on Houston Street, at a photography show. He saw a young woman in the crowd \u2014 in her 20s, exquisitely dressed \u2014 whose fashion sense impressed him. Mr. Patterson asked if he could take the woman\u2019s picture, she agreed, and they gradually got to talking. It turned out her fianc\u00e9 was the singer for a band called Dameht, whose members had distantly worshiped him for years.", "What resulted from this spontaneous encounter was a creative collaboration of the sort that Mr. Patterson thought no longer existed in New York. The singer, Gary Angulo, whose nom de band is Rivington (for the street on the Lower East Side), commissioned Mr. Patterson to design a logo for the group\u2019s leather jackets. When Mr. Angulo and friends \u2014 artists, musicians, filmmakers and a couple of professionals who worked in public relations \u2014 discovered that their idol was on the verge of leaving New York, they decided to honor his departure with a gallery show.", "\u201cSo much of what you see these days in terms of art is just veneer,\u201d said one of the friends, Kate Litvinov, who is 25 and helped secure a pop-up space for the show in the meatpacking district, on West 15th Street and Ninth Avenue. \u201cBut Clayton and Elsa\u2019s work is real, it\u2019s authentic. It doesn\u2019t derive from anything but itself.\u201d", "The show, \u201c$16 Burger\u201d (Mr. Patterson loves to complain about the price of New York food), is scheduled to open on April 15 and to include a collection of Mr. Patterson\u2019s photographs and several of his rarely seen ink-on-paper prints. Ms. Rensaa\u2019s work \u2014 mostly portraits done in oil \u2014 will be on display as well.", "On a recent afternoon, Mr. Patterson, in his thick black glasses and a baseball cap embroidered with a skull, was on all fours tagging the gallery\u2019s whitewashed floor with a chalk reproduction of one of his most familiar black-and-white designs: a squiggly, graffiti-esque NYC. Mr. Angulo had just ducked out for coffee for the members of his band, who were mopping the floorboards and polishing the windows. A laptop on the bar was streaming a Ramones song. Art was being made and Mr. Patterson looked ecstatic.", "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a dream,\u201d he said, \u201cto have found these kids just as I was on my way out. My whole life has been about the old New York, and here they are about the new New York.\u201d", "As the afternoon went on, the Ramones gave way to more obscure contemporary music, but Mr. Patterson, directing an assistant with a pool cue, did not mind. He was, it seemed, in his element again, drawing, painting, pausing to consider things with a pensive tug on his beard. One of the band members, in skinny jeans and new wave hair, followed him in circles around the room. He was documenting everything that Mr. Patterson did, on a hand-held video camera.", "It had been a heady day. Mr. Patterson had worked for hours and talked \u2014 he loves to talk \u2014 not about what a wasteland the city had become, but instead about Pop Art, Google, Jean Baudrillard, Lou Reed and the cultural significance of the television program \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York.\u201d His plan to flee the city hadn\u2019t changed, but Austria seemed very far away.", "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d Mr. Patterson admitted. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve got youth here \u2014 youth, vitality and interest. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re on the threshold of a new moment. Who knows?

On what floor should the cafeteria go? How many cars could be parked in a small underground garage, and had anyone done a traffic study of the narrow city street where the garage would exit? Since the new building is intended for engineers and other high-tech workers, would the ratio of square footage per employee be similar to that of the Comcast facility in Silicon Valley?", "Mr. Cohen is well known in Philadelphia from his time as chief of staff to former Mayor Edward G.

It\u2019s a point that Mr. Cohen, with a lawyer\u2019s gift for emphasizing only the facts in his favor, does not highlight, and broadband, much more than cable, is likely to be the focus of regulators. \u201cI think almost everyone uses the facts that help them,\u201d he says.", "Michael Copps, a former commissioner on the F.C.C., now serves as the special adviser to Common Cause\u2019s Media and Democracy Reform Initiative.

Because of his association with Mr. Rendell, who also served two terms as Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, and now President Obama, many assume he is a straight-down-the-line Democrat. He says that was never the case \u2014 he grew up with Republican parents and was one of what he believes to have been four Republican students at Swarthmore during his time there \u2014 but the rightward drift of the party drove him away, and for many years the bulk of his giving was to Democrats.", "His giving and fund-raising on behalf of candidates is now split more evenly, though it still tilts toward Democrats.

After taking the reports and tools for a long spin, I came up with some conclusions; here are a few of the most useful.", "When to Book and When to Fly", "The overall take on the best day to book tickets turns out to be somewhat underwhelming, if you look at the country as a whole. Hopper\u2019s data shows it\u2019s actually Thursday, but don\u2019t expect that fact to save you much money. Reserve a domestic flight on Thursday and you\u2019ll spend, on average, $10 less than if you reserve on Saturday, the worst day to book domestic flights. With international flights, you\u2019ll save, on average, $25 over Sunday, the worst day to book flights abroad. (Those are \u201cmaximum averages\u201d that assume you would have booked on the worst day and are now booking on the best.)", "But even before we get to those custom tools, some useful tips emerge: For the vast majority of routes, weekends are the worst time to book, and for about two-thirds of routes, Wednesday or Thursday is the best day. So avoid booking on weekends and try midweek; for the average American flier, those savings will add up in the long run.", "Hopper\u2019s reports also show that the day of the week you depart and the day you return matter more than the day you book. For domestic flights, leaving Wednesday (the best day) will save you $40 on average over a Sunday departure (the worst day); returning Tuesday will save you $45 over returning Friday. For international flights, Wednesdays are the best day to both leave and return.", "Again, that\u2019s on average.

But the cheapest destinations from each of those cities varied widely. For New York, it\u2019s Bergen in Norway and Oslo and Copenhagen; for Chicago, it\u2019s Warsaw and Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany; for Los Angeles it\u2019s Copenhagen, Stockholm and Moscow; and for Boston it\u2019s Lisbon, Dublin and Istanbul.", "That\u2019s good news for Chicago\u2019s big Polish population and Boston\u2019s Irish community, not to mention any pickled herring fans in New York City \u2014 but not just for them. The price differentials are significantly higher, in some cases, than adding the cost of an intra-European flight. In other words, say you live in Boston and want to take your family of four to Paris. The average flight costs $1,089, whereas the average flight to Lisbon is $677. Find a cheap flight from Lisbon to Paris \u2014 they go for as little as $150 \u2014 and voil\u00e0, you\u2019ve got a Lisbon-Paris vacation for less than going to Paris alone.", "(Note that this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good idea to skip Lisbon by booking a connecting flight directly to Paris. If you book two flights separately and miss the connection, the airlines have no responsibility, and you\u2019ll be on your own getting to Paris.)", "Hopper\u2019s interactive tools also work well for choosing a destination. They take your home airport and spit out a world map with average prices by city, so you can also find, say, the cheapest destination in South Asia from Cincinnati.

As is always the case with data crunching, they\u2019ve done some adjusting: For example, the \u201caverage\u201d prices are actually the average for the cheapest 10 percent of results. That makes sense, since most people ignore the least useful search results \u2014 say, an Air India flight from New York to Washington, with a stopover in Mumbai, for $6,500.

There are few questions I hear more often than that one. In February, I interviewed Laszlo Bock, who is in charge of all hiring at Google \u2014 about 100 new hires a week \u2014 to try to understand what an employer like Google was looking for and why it was increasingly ready to hire people with no college degrees. Bock\u2019s remarks generated a lot of reader response, particularly his point that prospective bosses today care less about what you know or where you learned it \u2014 the Google machine knows everything now \u2014 than what value you can create with what you know. With graduations approaching, I went back to Google to ask Bock to share his best advice for job-seekers anywhere, not just at Google. Here is a condensed version of our conversations:", "You\u2019re not saying college education is worthless?", "\u201cMy belief is not that one shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d said Bock. It is that among 18- to 22-year-olds \u2014 or people returning to school years later \u2014 \u201cmost don\u2019t put enough thought into why they\u2019re going, and what they want to get out of it.\u201d Of course, we want an informed citizenry, where everyone has a baseline of knowledge from which to build skills. That is a social good. But, he added, don\u2019t just go to college because you think it is the right thing to do and that any bachelor\u2019s degree will suffice. \u201cThe first and most important thing is to be explicit and willful in making the decisions about what you want to get out of this investment in your education.\u201d It\u2019s a huge investment of time, effort and money and people should think \u201cincredibly hard about what they\u2019re getting in return.\u201d", "Once there, said Bock, make sure that you\u2019re getting out of it not only a broadening of your knowledge but skills that will be valued in today\u2019s workplace. Your college degree is not a proxy anymore for having the skills or traits to do any job.", "What are those traits? One is grit, he said. Shuffling through r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of some of Google\u2019s 100 hires that week, Bock explained: \u201cI was on campus speaking to a student who was a computer science and math double major, who was thinking of shifting to an economics major because the computer science courses were too difficult. I told that student they are much better off being a B student in computer science than an A+ student in English because it signals a rigor in your thinking and a more challenging course load. That student will be one of our interns this summer.\u201d", "Or, he added, think of this headline from The Wall Street Journal in 2011: \u201cStudents Pick Easier Majors Despite Less Pay.\u201d This was an article about a student who switched from electrical and computer engineering to a major in psychology. She said she just found the former too difficult and would focus instead on a career in public relations and human resources. \u201cI think this student was making a mistake,\u201d said Bock, even if it meant lower grades. \u201cShe was moving out of a major where she would have been differentiated in the labor force\u201d and \u201cout of classes that would have made her better qualified for other jobs because of the training.\u201d", "This is key for Bock because the first thing Google looks for \u201cis general cognitive ability \u2014 the ability to learn things and solve problems,\u201d he said. In that vein, \u201ca knowledge set that will be invaluable is the ability to understand and apply information \u2014 so, basic computer science skills. I\u2019m not saying you have to be some terrific coder, but to just understand how [these] things work you have to be able to think in a formal and logical and structured way.\u201d But that kind of thinking doesn\u2019t have to come from a computer science degree. \u201cI took statistics at business school, and it was transformative for my career. Analytical training gives you a skill set that differentiates you from most people in the labor market.\u201d", "A lot of work, he added, is no longer tied to location. \u201cSo if you want your job tied to where you are, you need to be: A) quite good at it; and B) you need to be very adaptable so that you have a baseline skill set that allows you to be a call center operator today and tomorrow be able to interpret MRI scans. To have built the skill set that allows you to do both things requires a baseline capability that\u2019s analytical.\u201d ", "Well, what about creativity?", "Bock: \u201cHumans are by nature creative beings, but not by nature logical, structured-thinking beings. Those are skills you have to learn. One of the things that makes people more effective is if you can do both. ... If you\u2019re great on both attributes, you\u2019ll have a lot more options. If you have just one, that\u2019s fine, too.\u201d But a lot fewer people have this kind of structured thought process and creativity.", "Are the liberal arts still important?", "They are \u201cphenomenally important,\u201d he said, especially when you combine them with other disciplines. \u201cTen years ago behavioral economics was rarely referenced. But [then] you apply social science to economics and suddenly there\u2019s this whole new field. I think a lot about how the most interesting things are happening at the intersection of two fields. To pursue that, you need expertise in both fields. You have to understand economics and psychology or statistics and physics [and] bring them together. You need some people who are holistic thinkers and have liberal arts backgrounds and some who are deep functional experts. Building that balance is hard, but that\u2019s where you end up building great societies, great organizations.\u201d", "How do you write a good r\u00e9sum\u00e9?", "\u201cThe key,\u201d he said, \u201cis to frame your strengths as: \u2018I accomplished X, relative to Y, by doing Z.\u2019 Most people would write a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 like this: \u2018Wrote editorials for The New York Times.\u2019 Better would be to say: \u2018Had 50 op-eds published compared to average of 6 by most op-ed [writers] as a result of providing deep insight into the following area for three years.\u2019 Most people don\u2019t put the right content on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.\u201d", "What\u2019s your best advice for job interviews?", "\u201cWhat you want to do is say: \u2018Here\u2019s the attribute I\u2019m going to demonstrate; here\u2019s the story demonstrating it; here\u2019s how that story demonstrated that attribute.\u2019 \u201d And here is how it can create value. \u201cMost people in an interview don\u2019t make explicit their thought process behind how or why they did something and, even if they are able to come up with a compelling story, they are unable to explain their thought process.\u201d", "For parents, new grads and those too long out of work, I hope some of this helps."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/business/lobbying-efforts-intensify-after-fcc-tries-3rd-time-on-net-neutrality.html": ["WASHINGTON \u2014 In the nine weeks since the Federal Communications Commission said it would try, for a third time, to write new rules to secure an open Internet, at least 69 companies, interest groups and trade associations \u2014 over one a day \u2014 have met with or otherwise lobbied commission officials on what the rules should specify.", "That effort does not count the more than 10,000 comments that individuals have submitted to the F.C.C.", "Now the flood of lobbying efforts is likely to increase after the disclosure Wednesday evening that the F.C.C. would soon release preliminary rules allowing for the creation of special, faster lanes for online content to flow to consumers \u2014 for content providers willing to pay for it.", "The F.C.C. had previously warned against those types of deals, saying they could unfairly discriminate against companies that could not or were not willing to pay.

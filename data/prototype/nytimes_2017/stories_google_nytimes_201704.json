Boy, was I wrong.", "I rely on a cellphone with Google Maps to find my way around. Why would I ever want to buy a GPS unit?", "The major maps apps are excellent, with awesome traffic information. If I\u2019m going for a short jaunt around town, I\u2019ll always grab my phone. But for longer trips, especially, dedicated car-GPS devices have some advantages.", "Like what?", "One big advantage is that GPS devices don\u2019t rely on a data connection to plot a route. They have the map data stored inside. I\u2019ve used my phone to navigate to a rural area \u2014 say, upstate Vermont \u2014 and since the app cached the original route, it got me there just fine. But when I went to navigate out, I didn\u2019t have a data connection. So, I was out of luck.", "There are some apps that let you download the route and map information so you don\u2019t have that problem, but you have to plan ahead, whereas a GPS you keep in your glovebox is always ready to go.", "OK, but what does a good GPS unit cost? Is it worth that much to avoid dead zones?", "In our car GPS guide, we picked the Garmin Drive 51 LMT-S as the best for most people, which costs about $170. There are less expensive ones, about $100. So, yeah, it\u2019s an investment.", "Still, having a GPS frees your phone for other uses, such as music or calls. And the latest GPS units are now multitasking in ways that a phone\u2019s navigation app can\u2019t.", "For example, Garmin\u2019s entire Drive lineup can connect to a backup camera. And there are higher-end \u201ccombo models\u201d that integrate a dash cam. Traditionally, a dash cam is primarily for keeping a record in case of an accident, but some of these new GPS models can also provide some pretty advanced safety features, such as forward-collision warnings, lane-departure alerts, and even the ability to automatically send a text if there\u2019s a crash.", "Those are features we\u2019ve come to expect from new cars, but up until now were difficult to find as aftermarket add-ons for older or more basic cars. These camera-based units don\u2019t work as well as an expensive built-in system with multiple sensors, but they\u2019re still handy features that can help combat distracted driving.", "What about the color-coded roads on Google Maps that warn of delays? And the Waze app, which warns of the police and accidents ahead?", "Phone apps definitely have better traffic information than GPS devices. That\u2019s partly why I will grab my phone for around-town jaunts. The accuracy of Google Maps traffic is awesome. My wife will be checking it as I\u2019m driving and will say, right around this bend, it turns red. And sure enough, the traffic slows way down right at that spot.", "GPS devices provide traffic warnings, and a lot of them also now connect to a phone via Bluetooth for \u201clive traffic,\u201d but they don\u2019t measure up to Google or Waze in that regard.", "The better GPS units have better onscreen directions, especially at tricky interchanges, and they have more precise voice directions. While most navigation systems say \u201cTurn on such-and-such street.\u201d Garmins, for example, now say, \u201cTurn at the traffic light\u201d or even \u201cat the red building.\u201d This landmark-type voice guidance makes it easier to find your turn, especially when it\u2019s not easy to see the street signs.", "How do you test all the different GPS device models?", "While we\u2019ve compared the specs and features for more than 100 models, we\u2019ve done three rounds of hands-on testing with about 20. Most of the nitty-gritty testing is done over weeks inside a car while we use the units for everyday driving.", "At times, I have mounted three units on the windshield at once \u2014 one from each major brand \u2014 to see how they compare under the same circumstances. That\u2019s a challenge. I now record those sessions with a GoPro camera, so I can better keep my eyes on the road."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/technology/tech-roundup-paying-up-to-500-to-chat-with-a-live-streamer.html": ["YouTube has been a source of many videos and memes that have wound their way into popular culture.

That prospect has created angst for many American workers about the difficulties of adapting to technological change and the failure of institutions to help them.", "Yet technologists and academics still differ sharply on how fast the next wave of automation will proceed and how many occupations will be affected. That prompted the panelists to suggest the new data-monitoring tools and the pulling together of government and online data sources to sort through the consequences.", "Those moves could eventually give a worker in a declining occupation useful information about a more promising occupation, with some similar skills but also requiring some new ones, Mr. Mitchell said.

Should we be trying to instill a stronger work ethic in the United States, and build a more robust culture of hard work? Counterproductive and, at times, bitter arguments bog down the search for solutions.", "A recent paper by the psychologists Shai Davidai of the New School of Social Research and Thomas Gilovich of Cornell University reveals a quirk in human psychology that, I think, is responsible for some of our failure to make much progress on those issues. Understanding that quirk could help us find common ground on how to help the poorest Americans.", "In public talks, Mr. Gilovich illustrates the research findings by displaying two separate Google image searches.

Most of our time and energy goes toward overcoming the challenges immediately in front of us. Headwinds demand attention because they must be overcome. Tailwinds may evoke a momentary sense of well-being and gratitude; but primarily, they free us to focus elsewhere, on challenges that must be overcome.", "Mr. Davidai and Mr. Gilovich show some of the broader social and political consequences of this psychological asymmetry. They find, for example, that both Democrats and Republicans believe that electoral maps are not apportioned to their advantage. The scholars also find that, within families, people tend to think their parents were tougher on them than their siblings recognize.", "Of course, we don\u2019t really know what is going on inside everyone\u2019s mind, but it does appear that many of us overrepresent the obstacles we face.", "In many autobiographies, for example, even fortunate people, born to rich, loving families, look back on life and remember all the things that stood in their way. Not only do we play the starring role in our own life stories, but those stories often revolve around struggle.", "I see this tendency in myself. When it comes to education, I have won not just one but several birth lotteries: Many children born next to me in rural India struggled to obtain anything beyond simple primary education and maybe a decent high school. Yet I had some of the best educational resources placed right in front of me all the way through my doctorate at Harvard.", "I would be foolish if I did not remind myself of these advantages every day. Yet it is telling that I do need to remind myself. My spontaneous thoughts are of the challenges I faced, not the advantages I had.", "This cognitive bias, I think, sheds light on persistent disagreements over inequality and opportunity that affect many of us in American society.", "When we see our own past in terms of the headwinds we managed to overcome, it is easy to attribute the failure of others to a lack of perseverance. When poor children drop out of high school, someone who complains that these children don\u2019t have an adequate work ethic may be remembering educational hurdles that she managed to surmount early in her own life.", "We often disagree over the source of our success: Those who emphasize the existence of birth lotteries point to the easy ride the well-off have had. Yet relatively privileged people may look at their own lives and feel, \u201cI\u2019ve struggled too.\u201d", "Arguing about these perceptions doesn\u2019t seem to be productive. We may try a different approach. Poverty, after all, is not only caused by strong headwinds; it is also characterized by a lack of tailwinds. If we work on creating more tailwinds \u2014 by giving poor children more advantages \u2014 we can solve many otherwise intractable problems.", "Consider that by high school, poor children are doing much worse than those from well-off families. Researchers have found that most of this gap accumulates not during the school year, but in the summer months. In Baltimore, for example, a study has found that the entire achievement gap between the poor and the well-off is accounted for by learning disparities in the summer.", "During these months, richer children benefit from summer programs and books around the house, and, more broadly, from the myriad advantages of having parents with the resources, knowledge and time to intellectually engage them. Even conversation around the dinner table can be a tailwind.", "Closing the achievement gap could, then, be about generating tailwinds for poor children. In many ways, the provision of decent public education is itself a tailwind; it is, if not a complete equalizer, more equal than home life. But we could do more. For example, some have suggested the creation of a Summer Opportunity Scholarship to help low-income youth.", "From a public policy perspective, it may be easier to agree on creating tailwinds than on removing headwinds. Even people who take great pride in having gotten ahead through hard work can, if prompted and upon reflection, recognize the tailwinds that helped them. This recognition does not detract from their genuine effort.

For the union, that reality \u2014 a consequence of the teams\u2019 different pay structures and an eight-figure gap in FIFA bonus payouts to U.S. Soccer for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup \u2014 was balanced by progress elsewhere. It is those changes, including control of some licensing and marketing rights, which the union views as an opening to test the team\u2019s value on the open market, that the players and their lawyers feel could pay off in future negotiations.", "\u201cWe tried to completely change the methodology for how to define our value, and we made progress in that regard, and it changes the equation for the future,\u201d said Becca Roux, the union\u2019s executive director.", "Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, portrayed the agreement as a shared victory, an \u201cequitable\u201d deal that he said recognized the team\u2019s achievements and kept U.S. Soccer at the forefront of the continuing fight for gender equity in soccer worldwide.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve always had the most highly compensated women\u2019s team in the world, and this puts them at even higher level,\u201d Gulati said. \u201cTheir performance over all over the last quarter-century has put them at the top of their game. Financially the agreement gives the players security in a way that they haven\u2019t had before and adds a number of other things that were very important to them.", "\u201cSo we\u2019re very pleased to continue being at the forefront of the women\u2019s game internationally.\u201d", "Gulati noted that the deal\u2019s five-year term, through 2021, ensured that the next negotiation would not become an issue for the team in its next major competitions, the 2019 World Cup in France and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. He also revealed that U.S. Soccer had agreed to pay the players for two years\u2019 worth of unequal per-diem payments, the result of improvements in the men\u2019s C.B.A. that were not accounted for in the women\u2019s version.", "But while the deal was completed this week, it was forged over the past four months, during which the players took active control of their side of the negotiations with a team of U.S. Soccer negotiators \u2014 including Gulati \u2014 who had long been eager to do what they called an equitable deal but had bristled at the way the union went about it.", "Initially, the talks had been framed as a simple equal-pay debate, a powerful wedge issue that hung over the talks from the start. It resulted in a lawsuit against the players\u2019 union by the federation to enforce the old collective bargaining agreement but also in a federal wage-discrimination complaint signed by five top players that will continue even with the new C.B.A. complete.", "Those legal fights were the most public salvos in what the top women\u2019s players had come to view as a yearslong fight for respect and equal treatment. After the United States won the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015, in the richest year in team history, a group of players fueled by simmering resentments \u2014 artificial turf fields, travel in coach class, unequal per-diem payments \u2014 demanded that the union fight to win the richer contracts the group felt the players had earned.", "The cause of equal pay seemed a successful strategy; it put U.S. Soccer in the awkward position of defending what was effectively unequal pay for the same work, and it received wide news media coverage as well as the support of athletes and celebrities and even Hillary Clinton, who tweeted her support during the 2016 presidential campaign. But the tactic also proved divisive, forcing fans of the national teams to take sides in an increasingly nasty fight, and it hurt feelings inside the close-knit world of U.S. Soccer, especially after some women\u2019s players \u2014 riding high after their World Cup title \u2014 denigrated the on-field record of the men\u2019s team while pushing their cause.", "With the union\u2019s negotiators and U.S. Soccer barely on speaking terms late last year, the women\u2019s players fired their lawyer and restructured the union\u2019s leadership. The goal was to change the tone of the talks and, with the players more involved, to pivot toward a solution that veteran voices on the team soon came to call \u201cequitable and fair\u201d pay \u2014 a subtle but important shift.", "Gulati, in a telephone interview on Wednesday morning, said the change in leadership, and in tone, had quickly opened the door to the discussions that produced a deal.", "In addition to seeking improved, but not necessarily equal, pay, the players began to press for changes that they saw as vital to the long-term growth of their game. Those changes, they argued in detailed slide presentations during increasingly frequent negotiating sessions, would improve the game outside the narrow ecosystem of the national team and also establish a structure to support both their careers and those of the next generation of American women.", "As a result, the new agreement includes commitments from U.S. Soccer for its continued support of the domestic professional league, the N.W.S.L., as well as requirements that the federation improve standards in the league and \u2014 through sizable increases in camp and roster bonuses for players not under contract with U.S. Soccer \u2014 transfer money to players who exist on the periphery of the more established national team pool.", "The agreement also reinforces the national team players\u2019 commitment to the N.W.S.L. through their league salaries, while at the same time establishing a mechanism for them to pursue opportunities abroad, as players like Carli Lloyd and Crystal Dunn (in England) and Morgan (in France) have done in recent months.", "The final breakthrough came last weekend in Dallas, when as many as 16 players \u2014 dressed in matching team gear in a row of chairs only feet from the negotiating table \u2014 took part in two days of marathon discussions with Gulati and U.S. Soccer representatives. Helpful timing \u2014 the players were together in camp ahead of two friendlies against Russia this week \u2014 and the looming start of the N.W.S.L. season provided another needed nudge.", "On Tuesday night, the players gathered in a drab conference room to hear the details of the agreement from their lawyers, including some benefits that had come to pass only in the final days. \u201cOh, we got that, too,\u201d one player remarked, according to Roux. Then the completed document was shared electronically with all 22 voting members for ratification, while U.S. Soccer\u2019s board met on a conference call to give its assent.", "\u201cI am incredibly proud of this team and the commitment we have shown through this entire process,\u201d Rapinoe, a player and a member of the union\u2019s C.B.A. committee, said in a statement provided by the union. \u201cWhile I think there is still much progress to be made for us and for women more broadly, I think the W.N.T.P.A. should be very proud of this deal and feel empowered moving forward.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/magazine/could-legalized-gambling-save-us-from-the-insufferability-of-fantasy-sports.html": ["In the early 1990s, Bill Bradley, the New Jersey senator and former New York Knick, argued several times in front of Congress that legalizing sports betting would dehumanize athletes and lead to the rampant corruption of children. This was no cynical political crusade; Bradley was a true believer. He liked to declare that athletes were not \u201croulette chips\u201d and tell the story of a game he once played in Madison Square Garden. His Knicks were up by 5 at the end when the other team hit a meaningless basket to cut the final lead to 3. A confused Bradley heard cheers in the crowd, and when someone told him why \u2014 the opponent had just lost by fewer points and beat the spread predicted by oddsmakers \u2014 his eyes were opened to the sordid callousness of the gambling world. Bradley helped push through the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 1992, all but banning sports betting outside Nevada and driving a growing industry that employed hundreds underground.", "As it turned out, the country\u2019s millions of sports gamblers didn\u2019t share Bradley\u2019s concern for the sanctity of athletes like Bill Bradley or the children who might grow up to be just like him. In practical terms, the Sports Protection Act has mostly failed, and gambling has effectively grown to be an inescapable part of big-time sports. Nobody knows how many Americans bet illegally on sports, but the American Gaming Association estimates that roughly $150 billion is wagered annually. (By contrast, $4.5 billion was bet in Nevada sports books last year.) A gambler with a hunch about, say, a Golden State Warriors playoff game this month can use a debit card on any one of dozens of offshore online betting sites. If the gut feeling runs a bit more toward whether a specific player can handle the big stage, he or she can pick him in a daily-fantasy lineup and enter a contest to win thousands.", "Sometime in the next four months, the Supreme Court is likely to decide whether to hear an appeal by Gov. Chris Christie and the State of New Jersey that would essentially let states determine whether to allow sports betting within their borders. What the court will do is not certain: The debate is largely being framed in the language of states\u2019 rights versus intrusive and economically harmful federal overreach, and the position the Justice Department will take in any opinion it files is unclear. But most in the gambling industry believe that some court case either now or in the near future \u2014 seven other states have recently expressed interest in the added tax, infrastructure and tourism revenue that would come from legalized gambling \u2014 will succeed in repealing or gutting the Sports Protection Act.", "Even the professional leagues, which for years mostly opposed legalization on the grounds that expanded gambling would corrupt their product, have started to prepare for changes. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., has publicly come out in favor of regulated sports betting. Last month, the N.F.L. announced that the Oakland Raiders would be moving to Las Vegas, putting an N.F.L. team in the heart of the gambling industry. \u201cThere\u2019s an irreversible momentum for sports gambling,\u201d Daniel Wallach, a gambling expert at the law firm Becker & Poliakoff, told me. The rise of daily-fantasy sports (whose legality is accepted by many states) and the placement of N.H.L. and N.F.L. franchises in Las Vegas have diluted the spirit of the law and spawned challenges in court. \u201cWe could be looking at legal sports betting in this country in three years,\u201d Wallach said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point of no return.\u201d", "Legal gambling on sports doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we will soon follow the example of European and Asian soccer teams that put the logos of online betting sites on the front of their jerseys. There\u2019s still a sizable public-relations gap to overcome \u2014 nobody really likes sports bettors. It\u2019s why the charming gamblers in movies tend to be cardsharps or pool hustlers and rarely sports bettors. In cards and pool and games of chance, the people who get hurt are the house or the sucker who willingly took on the hustler. In sports betting, everyone\u2019s a victim: the teammates, the fans, the innocent spirit of American youth. The potential ruin doesn\u2019t stop with the gambler but with the corruption of the sport itself.", "This, of course, is a dubious fear \u2014 those who gamble away their savings at the craps table are no different morally speaking from those who blow their money betting on the Cavaliers. And if it sometimes seems as if betting scandals are routine in Europe and Asia \u2014 allegations of match-fixing in the lower circuits of professional tennis have circulated for years, for example, as have claims of Asian gambling moguls fixing prominent European soccer matches \u2014 the legality of sports betting in a particular country hardly matters when the sharp behind an illicit operation lives in Malaysia and bets millions in a casino in Macau. Regulated sports gambling in New Jersey is unlikely to lead to a new generation of high-powered match fixers in the United States.", "The larger fantasy-sports industry, however, offers both a model and a cautionary tale for how sports betting could grow once it moves into the light of day. For both fantasy sports and gambling, a vast market has emerged for any bit of information that might provide an edge, and its reach has been evident for years, since N.F.L. broadcasts introduced fantasy stock tickers and pregame segments full of references to obscure metrics like \u201cyards after catch\u201d and \u201cdefense-adjusted value over average.\u201d Over the past 20 or so years, the world of fantasy sports has broadened its originally stultifying conversations \u2014 arguments over how many yards the running back Tiki Barber would gain against the Cowboys\u2019 defense \u2014 into inquiries about how games are actually won on the field, whether by examining the way a baseball catcher frames pitches or by establishing the most efficient spots to shoot from on a basketball court. Fantasy talk evolved into real insight.", "If gambling wants to shake off its bad associations, fueled in no small part by the scammers who offer their stone-cold lock of the week for a one-time payment of just $49.99, it will need to share all the data that goes into making an informed sports bet. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody in this country who knows more about predictive analytics than the guys working in sports betting,\u201d Brian Musburger, the founder of the new media venture Vegas Stats & Information Network, told me. For years, Brian\u2019s uncle, Brent, the longtime CBS sportscaster, always tried to wink at the gamblers watching his games. If a seemingly meaningless field goal covered the spread, Brent found a way to work in a reference to the people who had just sighed in great, full-bodied relief. Brent left ESPN and joined his nephew\u2019s start-up this year.", "The Vegas Stats network, which debuted in February, still does not have many viewers (if you type VSIN into Google, search results for \u201cvain\u201d still pop up), but if it succeeds, there may be an unexpected benefit to traditionalists like Bradley who want sports to be about wins and losses, free from financial concerns or selfish individual accomplishments. Fantasy might have inspired smarter ways to look at actual game play, but it has also tended to make the experience of watching sports, whether with friends or at a bar, downright unbearable.", "We\u2019ve long since normalized the horror of listening to someone telling you about the tragedy that befell a fantasy team, but if that talk were instead about whether the Cowboys were going to cover the spread, wouldn\u2019t that conversation come closer to the actual, idealized point of the game? There are hundreds of reasons that a team might win a football game by, say, 10 or more points. Each one requires you to consider offenses, defensive schemes or, at the very worst, minor details like the rumors about the quarterback\u2019s recent trip to Cabo San Lucas or what your equipment-manager cousin told you about the impact of last night\u2019s rain on turf conditions \u2014 and every such discussion beats talking about your fantasy squad.

But it is hard to believe that voluntary standards would be strong enough. It also puts the onus on individuals and small businesses to complain to regulators and request investigations.", "Under Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal, broadband companies would probably use their gatekeeping position to give themselves a leg up. AT&T, for example, already encourages people to buy the streaming video service of its DirecTV subsidiary by allowing customers to watch it on AT&T\u2019s wireless network without incurring data charges. Verizon and Comcast have similar practices. Over time, such corporate policies will make it harder for smaller companies to compete with the telecom giants.", "Big internet businesses like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix will probably be fine under Mr. Pai\u2019s plans, because they are well established and have the money to cut special deals with broadband companies.", "Smaller firms and start-ups \u2014 some of which may never get started \u2014 will not be as lucky.", "Ultimately, though, the real losers will be all Americans, because there will be fewer choices and less innovation."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/podcasts/the-daily/neil-gorsuchs-first-day.html": ["Listen and subscribe from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher", "For the first time in more than a year, nine justices heard arguments at the Supreme Court on Monday.", "A week and a half after Republicans in the Senate changed their own rules to secure the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch, he now occupies the position at the end of the bench, furthest to the right \u2014 the spot reserved for the most junior justice on the court.", "On today\u2019s episode:", "\u2022 We talk with Adam Liptak, our Supreme Court reporter, who was in the room for Mr. Gorsuch\u2019s first day on the job.", "\u2022 Why would a democratic country voluntarily choose to make itself more authoritarian?

The program is aimed at highly skilled workers, and most of the visas are awarded to technology companies, although other specialty industries such as fashion also use the visas. (Melania Trump, the first lady, worked as a model on an H-1B visa.)", "Under federal law, employers that use a large number of H-1B workers are supposed to document that they tried to hire Americans for the jobs. All H-1B employers are also required to pay prevailing wages to the immigrant workers who receive the visas.", "Labor Department data shows that about 40 percent of the visas go to entry-level workers and another 40 percent go to people with limited experience and skills. The Trump administration says that more of the jobs performed by those people could and should be filled by Americans.", "How are the visas allocated?", "Visa applications must be sponsored by employers. Every April 1, the government begins accepting applications for the next fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. This year, the government received 199,000 H-1B applications in the first five days and then stopped accepting them.", "Because there are more applicants than visas, the visas are awarded by lottery. Each visa is good for three years and can be renewed for three more years. Immigrants who are applying for a permanent residency visa, known as a green card, can typically stay longer while waiting for approval.", "In 2015, President Obama expanded the program to allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to also work in the United States, but in a recent court filing, the Trump administration said it was reviewing that policy.", "It is not clear exactly how many foreigners are in the United States on H-1B visas, but analysts estimate 650,000 to 900,000. In recent years, about 70 percent of the visas have been issued to citizens of India.", "Who employs these H-1B visa holders?", "The biggest employers are India-based outsourcing companies like Wipro Technologies, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services. These firms contract with banks, health care companies and other businesses to handle various computing tasks and bring in thousands of immigrants to do the work. Outsourcing companies based in the United States, particularly IBM and Cognizant, also use large numbers of H-1B workers.", "The leading American technology companies, including Google, Microsoft and Apple, employ thousands of H-1B workers. Two companies, Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm, are heavily dependent on H-1B visas, with at least 15 percent of their American workforces holding the visas, according to federal filings. Thousands of Silicon Valley start-ups also hire some H-1B workers.", "How do these foreign workers contribute to the American economy?", "American technology companies argue that there is a shortage of qualified Americans for scientific and programming jobs, forcing them to turn overseas for workers to meet their hiring needs.", "In addition, immigrants or their children have played key roles in founding many technology companies, including giants like Apple, Google and Intel and up-and-comers like WhatsApp and Airbnb.", "The Indian outsourcers, which generally pay lower wages and operate in a different part of the technology ecosystem, say they are helping American companies cut spending on certain basic services so they can keep employing higher-paid workers in other parts of their businesses. R. Chandrashekhar, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, a group that represents the Indian technology industry, says that more than three-quarters of the Fortune 500, America\u2019s largest companies by sales, use the Indian outsourcers for some operations.", "\u201cThese services play a critical role in ensuring that corporate America remains a job-creation engine,\u201d Mr. Chandrashekhar said.", "Still, Indian outsourcing companies are preparing for a world of fewer visas, shifting the work to people in India and other countries.", "Are American workers hurt by immigrant work visa programs?", "Some studies suggest that universities grant technology degrees to more than enough American students to fill all the open jobs in the United States, so critics of the visas say the program is unnecessary. Silicon Valley companies often do not cast a wide net for American job candidates. Instead, they compete to hire the same graduates of the top colleges for many jobs and rely heavily on immigrants to fill out their workforces.", "Under the H-1B program, all companies have to attest that they are paying foreign workers prevailing wages and that their existing workers will not be adversely affected, said Russ Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of IEEE, the largest professional association for computer scientists and electrical engineers. \u201cBut all you have to do is check a box.\u201d", "In some cases \u2014 at Walt Disney and at the University of California, San Francisco, for instance \u2014 employers laid off workers and replaced them with cheaper immigrants employed by outsourcing companies.", "Foreign workers can also be abused by the visa programs. The H-1B visa is tied to a specific employer, which means the visa holder cannot easily change jobs. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, who has long pushed for changes, said some H-1B holders earned less than their stated salaries because they were forced to repay their employer for various expenses, such as travel.", "What changes are under consideration for visa programs?", "The Trump administration was vague about what it would like to change. In a background briefing with reporters, officials said they were considering changing the wage levels that would qualify for visas, raising fees for H-1B applications and steering more visas to immigrants with advanced degrees.", "The government will also publicly release more data about other visa programs, such as the L-1, which allows workers officially employed overseas by a company to work in the United States. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many L-1s are here, who employs them, where they are located and what they are paid,\u201d said Ronil Hira, an associate professor of political science at Howard University who has extensively studied immigrant visa programs.", "Many in Congress support changing the H-1B lottery system to give preference to the highest-paying jobs. \u201cWe should allocate visas based on who wants to pay the highest salary to avoid undercutting the wages of American workers,\u201d said Ms. Lofgren, who has sponsored one of several bills on the topic.", "Such a change would favor established American technology companies, which tend to pay high wages, and hurt the outsourcing companies, which hire immigrants to do more basic work at lower wages. But there is a risk of collateral damage to start-ups, which pay less in cash but award stock to new hires, and to hospitals, which recruit immigrants for nursing and other nontech jobs.", "Changes to work visas could also be wrapped into a broader immigration bill. Mr. Trump recently told members of Congress that he was open to discussing that approach."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/style/isabel-rose-transgender-daughter-donald-trump.html": ["Isabel Rose, the telegenic heiress to one of New York\u2019s best-known real estate dynasties, has always had an ability to make her publicity-wary family squirm.", "In 2005 she published a novel, \u201cThe J.A.P.

She pointed out their similarities.", "\u201cWe are both from prominent New York real estate families, we both attended private all-girls schools and went on to earn degrees from Ivy League colleges, and we both married smart Jewish men and now have young children,\u201d Ms. Rose wrote.", "Then, she issued a directive: \u201cIvanka, put yourself in my Jimmy Choos for a minute. What would you do if you were me? Because I know exactly what I would do if I were you: I would take my father aside and explain that failing to protect innocent children\u2019s rights to use the bathroom of their choice is wrong and unfair and un-American.\u201d", "Within hours, the letter went viral, generating hundreds of comments that ranged from profoundly supportive to utterly horrified. It was reposted on the website of Harper\u2019s Bazaar. CNN commissioned a follow-up piece, in which Ms. Rose gently picked apart some of the more stinging commentary that had come her way, noting that there is a subtle but essential difference between giving a child permission to express who they are and engaging as a parent in \u201cindulgent behavior.\u201d", "At gay and transgender benefits around town, Ms. Rose arrived in her Isabel Marant trousers and the Row blazers, and was greeted almost like a folk hero \u2014 a Jessica Chastain look-alike who had spoken truth to power and put her social position at risk on behalf of a cause that needs powerful allies.", "Ms. Rose didn\u2019t hear directly from Ms. Trump, but Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo called and congratulated Ms. Rose on the letter. Earlier this week, Ms. Rose even met with Mr. Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Ms. Rose said she pleaded for protections.", "Darting around Lower Manhattan, Ms. Rose was amiable and self-deprecating about what she has been through. At a benefit for the Family Equality Council, one of the hosts began talking about how miraculous having children is. \u201cExcept when they\u2019re unbelievably annoying,\u201d Ms. Rose interjected.", "She noted that what is most remarkable about her family is how unremarkable they are; that change (or what she calls the \u201creversal of expectations\u201d) is simply the most reliable fact of life.", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand the tendency to catastrophize,\u201d she said. \u201cI see it and the only conclusion I draw is that it produces adrenaline. It makes people excited.\u201d", "Friends marvel at what they view to be her bravery, as she proudly and unapologetically offered her unconditional love and support to Sadie. The sight of that child, happy and free, is pretty good evidence Ms. Rose has done something right.", "But in a country where transgender people are routinely killed, it\u2019s not always this simple.", "Even for Ms. Rose \u2014 a person with wealth and privilege \u2014 there are relatives who have not always been comfortable with the choices she made. Not to mention people on the right, who are excoriating her for what they believe is the ultimate act of indulgence.", "Then, questions remain about how she will balance the public demands of being an activist with the private responsibilities of being a parent.", "How does she talk honestly about her child without opening her up to danger, and without making her into a representative she is not yet ready to be?", "Ms. Rose also has ambitions and desires of her own. Those can sometimes be hard to separate from the brand of activism she has chosen to pursue. She is, after all, a person who proudly calls herself \u201cthe second cousin twice removed of a drag queen\u201d \u2014 a woman who requires no orchestra to break into song. And that comes with attendant complications too.", "In 2002, Ms. Rose was the star and a writer of an independent film called \u201cAnything but Love,\u201d which centered on an aspiring cabaret singer named Billie Golden who lives in Queens, watches Eartha Kitt enviously through the window of the supper club she works and fends off her the opprobrium of a mother who says: \u201cYou live your life as if you\u2019re in some kind of technorama musical.\u201d", "\u201cTechnicolor,\u201d she corrects.", "Of course, in real life, Ms. Rose did not grow up in Queens but on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.", "Her father, Elihu, is a real estate scion and retired professor of military history at New York University who serves as the chairman of the Park Avenue Armory.", "His family manages rental buildings all over Manhattan as well as in Queens, and much of their fortune has gone back to local cultural organizations such as the New York Public Library, Carnegie Hall, the Museum of Natural History and Lincoln Center, all of which have areas named after them.", "Even at Central Synagogue \u2014 the congregation frequented by prominent families like the Lauders and Tisches \u2014 they loomed large, from the checks they wrote, to their black-tie seders.", "As parents to Isabel, Mr. Rose and his wife, Susan, were determined to be completely supportive. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is with all of our children,\u201d Susan said in a phone interview this week. \u201cThere was never any other way.\u201d", "Still, there was no question, that Isabel \u2014 despite her diplomas from Yale (summa cum laude) and Bennington (master\u2019s degree in writing) \u2014 was an unusual family member.", "She is a performer.

After that were drinks at Art Bar in the West Village.", "On the fourth date, he asked her to marry him.", "She got pregnant and said yes, trading the Plaza for the Park in West Chelsea, where she and Mr. Fagen performed a rendition of the \u201cGrease\u201d anthem \u201cWe Go Together\u201d and were united in holy matrimony by Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl of Central Synagogue, whom Mr. Fagen affectionately describes as the \u201conly Korean woman rabbi in the world.\u201d", "After the ceremony, Ms. Rose practically went into palpitations as a \u201csenior member\u201d of her clan said he was getting up to go to the bathroom, and she realized he was about to unzip at a urinal shaped like a male appendage.", "\u201cIt was just like, \u2018Nooooooooo,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Rose, reaching her arm out, like a movie character in slow motion.", "As fervent gay rights activists, Ms. Rose and Mr. Fagen joked to friends that evening that they were going to raise their baby gay but would \u201clove him all just the same\u201d if he turned out straight.", "\u201cWhat we weren\u2019t predicting was door No. 3,\u201d Mr. Fagen said.", "It wasn\u2019t just that their son, Samuel, wanted to play mermaids at age 2, which led Ms. Rose online to numerous articles that described this as a typical predictor of \u201cgender dysphoria,\u201d the mental state typically used to describe pre-transitioners.", "It was also Samuel\u2019s refusal to smile for photographs with Lily and the violent tantrums that transpired while getting suited up for a relative\u2019s bar mitzvah.", "\u201cI\u2019m a girl, Mommy,\u201d Ms. Rose recalled being told, over and over.", "Friends didn\u2019t really know at first what the exact nature of the problem was.

(More than a few also wondered privately: Why does the dramatic stuff always happen to her? \u201cIsn\u2019t that the question,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d)", "Even Mr. Fagen did a certain amount of blaming his wife, which she found surprising given that he was, as she described it, \u201ca rocker with a master\u2019s degree in poetry.\u201d", "\u201cAll I can tell you is that I went through all the permutations people go through,\u201d he said.", "So Ms. Rose took the good-cop role, becoming the confidante her husband wasn\u2019t ready to be.", "On vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., she took Samuel, then around 4, to the Lilly Pulitzer shop and watched with curiosity as pink poplin turned a depressed child turn into a happy nymph. Back in New York, they watched David Bowie videos and went to the set of Ms. Rose\u2019s video, where the first introductions to drag queens like Hedda Lettuce were made.", "Ms. Rose hoped to show her son there were many ways one could be a boy, from wearing metallic face paint to putting on green wigs and high heels.", "Unfortunately, this didn\u2019t really work with Samuel, who was alarmed by Ms. Rose\u2019s compatriots and utterly uninterested in Bowie. Nor did it assuage the concerns of friends and relatives who argued at the time that Ms. Rose was \u201cindulging\u201d her child and pushing ever closer to the great trans abyss.", "Throughout, Ms. Rose waded through confusing studies and heard troubling statistics about trans people attempting suicide. Attending another bar mitzvah, in Huntington, N.Y., in March 2014, the concern became more immediate.", "Before the reception, the family was in their hotel room and Ms. Rose went to take a nap. When she woke up, Samuel was in front of the mirror crying and Mr. Fagen was on his knee, asking what was wrong.", "The response: \u201cI want to burn my face off.\u201d", "\u201cUntil that moment, I never really understood the profound discomfort,\u201d Mr. Fagen said. \u201cHow does any child that young learn to hate themselves so much?

So I was a little confused.\u201d", "Maybe angry too.", "\u201cI was in middle school,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to be normal and fit in. So I had to take a step back and say, you know what, this is not about me.\u201d", "Together, the family embarked on extensive counseling at the Gender & Family Project at the Ackerman Institute for the Family, where gender-divergent children and their siblings and parents attend sessions together and then split off into peer support groups.", "One early concern for Ms. Rose and Mr. Fagen was how to embrace their child\u2019s transition and not have her become a Real Housewife in miniature.", "When the girl formerly known as Samuel suggested that the new name be Jasmine, a line was drawn.", "At this point, Mr. Fagen was arguing that if parents get to name their son at birth, they ought also to be able to pick the second one five years later when she emerges as their transgender daughter. Then his child approached with the name Sadie, and Ms. Rose was able to broker a peace offering.", "As Sadie\u2019s hair grew out, Ms. Rose felt it was time to clear things up quickly and definitively.", "First, she placed a photo on Facebook of Sadie attending her first ballet class and allowed people to talk among themselves. Then, she took her daughter to Central Synagogue, where Rabbi Buchdahl announced that the two were coming up to the bimah to sing.", "As Ms. Rose saw it, this was a good way to say: \u201cYes. Done.\u201d But it also was embraced by the synagogue\u2019s leadership, who thought standing behind the family sent a powerful message about what religious institutions can be.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want the religious right to be able to speak for God with a monolithic voice,\u201d Rabbi Buchdahl said. \u201cI understand that there will be interpretations of certain sacred texts that make this challenging for some people to accept, but I think it\u2019s important that we interpret the revelations with the moral compass of our day. And my understanding of our sacred texts is of a God who loves children, in all the ways they are made.\u201d", "Sometimes, people ask whether Sadie\u2019s \u201ctransitioning\u201d means she has already begun surgery or taking hormones.", "Mr. Fagen patiently explains that those issues are years away, and that for now what has changed are \u201cwardrobe and pronouns.\u201d", "Given the confidence Ms. Rose showed at temple and on Facebook, perhaps the letter she published on Medium shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise.", "But it did to Susan and Elihu Rose.", "\u201cWell, that was crazy,\u201d Susan said, chuckling. \u201cEli and I were down in D.C. We came home from the Smithsonian museum of African-American history, we were totally pooped, and I said: \u2018My God. Look at this amazing letter.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know Isabel was writing it. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. Then Eli said, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 and he mentioned that he knew someone who knew Ivanka and maybe they could pass it to her. The next morning I sent it out to friends, especially friends with marginalized children who might be gay or transgender. I think it\u2019s just an inspiration.\u201d", "Lily had a more complicated reaction. She asked her mother if she realized she had outed Sadie.", "While the administration at Sadie\u2019s elementary school accepted her last year with the awareness that she is transgender, there hasn\u2019t been an explicit conversation with members of her class.", "Mr. Fagen, asked whether he worries about his wife\u2019s openness with the world, and all the publicity about their daughter, said: \u201cAbsolutely.

How will she feel about what is for the world a mere Google search away?", "Alternatively, if she decides she does want to talk about it publicly, will she feel the power of her story has been blunted by all of the adults who saw fit to tell it before she could?", "But that\u2019s later.", "For now, Sadie is merely a second-grade girl who loves science, likes math, thinks English is O.K. and hates history.

The network technology is quickly becoming popular: After the start-up Eero released a mesh system last year, bigger brands like Google and D-Link followed with similar products.", "Obviously, large houses with many rooms would benefit from multiple Wi-Fi hubs. But based on my tests with several mesh systems over the last year, I would go a step further and recommend a mesh network for most people, including those with modestly sized homes, for a variety of reasons.", "For one, mesh Wi-Fi systems like Eero and Google Wifi include intuitive smartphone apps that make managing your network easier to understand. For another, some mesh systems are aesthetically pleasing \u2014 unlike traditional routers, which are bulky contraptions of hideous antennas that look as if they were made on the Death Star.", "Most important, mesh networks better accommodate a shift in how people use technology today. We carry mobiles devices like smartphones, smart watches, laptops and tablets from room to room. Internet-connected gadgets like smart speakers, bathroom scales and smart televisions are also increasingly scattered throughout the home. With mesh networks, your Wi-Fi coverage has less chance of being interrupted.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see the router vendors doing something that is properly useful for once,\u201d said Dave Fraser, the chief executive of Devicescape, a tech company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019ve finally realized it\u2019s human beings buying these products rather than I.T. staff.\u201d", "I tested three popular Wi-Fi systems: Eero, Google Wifi and Netgear\u2019s Orbi. All were solid, though my favorite was Eero. Here\u2019s what you need to know about mesh networks when picking one that suits your home.", "First, a primer on how a mesh system works. You connect a primary base station to your broadband modem. From there, you connect satellite stations in rooms where you might get weak coverage.", "Let\u2019s say your primary base station is in the downstairs living room, and you have a satellite station in the upstairs office. When you are in the office and loading a webpage on a laptop, the primary base station retrieves the webpage data and bounces it to the satellite station, which then beams it to your computer in the office in what\u2019s known as a hop.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like taking a flight where you can\u2019t fly direct, but you can fly indirectly through a hub,\u201d Mr. Fraser said. \u201cIf you go into the back room, there\u2019s no signal. The only way you can get there is through two shorter flights.\u201d", "In addition to expanding your Wi-Fi range, a mesh system helps your device automatically connect to the strongest station as you move about the house. When you\u2019re in the living room, your smartphone will automatically pull a signal from the station there; when you move to the bedroom, your smartphone will seamlessly switch to the station there.", "That\u2019s better than what we could do with older router setups. With a traditional Wi-Fi router, your signal would degrade the farther you move from the base station. You could boost a Wi-Fi router\u2019s connection with an extender station. But in that situation, you would have to manually connect your device to the extender\u2019s Wi-Fi network, and when you moved away from the extender, you would have to manually switch back to the main router\u2019s Wi-Fi network. That\u2019s a pain.", "Finally, mesh systems like Eero, which looks like a sleek white hub with rounded corners, and Google Wifi, which is a white cylindrically shaped device, aren\u2019t eyesores. So you need not be shy about putting the Wi-Fi hubs out in the open, like on a side table, for a clear line of sight with your gadgets.", "The main downside of a mesh network is that you lose some speed with every so-called hop.", "Let\u2019s say that your primary Wi-Fi station is in the living room, you have a satellite hub in the basement, and in between those two rooms there is another satellite hub in the garage. In the basement, your speeds will be slower, because the primary router makes a copy of the data as it hops to the satellite in the garage, and then the satellite in the garage produces another copy that reaches the satellite in the basement. As a result, it will take more time for that data to travel to your device via the basement hub.", "Despite the sluggishness, that is still better than getting a crummy signal or no connection at all in the basement if you had just one router.", "Netgear\u2019s Orbi works differently than traditional mesh systems. It has a dedicated Wi-Fi band, or connection, in which only the router and satellites can talk to each other; no other devices can interfere with their connection. Hence Orbi\u2019s hubs can transfer data more quickly to one another than systems like Eero and Google Wifi can.", "The other downside of a mesh system is they are not cheap. A pack of three Eero devices costs about $400, Google Wifi costs about $300 for a pack of three, and Netgear\u2019s Orbi with a router and one wall-plug satellite costs $300.", "Google says the rule of thumb for choosing a package is that each access point covers about 1,500 square feet of space. But configurations will vary depending on the layout of your home and the materials inside your walls. In my roughly 1,100-square-foot apartment, I needed two access points because my main rooms are separated by a long hallway.", "In my tests with Eero, Google Wifi and Netgear\u2019s Orbi, all were quite fast in each room. The Orbi delivered the speediest results over all, and Eero and Google Wifi performed roughly the same. The Wirecutter, the product recommendations site owned by The New York Times, tested multiple mesh systems in a large house and also found Orbi to be the fastest, strongest system.", "Yet speed isn\u2019t everything. Eero\u2019s app was the easiest to understand, which made setting up and checking on the status of the Wi-Fi system extremely smooth. Google Wifi\u2019s app was also intuitive, though less polished than Eero\u2019s. Netgear\u2019s Orbi had the clunkiest setup, requiring an arcane web browser interface to get started, and the configuration language would probably be intimidating for those who are not information technology professionals.", "In addition, the Orbi, which looks like a water purifier pitcher, is the bulkiest and ugliest of the three, so you may feel tempted to hide it behind a pile of books, which would weaken its signal.", "Consumers would probably be happy with any of these systems compared to a traditional router. If speed is your top priority, consider the Orbi. If price is a concern, go with a Google Wifi package. Or if your goal is to make Wi-Fi less of a headache for you or a loved one, buy an Eero system.", "If you live in a tiny space, like a studio apartment, a mesh network is probably overkill. But you may still want to consider buying a single Eero or Google Wifi hub to take advantage of their intuitive apps for managing your Wi-Fi.", "The complexity of Wi-Fi is what inspired Eero\u2019s chief executive, Nick Weaver, to create a mesh product.

And as of 1990, it was concepts from computing that explained us to ourselves: \u201cToday\u2019s embrace of the computational metaphor in the cognitive and neural sciences is so widespread and automatic that it begins to appear less like an innovative leap than like a bandwagon phenomenon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is a tendency to rephrase every assertion about mind or brains in computational terms.\u201d", "Nearly three decades later, now that computing has become truly ubiquitous, its metaphors are deployed without a moment\u2019s thought. We don\u2019t just talk intuitively about the ways in which people are \u201cprogrammed\u201d \u2014 we talk about our emotional \u201cbandwidth\u201d and look for clever ways to \u201chack\u201d our daily routines. These metaphors have developed right alongside the technology from which they\u2019re derived, starting with hardware and then moving to software, apps and networks. Now we\u2019ve arrived at a tempting concept that promises to contain all of this: the stack. These days, corporate managers talk about their solution stacks and idealize \u201cfull stack\u201d companies; athletes share their recovery stacks and muscle-building stacks; devotees of so-called smart drugs obsessively modify their brain-enhancement stacks to address a seemingly infinite range of flaws and desires.", "\u201cStack,\u201d in technological terms, can mean a few different things, but the most relevant usage grew from the start-up world: A stack is a collection of different pieces of software that are being used together to accomplish a task. A smartphone\u2019s software stack, for instance, could be described as a layered structure: There\u2019s the low-level code that controls the device\u2019s hardware, and then, higher up, its basic operating system, and then, even higher, the software you use to message a friend or play a game. An individual application\u2019s stack might include the programming languages used to build it, the services used to connect it to other apps or the service that hosts it online; a \u201cfull stack\u201d developer would be someone proficient at working with each layer of that system, from bottom to top.", "The stack isn\u2019t just a handy concept for visualizing how technology works. For many companies, the organizing logic of the software stack becomes inseparable from the logic of the business itself. The system that powers Snapchat, for instance, sits on top of App Engine, a service owned by Google; to the extent that Snapchat even exists as a service, it is as a stack of different elements. \u201cWhat you end up with is entire companies being built on a set of software tools and services,\u201d says Yonas Beshawred, whose own company, StackShare, lets tech professionals publish their companies\u2019 stacks and see what others are using, comparing technology the way hobbyists might compare gear. \u201cYou can think of them as Lego blocks.\u201d A healthy stack, or a clever one, is tantamount (the thinking goes) to a well-structured company.", "On StackShare, Airbnb lists over 50 services in its stack, including items as fundamental as the Ruby programming language and as complex and familiar as Google Docs. StackShare itself \u2014 the website \u2014 lists over 90 items, according to a more liberal usage of the term: Alongside basic infrastructure are communications tools like Skype and a payroll service called Zenefits. When I asked Beshawred about the word\u2019s broadening usage, his response was basically Daugmanian: \u201cThe reason we\u2019re talking about software now is because this is the dominant form that technology takes right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a function of the state of the industry, and how ubiquitous software has become.\u201d Ten years ago, he said, your company\u2019s tech \u201cstack\u201d would have included actual hardware, like servers. Ten years before that, you wouldn\u2019t have been asked about your stack at all \u2014 though an obnoxious time traveler from the Silicon Valley of 2017 might insist that a phone system, a parcel service and credit-card companies composed, more or less, a mail-order stack.", "Stack logic is only just finding its footing in the corporate world, and it hasn\u2019t spilled into mainstream conversation just yet. (People might intuit what you meant if you described your Twitter and Facebook accounts as a \u201csocial-media stack,\u201d but they might also intuit that they want their conversation with you to be over as quickly as possible.) The concept, however, has gained traction in a telling set of subcultures. Bodybuilders, for instance, obsess over their supplement stacks, arguing on fitness forums about which combinations of protein powder, fish oils and amino acids will maximize muscle growth and minimize recovery time; GNC, the supplement chain, has a whole section of its site called \u201cStacks and Bundles.\u201d On Reddit, nearly 100,000 people are subscribed to a forum for Nootropics \u2014 \u201cdrugs, supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional foods that improve mental functions,\u201d in the forum\u2019s words \u2014 where they list their stacks: Theanine, Modafinil, \u201ca good multivitamin,\u201d caffeine. Sample posts on a sister forum called StackAdvice include \u201cGood effective nootropic stack for competitive college performance?\u201d and \u201cSeeking stack advice for mood enhancement.\u201d Users compare and critique stacks like developers arguing about server software.", "Elsewhere, Scott Adams \u2014 the creator of \u201cDilbert\u201d and, more recently, an unlikely pro-Trump political blogger \u2014 has stretched this usage to an extreme, attributing Trump\u2019s political potency to his unique \u201ctalent stack.\u201d (Including, among many others, the skills of \u201csocial media,\u201d \u201cstrategy\u201d and \u201cpersuasion\u201d \u2014 the last of these is a longtime obsession for Adams.) In this formulation, Kanye West\u2019s success is a result of talents years in the stacking, including \u201chis business acumen, his drive and his knack for self-promotion.\u201d Adams also says his girlfriend, an Instagram personality, stacks \u201cmodel tricks\u201d with \u201call the tools of social media.\u201d This method for describing the qualities of other people can border on the sociopathic; it calls to mind, and has piqued the interest of, online pickup-artist culture. But in a world where Amazon\u2019s Echo device goes by the name \u201cAlexa,\u201d speaks in a human voice and can be supplemented with various \u201cskills\u201d \u2014 individual bits of software that stack up into a crude personality \u2014 the concept of a stacked self is neither surprising nor entirely dissonant.", "Other attempts to elaborate on the stack have been more rigorous and comprehensive, less personal and more global. In a 2016 book, \u201cThe Stack: On Software and Sovereignty,\u201d the professor and design theorist Benjamin Bratton sets out to, in his words, propose a \u201cspecific model for the design of political geography tuned to this era of planetary-scale computation,\u201d by drawing on the \u201cmultilayered structure of software, hardware and network \u2018stacks\u2019 that arrange different technologies vertically within a modular, interdependent order.\u201d In other words, Bratton sees the world around us as one big emerging technological stack. In his telling, the six-layer stack we inhabit is complex, fluid and vertigo-inducing: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface and User. It is also, he suggests, extremely powerful, with the potential to undermine and replace our current conceptions of, among other things, the sovereign state \u2014 ushering us into a world blown apart and reassembled by software. This might sound extreme, but such is the intoxicating logic of the stack.", "As theory, the stack remains mostly a speculative exercise: What if we imagined the whole world as software? And as a popular term, it risks becoming an empty buzzword, used to refer to any collection, pile or system of different things. (What\u2019s your dental care stack? Your spiritual stack?) But if tech start-ups continue to broaden their ambitions and challenge new industries \u2014 if, as the venture-capital firm Andreessen-Horowitz likes to say, \u201csoftware is eating the world\u201d \u2014 then the logic of the stack can\u2019t be trailing far behind, ready to remake more and more of our economy and our culture in its image. It will also, of course, be subject to the warning with which Daugman ended his 1990 essay. \u201cWe should remember,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat the enthusiastically embraced metaphors of each \u2018new era\u2019 can become, like their predecessors, as much the prison house of thought as they first appeared to represent its liberation.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/sports/basketball/kelsey-plum-wnba-draft-james-harden-comparisons.html": ["As Kelsey Plum neared the N.C.A.A. women\u2019s basketball career scoring record during her senior season at the University of Washington, her game became equated with that of another prolific left-handed shooter.", "Type Plum\u2019s name into Google, and the first result under \u201cPeople also search for\u201d will be James Harden, the Houston Rockets guard.", "Several news outlets, including WNBA.com, advanced the comparison, which was framed as a compliment to Plum, placing her on a level with a leading candidate for the N.B.A.\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award.", "Plum, who was picked first over all in the W.N.B.A. draft by the San Antonio Stars on Thursday, has appreciated the analogy.

Serious complications are rare, but the risk increases as the pregnancy progresses, and it isn\u2019t clear yet how far into pregnancy the drugs should be used.", "With the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of mifepristone in 2000, many people believed the reproductive revolution had arrived; the drug, which studies had shown could be safely provided by nurse practitioners, midwives and physician assistants, would dramatically expand access to abortion. But that didn\u2019t happen; approval of mifepristone came with tight restrictions on how it can be distributed \u2014 only in clinics, medical offices and hospitals; only by, or under the supervision of, a doctor certified to prescribe the drug; and only to patients who have signed an F.D.A.-approved patient agreement.", "The F.D.A. warns against purchasing the drugs from online vendors, but women in the United States are doing it anyway. Increasingly, advocates of access to the drugs say, women are turning to the internet to procure the pills for use in their homes. Ms. Coeytaux and her colleague, Elisa Wells, who lives in Portland, Ore., were curious: Who are these vendors? Will they steal your credit card information? Will the pills get held up in customs?

But they have heard of the morning-after pill, or Plan B, a form of emergency contraception made available over the counter in 2013.

They also campaigned to make the pills available over the counter. With Donald Trump as president, that goal now seems remote. Just last month, the Senate rolled back an Obama administration rule barring states from denying family-planning grants to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. And Republican-controlled state legislatures continue to propose legal restrictions on abortion, having already passed more than 300 since 2011.", "Those restrictions have forced clinics across the country to close their doors, curbing access to facility-based procedures, especially for lower-income women.

Alarmed by the trends, some have warned of a return to the era before Roe v. Wade, when women were forced to risk their lives with coat hangers. And indeed, in September 2015, a woman in Tennessee was charged with attempted murder for using a hanger to try to abort her 24-week-old fetus.", "The reality, however, is that increasingly, self-induced abortion in the United States means using pills procured through the mail, much as it is in many other countries. Women on Web, a Netherlands-based nonprofit collective that pioneered the practice of putting the pills directly into women\u2019s hands, has provided abortion medications to more than 50,000 women in 130 countries.

They seem to want to understand how it works and to assess whether we\u2019re reliable.\u201d", "\u201cThe fact is, women in the U.S. are already doing this, and the reproductive health community needs to catch up,\u201d Ms. Wells said. \u201cWe started Plan C because we believe it\u2019s time for bold action. We have to make sure women have the information they need, that they know their rights\u201d \u2014 for example, that they are not obligated to report to the police or providers that they have taken abortion pills; that the drugs can\u2019t be detected in their blood; and that knowing that a woman has used the pills has no bearing on follow-up care, which is the same as for a natural miscarriage.", "The risks of self-induced abortion today are primarily legal. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered 40 different kinds of laws that are potentially implicated when someone ends their own pregnancy,\u201d said Jill E. Adams, chief strategist of the Self-Induced Abortion Legal Team, a nonprofit consortium formed in 2015 to support advocates who legally share information on self-induced abortion and to halt its criminalization. So far, she said, the S.I.A. team has identified 18 arrests related to self-induced abortion around the country, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s just what made the news. I suspect the true number is significantly higher.\u201d", "Reflecting on the case of Purvi Patel, an Indiana woman sentenced to 20 years in prison on the seemingly incompatible convictions of felony feticide and child neglect, Ms. Adams said overzealous prosecutors have become creative in applying laws \u201cthat were never meant to concern self-induced abortion.\u201d", "Plan C does not advise women where they can get the pills, and Ms. Coeytaux and Ms. Wells acknowledge that no matter how authentic the pills may appear, a woman can\u2019t immediately determine their quality or whether they are counterfeit. But they say that when skeptics warn women off by claiming that the pills could be harmful, as Planned Parenthood suggests on a website directing women to its own treatment centers, they are overstating the risks. \u201cIf they\u2019re not real pills, they would have no harmful effect except to delay access to treatment from another source,\u201d Ms. Wells said. Of course, any form of treatment can involve potential risk, and it is up to the patient to decide what is right for her.", "In describing their own experiences, both said the sites offering pills did look sketchy. \u201cI was looking around one and then went out for a jog,\u201d Ms. Coeytaux said. \u201cBy the time I got back, the site was gone. But then a couple days later it was back up.\u201d Some sites accepted credit cards; others required a bank transfer. Ms. Wells posed as a teenager and tried to imagine how frightening it would be if she were 17. When it appeared that a package was stuck in customs in New York, Ms. Wells emailed the vendor.", "\u201cAnd they replied every time,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, the other day, I checked that inbox, and he had sent me a message: \u2018How are you? How is your health?\u2019 \u201d Still, when the pills come, she said, there are no instructions or labeling \u2014 \u201cjust the blister pack in an envelope.\u201d", "Ms. Coeytaux and Ms. Wells hope that by sharing their experiences on the Plan C site, they can help women navigate the unknown. They acknowledge that there will always be women who prefer to see a provider and say that all women should have access to one. But in drawing attention to an option that isn\u2019t strictly legal, they have touched on tensions at the heart of an abortion rights movement increasingly rived by what some say are competing aims.", "\u201cFor so long, the whole objective was to make abortion a legitimate health care service, to bring it out of the shadows and remove the stigma,\u201d said Joanna Erdman, assistant professor at Dalhousie University\u2019s Schulich School of Law in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who is working on a book about the abortion clinic. \u201cSo this effort to remedy a crisis of access by making the \u2018back street\u2019 safer \u2014 it\u2019s very counterintuitive for a lot of older figures in the movement. They get very nervous about the idea of leaving women to their own devices.\u201d", "As Ms. Erdman sees it, Plan C is not just health advocacy; it\u2019s a form of political resistance, part of a larger struggle for the right of access to \u201cinformation instrumental to women\u2019s self-determination.\u201d Underlying it, she said, is the same feminist ideology of \u201cself-help\u201d that guided the many safe-abortion initiatives before it, including, most notably, the Abortion Counseling Service of Women\u2019s Liberation, or Jane.", "Ms. Coeytaux counts those groups as inspiration for Plan C, along with Lorraine Rothman, a founder of the feminist Self-Help Clinic movement and inventor of the Del-Em menstrual extraction kit, which she designed for self-use.", "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the humiliation of trying to persuade the powers that be to legalize abortion,\u201d Ms. Rothman, who died in 2007, told an interviewer. \u201cLet\u2019s just take back the technology, the tools, the skills, and the information to perform early abortions and be in charge of our own reproduction.\u201d", "Decades later, the tools have changed.

Nearly every year \u2014 at least until recently \u2014 more and more people paid American Express up to $7,500 for the privilege of carrying cards that are very similar to the ones Visa and MasterCard give away free.", "But in the last few years, Amex\u2019s hold on our affluent fantasies has started to wobble. Last year, for instance, the number of American Express cards in use declined by almost 18 percent, according to industry analysts. Amex\u2019s 2016 revenue was down more than $2 billion from two years before. And the company\u2019s relationships with Costco and JetBlue \u2014 long big sources of new cardholders \u2014 summarily ended when those firms found alternative credit card partners.", "One of the big reasons for those stumbles is that other financial companies, most notably Chase and Citibank, have started beating Amex at its own game, often by hiring the same executives who built Amex. The head of Citibank\u2019s credit card division as well as the heads of its branded cards, global rewards, customer acquisition, proprietary products and analytics all came from American Express. The woman credited with creating Chase\u2019s Sapphire Reserve is an Amex alum, as are her boss and two top colleagues.", "But there is also the problem of simple demographics. Amex, like all credit card companies, desperately needs new customers each year, preferably ones with decades of spending ahead of them. Hence the focus on millennials.", "\u201cTraditionally, American Express succeeds because of its customer service,\u201d said David Robertson, publisher of the industry newsletter The Nilson Report. \u201cThey can book travel for you, they have concierges to recommend the best restaurants. If you leave your reading glasses inside a hotel room in Budapest, Amex will get them mailed back to you. No one else does that.\u201d", "Millennials, however, don\u2019t really need travel agents or concierges: They have Priceline and Yelp. Nor are they traditionally fans of opera, ballet, Dom P\u00e9rignon tastings, or the other high-culture events Amex can get cardholders into. If you leave your reading glasses in Budapest, it\u2019s probably faster to order new ones from Warby Parker, which is pretty cheap to begin with.", "This is the real reason Amex\u2019s executives became so worried when they heard about the dinner, one of multiple held by Chase, when a cardholder said his Sapphire card made him more interesting. American Express, for decades, has essentially sold snob appeal. But for millennials, snobbery isn\u2019t quite as appealing as it once was. Or, more precisely, snobbery has to be hidden and camouflaged as something else, like an Instagram post from your Iceland spelunking adventure or a lament about how hard it is to find a charging station near Burning Man for your electric sports car.", "The Chase Sapphire Reserve \u2014 which in the seven months since it was released has signed up more than a million cardholders, half of whom are under 35 \u2014 is all about emphasizing what cardholders can do, rather than what they can buy.", "\u201cThe message we send is, this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s credit card,\u201d said Pam Codispoti, who created the Chase Sapphire Reserve after 18 years at Amex. \u201cFor millennials, travel might mean taking an Uber to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Chinatown, and then riding the subway to karaoke, and then catching a taxi home. So we\u2019re going to give you accelerated travel points on all that. This is a card for accumulating experiences.\u201d", "Amex, it should be noted, is fighting back valiantly. The company has increased sign-up bonuses and spending rewards, and now gives cardholders an annual $200 credit with Uber. The firm is quick to note that more than a third of its new cardholders last year were millennials. Soon, the Amex Platinum will look sleeker, less flashy. Amex\u2019s commercials, which once featured businessmen (but no businesswomen) rushing from the boardroom to a first-class flight, now present Tina Fey teaching viewers how to meet their boyfriend\u2019s parents.", "But it\u2019s an uphill battle for Amex, in part because the company is fighting an image of conspicuous consumption it has cultivated for decades. Amex sold a dream about what success looks like, a universe where handsome men and glittering women murmur about second homes over decanters filled with expensive booze. The company declined to put executives on the phone for this column, but it did send an email explaining that cardholder benefits included \u201cpremium access to the Grand Prix de Monaco, a wine enthusiast\u2019s dream trip through French wine country and a global fashion tour with Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u201d \u2014 not exactly the hipster\u2019s bucket list.", "The other challenge is that many people who work at American Express aren\u2019t all that millennially minded themselves. If you visit Amex\u2019s headquarters in Lower Manhattan, you\u2019ll find squared-jawed men in bespoke suits and fashion model-glamorous women, but not a lot of young people in the uppermost ranks. The company\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, has led Amex for almost 16 years, an eternity in corporate America. In one Amex brainstorming session, according to an executive I spoke with, participants spent 10 minutes trying to figure out what FOMO meant before turning to Google.", "They discovered it stands for \u201cfear of missing out.\u201d It is unclear if the group recognized the irony.", "That said, there\u2019s every reason to believe that American Express will eventually solve this puzzle. Amex, it should be remembered, created a world where leaving your glasses in a Budapest hotel seems like a realistic concern \u2014 even to its many customers (myself among them) who have trouble finding Budapest on a map. A few years from now, who is to say that your Amex won\u2019t get you into a foam party at the Electric Daisy Carnival as easily as a cocktail party at the Met?", "And until then, the real winner of all these battles is the cardholders. The long dark winter of the financial crisis hangover is, finally, being made glorious summer by the tussles between Amex and its competitors. You might think millennials are spiritually poorer for substituting the dream of the Grand Prix de Monaco with the reality of a subway ride to the karaoke bar. But, don\u2019t feel too bad for them.", "In the meantime, they \u2014 and, by extension, all of us \u2014 are almost getting paid to spend."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/nyregion/facebook-bulk-search-warrants-new-york-state.html": ["New York State\u2019s highest court dealt a blow to Facebook and other social media companies seeking to expand privacy protections, ruling on Tuesday that Facebook had no right to ask an appellate court to quash search warrants ordering the company to hand over information from hundreds of accounts in a disability fraud case.", "The state Court of Appeals, in a 5-to-1 decision, with one judge recusing himself, upheld lower court rulings that New York law does not allow a social media company to appeal a judge\u2019s decision to issue search warrants in a criminal case, even if the company believes those warrants violate the constitutional rights of its users.", "The Facebook case is part of a broader battle between the government and technology companies over the limits on law enforcement requests for data under the federal Stored Communications Act.

The club had its heyday in the 1960s, when it produced a string of talented young players. It was in the era before the transfer market took off, when commercialism had yet to take hold in the game. In 1964, the club\u2019s manager, Ron Greenwood, had wrapped the F.A. Cup trophy in cloth and taken it home on a London Tube train after the Hammers had beaten Preston North End in the final. Two years later, three members of his team \u2014 Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters \u2014 helped England win the World Cup, snapping the dominance of Pel\u00e9 and Brazil.", "However, West Ham had dropped out of the Premier League in 2003, the same year that Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea and \u2014 although it returned two years later and continued to produce talented players \u2014 it did not have the financial clout to compete with the biggest English clubs. Its latest generation of talented players \u2014 such as Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole \u2014 had one by one left for bigger-spending clubs. The club\u2019s song, \u201cI\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles,\u201d featuring the line \u201cfortune\u2019s always hiding,\u201d was now more apt than ever.", "Scudamore\u2019s car made its way down Green Street, where pie-and-mash restaurants stand next to shops selling Indian saris and samosas. Scudamore darted out of the car and strode into the club\u2019s offices to be welcomed by the team\u2019s managing director, Paul Aldridge, who apologized for the absence of the owner, Terry Brown. Scudamore wasted no time, getting straight to the point of his visit. \u201cThese players, what\u2019s the story? How have they got here?\u201d he snapped.", "A few days earlier, in late August 2006, the Argentine stars Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano had themselves arrived at West Ham. Flanking Alan Pardew, the team\u2019s manager, Tevez and Mascherano held up claret-and-blue shirts and smiled for the news media. How on earth had this struggling Premier League team managed to sign two of the world\u2019s most sought-after players? The story has its roots in South America, but was also tied to the riches that accompanied the breakup of the Soviet Union and to an Israeli dealmaker called Pini Zahavi, who was never far away from soccer\u2019s biggest transfers.", "Scudamore was already aware of wealthy individuals buying the transfer rights of players as early as 2000, a year after he took the job at the Premier League. Zahavi had told him all about it.", "Zahavi was suave and smooth-talking, and had parlayed a career as a soccer journalist in Israel into being a transfer broker. His first deal, while still working as a reporter, had been to take Avi Cohen to Liverpool from Maccabi Tel Aviv in 1979. After 20 years as an agent, he had turned his attention to acting as a dealmaker to help a small group of wealthy individuals, some of them from the former Soviet Union, to invest in the transfer market. He called the business Soccer Investments & Representations.", "Zahavi\u2019s office was on a tree-lined boulevard near the Mediterranean Sea in Tel Aviv, but he spent much of his working life in five-star hotels across the globe or in his apartment in London\u2019s Marble Arch. He had learned how this South American business model worked from his partners in Argentina: Fernando Hidalgo and Gustavo Arribas. Together they had founded the HAZ agency, which took its name from the first letters of their surnames and used a series of companies domiciled in Gibraltar, Luxembourg and Malta to buy and sell transfer rights. The business was so successful that the three men set up their own motor-racing team in 2006, and even considered entering the Nascar series before one of their drivers died in a 120 m.p.h. crash at the Aut\u00f3dromo Juan Manuel Fangio on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The sudden and shocking death had ended their appetite to pursue the racing adventure.", "Zahavi was well known in the Premier League\u2019s offices in London. At Christmas he would send a box of oranges to Scudamore from back home. Over a cup of tea one day, Zahavi told Scudamore that he was moving into owning transfer rights. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not an agent anymore. I own players. I actually own them,\u2019\u201d Scudamore recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s the future.\u201d", "In 2001, Zahavi had helped Gustavo Mascardi, the first registered FIFA agent in Argentina, earn as much as half of the $12 million transfer fee Aston Villa paid River Plate for the Colombian striker Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel. Mascardi owned 50 percent of \u00c1ngel\u2019s transfer rights through a company called Siglo XXI (21st Century). Aston Villa almost pulled out of the deal at the last minute after hearing of the unorthodox arrangement, but in the end the signing went ahead.", "In the spring of 2003, Zahavi was introduced by another soccer agent, Jonathan Barnett, to Chelsea\u2019s chief executive, Trevor Birch, at Les Ambassadeurs, a private club in London\u2019s Mayfair, in a move that would help Zahavi \u2014 with his contacts in the former Soviet Union \u2014 become a broker in the takeover of the then struggling club.", "While Zahavi and Barnett loved the high life, fine clothes and trappings of success \u2014 like Les Ambassadeurs, which served French Champagne, Belgian chocolates and Cuban cigars \u2014 Birch was a more low-key character. He had a first-class degree in accounting from Liverpool Polytechnic and specialized in corporate restructuring. He was an employee of Ken Bates, a gruff Londoner who had bought Chelsea for 1 pound in 1982.", "Birch had briefed Zahavi on Chelsea\u2019s financial woes, how it could barely pay the players\u2019 salaries and how Bates wanted to sell up. Zahavi relayed the information to Abramovich. A few weeks later the Russian billionaire, dressed in jeans and accompanied by a Citibank banker and a lawyer from Skadden Arps, came to meet Birch in one of the executive boxes overlooking the pitch at Stamford Bridge stadium. The rendezvous lasted less than an hour and ended with an outline for a deal, which was agreed on a handshake.", "Chelsea\u2019s executives were stunned by how fast the Russian was moving. They did a Google search on his name but little came up. Still, he seemed to be bona fide and his advisers clearly worked for serious organizations. Three weeks later, on July 1, 2003, contracts were signed and Abramovich became the first Russian owner of a Premier League club.", "Three years later, two more oligarchs who had been close to Abramovich became involved in the Premier League via a different route. Boris Berezovsky and Arkady Patarkatsishvili took control of the transfer rights of Tevez and Mascherano through a series of offshore companies, and their aides arranged for the Argentines to join West Ham.", "According to The Observer newspaper, which secured a rare interview with Zahavi that year, he acted as an adviser to West Ham in the deal just as he had done for Abramovich in his acquisition of Chelsea.", "Berezovsky, a mathematician, had built his fortune after the fall of the Soviet Union by investing in Lada cars and Aeroflot planes. After surviving a car bomb that decapitated his driver, he masterminded Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s rise to the presidency in 2000. But once Putin was in power, he vowed to get rid of the oligarchs for meddling in politics, forcing Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili to flee to Britain with their fortunes.", "Initially, the exiled oligarchs\u2019 link to the two Argentine players was not known. West Ham did not disclose the terms of the agreement, instead employing the clich\u00e9d patter of English soccer. The Hammers said that Tevez and Mascherano had \u201cput pen to paper\u201d on permanent contracts and that all other details would remain confidential.", "However, there was more going on behind the scenes. A couple of days earlier, West Ham\u2019s legal and commercial director, Scott Duxbury, had called the Premier League\u2019s secretary, Jane Purdon, to make an inquiry about the possibility of signing two players whose transfer rights were owned by offshore companies. The companies, Duxbury said, wanted the players to join West Ham free of charge should the club agree to allow them freedom to move them on. Purdon said the arrangement would breach league rules that forbade any third party having influence over the buying or selling of players. She advised Duxbury against the transaction.", "The next day, Purdon spoke to him again and asked if there were any third parties involved in the signings. Duxbury ducked that question, according to Purdon\u2019s comments in the minutes of a Premier League hearing. \u201cHe did not say yes, he did not say no,\u201d Purdon recalled. \u201cHe merely replied that all documents required for registration had been provided. In doing so, he was in the belief that no rule had been broken.\u201d", "When Scudamore personally went to West Ham to hear the club\u2019s version of events, Aldridge sought to calm him. He said there was nothing untoward. Investors were going to buy the club and therefore they were just placing these players there in anticipation of the sale.", "Scudamore, whose organization had no power to raid the club\u2019s files, went back to the Premier League\u2019s office and fumed. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve worked with these people for so long, when you\u2019ve looked them in the eye and asked them a direct question, you get a direct answer,\u201d Scudamore said. \u201cThere\u2019s really not a lot more you can do.\u201d", "If the oligarchs had been passive investors in the two players, West Ham would have complied with the rules, but it would become clear that they had complete control over the next transfer of the Argentines. According to Premier League rules, that was not allowed. Third parties could not acquire the right to \u201cinfluence\u201d the policies or performance of teams.", "The companies in the British Virgin Islands that controlled where the Argentines played next were owned by Patarkatsishvili, although Berezovsky said they were a joint venture with him under a series of gentlemen\u2019s agreements they had embarked on together. They had previously held stakes in a Russian car dealership, the oil company Sibneft and the Kommersant newspaper.", "The two men now lived in exile in mansions a 20-minute drive from each other in the Surrey commuter belt west of London. Berezovsky lived in Ascot, in an ivy-clad home with its own lake and manicured lawn. Patarkatsishvili, who had a distinctive white handlebar mustache, resided in an even grander pile with chandeliers, gold fittings and ornate sculptures.", "Under the deal that the two oligarchs had financed, West Ham would be a temporary home for Tevez. The club, which was founded by workers from a shipyard at the end of the 19th century, would get \u00a32 million, about $4 million at the time, should he be transferred in the January transfer window. After that, the compensation would fall to \u00a3100,000. West Ham would get \u00a3150,000 on the transfer of Mascherano.", "Patarkatsishvili had appointed Kia Joorabchian, a young businessman to head up their soccer operation. Joorabchian was raised in Britain and had helped his Iranian father run car dealerships in Essex and Kent. In what Time magazine called a \u201csurreal\u201d sale, the businessman in his early 30s was part of an offshore group that battled with Berezovsky for control of Kommersant. According to Joorabchian\u2019s version of events, he sued the oligarch over the sale before they agreed to settle out of court. \u201cThat\u2019s how I met Boris Berezovsky,\u201d he said.", "Joorabchian then moved to S\u00e3o Paulo to manage Corinthians, one of Brazil\u2019s biggest soccer clubs, on behalf of the oligarchs. Patarkatsishvili\u2019s London-based Media Sports Investments had agreed to pay $35 million to take control of the team for 10 years in return for a share of the team\u2019s profits from marketing and buying and selling players. As part of the deal, Media Sports Investments would get 51 percent of the net profit from television revenue, sponsorships and ticket sales, and 80 percent of transfer fees. Joorabchian hired Tevez from Boca Juniors and Mascherano from River Plate.", "Tevez\u2019s arrival thrilled Corinthians fans, who were surprised that such a big-name player had arrived on their doorstep. At $16 million he was the most expensive player ever signed by a Brazilian club. He delighted them with a never-say-die attitude that yielded 46 goals in 78 games. Tevez would celebrate each goal enthusiastically, at one point pulling a pacifier from his sock and sucking on it to mark the birth of his child.", "Using the wealth of the oligarchs, Corinthians went shopping in European soccer and added other prominent players to its squad, including Nilmar from Lyon, Gustavo Nery from Werder Bremen and Carlos Alberto Gomes de J\u00e9sus from Porto. The team swept to the Brazilian league title.", "With Tevez\u2019s form pushing up his market price and triggering interest from clubs abroad, Joorabchian\u2019s job was to extract the highest possible fee for the investment fund\u2019s biggest asset. He announced that the striker would leave Corinthians only if another team paid the release clause in his contract of between \u00a369 million and \u00a383 million. Even the lowest amount would have been a world record transfer fee. There was no suitor willing to hand over such an enormous sum, and so he ended up at West Ham.", "The memory of the Tevez and Mascherano affair remains painful for Scudamore a decade later. \u201cI can give you dates, I can give you times,\u201d Scudamore said, sitting at a table in his glass office that looks out at the Premier League\u2019s headquarters in a smart townhouse in London\u2019s West End. The office, with a small plaque next to the black front door, could pass for that of a law firm or accounting practice.", "In Scudamore\u2019s opinion, West Ham executives broke the rules because they were blinded by the possibility of deep-pocketed owners buying the club. \u201cWhat was more tantalizing was the acquisition of the club\u201d as opposed to the Argentine stars, Scudamore said. West Ham officials were probably \u201cjust so wrapped up in the idea of new owners, and becoming key in the new ownership structure.\u201d", "In the end, neither Patarkatsishvili nor Berezovsky bought West Ham. A few weeks later, Brown, the club\u2019s owner, sold his majority stake to a group from Iceland. Mascherano was traded to Liverpool, earning the oligarchs \u00a318 million. A Premier League panel then issued West Ham with a record fine of \u00a35.5 million, though it stopped short of handing down a points deduction.", "To Scudamore\u2019s horror, the fallout continued. As the season reached its climax, Tevez found his form to boost West Ham\u2019s battle to avoid relegation. He scored seven goals in the last 10 games of the season, including the only one in a 1-0 win on the last day of the season at Manchester United, which kept West Ham in the top division. Tevez\u2019s goal meant that Sheffield United was relegated instead, and its coach, Neil Warnock, raged that Scudamore should be fired.", "That single goal by Tevez made the affair \u201cseismic rather than containable,\u201d Scudamore said. Sheffield United immediately challenged the Premier League\u2019s decision not to dock points from West Ham.", "As the scandal was unfurling, Berezovsky was wrestling with dark thoughts at his home in London\u2019s commuter belt. He was feeling glum about how he had to flee Russia and how he had fallen out with Abramovich, who he felt had forced him into selling Sibneft, his oil company, below the market price. While the Chelsea owner had left Russia on a high, the former mathematician was pushed out of his country against his will. Now Abramovich, a high school dropout, was the 15th wealthiest person in the world \u2014 worth $24 billion according to Forbes magazine \u2014 and had just led Chelsea to its first English league title in half a century, endearing himself to fans. Berezovsky was at 897th on the rich list, with $1.3 billion.", "Berezovsky could console himself that he was on course to make more money from soccer. Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea had not posted a profit in each of the five years since he took charge. The London club was hemorrhaging money in the race to win trophies: In the year ending June 2007 alone, Abramovich had to soak up its loss of \u00a375 million.", "Berezovzky\u2019s bet with Patarkatsishvili to buy Brazil\u2019s Corinthians was much cheaper and, despite the Premier League hullabaloo with the Tevez affair, they were now on course to turn a handsome profit by trading him for many times the $16 million they paid for him."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/marissa-mayer-will-make-186-million-on-yahoos-sale-to-verizon.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Yahoo shareholders will vote June 8 on whether to sell the company\u2019s internet businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion.

The Frank Gehry-designed building has a pristine nine-acre rooftop garden, yet much of the interior \u2014 a meandering open-plan hallway \u2014 appears unfinished. There are exposed air ducts and I-beams scribbled with contractors\u2019 marks. Many of the internal walls are unpainted plywood. The space looks less like the headquarters of one of the world\u2019s wealthiest companies and more like a Chipotle with standing desks. It\u2019s an aesthetic meant to reflect \u2014 and perhaps also inspire employee allegiance to \u2014 one of Facebook\u2019s founding ideologies: that things are never quite finished, that nothing is permanent, that you should always look for a chance to take an ax to your surroundings.", "The mood in overwhelmingly liberal Silicon Valley at the time, days before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, was grim. But Zuckerberg, who had recently returned from his 700-acre estate on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, is preternaturally unable to look anything other than excited about the future. \u201cHey, guys!\u201d he beamed, greeting me and Mike Isaac, a Times colleague who covers Facebook. Zuckerberg wore a short-sleeve gray T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, which is his Steve Jobsian daily uniform: Indoor Zuck.", "Zuckerberg used to be a nervous speaker, but he has become much less so. He speaks quickly but often unloads full paragraphs of thought, and sometimes his arguments are so polished that they sound rehearsed, which happened often that morning. \u201c2016 was an interesting year for us,\u201d he said as the three of us, plus a P.R. executive, sat around a couple of couches in the glass-walled conference room where he conducts many of his meetings. (There are many perks to working at Facebook, but no one, not even Zuckerberg, has a private office.) It was an understatement and a nod to the obvious: Facebook, once a mere app on your phone, had become a global political and cultural force, and the full implications of that transformation had begun to come into view last year. \u201cIf you look at the history of Facebook, when we started off, there really wasn\u2019t news as part of it,\u201d Zuckerberg went on. But as Facebook grew and became a bigger part of how people learn about the world, the company had been slow to adjust to its new place in people\u2019s lives. The events of 2016, he said, \u201cset off a number of conversations that we\u2019re still in the middle of.\u201d", "Nearly two billion people use Facebook every month, about 1.2 billion of them daily. The company, which Zuckerberg co-founded in his Harvard dorm room 13 years ago, has become the largest and most influential entity in the news business, commanding an audience greater than that of any American or European television news network, any newspaper or magazine in the Western world and any online news outlet. It is also the most powerful mobilizing force in politics, and it is fast replacing television as the most consequential entertainment medium. Just five years after its initial public offering, Facebook is one of the 10 highest market-capitalized public companies in the world.", "As recently as a year ago, Zuckerberg might have proudly rattled off these facts as a testament to Facebook\u2019s power. But over the course of 2016, Facebook\u2019s gargantuan influence became its biggest liability. During the U.S. election, propagandists \u2014 some working for money, others for potentially state-sponsored lulz \u2014 used the service to turn fake stories into viral sensations, like the one about Pope Francis\u2019 endorsing Trump (he hadn\u2019t). And fake news was only part of a larger conundrum. With its huge reach, Facebook has begun to act as the great disseminator of the larger cloud of misinformation and half-truths swirling about the rest of media. It sucks up lies from cable news and Twitter, then precisely targets each lie to the partisan bubble most receptive to it.", "After studying how people shared 1.25 million stories during the campaign, a team of researchers at M.I.T. and Harvard implicated Facebook and Twitter in the larger failure of media in 2016. The researchers found that social media created a right-wing echo chamber: a \u201cmedia network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a hyperpartisan perspective to the world.\u201d The findings partially echoed a long-held worry about social news: that people would use sites like Facebook to cocoon themselves into self-reinforcing bubbles of confirmatory ideas, to the detriment of civility and a shared factual basis from which to make collective, democratic decisions. A week and a half after the election, President Obama bemoaned \u201can age where there\u2019s so much active misinformation and it\u2019s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television.\u201d", "After the election, Zuckerberg offered a few pat defenses of Facebook\u2019s role. \u201cI\u2019m actually quite proud of the impact that we were able to have on civic discourse over all,\u201d he said when we spoke in January. Misinformation on Facebook was not as big a problem as some believed it was, but Facebook nevertheless would do more to battle it, he pledged. Echo chambers were a concern, but if the source was people\u2019s own confirmation bias, was it really Facebook\u2019s problem to solve?", "It was hard to tell how seriously Zuckerberg took the criticisms of his service and its increasingly paradoxical role in the world. He had spent much of his life building a magnificent machine to bring people together. By the most literal measures, he\u2019d succeeded spectacularly, but what had that connection wrought? Across the globe, Facebook now seems to benefit actors who want to undermine the global vision at its foundation. Supporters of Trump and the European right-wing nationalists who aim to turn their nations inward and dissolve alliances, trolls sowing cross-border paranoia, even ISIS with its skillful social-media recruiting and propagandizing \u2014 all of them have sought in their own ways to split the Zuckerbergian world apart. And they are using his own machine to do it.", "In Silicon Valley, current events tend to fade into the background. The Sept. 11 attacks, the Iraq war, the financial crisis and every recent presidential election occurred, for the tech industry, on some parallel but distant timeline divorced from the everyday business of digitizing the world. Then Donald Trump won. In the 17 years I\u2019ve spent covering Silicon Valley, I\u2019ve never seen anything shake the place like his victory. In the span of a few months, the Valley has been transformed from a politically disengaged company town into a center of anti-Trump resistance and fear. A week after the election, one start-up founder sent me a private message on Twitter: \u201cI think it\u2019s worse than I thought,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOriginally I thought 18 months. I\u2019ve cut that in half.\u201d Until what? \u201cApocalypse. End of the world.\u201d", "Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric felt particularly personal for an industry with a proud reliance upon immigrants. Stephen K.

More than 15 percent of Facebook\u2019s employees are in the United States on H-1B visas, a program that Trump has pledged to revamp. But the outcome also revealed the depth of the Valley\u2019s disconnection with much of the rest of the country. \u201cI saw an election that was just different from the way I think,\u201d says Joshua Reeves, a Bay Area native who is a co-founder of Gusto, a human-resources software start-up. \u201cI have this engineering brain that wants to go to this analytical, rational, nonemotional way of looking at things, and it was clear in this election that we\u2019re trending in a different direction, toward spirited populism.\u201d", "Underneath it all was a nagging feeling of complicity. Trump had benefited from a media environment that is now shaped by Facebook \u2014 and, more to the point, shaped by a single Facebook feature, the same one to which the company owes its remarkable ascent to social-media hegemony: the computationally determined list of updates you see every time you open the app. The list has a formal name, News Feed. But most users are apt to think of it as Facebook itself.", "If it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that News Feed has become the most influential source of information in the history of civilization, it is only slightly so. Facebook created News Feed in 2006 to solve a problem: In the social-media age, people suddenly had too many friends to keep up with. At the time, Facebook was just a collection of profiles, lacking any kind of central organization. To figure out what any of your connections were up to, you had to visit each of their profiles to see if anything had changed. News Feed fixed that. Every time you open Facebook, it hunts through the network, collecting every post from every connection \u2014 information that, for most Facebook users, would be too overwhelming to process themselves. Then it weighs the merits of each post before presenting you with a feed sorted in order of importance: a hyperpersonalized front page designed just for you.", "Scholars and critics have been warning of the solipsistic irresistibility of algorithmic news at least since 2001, when the constitutional-law professor Cass R. Sunstein warned, in his book \u201cRepublic.com,\u201d of the urgent risks posed to democracy \u201cby any situation in which thousands or perhaps millions or even tens of millions of people are mainly listening to louder echoes of their own voices.\u201d (In 2008, I piled on with my own book, \u201cTrue Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society.\u201d) In 2011, the digital activist and entrepreneur Eli Pariser, looking at similar issues, gave this phenomenon a memorable name in the title of his own book: \u201cThe Filter Bubble.\u201d", "Facebook says its own researchers have been studying the filter bubble since 2010. In 2015, they published an in-house study, which was criticized by independent researchers, concluding that Facebook\u2019s effect on the diversity of people\u2019s information diet was minimal. News Feed\u2019s personalization algorithm did filter out some opposing views in your feed, the study claimed, but the bigger effect was users\u2019 own choices. When News Feed did show people views contrary to their own, they tended not to click on the stories. For Zuckerberg, the finding let Facebook off the hook. \u201cIt\u2019s a good-sounding theory, and I can get why people repeat it, but it\u2019s not true,\u201d he said on a call with analysts last summer.", "Employees got the same message. \u201cWhen Facebook cares about something, they spin up teams to address it, and Zuck will come out and talk about it all the time,\u201d one former executive told me. \u201cI have never heard of anything close to that on the filter bubble. I never sensed that this was a problem he wanted us to tackle. It was always positioned as an interesting intellectual question but not something that we\u2019re going to go focus on.\u201d", "Then, last year, Facebook\u2019s domination of the news became a story itself. In May, Gizmodo reported that some editors who had worked on Facebook\u2019s Trending Topics section had been suppressing conservative points of view. To smooth things over, Zuckerberg convened a meeting of conservative media figures and eventually significantly reduced the role of human editors. Then in September, Facebook deleted a post by a Norwegian writer that included the photojournalist Nick Ut\u2019s iconic photo of a naked 9-year-old girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, running in terror after a napalm attack during the Vietnam War, on the grounds that it ran afoul of Facebook\u2019s prohibition of child nudity.", "Facebook, under criticism, reinstated the picture, but the photo incident stuck with Zuckerberg. He would bring it up unbidden to staff members and to reporters. It highlighted, for him, the difficulty of building a policy framework for what Facebook was trying to do. Zuckerberg wanted to become a global news distributor that is run by machines, rather than by humans who would try to look at every last bit of content and exercise considered judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think we\u2019re still figuring out,\u201d he told me in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do here than what we\u2019ve done. And I think we\u2019re starting to realize this now as well.\u201d", "It struck me as an unsatisfying answer, and it later became apparent that Zuckerberg seemed to feel the same way. On a Sunday morning about a month after the first meeting, I got a call from a Facebook spokesman. Zuckerberg wanted to chat again. Could Mike and I come back on Monday afternoon?", "We met again in the same conference room. Same Zuck outfit, same P.R. executive. But the Zuckerberg who greeted us seemed markedly different. He was less certain in his pronouncements than he had been the month before, more expansive and questioning. Earlier that day, Zuckerberg\u2019s staff had sent me a draft of a 5,700-word manifesto that, I was told, he spent weeks writing. The document, \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d argued that until now, Facebook\u2019s corporate goal had merely been to connect people. But that was just Step 1. According to the manifesto, Facebook\u2019s \u201cnext focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community \u2014 for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all.\u201d If it was a nebulous crusade, it was also vast in its ambition.", "The last manifesto that Zuckerberg wrote was in 2012, as part of Facebook\u2019s application to sell its stock to the public. It explained Facebook\u2019s philosophy \u2014 what he called \u201cthe hacker way\u201d \u2014 and sketched an unorthodox path for the soon-to-be-public company. \u201cFacebook was not originally created to be a company,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was built to accomplish a social mission: to make the world more open and connected.\u201d", "What\u2019s striking about that 2012 letter, read through the prism of 2017, is its certainty that a more \u201copen and connected\u201d world is by definition a better one. \u201cWhen I started Facebook, the idea of connecting the world was not controversial,\u201d Zuckerberg said now. \u201cThe default assumption was that the world was incrementally just moving in that direction. So I thought we can connect some people and do our part in helping move in that direction.\u201d But now, he said, whether it was wise to connect the world was \u201cactually a real question.\u201d", "Zuckerberg\u2019s new manifesto never quite accepts blame for any of the global ills that have been laid at Facebook\u2019s feet. Yet by the standards of a company release, it is remarkable for the way it concedes that the company\u2019s chief goal \u2014 wiring the globe \u2014 is controversial. \u201cThere are questions about whether we can make a global community that works for everyone,\u201d Zuckerberg writes, \u201cand whether the path ahead is to connect more or reverse course.\u201d He also confesses misgivings about Facebook\u2019s role in the news. \u201cGiving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.\u201d", "At the time of our second interview, the manifesto was still only a draft, and I was surprised by how unsure Zuckerberg seemed about it in person. He had almost as many questions for us \u2014 about whether we understood what he was trying to say, how we thought it would land in the media \u2014 as we had for him. When I suggested that it might be perceived as an attack on Trump, he looked dismayed. He noted several times that he had been noodling over these ideas since long before November. A few weeks earlier, there was media speculation, fueled by a postelection tour of America by Zuckerberg and his wife, that he was laying the groundwork to run against Trump in 2020, and in this meeting he took pains to shoot down the rumors. When I asked if he had chatted with Obama about the former president\u2019s critique of Facebook, Zuckerberg paused for several seconds, nearly to the point of awkwardness, before answering that he had.", "Facebook\u2019s spokespeople later called to stress that Obama was only one of many people to whom he had spoken. In other words: Don\u2019t read this as a partisan anti-Trump manifesto. But if the company pursues the admittedly airy aims outlined in \u201cBuilding Global Community,\u201d the changes will echo across media and politics, and some are bound to be considered partisan. The risks are especially clear for changes aimed at adding layers of journalistic ethics across News Feed, which could transform the public\u2019s perception of Facebook, not to mention shake the foundations of its business.", "The Facebook app, and consequently News Feed, is run by one of Zuckerberg\u2019s most influential lieutenants, a 34-year-old named Chris Cox, the company\u2019s chief product officer. Ten years ago, Cox dropped out of a graduate program in computer science at Stanford to join Facebook. One of his first assignments was on the team that created News Feed. Since then, he has become an envoy to the media industry. Don Graham, the longtime publisher of The Washington Post who was for years a member of Facebook\u2019s board, told me that he felt Cox, among Facebook staff, \u201cwas at the 99.9th percentile of interest in news. He thought it was important to society, and he wanted Facebook to get it right.\u201d", "For the typical user, Cox explained when I met him on a morning in October at MPK20, News Feed is computing the relative merits of about 2,000 potential posts in your network every time you open the app. In sorting these posts, Facebook does not optimize for any single metric: not clicks or reading time or likes. Instead, he said, \u201cwhat you really want to get to is whether somebody, at the end of the day, would say, \u2018Hey, my experience today was meaningful.\u2019\u2009\u201d Personalizing News Feed, in other words, is a very big \u201cmath problem,\u201d incorporating countless metrics in extraordinarily complicated ways. Zuckerberg calls it \u201ca modern A.I. problem.\u201d", "Last summer, I sat in on two meetings in another glass-walled MPK20 conference room, in which News Feed\u2019s engineers, designers, user-research experts and managers debated several small alterations to how News Feed displays certain kinds of posts. The conversations were far from exciting \u2014 people in jeans on couches looking at PowerPoints, talking quietly about numbers \u2014 and yet I found them mesmerizing, a demonstration of the profound cultural differences between how news companies like The Times work and how Facebook does. The first surprise was how slowly things move, contrary to the freewheeling culture of \u201cthe hacker way.\u201d In one meeting, the team spent several minutes discussing the merits of bold text in a certain News Feed design. One blessing of making social software is that you can gauge any potential change to your product by seeing how your users react to it. That is also the curse: At Facebook, virtually every change to the app, no matter how small or obviously beneficial, is thoroughly tested on different segments of the audience before it\u2019s rolled out to everyone.", "The people who work on News Feed aren\u2019t making decisions that turn on fuzzy human ideas like ethics, judgment, intuition or seniority. They are concerned only with quantifiable outcomes about people\u2019s actions on the site. That data, at Facebook, is the only real truth. And it is a particular kind of truth: The News Feed team\u2019s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want \u2014 what they find \u201cmeaningful,\u201d to use Cox and Zuckerberg\u2019s preferred term \u2014 and to give them more of that.", "This ideal runs so deep that the people who make News Feed often have to put aside their own notions of what\u2019s best. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that our intuition can be wrong a fair amount of the time,\u201d John Hegeman, the vice president of product management and a News Feed team member, told me. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t expect will happen. And we learn a lot from that process: Why didn\u2019t that happen, and what might that mean?\u201d But it is precisely this ideal that conflicts with attempts to wrangle the feed in the way press critics have called for. The whole purpose of editorial guidelines and ethics is often to suppress individual instincts in favor of some larger social goal. Facebook finds it very hard to suppress anything that its users\u2019 actions say they want. In some cases, it has been easier for the company to seek out evidence that, in fact, users don\u2019t want these things at all.", "Facebook\u2019s two-year-long battle against \u201cclickbait\u201d is a telling example. Early this decade, the internet\u2019s headline writers discovered the power of stories that trick you into clicking on them, like those that teasingly withhold information from their headlines: \u201cDustin Hoffman Breaks Down Crying Explaining Something That Every Woman Sadly Already Experienced.\u201d By the fall of 2013, clickbait had overrun News Feed. Upworthy, a progressive activism site co-founded by Pariser, the author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble,\u201d that relied heavily on teasing headlines, was attracting 90 million readers a month to its feel-good viral posts.", "If a human editor ran News Feed, she would look at the clickbait scourge and make simple, intuitive fixes: Turn down the Upworthy knob. But Facebook approaches the feed as an engineering project rather than an editorial one. When it makes alterations in the code that powers News Feed, it\u2019s often only because it has found some clear signal in its data that users are demanding the change. In this sense, clickbait was a riddle. In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them? Was there something Facebook\u2019s algorithm was missing, some signal that would show that despite the clicks, clickbait was really sickening users?", "To answer these questions, Cox and his team hired survey panels of more than a thousand paid \u201cprofessional raters\u201d around the world who answer questions about how well News Feed is working. Starting in 2013, Facebook began adding first dozens and then hundreds and then thousands of data points that were meant to teach the artificial-intelligence system that runs News Feed how people were reacting to their feeds. Facebook noticed that people would sometimes click open a clickbaity story but spend very little time on it. In other cases, lots of people would click on a story but few would share or Like it. Headlines on stories that people seemed to reject often contained a set of signature phrases (\u201cyou\u2019ll never believe,\u201d \u201cthis one trick,\u201d etc.) or they came from a set of repeat-offender publishers.", "The more such signals Facebook incorporated into the feed, the more clickbait began to drop out of the feed. Since its 2013 peak, Upworthy\u2019s traffic has declined; it now averages 17.5 million visitors a month. The site has since disavowed clickbait. \u201cWe sort of unleashed a monster,\u201d Peter Koechley, Upworthy\u2019s co-founder, told a conference in 2015. \u201cSorry for that.\u201d", "Cox suggested that it was not exactly correct to say that Facebook, as a company, decided to fight clickbait. What actually happened was that Facebook found better ways to listen to users, who were themselves rejecting clickbait. \u201cThat comes out of good-quality panels and measurement systems, rather than an individual decision saying, \u2018Hey, I really want us to care about clickbait,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says.", "This approach \u2014 looking for signs of user dissatisfaction \u2014 could curb stories that constitute the most egregious examples of misinformation. Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s vice president in charge of News Feed, says that Facebook has begun testing an algorithm change that would look at whether people share an article after reading it. If few of the people who click on a story decide to share it, that might suggest people feel misled by it and it would get lower billing in the feed.", "But the solution to the broader misinformation dilemma \u2014 the pervasive climate of rumor, propaganda and conspiracy theories that Facebook has inadvertently incubated \u2014 may require something that Facebook has never done: ignoring the likes and dislikes of its users. Facebook believes the pope-endorses-Trump type of made-up news stories are only a tiny minority of pieces that appear in News Feed; they account for a fraction of 1 percent of the posts, according to Mosseri. The question the company faces now is whether the misinformation problem resembles clickbait at all, and whether its solutions will align as neatly with Facebook\u2019s worldview. Facebook\u2019s entire project, when it comes to news, rests on the assumption that people\u2019s individual preferences ultimately coincide with the public good, and that if it doesn\u2019t appear that way at first, you\u2019re not delving deeply enough into the data. By contrast, decades of social-science research shows that most of us simply prefer stuff that feels true to our worldview even if it isn\u2019t true at all and that the mining of all those preference signals is likely to lead us deeper into bubbles rather than out of them.", "After the election, Margaret Sullivan, the Washington Post columnist and a former public editor of The Times, called on Facebook to hire an executive editor who would monitor News Feed with an eye to fact-checking, balance and editorial integrity. Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed, told me that he wanted Facebook to use its data to create a kind of reputational score for online news, as well as explore ways of strengthening reporting through monetary partnerships.", "\u201cAt some point, if they really want to address this, they have to say, \u2018This is good information\u2019 and \u2018This is bad information,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Emily Bell, the director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018These are the kinds of information sources that we want to privilege, and these others are not going to be banned from the platform, but they are not going to thrive.\u2019 In other words, they have to create a hierarchy, and they\u2019re going to have to decide how they\u2019re going to transfer wealth into the publishing market.\u201d", "There aren\u2019t many technical reasons Facebook could not implement such plans. The hurdles are institutional and philosophical, and ultimately financial too. Late last year, Facebook outlined a modest effort to curb misinformation. News Feed would now carry warning labels: If a friend shares a viral story that has been flagged and shot down by one of Facebook\u2019s fact-checking partners (including Snopes and PolitiFact), you\u2019ll be cautioned that the piece has been \u201cdisputed.\u201d But even that slight change has been met with fury on the right, with Breitbart and The Daily Caller fuming that Facebook had teamed up with liberal hacks motivated by partisanship. If Facebook were to take more significant action, like hiring human editors, creating a reputational system or paying journalists, the company would instantly become something it has long resisted: a media company rather than a neutral tech platform.", "In many ways, the worry over how Facebook changes the news is really a manifestation of a grander problem with News Feed, which is simply dominance itself. News Feed\u2019s aggressive personalization wouldn\u2019t be much of an issue if it weren\u2019t crowding out every other source. \u201cTo some degree I feel like the Pottery Barn Rule applies,\u201d says Pariser, the Upworthy chief executive. \u201cThey play a critical role in our information circulatory system, and so \u2014 lucky them \u2014 all of the problems therein are significantly on their shoulders.\u201d", "During our first meeting in January, I posed this question to Zuckerberg: \u201cWhen you see various problems in the media, do you say to yourself, \u2018I run Facebook, I can solve that?\u2019\u2009\u201d", "\u201cUm,\u201d he started, and then paused, weighing his words as carefully as American presidents once did. \u201cNot usually.\u201d He argued that some of Facebook\u2019s critics\u2019 proposed fixes for news on the service, such as hiring editors, were impractical due to Facebook\u2019s scale and global diversity. Personalization, he said, remained a central tenet. \u201cIt really gets back to, like, what do people want at a deep level,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this oversimplified narrative that a company can get very successful by just scratching a very superficial itch, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s right over the long term.\u201d", "Yet by our second meeting, Zuckerberg\u2019s position seemed to have evolved. Facebook had by then announced plans for the Facebook Journalism Project, in which the company would collaborate with news companies on new products. Facebook also created a project to promote \u201cnews literacy\u201d among its users, and it hired the former CNN news anchor Campbell Brown to manage the partnership between it and news companies. Zuckerberg\u2019s tone toward critics of Facebook\u2019s approach to news had also grown far more conciliatory. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to get to the core of the actual problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI also really think that the core social thing that needs to happen is that a common understanding needs to exist. And misinformation I view as one of the things that can possibly erode common understanding. But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201d", "Still, in both our conversation and his new manifesto, Zuckerberg remained preoccupied with the kind of problems that could be solved by the kind of hyperconnectivity he believed in, not the ones caused by it. \u201cThere\u2019s a social infrastructure that needs to get built for modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving more people oriented not just toward short-term things but toward building the long-term social infrastructure that needs to get built across all these things in order to enable people to come together is going to be a really important thing over the next decades.\u201d By way of example, he pointed to Safety Check, Facebook\u2019s system for letting people tell their friends that they\u2019ve survived some kind of dangerous event, like a natural disaster or terrorist attack.", "\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world ... problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don\u2019t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have,\u201d Zuckerberg told me. What\u2019s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.", "This is not an especially controversial idea; Zuckerberg is arguing for a kind of digital-era version of the global institution-building that the Western world engaged in after World War II. But because he is a chief executive and not an elected president, there is something frightening about his project. He is positioning Facebook \u2014 and, considering that he commands absolute voting control of the company, he is positioning himself \u2014 as a critical enabler of the next generation of human society. A minor problem with his mission is that it drips with megalomania, albeit of a particularly sincere sort. With his wife, Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg has pledged to give away nearly all of his wealth to a variety of charitable causes, including a long-term medical-research project to cure all disease. His desire to take on global social problems through digital connectivity, and specifically through Facebook, feels like part of the same impulse.", "Yet Zuckerberg is often blas\u00e9 about the messiness of the transition between the world we\u2019re in and the one he wants to create through software. Building new \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d usually involves tearing older infrastructure down. If you manage the demolition poorly, you might undermine what comes next. In the case of the shattering media landscape, Zuckerberg seems finally to have at least noticed this problem and may yet come up with fixes for it. But in the meantime, Facebook rushes headlong into murky new areas, uncovering new dystopian possibilities at every turn.", "A few months after I spoke with Zuckerberg, Facebook held its annual developer conference in San Jose, Calif. At last year\u2019s show, Zuckerberg introduced an expanded version of Facebook\u2019s live streaming service which had been promised to revolutionize how we communicate. In the year since, Live had generated iconic scenes of protest, but it was also used to broadcast a terrorist attack in Munich and at least one suicide. Hours before Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance at the conference, police announced that a Cleveland man who had killed a stranger and posted a video on Facebook had shot himself after a manhunt.", "But as he took the stage in San Jose, Zuckerberg was ebullient. He started with a few dad jokes and threatened to read his long manifesto on stage. For a brief moment, there was a shift in tone: Statesman Zuck. \u201cIn all seriousness, this is an important time to work on building community,\u201d he said. He offered Facebook\u2019s condolences to the victim in Cleveland; the incident, he said, reminded Facebook that \u201cwe have a lot more to do.\u201d", "Just as quickly, though, Zuckerberg then pivoted to Facebook\u2019s next marvel, a system for digitally augmenting your pictures and videos. The technical term for this is \u201caugmented reality.\u201d The name bursts with dystopian possibilities \u2014 fake news on video rather than just text \u2014 but Zuckerberg never mentioned them.

Last month YouTube announced abrupt, vague changes to its automated processes for placing ads across the platform.

YouTube\u2019s process for mechanically pulling ads from videos is particularly concerning, because it takes aim at whole topics of conversation that could be perceived as potentially offensive to advertisers, and because it so often misfires. It risks suppressing political commentary and jokes. It puts the wild, independent internet in danger of becoming more boring than TV.", "YouTube\u2019s most serious ad change yet came in the wake of reports from The Times of London and The Wall Street Journal that ads were appearing on YouTube videos that espoused extremism and hate speech. When major advertisers like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson withdrew their spots, YouTube announced that it would try to make the site more palatable to advertisers by \u201ctaking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content.\u201d", "But according to YouTube creators, that shift has also punished video makers who bear no resemblance to terrorist sympathizers and racists. YouTube\u2019s comedians, political commentators and experts on subjects from military arms to video games have reported being squeezed by the ad shake-up \u2014 often in videos they\u2019ve posted to YouTube.

In fact, because his show is also broadcast over the radio, it adheres strictly to FCC content rules.

YouTube has previously blocked ads on Mr. Pakman\u2019s news videos referring to ISIS church bombings and the assassination of a Russian diplomat.

People create these systems, and they are sensitive to bad press and skittish advertisers. The YouTube ad crisis \u2014 and the company\u2019s response \u2014 also speaks to a persistent public misunderstanding of the worth of digital creators. The mainstream media barely engages with YouTube videos as an artistic product in the way it does traditional television and film. Coverage is focused on how much money YouTube stars make, how improbably famous they are among teenagers and, now, on the small number of racist and extremist videos that have slipped through the cracks of the ad system.", "Jamie Byrne, director of creators and enterprise at YouTube, said that concerned companies had requested tougher controls to keep their ad dollars flowing. \u201cFor creators to flourish on our platform, we need an incredibly strong advertising community engaged on YouTube as well,\u201d he said.

The internet was supposed to offer an opportunity for a diverse group of upstarts to challenge the corporate structure. But the same consolidation of power has happened online. Independent blogs have been shut down or snapped up by bigger companies. YouTube has long been owned by Google, which has gobbled up a greater share of online ad revenue in recent years. Google and Facebook are now so dominant that they form a practical duopoly over digital advertising. Meanwhile, YouTube is making a run at Netflix with its original-content subscription service, YouTube Red, and going after television with YouTube TV, which allows subscribers to stream TV channels online for $35 a month.", "All of that means that new media creators hoping to make a living online need to play by YouTube\u2019s rules, and steer clear of anything \u201cpotentially objectionable\u201d \u2014 not to real people, who might actually be offended, but to robots.

Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be convincing the public that the whole idea isn\u2019t crazy.", "\u201cI love the idea of being able to go out into my backyard and hop into my flying car,\u201d said Brad Templeton, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has served as a consultant on Google\u2019s self-driving project. \u201cI hate the idea of my next-door neighbor having one.\u201d", "Kitty Hawk, the company backed by Mr. Page, is trying to be one of the first out of the gate and plans to start selling its vehicle by the end of the year.", "The company has attracted intense interest because of Mr. Page and its chief executive, Sebastian Thrun, an influential technologist and self-driving car pioneer who is the founding director of Google\u2019s X lab.", "In 2013, Zee Aero, a Kitty Hawk division, became the object of Silicon Valley rumors when reports of a small air taxilike vehicle first surfaced.", "Mr. Page declined a request for an interview but said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve all had dreams of flying effortlessly. I\u2019m excited that one day very soon I\u2019ll be able to climb onto my Kitty Hawk Flyer for a quick and easy personal flight.\u201d", "During his recent test flight, Cameron Robertson, the aerospace engineer, used two joysticklike controls to swing the vehicle back and forth above Clear Lake, sliding on the air as a Formula One car might shimmy through a racecourse. The flight, just 15 feet above the water, circled over the lake about 20 or 30 yards from shore, and after about five minutes Mr. Robertson steered back to a floating landing pad at the end of a dock.", "The Kitty Hawk Flyer is one of several prototypes the start-up, based in Mountain View, Calif., is designing. The company hopes to create an audience of enthusiasts and hobbyists, who can pay $100 to sign up for a $2,000 discount on the retail price of a Flyer to \u201cgain exclusive access to Kitty Hawk experiences and demonstrations where a select few will get the chance to ride the Flyer.\u201d", "It is an unusual offer, since the company has yet to set a price for the vehicle, and Mr. Thrun\u2019s and Mr. Page\u2019s involvement can be taken as evidence that the company is aiming beyond hobbyists. Still, Kitty Hawk is clearly targeting a new kind of transportation \u2014 air flight that can be performed safely by most people and hopefully with government approval.", "\u201cWe have been in contact with the F.A.A. and we see the regulators as friends,\u201d Mr. Thrun said in an interview. He agreed that concerns about vehicles flying over our heads were legitimate. \u201cI believe that all of us have to work together to understand how new technologies will shape the future of society, \u201d he said.", "Two years ago, Mr. Thrun recruited two other pioneers, Mr. Robertson and Todd Reichert, aerospace engineers from AeroVelo, a University of Toronto spinoff company that won a coveted prize for a human-powered helicopter and set the land speed record for a bicycle last year.", "They are flying under a special Federal Aviation Administration category for ultralight aircraft that does not require a pilot\u2019s license and is intended for recreational flying in uncongested areas. To add an extra margin of safety, the Kitty Hawk engineers are sticking to flying over open water. The company said the final commercial product would look different and be far quieter than the test model.", "\u201cWe hope that this is more of an exciting concept than what most people have had in their minds about flying cars,\u201d Mr. Robertson said. \u201cThis is not yet that product in terms of what we will say and what it can do, but I think it demonstrates a vision of the future.\u201d", "Kitty Hawk could face stiff competition, not just from about a half dozen start-ups, but from the giant Airbus, headquartered in Blagnac, France. The aerospace firm has announced two different vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, concepts and is reported to be planning an initial test flight before the end of the year.", "At the Geneva International Motor Show last month, Airbus proposed an autonomous vehicle named Pop.Up that would operate on the ground and in the air. And this year, the government of Dubai, in partnership with a Chinese firm, EHang, said it planned to begin operating an autonomous flying taxi in July. Also, Uber is expected on Tuesday to detail its \u201cvision for the future of Urban Air Mobility\u201d at a conference in Dallas.", "There is no shortage of skeptics happy to point out the roadblocks for these vehicles. There is already significant resistance to the idea of unmanned drones flying over urban areas, and flying cars could face substantial opposition, even if they can be quieted to automotive noise levels.", "For these personal air vehicles to become a reality in the United States, the country would need a new air traffic control system.", "Two years ago, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began development of an air traffic control system meant for managing all sorts of flying vehicles, including drones. One NASA developer described it as an air traffic control system, \u201cfor a sky dark with drones.\u201d Researchers hope testing can begin by 2019.", "Batteries are also an issue. While electric propeller-driven motors seem promising, today\u2019s battery technology cannot support flights of a reasonable distance, say a 30- or 50-mile commute.", "\u201cHow is this going to work? I don\u2019t want to be a Debbie Downer, but we can\u2019t even take our cellphones on airplanes today because of fears about battery fires,\u201d said Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University, who is researching personal air transport for NASA.", "And don\u2019t forget that flying cars will not be able to pull to the side of the road in an emergency, said John Leonard, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.", "\u201cSilicon Valley is full of very smart people, but they don\u2019t always get the laws of physics,\u201d he said. \u201cGravity is a formidable adversary.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/podcasts/the-daily/the-daily-bill-oreillys-ouster.html": ["Listen and subscribe from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher", "For 14 consecutive years, Bill O\u2019Reilly hosted the highest-rated news program not just on Fox News but on television.", "Until yesterday.", "On today\u2019s episode:", "\u2022 Fox News\u2019s biggest star is out of a job two and a half weeks after a Times investigation into allegations of sexual harassment.

The artist worked with Met staff to redesign the pergola, landscaping and seating areas as well as the bar and its menu so his commission would cohere and foster the social and romantic life of the place.", "It\u2019s a delight to hear the artist, prolific and successful at 37, talk so much about life, because for a long time, a deep anxiety and a preoccupation with death has pervaded his practice, which he described as \u201ca little bit suicidal.\u201d (One example: a 2015 show at Marian Goodman Gallery where the floor was fossilized with the detritus of contemporary civilization: sneakers, glass, plastic bags, an iPod.)", "In conversations in person, by Skype and by email over the last 18 months, he revealed that destruction, deterioration and decomposition were \u201cimportant axes\u201d of his practice.", "He can look the part, too, with his gaunt and lanky frame.

He wears his dark hair in a long bob, or rubber-banded back into a ponytail. His Google icon is Thumper, the floppy-eared hop-along rabbit from the 1942 film \u201cBambi.\u201d", "And while he used to contemplate each artistic endeavor as if it were his final one, that kind of thinking has been all but impossible of late, with five projects coming to fruition in 2017, all under the same title as the rooftop project, \u201cThe Theater of Disappearance\u201d: There is his film trilogy, which had its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in February; an exhibition with the contemporary art organization NEON in Athens (June 1-Sep. 24); and two coming takeovers of entire museums, first of Kunsthaus Bregenz, in Austria (May 13-Aug. 27), and then of the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, in Los Angeles (Oct. 22-Feb. 26, 2018).", "His explorations, from prehistory through post-apocalyptic ruin, resonate at many levels. \u201cAdri\u00e1n\u2019s work allows the visitor to wander through the history of humankind,\u201d said Rudolf Sagmeister, who is a curator of the artist\u2019s exhibition in Bregenz. \u201cFor me it creates a mixture of these unconscious images, feelings, objects and spaces that may exist already, and yet he always creates something new within and from them.\u201d", "By January, at the Met, Mr. Villar Rojas had chosen the objects he wanted to replicate for use as raw materials, and staff members from the Met\u2019s imaging department were busy creating three-dimensional images to make that happen. They used two methods. The first was photogrammetry, a process born out of aerial and architectural mapping that can create a 3-D model from an array of images shot with a regular camera. The second process used the Met\u2019s new laser scanner to collect millions of data points and then transpose them into a 3-D model.", "Early one Wednesday before the Met opened to the public, a gaggle of staffers from the imaging department clustered in the Egyptian wing around the granodiorite statue of Haremhab. The laser scanner sat atop a large tripod. As Oi-Cheong Lee held the scanner\u2019s articulated arm, his colleague Joe Coscia wielded its hairdryer-size laser probe, moving it evenly just above the rough striations of the statue\u2019s surface amid a chorus of happy bleeps, pings, poings and a dididdididi.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going for a close shave,\u201d their colleague Scott Geffert laughed. \u201cBut not too close.\u201d", "The men crouched over a laptop to scrutinize the data from the laser. \u201cHow about his sleeve \u2014 are we good?\u201d", "\u201cHmm, I think there\u2019s a hole there.\u201d", "\u201cO.K., yeah, I got it.\u201d", "All told, the project would necessitate billions of laser measurements and photographs.", "The artist\u2019s studio team and Met staff members also had found a special effects company in Dallas that could scan humans at a resolution high enough to generate, as Ms. Galilee put it, \u201cpeople-size people\u201d whose figures would animate Mr. Villar Rojas\u2019s sculptures.", "In mid-January, a colossal mobile photo studio that was kitted out with 130 cameras had traveled from Texas to New Jersey. A dozen people, mostly friends and family, served as models, even the artist. (On the rooftop, Mr. Villar Rojas\u2019s arms emerge outstretched from one sculpture, one hand making what various cultures call the sign of the horns or the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sign).", "Over the course of many weeks, Mr. Villar Rojas manipulated and merged hundreds of 3-D images to allow the human figures to hold, wear, sit upon or engage realistically with the replicas of the Met objects. Once the artist had 3-D renderings for 16 cohesive sculptures, the smaller objects \u2014 horns, plates, coins \u2014 were reborn through 3-D printing.", "Larger elements \u2014 tombs, armor and human forms \u2014 were replicated via a computer-controlled milling process that chisels shapes from a block of rigid polyurethane foam.", "On a frigid day in February, Jon Lash, president of Digital Atelier in Hamilton, N.J., gave a tour of the facility, where the sculptures would be fabricated. He gestured through a thick window to a machinery room where dust was accumulating like snowdrifts on every surface as a mill whittled a bird Mr. Villar had chosen to replicate from the Met\u2019s Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. The original was made of wood by the Senufo people of the northern Ivory Coast.", "Then, in a cavernous warehouse, Ms. Galilee, the curator; Mr. Villar Rojas; Mr. Lash; and members of their teams bent over a just-completed copy of a 13th-century limestone knight, plucked long ago from a Cistercian abbey in France.

Walt was essentially a guide for normal people to understand a brave new world of computing that was upon us.", "Eventually, the industry had to change to meet the future that he saw coming. Computers were indeed personal objects, as the cost came down and people brought more of them into their homes \u2014 desktops, laptops, set-top boxes and the like.

Anyway, Walt. Oh man, I\u2019ll miss him.", "To me the most amazing thing about Walt is how early he identified computers as a mainstream phenomenon. In the 1980s and 1990s lots of people were writing about tech, but Walt was among the first to understand that this strange new class of nerds would completely change the world, and that they would do so in a way that would affect ordinary people who did not consider themselves techies.

Longer still, she reckons, are the odds they\u2019re led back to her and to Ray Stussy (unrelated), who blackmailed LeFay into committing a crime and thus initiated the chain of events leading to all this chaos. And she\u2019s right, at least insofar as it applies to the unfathomable pinhead-ery she knows, which is that Maurice drove to the wrong Stussy house and killed its resident for indiscernible reasons. What she can\u2019t account for is the extent of the unfathomable pinhead-ery she doesn\u2019t know, which is likely to leave the authorities with a lot more evidence leading back to them, including a gas-station phone book with Ennis\u2019s page ripped out of it.", "The phrase also neatly encapsulates where we are in \u201cFargo\u201d so far.

What we\u2019re not seeing yet is the counterbalance of human decency and moral certitude that\u2019s also important to what could now, in the parlance of our times, be called the \u201cFargo\u201d brand. That typically arises from the Marge Gunderson character \u2014 in this case, Carrie Coon\u2019s Gloria Burgle \u2014 but she hasn\u2019t enjoyed enough meaningful screen time to establish that balance.", "In his review of the third season, the Times\u2019s James Poniewozik calls it \u201can expertly made meta-concoction, a remix of a remix,\u201d which is certainly true of the first two episodes (the only ones made available to critics so far) and may ultimately be true of the whole thing. There\u2019s a hollowness to the action so far that gives oxygen to the series\u2019s (and the original movie\u2019s) toughest critics, who might fairly dismiss it as a glib rendering of criminal stupidity and Midwestern anthropology. But two hours of a 10-hour narrative isn\u2019t a significant enough sample size to take an adequate measure of the season unless the pattern repeats itself the rest of the way. Perhaps the soul has not yet been revealed. Perhaps it has no soul. Such things take time.", "As a plot machine, however, \u201cFargo\u201d remains top-notch, and the current cast may be the best the show has assembled. Ewan McGregor\u2019s dual role has been getting most of the attention so far, but Mary-Elizabeth Winstead\u2019s work as Nikki has been the bigger standout \u2014 in part because of Winstead\u2019s unwavering confidence as a femme fatale, but also because Nikki isn\u2019t quite as smart as her own measure. Compared with Ray, Maurice and the other losers in her orbit, Nikki is a criminal mastermind of Keyser Soze proportions, and we\u2019ve seen her react quickly and instinctually in threatening situations, like using her body in an attempt to figuratively and literally disarm Maurice or calculating the precise trajectory of a fatal air-conditioning unit.", "Yet Nikki is given to the same impulsive pinhead-ery that gets everyone in trouble in the \u201cFargo\u201d-verse.

As part of his broader inspiration, Mr. Guare has often cited the 1909 Nobel Prize lecture by the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, a pioneer of wireless telegraphy, who envisioned a network of towers that could send messages to any part of the globe.", "Mr. Guare, in a recent interview, said he first encountered the six-degrees concept in 1967, in the inaugural issue of Psychology Today, which featured a cover story about the psychologist Stanley Milgram\u2019s \u201csmall world\u201d experiment. The experiment involved giving a letter to random people in Omaha and Wichita, Kan., with instructions to give it to someone who could give it to someone who would help it reach a designated individual in Boston.", "Evidently, Ouisa Kittredge, one half of the couple in Mr. Guare\u2019s play, saw the same article.", "\u201cI read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people,\u201d she says during the increasingly desperate search to find \u201cPaul\u201d Poitier (who was based on a real con artist) after he disappears.", "\u201cThe president of the United States. A gondolier in Venice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the big names,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s anyone.\u201d", "The phrase is often seen as an inspiring, even mystical symbol. But the speech, Mr. Guare notes, was meant ironically, as a comment on racial exclusion and social stratification in America.", "\u201cThe nightmare of the play becomes finding the right six people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can find everyone in the world, but you can\u2019t find one black man whose name you don\u2019t know.\u201d", "Mr. Guare said he was \u201ctickled\u201d when he started seeing the phrase \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d in different contexts: an ad for Air France, a newspaper article about the 1992 presidential election. And then came Kevin Bacon.", "The now-famous Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game was invented in 1994 by Craig Fass, Brian Turtle and Mike Ginelli, three students at Albright College in Reading, Pa., who were sitting around watching \u201cFootloose.\u201d They started naming other movies Mr. Bacon had appeared in, and came up with the idea that he was the unacknowledged center of the Hollywood universe, who connected everyone.", "The three friends performed their parlor trick on \u201cThe Jon Stewart Show\u201d on MTV a few months later. Next came a book (with an introduction by Mr. Bacon) and a board game.", "Mr. Bacon (who declined to be interviewed for this article) would go on to found SixDegrees.org, which matches celebrities with charities, and star in a Visa commercial that parodied the six-degrees concept. But at a 20th-anniversary panel with Mr. Turtle and others at SXSW in Austin, Tex., in 2014, he recalled his initial mystification.", "\u201cPeople would come up to me and touch me and say, \u2018I\u2019m one degree!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what was going on.\u201d", "The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon board game, which appeared in 1997, featured 20-sided dice. But the true great leap forward came a year earlier, when Brett Tjaden, a graduate student in computer science at the University of Virginia who sometimes played the parlor game, created The Oracle of Bacon, a website that generated authoritative \u201cBacon numbers\u201d based on data from the Internet Movie Database.", "\u201cI did it mainly for myself and my friends,\u201d Mr. Tjaden, now a professor at James Madison University, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey sent the link to their friends, who sent it to a couple of their friends, and before too long it was famous.\u201d", "Time Magazine named it one of its top 10 websites of 1996. Today, it has the same Web 1.0 look, though its Center of the Hollywood Universe list is updated regularly. (Mr. Bacon is No. 457, while the current center is \u2026 Eric Roberts?)", "The website drew the attention of Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, two leading researchers in the emerging field of network theory, who drew on it for a seminal paper. It also inspired other riffs, like the Oracle of Baseball; Degrees of Wikipedia, which calculates links between Wikipedia pages; and Erdos-Bacon numbers, which combine a person\u2019s proximity to both the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdos, which has long been a benchmark for mathematicians, and Mr. Bacon. (Natalie Portman\u2019s Erdos-Bacon number, in case you are wondering, has been calculated as seven.)", "The Oracle of Bacon still has about 10,000 visitors on an average day, according to Patrick Reynolds, a software engineer in Florida who runs it.", "\u201cTo me, it says that a meme never really goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything lives forever until you pull the plug.\u201d", "The concept got another boost in 1999, when The New Yorker published an article by Malcolm Gladwell called \u201cSix Degrees of Lois Weisberg,\u201d which used Ms. Weisberg \u2014 at the time the cultural affairs commissioner of Chicago (and the mother of one of Mr. Gladwell\u2019s friends) \u2014 as a case study in the surprising science of social connection.", "The article, which was later adapted for Mr. Gladwell\u2019s monster best seller \u201cThe Tipping Point,\u201d dug into research by Milgram, Mark Granovetter (who developed the concept of strong versus weak social ties) and others. But the big ideas, Mr. Gladwell said in a phone interview, came second.", "\u201cShe was kind of a hilarious person, and I wanted an excuse to hang out with her,\u201d he said. \u201cThe article was really a delivery vehicle for Lois Weisberg.\u201d", "The article popularized the idea of \u201cconnectors\u201d: people who know unusually large numbers of people and are unusually given to making introductions, the rough equivalent of hubs in a computer network.", "\u201cNot all degrees are created equal,\u201d Mr. Gladwell wrote. The article\u2019s teaser summary put it even more dramatically: \u201cShe\u2019s a grandmother, she lives in a big house in Chicago, and you\u2019ve never heard of her. Does she run the world?\u201d", "Ms. Weisberg, who died last year at 90, may have run the world, but she didn\u2019t necessarily appreciate Mr. Gladwell\u2019s telling everyone about it.", "\u201cI think I made her life a little difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested in celebrity of any kind.\u201d", "The play, Mr. Guare said, is \u201can antique piece.\u201d Nowadays, a quick Google search \u2014 or text message to the Kittredges\u2019 children, whom Paul supposedly knows from Harvard \u2014 would have blown Paul\u2019s cover immediately.", "On the other hand, social media has made it possible to be \u201cfriends\u201d with people you don\u2019t actually know, while also providing vast data sets for calculating the number of links separating people scattered around the world.", "The degree of separation, it turns out, is less than six. Last year, researchers at Facebook reported that the 1.59 billion people on its network were separated from one another by only about 3.5 people. And that number had been shrinking: Five years earlier, when there were fewer than half as many people on the site, the figure was 3.74.", "The six-degrees idea has a cosmic undertow that writers and directors have been happy to ride. The movies \u201cBabel\u201d and \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d as well as \u201cLost,\u201d the head-scratching television series cocreated by J. J. Abrams, featured characters unknowingly linked across huge swaths of space and time. The movies \u201cCrash\u201d and \u201cMagnolia\u201d (both set in Los Angeles) and the short-lived ABC series \u201cSix Degrees\u201d (another Abrams project, set in New York) offered more localized versions.", "Virginia Heffernan, reviewing \u201cSix Degrees\u201d in The New York Times, said it reflected \u201cthe shared citywide creed\u201d that \u201cmight be called Manhattan paganism: a private, almost secretive belief in coincidence, chance, accident and serendipity.\u201d", "But here\u2019s a real coincidence for you: Back in 1993, Mr. Abrams was an aspiring actor whose film credits included \u2026 a small part in the film adaptation of \u201cSix Degrees of Separation.\u201d", "He played Doug, a college student whose father has also been taken in by Paul. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot!

Self-driving cars may be the future, and bioscience sure is interesting, but it\u2019s the ads that pay the bills.", "Now, even as Google enjoys historic success, a run of bad news has exposed a vulnerability in its automated advertising system. In recent weeks, big advertisers have become increasingly concerned that their brands have been appearing alongside YouTube videos posted by extremists and other unwelcome material.", "Automated ad systems may be good at identifying copyright violations, but they\u2019re not so good at seeing things in context, the way that humans do, as Daisuke Wakabayashi writes.

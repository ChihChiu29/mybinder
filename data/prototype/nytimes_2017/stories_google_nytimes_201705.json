First, codify the policy on gender pronouns in a written entry to the formal stylebook. If that sounds bureaucratic, it\u2019s not. Editors and writers regularly refer to the stylebook for clarity on word usage. It\u2019s a critical reference tool that short circuits the bad information that word-of-mouth answers can spread. Right now, it seems there is still some confusion. Are nonbinary pronouns ever allowed? And if so, under what circumstances? Among the rank and file, you\u2019re apt to get different answers, as I did, depending on who you ask.", "Second, I wonder about the unintended consequence of requiring the signoff of a masthead editor for every singular usage of \u201cthey.\u201d That alone is enough to quell the possibility that the subject of a story might actually be identified by the pronoun they prefer.", "At a time when American culture is outpacing the language to describe it, easily referenced rules can prevent the kinds of embarrassing mistakes that could leave The Times seeming out of touch."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/trump-comey-fbi.html": ["\u25a0 The Senate Intelligence Committee invited the former F.B.I. director James B.

Mr. Burton and the other Orchard founders had worked at an online ad exchange called Admeld, sold to Google for $400 million. Venture capital firms and Wall Street heavyweights including John Mack and Vikram Pandit had invested in Orchard.

Over that time, it burned through more than $5 million in legal fees and other expenses. A regulatory snarl over whether the loans would be treated as securities caused delays. Major lending platforms were reluctant to participate. And the market for loans was thrust into upheaval by a wave of defaults and a scandal that broke last May at Lending Club.", "Next month, hoping to add momentum, Orchard plans to unveil a scaled-back version of the platform, eight months later than first planned.", "But regardless of the company\u2019s fate, its struggles thus far reveal just how hard it can be for a new entrant \u2014 even one with successful founders, a promising service and big-name investors \u2014 to break into a highly regulated industry.", "In a series of interviews over the last 15 months, Mr. Burton and other Orchard employees offered an unusual inside look at a project that has not gone as envisioned, but that they believe still holds promise \u2014 especially in a Trump era of potentially lighter financial regulation.", "\u201cIn general, it has been a humbling process going through it,\u201d Mr. Burton acknowledged last week. \u201cWe have definitely learned a ton. When you\u2019re operating in a new space in fintech, it\u2019s hard.\u201d", "When Orchard was founded in 2013, marketplace lending was just taking off. Unlike banks \u2014 which take deposits, make loans and hold capital to absorb loan losses \u2014 marketplace lenders match investors and borrowers directly, with the investors taking the risk of losses in exchange for higher interest rates.", "Orchard began by offering institutional investors an automated service to analyze the loans and buy them from different online lenders. But its long-term plan always included creation of what Mr. Burton calls a \u201cmany-to-many\u201d trading platform.", "\u201cWhat got us excited was seeing what happened in online advertising,\u201d said Dan Ciporin, whose Canaan Partners invested in Lending Club and Orchard.

He sometimes takes his miniature Australian shepherd dog, Chico, to the office. At his desk is the 1972 book \u201cThe Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance.\u201d", "Seeking financial expertise, Orchard recruited a few Wall Street veterans from Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns. In late spring of last year, Mr. Burton had more than a dozen roadshow meetings with executives from the largest loan platforms, including Lending Club, Prosper Marketplace and Social Finance.", "He hoped to charge them monthly fees of $2,500 to $5,000 to participate. Orchard also offered them the ability to be its \u201cdata partners,\u201d so Orchard could standardize their data for trading purposes \u2014 which Mr. Burton called \u201cthe big heavy lift.\u201d", "Standardizing data was daunting because each loan platform had its own legal and data formats, such as different definitions of debt-to-income, said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of PeerIQ, which tracks alternative lending.", "Orchard also enlisted the help of Meredith Cross, a lawyer at WilmerHale and the former head of corporate finance at the Securities and Exchange Commission, as it met with Wall Street regulators.", "But in July, S.E.C. officials told Orchard that they would consider loans being traded as securities, potentially imposing a tougher level of oversight. That made some lenders nervous about participating. Some lenders were also concerned about exposing investors they had cultivated to loans from competitors.", "\u201cWe do not have a current need for a trading platform,\u201d said Ryan Rosett, a chief executive of Credibly, which offers small-business loans. \u201cOur capital markets team has the ability to sell our loans directly to a pool of institutional investors.\u201d", "By late July, 10 of the 30 top lenders signaled they could not participate quickly enough to meet a planned Oct. 15 platform debut. Among them was Lending Club, even though its board had three Orchard investors, including Mr. Mack and Mr. Ciporin.", "Orchard was also fighting a separate headwind. The broader market for online loans was being buffeted by higher consumer loan defaults and investor fears. Some online lenders cut staff members, and others shut down as loan growth dried up.", "In late September, Orchard postponed the unveiling of the trading platform, newly named \u201cOrchard X,\u201d to November from October. A few weeks later, its new goal became \u201cjust to do some trades of any size\u201d by year-end, one Orchard staff member said. But Orchard X\u2019s regulatory approvals were delayed until January.", "In December, Mr. Burton expressed frustration at the difficulties. As Orchard X struggled to get going, he said, legal documents for trades had \u201cballooned to 150 pages from a 20-page contract,\u201d leaving him exasperated. \u201cI\u2019m a tech guy!\u201d he said.", "As it moves forward, Orchard has played down the regulatory issue, proceeding without an explicit formal S.E.C. ruling on whether the loans are securities. It is a potentially risky move, but one the company believes will work in part because it has dropped its goal of legal standardization, cutting the need for lending platforms to agree on regulation issues. The S.E.C. declined to comment.", "In January, Orchard X arranged its first sale of about $30 million in loans from an ailing platform, a small-business lender called CAN Capital. The auction took a lengthy four weeks to complete. But Orchard X did receive a fee of 0.5 percent of the sale price.", "It has since provided data for a smaller loan sale for another lender, Credibility Capital, and signed up with a dozen other lenders to broker loan auctions as well as private placements and two other types of transactions \u2014 \u201cforward flow\u201d agreements and credit facilities \u2014 in which investors provide funds to lenders for future loans.", "Although Orchard X would receive commissions for all such sales, it would not clear and settle the auctions like an exchange.", "Looking back, Mr. Burton said on April 4, Orchard should not have tried to persuade lenders to join the trading platform all at once. Having raised $30 million in 2015, Orchard plans to announce next month that it has raised an additional $20 million or more and to formally roll out its revised Orchard X transaction platform.", "Mr. Ciporin, the venture investor, is convinced that Orchard X will someday \u201cdo transactions instantaneously around any loan.\u201d And while acknowledging that Orchard \u201cdidn\u2019t initially provide enough time for an evolutionary process,\u201d he remained optimistic.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody sees this as a major blow,\u201d he added. \u201cI would put it in the category of a minor hiccup.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/briefing/marine-le-pen-facebook.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

Without those buybacks, which reduce Apple\u2019s shares and total value, Apple\u2019s market cap might already be as high as $900 billion (though without the buybacks, Apple\u2019s stock price would be lower, so such calculations are inherently imprecise).", "Furthermore, in the next two years, Mr. Maestri said, the company intends \u201cto return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12 percent of our market cap at the current stock price.\u201d", "All of which is to say that if Apple\u2019s cash machine keeps clicking, it could well become the first company with a $1 trillion market cap. But it would probably get there much faster if it were not sending so much cash back to investors.", "The fact that it is doing so is great for shareholders, Mr. Damodaran said. It is displaying commendable discipline, he said, because Apple has had no better use for the money, either internally or with a big acquisition of a less-profitable or money-losing company.", "Apple is already investing as much as it can in useful research and development, the company said on Tuesday. \u201cWe know how much we need to invest in the business,\u201d Mr. Maestri said in the conference call. \u201cWe will never underinvest in the business.

Much of it will presumably return to the United States if the Trump administration lowers corporate tax rates, as it has proposed.

Apple\u2019s global base of iPhone users is growing ever larger, which implies rising income from music and apps and headphones and the like, and it\u2019s even possible that the company will come up with a new Big Thing in technology. Even if it does not, he said, the share price is still attractive.", "Mr. Damodaran takes a more gimlet-eyed view.

A handful of others \u2014 Comcast, AT&T, Verizon \u2014 control the wired and wireless connections through which all your data flows.

The rule basically prevents broadband providers from offering preferential treatment to some content online \u2014 it blocks Comcast from giving, say, a speed boost to a streaming video company that can afford to pay over one that cannot.", "Amid many legal battles, neutrality rules in some form have governed the internet for years. In 2015, after President Obama advocated a stricter policy, Tom Wheeler, then chairman of the F.C.C., pushed through sweeping network neutrality rules. But under President Trump, net neutrality is on the chopping block. Last week, Mr. Pai outlined an effort to loosen the rules; his vision is likely to come to pass.", "The fight over network neutrality is often seen as a battle between telecom companies and internet companies \u2014 between fat-pipe providers like Comcast (which stand to make some money by charging for priority lanes) and digital innovators like Google (which might have to pay up). As a matter of lobbying, the two sides are definitely in opposition: Broadband companies cheered Mr. Pai\u2019s speech, while the Internet Association \u2014 a group that represents dozens of large and small internet companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 opposed it.", "Yet the portrayal of a fight along internet-versus-telecom battle lines seems increasingly simplistic.

Does ending network neutrality help the big fish or the little fish? Will scrapping the rules make the internet fairer, more dynamic and more innovative? Will it create a more favorable atmosphere for potential challengers of the Frightful Five?", "Probably not.

In 2003, when he began arguing for neutrality rules, Mr. Wu was mainly interested in protecting digital innovators from the telecom oligopolies that had long stifled new technology on their networks. If phone companies brought the same rules from phone networks over to the internet, attaching unapproved hardware to your line (like a Wi-Fi router) or running software that might compete with the phone company\u2019s primary business (say, Skype) could be deemed verboten.", "But today, Mr. Wu sees neutrality rules as having a broader purpose \u2014 protecting innovators not just from broadband companies, but also from the internet giants that now rule the network.", "\u201cIn the earliest days we were trying to save companies like YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s as much about trying to save the net from YouTube as it is about saving YouTube.\u201d", "To see what he means, consider that today\u2019s internet giants have lots of ways to insulate themselves from competition. First, anytime competitors succeed, the giants usually also do well \u2014 they get rents from app store revenue, from cloud storage bills and from app-install ads, among other things. And when upstarts come along with services that threaten the Five\u2019s businesses, the giants can simply copy them, and bundle their own versions with their popular products. See how Apple launched its own streaming service to compete with Spotify, or how Facebook copied all of Snapchat\u2019s most popular features.", "But Mr. Wu points out that at least the giants now have to do something to respond to rivals. In the absence of neutrality rules, all they might have to do its buy up access to speedy lanes online, thus easily preventing rivals from ever working well on people\u2019s phones.", "\u201cSnapchat has grown up in an era of network neutrality, and I think Snapchat owes some of its existence to net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cFacebook hasn\u2019t been able to destroy it yet, and they would have had an easier job in a non-net-neutrality world. The question is, will Facebook and Comcast be able to join together and gang up on a future Snapchat?\u201d", "The internet giants \u2014 who, remember, are in favor of neutrality rules \u2014 don\u2019t exactly agree that the rules also help keep the internet giants in check. But they do agree that the rules could help start-ups.", "\u201cInternet companies of all sizes believe that the current F.C.C. net neutrality rules are working and these consumer protections should not be changed,\u201d Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association, said in an email. He added: \u201cSilicon Valley, since its birth, has held to the belief that the best ideas can compete and win in the marketplace.

But we are blissfully ignorant of what that means. We don\u2019t know what data is being bought and sold, because, well, that\u2019s private. The evidence that flashes in front of our own eyes looks harmless enough: We search Google for a new pair of shoes, and for a time, sneakers follow us across the web, tempting us from every sidebar.

The ancient Greeks, for instance, distinguished between the public realm (\u201ckoinon\u201d) and the private realm (\u201cidion\u201d). In contrast to those public citizens engaged in political life, humble private citizens were known as \u201cidiotai,\u201d a word that later evolved into \u201cidiots.\u201d Something similar is true of the English word \u201cprivacy.\u201d As Hannah Arendt wrote in \u201cThe Human Condition,\u201d privacy was once closely associated with \u201ca state of being deprived of something, and even of the highest and most human of man\u2019s capacities.\u201d In the 17th century, the word \u201cprivate\u201d arose as a more politically correct replacement for \u201ccommon,\u201d which had taken on condescending overtones.", "And yet somewhere along the way, privacy was recast as a necessity for cultivating the life of the mind. In George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d the proles are spared a life of constant surveillance, while higher-ranking members of society are exposed to Big Brother\u2019s watchful eye. The novel\u2019s protagonist, Winston, begins to suspect that real freedom lies in those unwatched slums: \u201cIf there is hope,\u201d he writes in his secret diary, \u201cit lies in the proles.\u201d In the influential 1967 book \u201cPrivacy and Freedom,\u201d Alan Westin described privacy as having four functions: personal autonomy, emotional release, self-evaluation and intimate communication. This modern understanding of privacy as an intimate good grew up right alongside the technology that threatened to violate it. At the end of the 18th century, the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protected Americans from physical searches of their bodies and homes. One hundred years later, technological advancements had legal minds thinking about a kind of mental privacy too: In an 1890 paper called \u201cThe Right to Privacy,\u201d Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis cited \u201crecent inventions and business methods\u201d \u2014 including instant photography and tabloid gossip \u2014 that they claimed had \u201cinvaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life.\u201d They argued for what they called the right \u201cto be let alone,\u201d but also what they called \u201cthe right to one\u2019s personality.\u201d", "Now that our privacy is worth something, every side of it is being monetized. We can either trade it for cheap services or shell out cash to protect it. It is increasingly seen not as a right but as a luxury good. When Congress recently voted to allow internet service providers to sell user data without users\u2019 explicit consent, talk emerged of premium products that people could pay for to protect their browsing habits from sale. And if they couldn\u2019t afford it? As one congressman told a concerned constituent, \u201cNobody\u2019s got to use the internet.\u201d Practically, though, everybody\u2019s got to. Tech companies have laid claim to the public square: All of a sudden, we use Facebook to support candidates, organize protests and pose questions in debates. We\u2019re essentially paying a data tax for participating in democracy.", "The smartphone is an intimate device; we stare rapt into its bright light and stroke its smooth glass to coax out information and connect with others. It seems designed to help us achieve Westin\u2019s functions of privacy, to enable emotional release and moments of passive reflection. We cradle it in bed, at dinner, on the toilet. Its pop-up privacy policies are annoying speed bumps in the otherwise instantaneous conjuring of desires. It feels like a private experience, when really it is everything but. How often have you shielded the contents of your screen from a stranger on the subway, or the partner next to you in bed, only to offer up your secrets to the data firm tracking everything you do?", "The surveillance economy works on such information asymmetry: Data-mining companies know everything about us, but we know very little about what they know. And just as \u201cprivacy\u201d has grown into an anxious buzzword, the powerful have co-opted it in order to maintain control over others and evade accountability. As we bargain away the amount of privacy that an ordinary person expects, we\u2019ve also watched businesses and government figures grow ever more indignant about their own need to be left alone. Companies mandate nondisclosure agreements and demand out-of-court arbitration to better conceal their business practices. In 2013, Facebook revoked users\u2019 ability to remain unsearchable on the site; meanwhile, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was buying up four houses surrounding his Palo Alto home to preserve his own privacy. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, has defended President Trump\u2019s secretive meetings at his personal golf clubs, saying he is \u201centitled to a bit of privacy,\u201d and the administration has cut off public access to White House visitor logs, citing security risks and \u201cprivacy concerns.\u201d When The New York Times reported that the president takes counsel from the Fox News host Sean Hannity, Hannity indignantly tweeted that his conversations were \u201cPRIVATE.\u201d", "We\u2019ve arrived at a place where public institutions and figures can be precious about their privacy in ways we\u2019re continually deciding individual people can\u2019t.

Researchers report that readers need to know at least 95 percent of the words in a text for comfortable absorption. Pausing to find a word definition is disruptive. Online, the mere presence of hyperlinks compromises reading comprehension because the decision of whether or not to click disrupts the flow of understanding.", "Deeper knowledge of words also helps. Your knowledge of what a word means, how it\u2019s spelled and how it sounds are actually separate in the brain. That\u2019s why you may recall one but not the others, as when you know what you want to say (\u201csomeone who owes money\u201d) but can\u2019t find the word (\u201cdebtor\u201d).

Every time you retrieve information from memory, it becomes a bit easier to find it the next time. That\u2019s why students studying for a test actually remember more if they quiz themselves than if they study as they typically do, by rereading their textbook or notes.

The Cuban government, they contend, has become no less despotic and must be pressured to reform through strict enforcement of existing sanctions, public admonishment and diplomatic isolation.", "Meanwhile, a large pro-engagement coalition that includes lawmakers from both parties, businesses and young Cuban-Americans, is calling on the White House to build on the foundation of engagement it inherited. By charting out narrow areas of cooperation with Havana \u2014 while agreeing to disagree on human rights issues \u2014 the Obama administration enabled the freer flow of people, goods and information between the countries.", "Among the fruits of this approach have been bilateral agreements on health care cooperation, joint planning to mitigate oil spills and coordination on counternarcotics efforts. Havana also recently agreed to start accepting some Cubans who have been ordered deported. Regulatory changes have made it easier for most Americans to visit Cuba \u2014 though going there purely for tourism is still technically illegal \u2014 and enabled broader exchanges among scholars, journalists and artists. Google, meanwhile, is negotiating a series of agreements with Cuba that could significantly expand access to the internet on the island, one of the most unplugged nations on earth.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s public remarks on Cuba policy have been brief and thoughtless.

The White House began an assessment early this year and agencies, including the Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, have given their input. It is unclear when, or whether, an announcement of a decision will come. Mr. Trump could undo many regulatory changes with the stroke of a pen. For instance, he could tighten rules on sending remittances to Cubans, suspend the newly re-established commercial flights between the nations and stop American cruises from docking in Havana.", "If he were to take those sorts of steps, Mr. Trump would make the small pro-embargo coalition in Capitol Hill very happy. But doing so would mean reversing course on a policy change that is widely popular among Americans and nearly universally supported by Cubans.", "He also would be putting American farmers and businesses at a disadvantage by curtailing their access to a market that is gradually opening to global trade. In 2016, the European Union formally abandoned a policy predicated on pursuit of a democratic transition and struck a broader agreement with Havana that includes cooperation on trade and development and a dialogue on human rights.", "Most damagingly, putting the relationship with Cuba back on a confrontational track would all but certainly subject Cubans to greater repression and privation. In the past, Havana has ratcheted up its repressive tactics during moments of heightened tension with the United States.", "Instead of waiting for the Cuban government to \u201cmake a better deal with the Cuban people\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 Mr. Trump can continue to make it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business with Cubans.

There are the innovations that pour out of Silicon Valley companies and elite universities, the flexibility of a work force relatively unconstrained by union rules, the dynamism of entrepreneurs less hamstrung by an oversize welfare state and of a more mobile population willing to move to where the cutting-edge jobs are mushrooming.", "In short, the standard innovation theory of American exceptionalism is all about qualities that make each worker more productive. Today, nearly all the economic discussion about how to make America great again focuses on ways \u2014 like cutting red tape and taxes \u2014 to revive flagging productivity growth.", "Though this discussion remains critically important, it plays down a big shift in the story. The underlying growth potential of any economy is shaped not only by productivity, or output per worker, but also by the number of workers entering the labor force. The growth of the labor force is in turn determined mainly by the number of native-born and immigrant working-age people. Over the last two decades, the United States\u2019 advantage in productivity growth has narrowed sharply, while its population advantages, compared with both Europe and Japan, have essentially held steady.", "What makes America great is, therefore, less about productivity than about population, less about Google and Stanford than about babies and immigrants.", "The growing importance of the population race will be very hard for any political leader to fully digest. Every nation prefers to think of itself as productive in the sense of hard-working and smart, not just fertile. But population is where the real action is.", "Comparing six of the leading developed countries \u2014 the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain \u2014 I found that not only has productivity growth been slowing across the board in recent decades, but also that the gaps in productivity growth among these rich nations are narrowing sharply. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, productivity was growing much faster in the United States than in Germany or Japan, but that advantage has largely disappeared in this decade.", "The reasons for this convergence are complex, possibly having to do with the way production technology now spreads quickly across borders. But this trend spans the developed world, and it basically holds regardless of which two countries you compare, which should raise doubts about how any one country, including the United States, can regain a distinct economic advantage by focusing only on reviving productivity.", "Which brings us back to babies and immigrants. Like productivity, population growth has been slowing worldwide in recent decades, the big difference being that the gaps among the rich nations are increasingly significant. In the 1960s the United States population growth rate averaged 1.2 percent, or 50 percent higher than Europe\u2019s and about the same as Japan\u2019s. By the late 1960s, population growth peaked worldwide because of the spread of birth control and other cultural shifts, but it has slowed much more gradually in the United States than in its rivals.", "In the past decade, American population growth has averaged 0.8 percent a year, eight times faster than Europe\u2019s, and Japan\u2019s population has not grown at all. Increasingly, then, the underlying difference between the fast- and slow-growing economies is explained more by the differences in population growth than by productivity. And the United States now relies more than ever on demographics to defend its economic power. In the past decade, population growth, including immigration, has accounted for roughly half of the potential economic growth rate in the United States, compared with just one-sixth in Europe, and none in Japan.", "Since 2005, per capita gross domestic product has grown on average by 0.6 percent a year in the United States, exactly the same rate as in Japan and virtually the same rate as in the 19 nations of the eurozone. In other words, if it weren\u2019t for the boost from babies and immigrants, the United States economy would look much like those supposed laggards, Europe and Japan.", "Indeed, if the United States population had been growing as slowly as Japan\u2019s over the last two decades, its share of the global economy would be just 15 percent, not the 25 percent it holds today.", "Moreover, immigrants make a surprisingly big contribution to population growth. In the United States, immigrants have accounted for a third to nearly a half of population growth for decades. In other countries with Anglo-Saxon roots \u2014 Canada, Australia and Britain \u2014 immigrants have accounted for more than half of population growth over the past decade. Those economies have also been growing faster than their counterparts in the rest of Europe or Japan. But much of that advantage would have disappeared without their population advantage.", "Politically, the irony of this moment is stark. Population growth is increasingly important as an economic force and is increasingly driven by immigration. Yet now along comes a new breed of nationalists, rising on the strength of their promises to limit immigration. And they have been especially successful in countries where anti-immigrant sentiment has run strong, including the United States and Britain.", "Immigration has been expanding the United States population at a rate of about one million people a year over the last decade. It\u2019s not clear exactly how much President Trump\u2019s policies will reduce the net flow of immigrants, given that he has yet to articulate a broad-based immigration program. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has been more explicit, promising to cut the net inflow to the \u201csustainable level\u201d of under 100,000 immigrants a year, down from an average of 250,000 in the last decade. For these leaders, delivering on these anti-immigrant messages may now be politically imperative, but it will seriously handicap their economies in the global growth sweepstakes.", "History is littered with examples of emerging nations that have failed to generate enough jobs for a booming young population. But virtually no nation has ever sustained rapid economic growth without strong population growth. And at a time when every major country including the United States faces continued decline in population growth, workers are an increasingly precious source of national economic strength.", "In the long run, governments have limited avenues to increase the growth rate of the labor force, which is unaffected by short-term fluctuations in unemployment. Even enticing the \u201cforgotten men\u201d \u2014 those no longer looking for work \u2014 back into the labor force can have only limited impact. The main reason fewer Americans participate in the labor force is not because they are discouraged, but because they are getting older.", "In recent decades nations from Australia to France to Singapore have foreseen the looming economic impact of slower population growth, offering families \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d to have more kids \u2014 but typically with little impact on the birthrate or the economy. The impulse to procreate may be one of the few areas of human endeavor that remains beyond the reach of government mandarins. In contrast, regulating immigration remains a relatively simple task, and if immigrants are properly assimilated, they can have an immediate impact on the size of the work force.", "It would be unrealistic to imagine that hard economic logic will turn the anti-global, anti-foreign tide any time soon. So the likely result is that the United States and Britain will go ahead and limit immigration. To the extent they do \u2014 and their rivals do not \u2014 they will undermine their key economic edge, and cede much of the growth advantage they have enjoyed over Europe and Japan."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/penn-state-prosecutors-fraternity-hazing-deaths.html": ["After downing a dangerous amount of alcohol and suffering severe internal injuries during a fraternity hazing, a 19-year-old college sophomore died.

They note that other organizations, like sports teams, also engage in hazing; at Florida A&M University, ritual abuse in the marching band killed a student in 2011, and several band members were prosecuted. Some of the deadly episodes that have been labeled fraternity hazing \u2014 at the University at Albany and Virginia State University \u2014 involved loosely organized groups with no national affiliation or school recognition.", "There are no figures kept by the government or higher education groups of hazing incidents, student deaths, excessive drinking or fraternity discipline; individual schools and fraternities generally resist sharing internal data. But in 2013, Bloomberg News documented more than 60 deaths over eight years in fraternity activities, many of them involving initiation rituals for would-be members and heavy drinking.", "Dr. Barron said university presidents around the country had been expanding educational programs to discourage drinking, creating stronger rules and, when all else failed, revoking fraternity charters.

Fierberg, a lawyer who specializes in suing fraternities and universities, said that while a few colleges had changed, most were unwilling to alienate alumni donors who belonged to fraternities.", "\u201cThe central problem is that in a fraternity house, kids, most of whom cannot legally drink, are in charge of getting and serving alcohol,\u201d he said.", "He noted that Mr. Piazza was left unconscious for hours before anyone sought help. \u201cThat would not have happened in an on-campus dorm,\u201d Mr. Fierberg said.", "Experts say the increase in prosecutions stems not only from a shift in attitudes but also from the ubiquity of electronic evidence.

When the whole process was over, I realized something incredible: To navigate all of the niggling details surrounding this one commercial transaction \u2014 figuring out what to buy, which accessories I needed, how and where to install it, and whom to hire to do so \u2014 I had dealt with only a single ubiquitous corporation: Amazon.", "It wasn\u2019t just the TV. As I began combing through other recent household decisions, I found that in 2016, nearly 10 percent of my household\u2019s commercial transactions flowed through the Seattle retailer, more by far than any other company my family dealt with. What\u2019s more, with its Echos, Fire TV devices, audiobooks, movies and TV shows, Amazon has become, for my family, more than a mere store. It is my confessor, my keeper of lists, a provider of food and culture, an entertainer and educator and handmaiden to my children.", "This may sound over the top. But what about you? I suspect that if you closely examine your own life, there\u2019s a good chance some other technology company occupies the same role for you as Amazon does for me: as warden of a very comfortable corporate prison.", "This is the most glaring and underappreciated fact of internet-age capitalism: We are, all of us, in inescapable thrall to one of the handful of American technology companies that now dominate much of the global economy. I speak, of course, of my old friends the Frightful Five: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.", "The five are among the most valuable companies on the planet, collectively worth trillions. (Apple reached $800 billion in market capitalization this week, the first of any public company to do so, and the others may not be far behind.) And despite the picture of Silicon Valley as a roiling sea of disruption, these five have gotten only stronger and richer over time.", "Their growth has prompted calls for greater regulation and antitrust intervention. There\u2019s rising worry, too, over their softer, noneconomic influence over culture and information \u2014 for instance, fears over how Facebook might affect democracies \u2014 as well as the implicit threat they pose to the jurisdictions of world governments.", "These are all worthy topics for discussion, but they are also fairly cold and abstract. So a better way to appreciate the power of these five might be to take the very small view instead of the very large \u2014 to examine the role each of them plays in your own day-to-day activities, and the particular grip each holds on your psyche.", "So, last week I came up with a fun game: If an evil, tech-phobic monarch forced you to abandon each of the Frightful Five, in which order would you do so, and how much would your life deteriorate as a result? To help answer this, please take a moment with this column\u2019s companion quiz.", "When I went through the thought experiment, I found that dropping the first couple of tech giants was pretty easy \u2014 but after that the process became progressively more unbearable. For me, Facebook was the first to go. I tend to socialize online using Twitter, Apple\u2019s messaging system, and Slack, the office-chat app, so losing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s popular service (and its subsidiaries, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) was not such a big deal.", "Next, for me, was Microsoft, which I found slightly more difficult to quit. I don\u2019t normally use any Windows devices, but Microsoft\u2019s word-processing program, Word, is an essential tool for me, and I\u2019d hate to lose it.", "In third place, full of regrets: Apple. There\u2019s nothing I use more than my iPhone, and close behind are my MacBook and iMac 5K, which may be the best computer I\u2019ve ever owned. Abandoning Apple would prompt deep and truly annoying rearrangements in my life, including braving Samsung\u2019s bad software.

It\u2019s here that you begin to confront how thoroughly the Frightful Five have woven their way into our lives, and how completely we\u2019ve come to depend on them.", "In fourth place, for me, was Google. I just can\u2019t fathom living without it. Without the world\u2019s best search engine, my job would become well-nigh impossible. Without YouTube, it would become significantly less entertaining. Without everything else Google makes \u2014 email, maps, calendar, translation software, photo storage and the Android mobile operating system, which I\u2019d need after ditching Apple \u2014 I\u2019d be relegated to a life of some poor soul from long ago (say, 1992).", "And then, finally, we confront the master of my domain. I have been shopping at Amazon almost since the moment it went online in the 1990s. (I was a curious college student, I liked to experiment.) Every year since, as my life got busier and accreted more responsibility (in other words, as I became more and more of a stereotypical dad), Amazon took on an ever-greater role in my life.", "When the kids were born, it became my household\u2019s Costco \u2014 supplier of diapers and other baby gear. Then it began to launch a series of services designed to remove any decision-making from shopping: My toilet paper, paper towels and other consumables now come to my house on schedule, no thinking required. Then Amazon launched media, and I was more hooked: It had me for packaged goods, so why not movies and TV shows, too?", "A few years ago I would have thought that was the limit. Then came Echo, the company\u2019s talking computer, which speaks through a persona known as Alexa, and which has infected my family like a happy virus.", "Echo has a way of ingratiating itself into one\u2019s most mundane moments. I rewired my household\u2019s lights to be able to control them through Alexa. I changed the kind of coffee I buy so that I could tell Alexa to reorder it. When Amazon announced, this week, a new screen-enabled Echo, and a feature to let Echos act as phones, I experienced another frisson of possibility. Amazon, I see now, is well on its way to becoming my household\u2019s brain, a kind of butler in the sky that runs the place for me.", "Which brings me back to my new TV. Did you know that Amazon now sells not just goods but also home services? If you buy a TV, it will offer to sell you a wall mount, and if you buy the mount, it will offer to send someone to your house to install the equipment for a surprisingly reasonable fee. What might, in the past, have taken a trip to several stores, a truck, some tools, some friends, and many hours now gets done in a handful of clicks.", "One evening three days after I\u2019d ordered the TV, the Amazon men came by and set up the whole thing while I cooked dinner.", "If such a future makes you blanch, that\u2019s the right reaction. I have fallen victim to the convenience trap, and you\u2019re right to laugh at me, and also to spin dystopian visions from my behavior \u2014 a future in which many others do as I do, in which vast portions of commercial activity flow through this single online store. And sure, you can decide to opt out; you can drive to Target, your life won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t patronize Amazon.", "But if it\u2019s not Amazon for you, it\u2019ll be another of the five.

But the House press gallery forbids photography; we would have to type out descriptions of any visuals we wanted to capture. We also faced another challenge: hand-entering 431 votes split among four wall-size screens. Worse, the press seats were beneath the screens, making them hard to see. Several ill-placed wall lamps added to the difficulty. And once the voting period ended, the screens turned off, and the vote tally disappeared.", "On my test runs, the press area of the chamber was empty.

A peasant girl who had survived war and rape in her rural village, she had migrated to Da Nang to escape persecution from both Vietnamese Communists and anti-Communists. In 1972 she married an American and moved to the United States, and in 1989 she would publish her powerful autobiographical account of being caught between two sides, \u201cWhen Heaven and Earth Changed Places.\u201d In 2017, it remains perhaps the only first-person book in English about the experiences of Vietnamese villagers caught in the crossfire of the Vietnam War. In her life and work, Ms. Hayslip embodies my broad definition of what it means to be Vietnamese, an identity that includes those in Vietnam or in the diaspora, as well as those who write in Vietnamese or in other languages, in this case English.", "I came across her book as a college student at Berkeley in the early 1990s. It moved me deeply, not only because it was a compelling memoir, but also because it was one of the few books in English by a Vietnamese writer. (Co-written, in her case, with Jay Wurts.) Searching for my own history as a Vietnamese refugee brought to the United States by an American war in my country of origin, I had not found much available to me in English, either in the original or in translation. The overwhelming amount of American writing about the war was by Americans, and it was, not surprisingly, about Americans.", "There were a few exceptions. Tran Van Dinh was a former diplomat from the South, the Republic of Vietnam, who stayed in America and wrote two novels dealing with the Vietnam War, \u201cNo Passenger on the River\u201d (1965) and \u201cBlue Dragon, White Tiger\u201d (1983). As a precocious child who read everything I could about the war, I came across the latter in the public library of San Jose, Calif., my hometown, and was puzzled by its anomalousness. Even then I knew that it was rare to find Vietnamese writers in the United States speaking about this war, or to hear any Vietnamese voices at all in mainstream America.", "Immersed in the stories, feelings and memories of the Vietnamese refugee community in which I grew up, I was determined to tell some of those stories, for I knew that Americans as a whole knew very little about them. Only a small cadre of Americans believed that it was necessary and urgent to learn more about Vietnamese voices and experiences, without which a more complete American understanding of the Vietnam War would never happen. American ignorance of Vietnamese history, culture and politics helped draw the United States into a war and a country that it did not comprehend. This pattern of ignorance arguably continues today, both in terms of what Americans continue to ignore about Vietnam and what Americans refuse to know about the Middle East. Literature plays an important role as a corrective to this ignorance.", "Thinking back to Tran Van Dinh, I wonder if he was lonely as the only Vietnamese novelist in America of his time. Now we have no shortage of Vietnamese Americans writing in English, as well as translations of Vietnamese-language literature into English. But a lack of knowledge that this literature even exists continues. For most Americans and the world, \u201cVietnam\u201d means the \u201cVietnam War,\u201d and the Vietnam War means the American war, with novels written by American men about American soldiers. While their experiences are important, they are hardly representative of the Vietnam War, much less Vietnam.", "As the writer Le Thi Diem Thuy and so many others have said, time and again, Vietnam is a country, not a war.

His stories reveal the complexities of postwar life in a disillusioned Vietnam, struggling to rebuild itself and to reconcile the hypocrisies and failures of Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese state with the noble wartime rhetoric of the Communist Party.

Like much of Vietnamese and Vietnamese-American literature dealing with the war, her novel shows that war affects more than soldiers or men. The Vietnam War was not remarkable in killing more civilians than soldiers, and in turning millions of civilians into refugees whose experiences were much more traumatic than those of the many American soldiers who never actually saw combat. Vietnamese-American literature forces its readers to acknowledge that a narrow definition of war that features only soldiers is inaccurate.", "Over and over, Vietnamese-American literature shows the war\u2019s traumatic effect on civilians and refugees (Vu Tran\u2019s gangster noir, \u201cDragonfish,\u201d or Aimee Phan\u2019s \u201cWe Should Never Meet,\u201d about Vietnamese and Amerasian orphans, or Lan Cao\u2019s \u201cThe Lotus and the Storm,\u201d which connects the Vietnam War to the Iraq War, or Nguyen Qui Duc\u2019s \u201cWhere the Ashes Are,\u201d about the imprisonment of the author\u2019s father, a South Vietnamese governor); its devastating reshaping of postwar Vietnamese life (Andrew X.

They are each expanding their market opportunity, but also straying out of their zones of competitive advantage into areas of increasing rivalry. This convergence in strategy, products and tactics is a powerful inoculation to anticompetitive outcomes.", "Many of the recent monopoly arguments rely upon narrowly defining markets to make a rhetorical case, as well as hypothetical consumer harm.

But the claim that it has a monopoly over content providers, is risible. Even if Facebook were the singular acquirer of content, that would make it a monopsonist, not a monopolist. This distinction is critical because a monopsonist \u2014 who is the only buyer for a given set of suppliers \u2014 uses its power to squeeze input prices (like the sole employer in a town, keeping wages low). Whereas a monopolist uses its power to raise consumer prices.", "Facebook\u2019s importance as a major traffic source for many content sites is self-evident, but publishers still go directly to consumers and use other significant intermediaries \u2014 notably Google, which is owned by Alphabet. The woes of the publishing industry are because of the impact of the internet, not Facebook.", "Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook\u2019s power over publishers produces a \u201cdead weight loss\u201d (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook\u2019s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.", "The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn\u2019t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe.

Amazon regularly gets tarred with this brush. About 80 million people now take a Prime subscription bundle, according to industry estimates. Weaving together multiple products and services under one compelling offering gives Amazon a formidable advantage to which its rivals are scrambling to react. But even so, Amazon is so far only exhibiting signs of market dominance in the market for books.

Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.", "It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.", "While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown.

The attackers based their weapon on vulnerabilities that were stolen from the National Security Agency and published last month.", "Security experts at Symantec, which in the past has accurately identified attacks mounted by the United States, Israel and North Korea, found early versions of the ransomware, called WannaCry, that used tools that were also deployed against Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Bangladesh central bank last year and Polish banks in February. American officials said Monday that they had seen the same similarities.", "All of those attacks were ultimately linked to North Korea; President Barack Obama formally charged the North in late 2014 with destroying computers at Sony in retaliation for a comedy, \u201cThe Interview,\u201d that envisioned a C.I.A. plot to kill Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s leader.", "The computer code used in the ransomware bore some striking similarities to the code used in those three attacks. That code has not been widely used, and has been seen only in attacks by North Korean-linked hackers. Researchers at Google and Kaspersky, a Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, confirmed the coding similarities.", "Those clues alone are not definitive, however. Hackers often borrow and retrofit one another\u2019s attack methods, and government agencies are known to plant \u201cfalse flags\u201d in their code to throw off forensic investigators.", "\u201cAt this time, all we have is a temporal link,\u201d said Eric Chien, an investigator at Symantec who was among the first to identify the Stuxnet worm, the American- and Israeli-led attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and North Korea\u2019s effort to steal millions from the Bangladeshi bank. \u201cWe want to see more coding similarities,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cto give us more confidence.\u2019\u2019", "The new leads about the source of the attacks came as technology executives raised an alarm about another feature of the attacks: They were based on vulnerabilities in Microsoft systems that were found by the N.S.A. and apparently stolen from it.", "In a blog post on Microsoft\u2019s website over the weekend, Brad Smith, the company\u2019s president, asked what would happen if the United States military lost control of \u201csome of its Tomahawk missiles\u201d and discovered that a criminal group was using them to threaten a damaging strike. It was a potent analogy, and an unusually public airing of the newest split in the Silicon Valley-Washington divide.", "Over the past few months, it has become clear that the intelligence community\u2019s version of Tomahawks \u2014 the \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d the N.S.A. and C.I.A. have spent billions of dollars to develop to break into foreign computers and foil Iranian nuclear programs or North Korean missiles \u2014 are being turned against everyday computer users around the world.", "\u201cWe have seen vulnerabilities stored by the C.I.A. show up on WikiLeaks,\u201d Mr. Smith wrote, \u201cand now this vulnerability stolen from the N.S.A. has affected customers around the world.\u201d", "The N.S.A.\u2019s tools were published last month by a hacking group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which enabled hackers to bake them into their ransomware, which then spread rapidly through unpatched Microsoft computers, locking up everything in its wake.", "There is no evidence that the North Koreans were involved in the actual theft of the N.S.A. hacking tools. There are many theories, but the favorite hypothesis among intelligence officials is that an insider, probably a contractor, stole the information, much as Edward J. Snowden lifted a different trove of information from the N.S.A. four years ago.", "But hackers quickly seized on the published vulnerabilities to wreak havoc on computer systems that were not \u201cpatched\u201d in recent months, after the N.S.A. quietly told Microsoft about the flaw in their systems. The damage wreaked in recent days could well escalate into the billions of dollars, security experts say, particularly now that any criminal, terrorist or nation state has the ability to tease the tools apart and retrofit them into their own hacking tools.", "Not surprisingly, government officials say it is not entirely their fault. They will not confirm or deny what Mr. Smith says outright: That these \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d come out of America\u2019s growing cyberarsenal. At a news conference at the White House on Monday, Thomas Bossert, President Trump\u2019s Homeland Security adviser, told reporters, \u201cThis was not an exploit developed by the N.S.A. to hold organizations ransom,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a vulnerability exploit that was part of a much larger tool put together by the culpable parties.\u201d", "\u201cThe provenance of the underlying vulnerability is not of as much concern to me,\u201d Mr. Bossert said, stepping around the delicate question of the N.S.A.\u2019s role.", "The weapons used in the attacks that started Friday, government officials insist, were cobbled together from many sources. And the fault, they argue, lies with whoever turned them into weapons \u2014 or maybe with Microsoft itself, for not having a system in place to make sure that when they issue a patch that neutralizes such attacks, everyone around the world takes the time to fix their systems. Or with the victims, who failed to run their security updates made available two months ago, or who continue to use so-called \u201clegacy\u201d software that Microsoft no longer supports.", "When asked about the source of the attack, Mr. Bossert said on Monday, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d He told reporters at the White House. \u201cAttribution can be difficult. I don\u2019t want to say we have no clues. But I stand assured that the best and brightest are working on this hack.\u201d", "As Mr. Bossert was speaking to reporters, yet another N.S.A. hacking tool, very similar to the one used in the weekend\u2019s ransomware attacks, was being retrofitted by cybercriminals and put up for sale on the underground dark web. In private hacking forums, cybercriminals were discussing how to develop more than a dozen other N.S.A. hacking tools for criminal use.", "Another round of attacks using the N.S.A. tools could well affect another big issue that the Obama administration debated and never resolved when it left office: whether the government can demand that all companies assure that investigators can \u201cunlock\u201d encrypted communications. Before he was fired last week, James B.

That law permits federally funded educational institutions to share students\u2019 personally identifiable information with certain school vendors, provided those companies use that information only for school purposes.", "Instead, Google initially proposed abiding by its own company policies, Mr. Wagner said, and followed up by emailing links to those policies \u2014 terms that the company could change at any time. \u201cOur lawyers were a little bit apoplectic when they were given links to security things,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a link that can change.\u201d", "Mr. Nelson, the former education official in Oregon, reported similar frustrations over student privacy when his state negotiated a contract with Google. \u201cThat\u2019s why it took 16 months,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Bout of Google said that the tech company had \u201calways taken the compliance needs of our education users seriously.\u201d He added that \u201ceven early versions\u201d of the company\u2019s agreements for its education apps had \u201caddressed\u201d the federal education privacy law.", "Today, Google\u2019s standard agreements with schools for its education apps include a commitment to comply with that law.", "Since adopting Google apps, Chicago schools have saved about $1.6 million annually on email and related costs, a district spokesman said.", "Google then enlisted Mr. Tidmarsh, who now works in technology at a health care company, to share his enthusiasm by contributing to a Google blog.

It ran on Google\u2019s Chrome operating system and revolved largely around web apps, making it cheaper and often faster to boot up than traditional laptops loaded with locally stored software.", "Although Google had a business audience in mind for Chromebooks, reviewers complained that the devices were of limited use without internet access.", "But there was one interested audience: public schools. In the fall of 2011, Google invited school administrators to its Chicago office to meet Mr. Casap, hoping to interest them in Chromebooks.", "Mr. Casap didn\u2019t talk tech specs. Instead, he held the audience spellbound as he described the challenges he had faced as a Latino student growing up on welfare in a tough Manhattan neighborhood.", "His message: Education is the great equalizer, and technology breaks down barriers between rich and poor students.", "In the audience, Jason Markey, principal of East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Ill., was converted. Students in his blue-collar district near O\u2019Hare International Airport faced similar struggles. On the spot, Mr. Markey said, he abandoned his previous plans to buy Microsoft Windows laptops for 3,500 high school students. Now he wanted Chromebooks for them instead.", "\u201cI went up to Jaime immediately after the presentation and said, \u2018Are you guys ready to ship these?\u2019\u201d Mr. Markey said.", "Then Mr. Markey went back to his district to inform administrators and teachers that he wanted to order an unproven device that most of them had never heard of. \u201cIt was a tough announcement to make,\u201d he conceded.", "It was an opportune moment for Google to pitch lower-cost laptops to schools. Districts administering new online standardized tests needed laptops for students to take them on. And Google offered a robust way for districts to manage thousands of computers online: They could lock Chromebooks remotely so that students could not search the web during tests, or disable missing ones.", "Another attraction: The Chromebook\u2019s cloud-storage approach made sharing among students easier. They could gain access to their documents no matter which Chromebook they used.", "\u201cThat is one of the big reasons we took off in education,\u201d said Rajen Sheth, who oversees Google\u2019s Chromebook business. \u201cIn less than 10 seconds, a student can grab a Chromebook and be off and running.\u201d", "The Chromebook\u2019s price and usability fit neatly into Mr. Casap\u2019s argument that, for students, access to technology was an issue of fairness. \u201cI didn\u2019t want us to be vendors in the space,\u201d he said of Google\u2019s education philosophy in an interview last year at the SXSWedu conference in Austin, Tex. \u201cI wanted us to be thought leaders, to have a point of view.\u201d", "As he spoke, a group of students trooped past wearing purple superhero capes emblazoned with the logo for Microsoft OneNote, a rival classroom service. Spotting the capes, Mr. Casap said, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d He added dryly, \u201cI love gimmicks.\u201d", "Some critics, though, contend that the equity argument for technology is itself a gimmick that promotes a self-serving Silicon Valley agenda: playing on educators\u2019 altruism to get schools to buy into laptops and apps.", "\u201cIt centers learning on technology, not students,\u201d said Mr. Fitzgerald, the learning app analyst. \u201cIt is a very narrow lens on equity that leaves out things like student-teacher ratios.\u201d", "(Mr. Casap said he would not advise school districts with deficiencies in areas like teaching or student support services to invest first in classroom technology.)", "Mr. Markey, the East Leyden High School principal, had another equity concern. About 20 percent of his students lacked home internet access, he said. How would they do their homework on a Chromebook, which required a connection?", "Google was already working on offline capabilities, Mr. Casap said, and ultimately modified its education apps so that students could take their work home on Chromebooks, then upload homework the next day using school Wi-Fi.", "Soon, so many educators were visiting Leyden to see its tech setup that the district started an annual conference to host them. Last summer, Mr. Casap gave the keynote address. And Mr. Markey now occasionally works as a paid speaker for EdTechTeam, a company that holds Google boot camps for teachers.", "In 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States, up from less than 1 percent in 2012, according to Futuresource Consulting, the research firm. Google does not make money directly from Chromebooks \u2014 which are manufactured by Samsung, Acer and other companies \u2014 but it does charge school districts a management service fee of $30 per device. Chicago Public Schools has spent about $33.5 million on 134,000 Chromebooks.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever remember when a specific device and platform has taken off so quickly across different kinds of schools,\u201d said David Andrade, a K-12 education strategist at CDW-G, a leading Chromebook dealer.", "In 2014, Google\u2019s education juggernaut hit a speed bump in Chicago Public Schools. The culture clash illuminated profound differences between Google, a build-it-first-and-tweak-it-later Silicon Valley company, and a large, bureaucratic school district with student-protection rules to uphold.", "Google had hoped that Chicago would become an early adopter of Google Classroom, its new app to help teachers take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks. In August 2014, a Google team flew to Chicago to demo Classroom at Googlepalooza, the school district\u2019s annual teacher conference.", "But Google had not anticipated Margaret Hahn.", "At the time, she was the school system\u2019s director of technology change management. Early on, she said, Google had invited teachers to try an initial version of Classroom, without first contacting the school district\u2019s technology administrators \u2014 effectively making a district policy decision from the outside. Now Google wanted Chicago Public Schools to switch on the app districtwide, she said, before determining whether it complied with local student-protection policies.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t just hand out product and hope it will work in the classroom,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. \u201cYou have to work with the districts to make sure that you are keeping the kids and the teachers safe.\u201d", "Jim Siegl, technology architect for Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia, the nation\u2019s 10th-largest school district, reported a similar experience.", "He said that Google had directly contacted certain Fairfax teachers who had volunteered to beta-test Classroom, giving them early access to the app. In so doing, he said, the company ignored the Google settings he had selected that were supposed to give his district control over which new Google services to switch on in its schools.", "Mr. Siegl added that Google did not tell him which, or even how many, Fairfax teachers the company had enlisted to try out the Classroom app. And by the time he was able to shut off the app, Mr. Siegl said, teachers had already set up virtual classrooms on the service and started using it with their students.", "He said he complained to Google.", "\u201cBecause of who they are and how sprawling the ecosystem is,\u201d Mr. Siegl said, \u201cthey are held up and need to meet a higher standard than any other vendor schools deal with.\u201d", "In an emailed statement, Mr. Bout said of the company\u2019s core education services, \u201cIn all cases, the use of these services is tied to the approval of an administrator who is responsible for overseeing a school\u2019s domain.\u201d", "Classroom was the brainchild of Mr. Rochelle, who started Google\u2019s education apps group, and Zach Yeskel, a Google product manager and former high school math teacher. They said they envisioned the app as a kind of \u201cmission control\u201d dashboard where teachers could more efficiently manage tasks like assigning and correcting homework, freeing teachers to spend more time with students. To create the app, they collaborated closely with teachers.", "In May 2014, Google posted an announcement online, asking for volunteers to beta-test Classroom. More than 100,000 teachers worldwide responded, the company said, illustrating Google\u2019s power to rapidly stoke demand among educators. That August, Google made Classroom available to schools.", "\u201cThey developed a real momentum with teachers,\u201d said Mr. Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. \u201cGoogle Classroom was key to that.\u201d", "That was too fast for Chicago Public Schools.", "Administrators there wanted to test Classroom first to make sure it complied with district policies and fit their teachers\u2019 needs. So they set up a pilot program, involving about 275 teachers and several thousand students, to run for the entire school year. Every month, Ms. Hahn said, she collected teachers\u2019 feedback and sent it to Google.", "\u201cWe wanted to help them do it right,\u201d Ms. Hahn said.", "One immediate problem administrators identified: School board policy required employees to keep records of cyberbullying and other problematic comments. But Classroom initially did not do that. If a student wrote something offensive and a teacher deleted it, there was no archive.", "\u201cIt took us a long time to get them to do it,\u201d Ms. Hahn said. She added, \u201cUnfortunately, there were things that a district of our size needed that Google did not understand.\u201d", "Google eventually added an archiving feature. The next fall, the Chicago district switched on Classroom. Teachers there later vetted other Google products, effectively becoming a test lab for the company. \u201cWe have said to Google many times, \u2018If it works in Chicago, it will work anywhere,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hahn said.", "Mr. Bout of Google agreed, saying that Chicago Public Schools often made more stringent demands on Google than other school districts did.", "\u201cIf you can get it in Chicago, it\u2019s sort of like you have passed a lot of tests,\u201d Mr. Bout said, \u201cand then you can probably get it into any school in the country.\u201d", "The relationship has benefited Chicago Public Schools, too.", "In 2015, the district was reeling from a scandal: The Justice Department charged the Chicago Public Schools former chief executive Barbara Byrd-Bennett with steering more than $23 million in no-bid contracts to two school vendors in exchange for kickbacks. Ms. Byrd-Bennett later pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced in April to four and a half years in prison.", "The fact that Chicago schools were vetting Google products, like the Classroom app, gave administrators a welcome counternarrative of the district\u2019s altruistically helping Google debug its products for schools across the country. And it remains a good story even as the district now faces a financial crisis.", "Today, about 15 million primary- and secondary-school students in the United States use Classroom, Google said.", "Google\u2019s ability to test its products on such a monumental scale has stoked concerns about whether the tech giant is exploiting public-school teachers and students for free labor. \u201cIt\u2019s a private company very creatively using public resources \u2014 in this instance, teachers\u2019 time and expertise \u2014 to build new markets at low cost,\u201d said Patricia Burch, an associate professor of education at the University of Southern California.", "Mr. Rochelle, the Google executive, said that it was important for the company to have large, diverse sets of educational users giving feedback \u2014 otherwise it might develop products that worked for only a few of them.", "\u201cOur goal is to build products that help educators and students,\u201d Mr. Rochelle said. \u201cTeachers tell us they appreciate the opportunity to get involved early and help shape our products to meet their needs.\u201d", "Ms. Hahn, who now works for the same health care company as Mr. Tidmarsh, agrees. She said that schools were getting something substantive in return from Google, something they had rarely received from other tech companies: quick product improvements that responded to teachers\u2019 feedback.", "After the Chicago schools tested Classroom, she said, members of Google\u2019s education team started directly contacting her when they were seeking educators to try out the company\u2019s innovations. \u201cThey no longer just turn stuff on,\u201d she said. \u201cThey come to us first.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/technology/personaltech/getting-google-cards-to-load-again.html": ["Q.

Magazines and ad agencies are measuring a model\u2019s attraction not just by his or her physical dimensions, but also by the number of followers.

I understand the Metro section can\u2019t cover every fire and shooting in the city. But this oil spill seemed of more interest than that.

More than two dozen employees have taken advantage of that offer.", "Audible is among a handful of companies around the country offering housing assistance to its workers, although such benefits tend to happen in areas where the cost of living is extraordinarily high, which is not the case for Newark.", "For example, Addepar, an investment software company, offers rental assistance for employees in Silicon Valley and in New York City, two pricey markets. A March survey for the Los Angeles Business Council found that out of 14 large employers in the area, about half offered workers some kind of help with housing, but most programs were reserved for senior staff members and helped with mortgages, not rent. \u201cOne of the things that really stresses people out is affording the cost of housing,\u201d said Jeffrey Lubell, the director of housing and community initiatives for Abt Associates, a research and consulting firm. Companies are \u201cgoing to be in a better position to both attract and retain workers if they can offer a strong housing package.\u201d", "The idea that your boss might provide housing has roots in the 19th century, when many company towns were best known for subpar housing and overpriced company stores. By the 1920s, many company towns vanished as Americans bought cars and began commuting. In its prime, a town such as Hershey, Pa., where the chocolate company mowed the lawn for you, \u201cwas a way to attract the kinds of workers that you\u2019d want to get,\u201d said Hardy Green, the author of \u201cThe Company Town\u201d (Basic Books, 2010). Today, the company town has been reinvented as the enviable corporate campus, with such technology companies as Google and Facebook luring workers to a home away from home with foosball, masseuses and private chefs, not to mention endless work hours.", "But how do you draw workers to a place without much of a draw?", "Only about 70 Audible employees working in the headquarters live in Newark, and that number includes those who took the company up on its housing offer.

No longer can she text her friends and immediately meet one somewhere in the neighborhood.", "The move has had another significant impact on her life \u2014 nearly eliminating her commute.

Already, Ms. Paquette cooks more at home and has taken on more volunteer opportunities with the company.", "Audible didn\u2019t decide to help pay the rent because it was concerned workers spent too much time in transit. Yet this unintended consequence may be the one that delivers the biggest impact. Moving a few dozen workers to Newark isn\u2019t going to save the city. But reducing commute time could drastically improve a worker\u2019s quality of life. The hours we spend each day sitting on trains, buses and in our cars contributes to our collective misery. Anyone who has ever had an hourslong commute knows that time spent in transit means less time to do things like go to the gym, hang out with friends or even just pet the cat.

Were they dead at all?\u201d President Assad said of the images broadcast on TV screens around the world, adding, \u201cHow can you verify a video?\u201d", "There is a simple answer to that question: Find a computer, get on Google Earth and match what you see in the video to the streets and buildings. For the six years since the Syrian conflict began, I\u2019ve used these basic tools \u2014 and widely accessible information \u2014 to verify images broadcast on television.", "My investigation into the veracity of the alleged April 4 chemical attack began with a YouTube video of bombs dropping over Khan Sheikhoun. Using social media, I found and interviewed people who had witnessed the bombings. I obtained exclusive video and photos of the buildings that were bombed from residents of the town. Using GPS coordinates and other mapping techniques, I determined their exact location.", "I supplemented my reporting with notes from our Middle Eastern correspondents Anne Barnard, Hwaida Saad and Patrick Kingsley, who interviewed witnesses soon after the attack. I spoke with human rights investigators and weapons experts conducting their own analysis. I found more videos uploaded to YouTube and Facebook by residents of the area by searching for the Arabic spelling of Khan Sheikhoun. I examined other videos gathered by the journalist Eliot Higgins and the social media news agency Storyful.", "Our investigation into the question of whether a chemical attack took place in Syria on April 4 relied on a fairly novel combination of forensic mapping techniques with analysis of witness content to enhance our reporting. Our work confirmed, conclusively, that a chemical attack had taken place in Khan Sheikhoun, and provided a concrete example of what we mean when we talk of video and the way it can strengthen our storytelling.", "In combination with graphics and on-the-ground reporting, our video forensic work also showed conclusively that the attack on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun took place hours before Syria \u2014 and its Russian allies \u2014 say that it occurred and cast doubt on the official account of the attack that Russia provided.", "Here\u2019s what we found:", "Geolocation", "Khan Sheikhoun is a town of many minarets. We started our investigation by mapping these towers; they provide identifiable reference points that we linked to images in the first videos from the morning of the attack. We also mapped distant hills, the alignment of fields and houses, roads out of the town and a large mound in the center of the town.", "Take a look at the Google Earth/DigitalGlobe satellite image above. I placed an electronic pin on every towering minaret in this image and identified each by the shadows they cast. When I couldn\u2019t easily determine whether a particular structure was a mosque or a minaret, I referred to historical satellite imagery, available on Google Earth, to examine older images, taken from alternate camera angles or on clearer days when shadows were more distinct.", "By zooming in on terrain view, another feature of Google Earth, I simulated how the town looked from the ground. Terrain view doesn\u2019t provide an exact 3-D replica of the town, but it shows the contours of the ground as hills rise and fall. This allowed me to match the position of minarets against distant hills as the video shows, and put myself in the cameraman\u2019s shoes.", "Analyzing the camera position, it was clear that the video was filmed in Khan Sheikhoun, it was not video from another town. I established that the camera was positioned to the north of the town and was looking south.", "The location was important because it helped us to ascertain what time the video was filmed, which we could estimate based on the sunlight illuminating the minarets on the video.", "The uploader", "Who filmed it? I examined the uploader\u2019s YouTube, Google Plus, Twitter and Facebook profiles. In his social media history, he regularly talks about events in Khan Sheikhoun. His cover photos are pictures of Khan Sheikhoun. This and other information in his profiles indicated that he was a journalist or activist who lived in the town.", "His YouTube account contained several videos of bombings and other events related to the conflict that were filmed from the same northerly vantage point. The voice-over on these videos was the same voice that we heard on the April 4 video.", "Why was this important? It gave me confidence the video was shot by someone who regularly films events in his hometown \u2014 not someone who copies and reposts videos from elsewhere.", "Time of the attack", "The Syrian foreign minister, President Assad and a Russian military spokesman said the attack took place between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. that day. Video forensics, however, proves that it took place much earlier.", "According to SunCalc, the sun rose at around 6.17 a.m. on the morning of April 4, almost directly to the east (from the left in the video). This matched what we saw in the video \u2014 the left side of the minarets were facing the sun. Khan Sheikhoun sits below hills to the east, so the actual sunrise would be sometime after 6.17 a.m.", "My colleague Neil Collier made contact with the uploader, Mohamad Salom, and interviewed him at length. He corroborated the time of the bombing as early morning, soon after 6:35 a.m.", "Our network of sources in Syria put us in touch with other town residents. A second witness who had filmed the attack sent us more footage that I verified using the same mapping techniques. We interviewed this witness and found that the time frame he presented corroborated Mr. Salom\u2019s account.", "Doctors at hospitals in the area coordinate support services using WhatsApp, and a medic sent me screenshots of messages they sent in the hours after the attack. The Times\u2019s Beirut bureau chief, Ms. Barnard, and Ms. Saad, a Times reporter in Beirut, verified the messages with two independent medical sources. The timing of these communications was consistent with what additional open source material indicated was the time that multiple casualties connected with exposure to chemical agents was reported.", "All of this occurred hours before Russian and Syrian officials acknowledged that regular bombing missions had been carried out in Khan Sheikhoun. No other bombing runs were reported that morning until warplanes hit a hospital in Khan Sheikhoun after midday.", "The time difference is important because Russia and Syria have frequently distorted the location and timing of events throughout the conflict, a technique meant to discredit evidence posted on YouTube and other social platforms. (After a chemical weapons attack on Eastern Ghouta in 2013, Russia claimed that the event was staged because videos were uploaded before the time of the attack. They were proved wrong.) Here, President Assad described the attack on Khan Sheikhoun as a \u201c100 percent fabrication\u201d and tried to distort the time frame of Syria\u2019s military activity that day to raise questions about the videos posted online.", "Video-enhanced investigative work helped us set the record straight.", "What was hit?", "A Russian military spokesman suggested that Syrian aircraft bombed a \u201clarge depot\u201d on the \u201ceastern outskirts\u201d of the town where, he alleged, \u201cterrorists,\u201d or opposition forces, manufactured chemical weapons.", "However, there were no visible depots near the strike points on the videos taken that morning. Small buildings were hit, and people described them as homes.", "Note that the videos show conventional bombing and do not depict chemical weapons. However, witnesses told us that the chemical weapons were dropped in the same bombing mission and took place near the conventional strike points.", "A resident sent me photos of buildings blown out by the airstrikes. They were consistent with the images other residents had posted on social media that morning. Using VerExif.com, I extracted the metadata in the images and used it to determine the precise latitude and longitude of each photo.", "Using TerraServer and DigitalGlobe, I got new and old satellite images of the town, zoomed into the buildings\u2019 coordinates and saw that the damage matched exactly what we see in the photos. As does the rubble in the streets.", "The satellite verification also corroborated our interviews and established precisely what was hit \u2014 those small buildings that residents described as people\u2019s homes.", "Large depot", "Russia said that a \u201clarge depot\u201d was bombed on the \u201ceastern outskirts\u201d of the town. The only large buildings near the strike points that match this description are a bakery and a grain silo. I found archive footage on YouTube showing they had been targeted in the past. But satellite imagery from April 6 showed that they had suffered no recent damage.", "We neither received nor found evidence of any other points being hit in the eastern parts of the town that morning. This casts further serious doubt on Russia\u2019s story.", "The crater", "Town residents pointed to a crater on the road by the grain silo and bakery where the chemical weapons attack reportedly took place. Fresh scarring in the video indicated the crater was new and, again, before-and-after satellite imagery confirmed this.", "Though we are not certain what caused the crater, circumstantial evidence and witness testimony establish the crater as the site of the attack. Several town residents say planes passed over the town twice and dropped bombs across it.", "I spoke with Kareem Shaheen, a Guardian journalist who visited Khan Sheikhoun two days after the attack, and that is what residents told him. He also entered the grain silo and saw no signs of chemical weapons manufacture, as alleged by Russia.", "My colleague Neil Collier spoke with the activist Hadi Abdullah, who visited the town hours after the attack. Witnesses provided him with the same account: Four bombs were dropped on the town. He too filmed inside the grain silo.", "Rebel-held parts of Syria have a network of spotters that monitor warplanes. They share information with residents and rescuers in an effort to warn of impending strikes. According to information our Beirut bureau received that day, spotters saw a fighter plane over Khan Sheikhoun twice within a few minutes that morning. This corroborates the accounts we received from witnesses.", "Another activist who works in the town sent me a map marking where the chemical attack happened. This matched our satellite location of the crater. The source said the \u201cpopulation within the vicinity of [this] place were poisoned.\u201d", "A Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with 32 Khan Skeikhoun residents and published on May 1, supports our account of the timing and the attack.", "The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said that tests on victims and survivors found \u201cincontrovertible evidence\u201d that the chemical agent sarin or a sarin-like toxin was used in Khan Sheikhoun. And a French report published on April 26 detected traces of the chemical hexamine in samples from Khan Sheikhoun. Hexamine is an additive sometimes used in sarin that was found at the site of the 2013 chemical weapons attack in Eastern Ghouta; Syria claimed to have destroyed its entire stock of chemical weapons after this attack. The O.P.C.W. said it could not confirm that Syria was free of all chemical weapons and, in a 2016 report, it said that Syria must still explain the presence of four chemical agents.", "Our investigation does not prove who is responsible for the attack, nor does it attempt to. The O.P.C.W. said it intends to search the site as soon as it is safe to do so. What our investigation shows is how the visual evidence debunks Russia and Syria\u2019s claims about what happened that day. The evidence builds on the testimony gathered by others and puts Syria and Russia\u2019s account into serious doubt.", "This investigation offered a promising occasion to use new technologies to bolster and extend our reporting into new areas, and it nicely illustrates the importance and possibilities forensic mapping and visual storytelling present.", "Readers interested in learning more about the digital forensics community might like to look at the work of Forensic Architecture, Bellingcat, Storyful and the forensics teams at Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.

From the gross pre-election misjudgments to postelection bafflement, the best pundits are at a loss to accurately anticipate his response to matters like North Korean military aggressiveness or his moment-by-moment political gyrations and opinion reversals.

Connections for winning moves are enhanced; losing connections are pruned away. The network has no idea what it is doing or why one play is better than another. It isn\u2019t saddled with any confounding principles such as what constitutes socially acceptable or unacceptable behavior or which decisions might result in negative downstream consequences.", "Metaphorically, this process is reminiscent of Richard Dawkins\u2019s notion of the selfish gene. The goal of DNA is self-reproduction; the sole intent of Deep Mind or Watson is to win. When Deep Mind beat the world\u2019s best Go player, it did not consider the feelings of the loser or the potentially devastating effects of A.I. on future employment or personal identity. If any one quality could be ascribed to A.I. neural networks, it would be relentless \u201csingle-minded\u201d self-interest.", "Now up the stakes; instead of Go, Jeopardy, backgammon, poker and chess domination, ask a neural network to figure out the optimal strategy for the biggest game in town \u2014 the United States presidency. In this hypothetical, let\u2019s input and analyze all available written and spoken word \u2014 from mainstream media commentary to the most obscure one-off crank pamphlets. After running simulations of various hypotheses, the network will serve up its suggestions. It might show Trump which areas of the country are most likely to respond to personal appearances, which rallies and town hall meetings will generate the greatest photo op and TV coverage, and which publicly manifest personality traits will garner the most votes. If it determines that outrage is the only road to the presidency, it will tell Trump when and where his opinions must be scandalous and offensively polarizing.", "Further imagine that the Trump A.I. machine determines that the opinions most likely to get him elected have slim chances of being carried out once he is president. To the extent that traditional politicians are embarrassed by flip-flops or bound by ethical and moral values or both, they are likely to display a degree of restraint and hedging of controversial positions. Winning at any cost is at least partially balanced by underlying principles. Not so for a neural network. There is no cringe factor, no sense of anticipated embarrassment or humiliation with seemingly random changes of mind. There is no concern with subsequent disclosures of misrepresentations, falsifications and outright lies. As the U.C.L.A.

Asking why a network chose a particular action is like asking why Amazon might recommend James Ellroy and Elmore Leonard novels to someone who has just purchased \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u201d There is no underlying understanding of the nature of the books; the association is strictly a matter of analyzing Amazon\u2019s click and purchase data.

It is easy to come up with a list of likely motivating goals such as power, money, brand-name recognition, public praise, vindication, retribution and idolization. As recent history has shown us, these goals seem to vary from moment to moment. Unfortunately, a constantly shifting definition of what constitutes \u201cwinning\u201d further increases our inability to predict his behavior.", "A bitter irony: Criticism may have unintended positive rather than negative effects. In a poll last month, nearly 90 percent of Trump voters felt that media criticism of Trump only reinforced their view that the president is on the right track. As neural networks have no concept of fault, a failure of a policy won\u2019t be seen as illogical or ill conceived. Failure just means that you need to try another strategy (or get new staff members \u2014 as suggested by his advisers\u2019 phenomenally short half-life).", "As armchair psychologists, we have the gut feeling that with enough information and psychological savvy, we can figure out what makes Trump tick. Unfortunately there is no supporting evidence for this wishful thinking. Once we accept that Donald Trump represents a black-box, first-generation artificial-intelligence president driven solely by self-selected data and widely fluctuating criteria of success, we can get down to the really hard question confronting our collective future: Is there a way to affect changes in a machine devoid of the common features that bind humanity?"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/technology/uber-federal-inquiry-software-greyball.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber is the subject of a United States Department of Justice inquiry over a program that it used to deceive regulators who were trying to shut down its ride-hailing service.", "The inquiry concerns Uber\u2019s use of a software tool called Greyball, which the company developed in part to aid entrance into new markets where its service was not permitted.

Other people calling it a vanity project actually tells me more about them than it does about Evan.\u201d", "That kind of determination may raise the odds but says little about long-term success. The darkest theory about the failure of Medium to catch on as an influential writing site comes from Cliff Watson, a 46-year-old advertising executive and onetime Medium contributor from Omaha. He thinks it is already a relic of an earlier era, kind of like communicating by carrier pigeon or telegraph.", "\u201cMedium feels like the perfect Obama-era platform: minimal, distinguished, self-important, elevated,\u201d Mr. Watson says. \u201cBut as soon as the campaigns really ramped up their efforts in the primaries, we were living in a post-Obama world, metaphorically, and then literally.

After raising $130 million from investors, it had a valuation of $600 million last year.", "Yet the path to significant revenue seems as elusive as ever.", "Mr. Williams is dismissive of those who say making Medium viable is not merely difficult, but flat-out impossible. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this, and they\u2019re not,\u201d he says.", "The site is soliciting writers again.

It\u2019s tough, in that environment, to cobble together a medium-size internet business.

Teng has made this trip nearly a thousand times, but Husab always seems like a mirage: a virtual city stretching seven miles across the desert floor, from two vast open pits being gouged out of the rocky substratum to a processing plant that, on the last working day of 2016, produced its first drums of U\u2083O\u2088, the yellowcake that can be used to generate nuclear power (and also to make weapons). \u201cWe had a big ceremony that day,\u201d Teng says.", "One of the few university graduates from his village in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan Province, Teng is keenly aware of Husab\u2019s significance. It is not simply a lifeline for Namibia\u2019s struggling economy, one that the country estimates will increase its gross domestic product by 5 percent when the mine reaches full production next year. The uranium itself, almost all of which will go to China, will also help turn Teng\u2019s homeland into a world leader in nuclear energy and reduce its dependence on coal. In Beijing, where he worked before coming here, Teng lived under the gray blanket of coal-generated pollution that hangs over much of eastern China.

The desert where the Husab mine has materialized in recent years used to be known only for the presence of Welwitschia mirabilis, the short, droopy national plant that grows just two leaves \u2014 and can live for more than 1,000 years. Now, in little more than 1,000 days, China\u2019s reach has spread far beyond the uranium mine.", "Just north of Swakopmund, a Chinese telemetry station sprouts from the desert floor, its radar dishes pointing skyward to track satellites and space missions. Twenty-five miles south, in Walvis Bay, a state-owned Chinese company is building an artificial peninsula the size of 40 baseball fields as part of a vast port expansion. Other Chinese projects nearby include new highways, a shopping mall, a granite factory and a $400 million fuel depot. Chinese trade flows through the port: shipping containers filled with cement, clothing and machinery coming in; tiles, minerals and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 illegal timber and endangered wildlife heading out to China. The activity is so frenzied that rumors of a proposed naval base in Walvis Bay, though vehemently denied by Chinese officials, do not strike locals as implausible.", "This small outpost offers a glimpse of what may be the largest global trade-and-investment spree in history. Driven by economics (a hunger for resources and new markets) and politics (a longing for strategic allies), Chinese companies and workers have rushed into all parts of the world.

The drumbeat of proposed projects never stops: a military operating base, China\u2019s first overseas, in Djibouti; an $8 billion high-speed railway through Nigeria; an almost-fantastical canal across Nicaragua expected to cost $50 billion. Even as China\u2019s boom slows down, its most ambitious scheme is still ramping up: With the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative \u2014 its name a reference to trade routes \u2014 President Xi Jinping has spoken of putting $1.6 trillion over the next decade into infrastructure and development throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

Though it was poor and mired in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, China won new allies in Africa by finishing, in 1976, a 1,156-mile railroad through the bush from Tanzania to Zambia. Aid continued to trickle in, but there were no other big projects for nearly 30 years, as China focused on building up its domestic economy, following its leader Deng Xiaoping\u2019s prescription to \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201d That ended in the 2000s, when Beijing, recognizing the need for foreign resources and allies to fuel its economic growth, exhorted the nation\u2019s companies to \u201cgo out\u201d into the world.", "Today, if you take the red-eye flight from Shanghai to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, chances are you\u2019ll be seated among Chinese workers heading to a construction site in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, a cotton-processing plant in Mozambique, a telecom project in Nigeria.

United States engagement in Asia, Africa and Latin America declined after the Cold War, when the regions served as proxies for superpower rivalries. China\u2019s rise and the wars in the Middle East also pulled away resources and attention. And now, with Washington raising doubts about global agreements on issues like free trade and climate change, Beijing has more leverage to push its own initiatives and show its capacity for global leadership. President Trump\u2019s disdain for the Trans-Pacific Partnership has already made Beijing\u2019s trade proposals, which exclude the United States, more appealing. \u201cIn certain parts of the world, the relative inattention of the Trump administration is definitely creating an opening for China to fill,\u201d says David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at George Washington University and author of the 2013 book \u201cChina Goes Global.\u201d But \u201cChina remains very much a partial power \u2014 and only offers other countries an economic relationship.\u201d", "Still, for a nation like Namibia, China\u2019s pitches can be irresistible partly because they\u2019re rooted in historical solidarity. Beijing backed the black nationalist movement\u2019s liberation struggle against apartheid and its white South African overlords. Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South West Africa People\u2019s Organization (Swapo), visited Beijing in search of guns and funds in the early 1960s. When Namibia finally claimed independence in early 1990, with Nujoma as president, China became one of its first diplomatic allies, pronouncing the two countries \u201call-weather friends.\u201d (Beijing was also desperate for allies to break its diplomatic isolation after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement.)", "In addition to offering its own history as a model for climbing out of poverty, China provides no-strings financing that, unlike Western aid, is not conditional on such fine points as human rights, clean governance or fiscal restraint. \u201cWe welcomed China very much because, for the first time, it gave us a real alternative to a Western-driven agenda, whether it was South Africa or the Western world,\u201d Calle Schlettwein, Namibia\u2019s minister of finance, told me. \u201cThe Chinese say, \u2018We want you to be masters of your own destiny, so tell us what you want.\u2019\u2009\u201d But they have their conditions, too, he says. \u201cThey want de facto total control over everything, so it\u2019s difficult to bring about a situation that is truly beneficial.\u201d", "China\u2019s leaders insist that its influence is entirely benign, a global exercise in what they call \u201cwin-win cooperation.\u201d And indeed, many of the projects Chinese companies are pursuing \u2014 roads and railways, ports and pipelines, mines and telecom networks \u2014 might never be built without them. China\u2019s investment in the Husab uranium mine, in which C.G.N. subsidiaries hold a 90 percent stake and the Namibian government owns 10 percent, is doing its part to stave off a recession. \u201cWe helped Namibia gain its political liberation,\u201d Xia Lili, a former Chinese diplomat who now works as an executive at a Chinese company in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, says. \u201cNow we\u2019re helping it fight for economic emancipation.\u201d", "For some Namibians, however, the flood of Chinese loans and investments doesn\u2019t look so much like freedom as it does a new form of colonialism. The infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans \u2014 financed by the Chinese \u2014 they have saddled the economy with debt and done little to alleviate the nearly 30 percent unemployment rate. Over the last few months, moreover, a series of scandals involving Chinese nationals \u2014 including tax evasion, money-laundering and poaching endangered wildlife \u2014 has soured locals on a foreign presence that can seem largely extractive: pulling uranium, timber, rhino horns and profits out the country without benefiting a population that, because of apartheid\u2019s legacy, ranks among the most unequal economically in the world. In January, a Windhoek newspaper captured the rising sentiment with an illustration on its front page of a golden dragon devouring the Namibian flag. The headline: \u201cFeeding Namibia to the Chinese.\u201d", "The question of how China is changing the world is often framed as a binary proposition: Is China the savior for developing nations, the only world power investing in their future \u2014 or is this the dawn of a new colonial era? The question itself, however, is misleading. In Namibia, as in much of the rest of the world, the narratives live uncomfortably side by side, impossible to disentangle. \u201cYou can argue that China is the best thing to happen to Africa \u2014 or the worst,\u201d says Eric Olander, the co-host of the weekly \u201cChina in Africa Podcast.\u201d \u201cThe beauty is in the complexity.\u201d", "The sign on the lime green cement wall outside the restaurant, written in Chinese, read \u201cYe Shanghai\u201d: \u201cShanghai Nights.\u201d Inside, the lunch crowd was already gone, but six middle-aged Chinese men and women \u2014 including James Shen and his wife, Rose, the proprietors \u2014 crowded around a table peeling prawns and sucking heartily on the shells. Nobody spoke. Blaring from the flat-screen television on the wall was a special report on CCTV-4, a channel from China\u2019s state television broadcaster, breathlessly describing the powers of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. When a double row of explosions erupted in the sea, Rose exclaimed, \u201cWah, our China is so strong!\u201d", "The couple\u2019s restaurant is in Walvis Bay, a port surrounded on three sides by the Namib Desert, which some consider the oldest in the world. James and Rose are part of the early wave of Chinese immigrants who landed in Africa 20 years ago and never left. The Chinese diaspora has a long history of finding a foothold, and then thriving, in some of the world\u2019s most remote places: I\u2019ve bumped into Chinese merchants everywhere from the Arctic tundra of Siberia to mining towns in the Andes. In Africa, entrepreneurs like James and Rose found a new frontier with the space, freedom and opportunities that many early settlers saw in the American West. \u201cMy husband came to look at business here, and he fell in love with the wide-open spaces,\u201d Rose told me. \u201cBut we\u2019re still Chinese first and foremost.\u201d", "Like many Chinese immigrants around the world, the couple began by opening a small mom-and-pop shop, filling the shelves with cheap clothes, shoes and bags shipped by container from China. Their store, James and Rose, still stands at a central intersection of Walvis Bay, even as their ventures have expanded to include a hotel, a restaurant, a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a trading company. Today there are such Chinese-run stores in nearly every town in Namibia \u2014 and thousands more across Africa.", "On a recent Sunday in Windhoek\u2019s Chinatown, where dozens of shops occupy a series of long warehouses in the city\u2019s industrial district, Namibian families strolled the lanes, haggling over everything from knockoff Nikes and plastic children\u2019s toys to solar panels and secondhand mobile phones. One man told me he liked the low prices, even as he complained about the goods\u2019 poor quality \u2014 and the harm they did to the local garment industry. Wu Qiaoxia, a Chinese entrepreneur whose real estate business began with a simple store in the northern town of Oshakati, waves off such criticism. \u201cMany Namibian children didn\u2019t even have shoes before we got here,\u201d Wu says. \u201cThe people here needed everything, and we sold it to them, cheaply.\u201d", "One of the most influential Chinese immigrants in Namibia, Jack Huang, parlayed a small textile business into a mining, real estate and trade conglomerate. A backslapping 49-year-old native of Nantong, a city located about two hours northwest of Shanghai, Huang moved to Namibia nearly two decades ago. Early on, he helped transform Oshikango, a sleepy town on the Angolan border, into a raucous Chinese trading post anchored by his properties. Angolans made rich by a boom in oil production flooded in to buy things like stereos and S.U.V.s, paying with United States dollars or, at times, diamonds. The collapse of oil prices has turned Oshikango into a ghost town. But Huang, through his Sun Investment Group, has diversified into many lucrative businesses, including a mining venture that has identified other uranium deposits close to Husab.", "Huang\u2019s success has come, in part, from cultivating connections with Namibia\u2019s political elite. Swapo, the guerrilla-group-turned-political-party, has dominated Namibia\u2019s elections since its independence \u2014 the kind of stability that appeals to China\u2019s rulers and to entrepreneurs hoping to make long-lasting connections. Huang has referred to Sam Nujoma, Namibia\u2019s founding father, as \u201cmy special adviser.\u201d During the 2014 election campaign, Huang and the Swapo candidate Hage Geingob (then the prime minister, now the president) attended a gala dinner at which, according to local reporting, the Chinese businessman pledged Geingob\u2019s political party a donation of 1 million Namibian dollars \u2014 about $90,000. (Huang denies this.)", "Huang\u2019s friends prefer to emphasize how much he has given back to his host country through his charity, the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. (Huang was out of the country at the time of my visit, but he authorized two deputies to speak with me on his behalf.) Over the last seven years, Huang\u2019s charity has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to Namibian students to attend medical school in China (in Nantong, naturally). Some critics, however, claim that a few recipients of Huang\u2019s philanthropy were not needy students but children of the ruling elite. Last year, moreover, the local media revealed that before Geingob was elected president in 2014, Huang was the owner of a majority stake in a real estate venture whose only other shareholders are Geingob\u2019s family trust and ex-wife. The men tried to distance themselves from each other in the press, and Geingob professed to have no operational control of the company. Still, Huang\u2019s friends worry about his courting of the powerful. \u201cI kept warning Jack,\u201d says one businessman who occasionally socializes with Huang. \u201c\u2009\u2018Don\u2019t get too close to the fire. You\u2019ll burn your fingers.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "The exact number of Chinese living in Namibia remains the subject of contentious debate. No definitive data exist, and the constant ebb and flow of contract workers muddies the picture. Last fall, Namibia\u2019s home-affairs ministry raised alarms when it claimed that 100,000 Chinese nationals live in Namibia \u2014 a figure that would be equivalent to 4 percent of the population. More conservative estimates run between 10,000 and 20,000. It is clear, however, that in Namibia and all across the developing world, the older generation of long-term immigrants is being eclipsed by China\u2019s new diaspora: younger, more educated workers going abroad to get experience \u2014 and make a small fortune \u2014 before returning to China. \u201cWe were among the first ones here,\u201d Rose Shen says, \u201cbut now there are Chinese everywhere.\u201d", "Sean Hao, a young telecommunications engineer in Windhoek, is part of that diaspora. Raised in a cave dwelling in central China\u2019s Shaanxi province, he wasn\u2019t expected to venture far beyond his village\u2019s orchard of jujube trees. But Hao was accepted by a university, a first for his family, and worked after graduation installing networks for a Chinese telecom giant. Renting a room for just $15 a month helped him squirrel away most of his $500 monthly salary, but his savings were hardly enough to buy the apartment he would need to marry. In a country where young men far outnumber women \u2014 a legacy of the government\u2019s restrictive family-planning policy \u2014 an apartment is seen as a prerequisite for attracting a wife and avoiding the fate of a \u201cbare branch\u201d (an unmarried person). But real estate seemed an impossible aspiration for a young man who grew up in a cave.", "When a headhunter told Hao about a job in Africa that would pay more than $6,000 a month, Hao figured it was a swindle. \u201cI thought this must be a case of human trafficking,\u201d he remembers, laughing. The offer was real, but the job was in Nigeria, which he thought was unsafe. So Hao instead signed a contract to work on building the telecom system in Angola for more than $5,000 a month, more than 10 times his previous salary. After a year in Africa, Hao put a down payment on an apartment in Xi\u2019an, a city in central China, and persuaded his girlfriend\u2019s parents that he was financially secure enough to marry their daughter. Hao and his wife soon had a baby girl, but his job in Africa meant that he saw her for only one month out of her first 15. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even recognize me,\u201d he said. His wife and daughter joined him in his new posting in Namibia, but they lasted one lonely year before going home, leaving Hao stuck between his longing to be with his family in China and the opportunity to make money in Namibia.", "On a warm Saturday night in late March, Hao joined a dozen Chinese colleagues under the thatched roofs of Joe\u2019s Beerhouse in Windhoek. Two of the men were headed back to China after finishing their short-term contracts, and the group was sending them off by knocking back pints of German-style lager. By the time I arrived at the bar, three men had already passed out, their heads planted on the table, and a few others were listing badly. Hao, the designated driver, had barely sipped any beer at all. Celebrating his colleagues\u2019 return to the motherland had put him in a contemplative mood. \u201cI\u2019d like to go home, too,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are no jobs in China that could pay me even close to what I\u2019m making now.\u201d", "In the hardscrabble hills of Sichuan Province, the parents of the uranium miner Dylan Teng still work as farmers, growing rice and maize in a hillside hamlet where most families share the same surname. Their village, called Tengjiayan (or Teng Family Rock), had only a primary school, so Teng left to study in nearby Guang\u2019an, the birthplace of Deng Xiaoping, and then went on to college in China\u2019s northeast. It was a long road that was about to grow longer. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d go abroad,\u201d he says, \u201cso I didn\u2019t even try in my English classes.\u201d", "In Teng\u2019s first job after graduation \u2014 at the Beijing-based Uranium Resources Company, a C.G.N. subsidiary \u2014 he learned about the company\u2019s mining interests in Kazakhstan, Australia and Namibia. The rural kid knew nothing about these foreign lands. But soon he was flying off to the most distant of the three to work in one of China\u2019s largest and most strategic mines. And one where C.G.N. was fully in control.", "As a load-and-haul engineer at the Husab mine, Teng helps choreograph 26 gargantuan trucks whose wheels stand twice as tall as he does. So far, the trucks have hauled more than 100 million metric tons of rock out of Husab\u2019s open pits. As production increases this year, far more will be needed to process the 15 million pounds of uranium oxide that the mine aims to produce annually. \u201cThe pressure is always on to stockpile enough so the processing plant never runs out of rock,\u201d Teng says.", "To feed its hungry economy, China has worked frantically to secure enough resources to keep the juggernaut going. Besides oil and gas, which are a primary focus of its investments abroad, China\u2019s state-owned companies have gobbled up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. In Africa, Chinese mining investments have increased 25-fold in just 10 years, from stakes in a handful of mines in 2006 to more than 120 in 2015.", "As its economy has slowed recently and commodity prices have plunged, China has sharply reduced some of its imports, causing a few boom areas, like Western Australia, to go bust. Chinese mines in Zambia (copper) and South Africa (iron ore) have been forced to close. It might seem something of a miracle, then, that Husab runs at all. With uranium prices at less than half their level before the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (and less than a quarter of what they were in 2007), Namibia\u2019s two other active uranium operations have stopped digging up rock and process only already-stockpiled material. But Husab forges ahead, hiring many of the hundreds of workers laid off at those other mines. As one Namibian engineer who landed a job there after spending six months unemployed told me, \u201cHusab was my salvation.\u201d", "There is a simple reason that C.G.N. can afford to ramp up production at Husab: It is selling most of the uranium to itself, the Chinese state, so price is almost irrelevant. (Low prices, in fact, have enabled China both to stockpile uranium cheaply and to buy part of a struggling Namibian uranium mine, Langer-Heinrich.) An even bigger reason is China\u2019s ambition both to reduce its carbon emissions and to become a world leader in nuclear power.", "Nearly 88 percent of China\u2019s energy now comes from fossil fuels, only 1 percent from nuclear power. (Solar, wind and hydropower account for the remaining 11 percent.) To reach its clean-energy goals \u2014 and shed the ignominious title of world\u2019s biggest producer of greenhouse gases \u2014 China has put nuclear power back on an almost impossibly fast track. The country now has 37 nuclear reactors, with another 20 under construction, and it aims to have 110 reactors by 2030. (Beyond that, the goal is to become an exporter of nuclear-reactor technology. China has already built six reactors overseas, and last month, Swakop Uranium, a C.G.N. subsidiary, submitted a proposal to construct a reactor in Namibia.)", "This rate of growth, six new plants each year, would catapult China past the United States as the world\u2019s top nuclear power, but it also raises concerns. In January, an American consultant to C.G.N. pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to illegally recruit United States nuclear engineers to help accelerate the design and manufacture of C.G.N. reactor components. Critics at home and abroad also question whether China\u2019s safety standards can keep pace with the new reactors. One Chinese physicist, He Zuoxiu, even told The Guardian that the plan is \u201cinsane.\u201d", "C.G.N. did not allow me to visit the mine or interview its managers, claiming that they were too busy increasing production. To get a glimpse of the vast complex, I drove down a dusty back road to the highland plain where the Welwitschia mirabilis grow, near Husab\u2019s back gate. Before construction began at Husab in 2013, the company transplanted four rare Welwitschia specimens that would have been destroyed in the blasts \u2014 a symbolic gesture in a country that reveres the ancient plant. Since then, C.G.N. has seemed eager to dispel the uncaring reputation that Chinese state-owned companies have earned: It has made donations to drought victims, offered scholarships to local engineering students and, in a first for a Chinese company in Namibia, even invited a local labor union to set up shop at the mine site.", "Independent unions are essentially illegal in China. And the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers Union had waged a campaign against Chinese state-owned companies, accusing some of paying Namibian workers only one-third of the minimum wage and others of using armies of Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should go to Namibians. So when C.G.N. invited the union\u2019s secretary general, Justina Jonas, to China for the mine\u2019s inaugural event, she was skeptical. \u201cThe Chinese will promise you heaven,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut the implementation can be hell.\u201d Jonas threatened not to go to China if Husab didn\u2019t sign a project labor agreement protecting workers\u2019 wages, hours and safety. Just days before the trip, C.G.N. signed the agreement, a first for a Chinese company.", "For all its public outreach, Husab still operates in a self-contained Chinese universe. Chinese managers often schedule key meetings for the weekend, when it\u2019s convenient for them to review and plan \u2014 but also when Namibian colleagues are not present, according to local employees. Local workers marvel at how, when a non-Chinese part breaks down, Chinese engineers will sometimes send the specs home so Chinese companies can reverse-engineer replacement parts at a fraction of the cost. This looks different from a Chinese perspective: Just as the mine offers young engineers an opportunity to hone their expertise in vital new jobs, it also gives Chinese companies a chance to show that they can make high-quality vehicles and equipment \u2014 at a third of the cost of top foreign brands. Husab still makes companies go through testing and bidding, but as one worker put it: \u201cWe have to help and support our brother companies. It\u2019s all part of the \u2018going out\u2019 policy.\u201d", "Mining is hardly China\u2019s only interest in Namibia. The land is too arid to sustain the kinds of vast agricultural projects underway in Mozambique and Brazil. But China\u2019s state-owned construction companies are burning up their excess capacity building Namibian highways and ports, a Chinese embassy compound and a new military academy in Okahandja. Military relations are close, too. China trains Namibian officers \u2014 an echo of its 1960s assistance to Swapo \u2014 and supplies weapons. In April, the United States intervened to stop Namibia from paying $12 million to Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of a Chinese company on the American sanctions list for selling banned weapons to Iran, Syria and North Korea. It was a reminder that the United States is still in the background, warily watching China\u2019s incursion into Africa.", "Husab is a tangible, direct investment, but most Chinese projects in Namibia and around the world are financed by soft loans that carry risks. Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending. The easy money is alluring, and the projects can be essential. But most of the loans stipulate that a Chinese state-owned company must take the lead, ensuring that the work, skills and profits are kept largely in the Chinese family. Countries like Namibia are left holding the debt. Schlettwein, the finance minister, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think those are real investments, but opportunities latched onto by Chinese enterprises without really adding value to the Namibian economy.\u201d", "Such criticism irritates Chinese business owners and diplomats, who point out that Chinese companies have invested more than $5 billion in Namibia and now employ more than 6,000 Namibians. \u201cWe\u2019re here to do business on an equal footing with the locals,\u201d says Xia Lili, the former diplomat who is deputy general manager of Jack Huang\u2019s Sun Investment Group and secretary general of the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. \u201cWe bring in money to establish mines and factories. Who benefits? The Namibians. Did the Western powers ever do this? Not nearly as much. So this talk of new colonialism is untrue.\u201d", "Namibia, though, is starting to push back. Last year the government pulled out of a $570 million loan agreement with a state-owned Chinese company to expand the Windhoek airport. Then in September, as sluggish growth and other foreign loans pushed Namibia\u2019s debt to over 40 percent of its G.D.P., the government suspended all new loan tenders. Schlettwein says the freeze was a prudent act of belt-tightening, not a move specifically targeting China. Nevertheless, he says: \u201cIt sends out a signal that Namibian interests are not to be trampled on indiscriminately. It sends a signal that our relationship must mature.\u201d", "One morning in late December, the Namibian conservation biologist Chris Brown was working alone in his Windhoek office when he heard a banging at the gate. Rushing out, he found two angry Chinese men in button-down shirts: the first and second secretaries from the Chinese Embassy. One of them threw a crumpled letter through the gate, Brown says, and shouted: \u201cThese are lies! You are making China look bad in the eyes of the world!\u201d", "The pages were the same ones Brown hand-delivered to the Chinese Embassy two days before \u2014 and then sent to other diplomatic missions, media outlets and international organizations. Signed by 45 local environmental groups, including Brown\u2019s own Namibian Chamber of Environment, the letter blamed Chinese nationals for a sharp surge in the commercial poaching of wildlife in Namibia \u2014 and excoriated the embassy for doing little to stop it.", "Over the last two years, Namibia has lost nearly 200 elephants and endangered rhinos to poaching. In November, a Chinese smuggler was caught in the Johannesburg airport with 18 rhino horns \u2014 all from Namibia. Two months earlier, four Chinese men were sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to smuggle out 14 rhino horns in 2014. (Rhino-horn powder is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to strengthen the immune system.) Brown had meant the letter to provoke a response, but this visit was unexpected.", "\u201cYou are abusing China\u2019s good nature,\u201d one of the diplomats said, in a raised voice, according to Brown. \u201cOnly a handful of Chinese have been involved in poaching.\u201d", "\u201cNo, Chinese demand is driving all of this,\u201d Brown replied. \u201cI think you are trying to strip all of our resources for China.\u201d When the yelling subsided, Brown says, he invited the men inside. Sitting in his conference room, they leafed through binders filled with photographs of slaughtered rhinos and elephants. \u201cThey got quieter and quieter,\u201d Brown recalls. A few days later, he met with the Chinese ambassador, who cautioned him against letting a few \u201crotten apples\u201d tarnish the entire Chinese community. Brown again insisted it was a more systemic problem. \u201cListen, we can ratchet up the pressure and make things even worse for you,\u201d he says he argued. \u201cOr we can come together to solve this problem.\u201d The ambassador, he says, agreed to join the antipoaching fight.", "One of the most troubling dimensions of China\u2019s global expansion is its reputation for pillaging and pilfering the natural world. China is not the only culprit in the $19 billion illegal wildlife trade. But its growing hunger for the rare, exotic and dubiously curative is devastating worldwide populations of rhinos and elephants, sharks and tigers \u2014 and spurring illegal timber operations in rain forests stretching from Congo to Cambodia. Huang Hongxiang, a former journalist from China who investigated ivory and rhino-horn poaching in Namibia, has started a Kenya-based nonprofit organization, China House, to help Chinese companies and communities engage in wildlife conservation as a form of corporate social responsibility. \u201cIn a lot of global environmental issues, Chinese are part of the problem,\u201d he says, \u201cso they have to be part of the solution.\u201d", "Poaching is a scourge in Damaraland, an arid region of rocky outcroppings in northwest Namibia. \u201cLocals are enticed into killing rhinos by the China market,\u201d my Namibian guide, Taffy, who tracks elephants and rhinos, told me. \u201cThe horns always seem to end up in Chinese hands.\u201d In the past, conservation issues were mostly championed by white Namibians. That is changing. \u201cBlacks used to think whites cared more about the animals than them,\u201d says Shinovene Immanuel, a reporter at The Namibian. \u201cBut now that poaching has gotten out of hand, everybody is upset.\u201d", "Public anger is also rising over some Chinese business proposals that could do damage to the environment. One Chinese-owned company has sought to clear-cut part of Namibia\u2019s only pristine forest, in the Zambezi region, to create a tobacco plantation nearly double the size of Manhattan, despite the fact that the area\u2019s sandy soil is unsuitable. Another Chinese business wants to set up donkey abattoirs to meet China\u2019s soaring demand for donkey meat and skin (the latter is considered a curative in Chinese medicine). And a Namibia-based Chinese company filed a request last fall to capture killer whales, penguins, dolphins and sharks in Namibian waters \u2014 all to sell to aquatic theme parks in China. Local activists protested for weeks until the Chinese firm withdrew its proposal.", "Three months after Brown\u2019s letter provoked the indignant response, the Chinese Embassy hosted a much more diplomatic meeting of Namibian activists and some 60 Chinese business leaders. Besides trumpeting China\u2019s recent ban on all ivory sales \u2014 and airing an antipoaching video featuring the basketball star Yao Ming \u2014 the acting ambassador, Li Nan, denounced poaching and lectured Chinese nationals about obeying Namibian law. Li told me in an email that, at Brown\u2019s invitation, he will visit the rhinos\u2019 habitat in northern Namibia this month. The two countries, he said, are also working to form a joint law-enforcement task force to combat transnational wildlife criminals.", "Jack Huang also spoke out against poaching, but a different kind of dragnet was closing around him. On Feb. 1, the tycoon and four others (three of them Chinese) were arrested at Windhoek\u2019s international airport for their participation in a supposed tax-fraud scheme that netted nearly $300 million \u2014 the largest case in Namibian history. The arrests were part of a two-year investigation into more than 30 Chinese companies accused of concealing illegal earnings. While in custody, Huang reportedly tried to contact President Geingob, but his business partner refused to help. \u201cWhen my \u2018friend\u2019 was arrested and spent a night in jail, there was no interference or intervention,\u201d Geingob told a local paper later. \u201cThis is because in Namibia, we uphold the rule of law, the separation of powers, and pride ourselves on the total independence of our judiciary.\u201d", "Huang, the man with all the connections, now finds himself disconnected. In mid-February, soon after his release on $75,000 bail, he claimed that the tax-fraud case against him was based on outdated information. Xia, his deputy at Sun Investment, told me that Huang actually divested from Golden Phoenix, a company named in the case, more than eight years ago, but that the transaction had not been entered into the official computer system. When this trial is over, Huang may file lawsuits against those who attacked his businesses, Xia says. In the meantime, the gregarious entrepreneur will probably spend more time dining alone. When he invited an old friend out to dinner recently, he was gently rebuffed \u2014 the power broker was suddenly a pariah.", "Arresting a high-flying Chinese businessman may be a simple matter of law, but it is also one more sign of how the relationship between Namibia and China is being recalibrated. Li Nan wrote to me that he believes that the boisterous local press is \u201ctrying to whip up racist sentiments and hatred.\u201d The animosity in Namibia, though, is nowhere near the levels that have caused explosive riots at a Chinese coal mine in Zambia, including one in 2012 that left a Chinese manager dead, or that sparked unruly protests against Chinese traders in Kampala, Uganda, last month. (The rising resentment toward the Chinese in Uganda recalls another era, when the dictator Idi Amin expelled an earlier wave of immigrant merchants, from the Indian diaspora, in 1972.)", "Still, the new tensions between China and Namibia are laid bare at police checkpoints around the country, where Chinese nationals are routinely singled out for inspection. The police say this new policy has already exposed several cases of wildlife smuggling. Jack Huang\u2019s associate, Xia, was pulled over at the checkpoint on the airport road last month. The police frisked him, combed through his luggage and scoured his car. \u201cAll the while they were yelling, \u2018Rhino horn, rhino horn, where\u2019s the rhino horn?\u2019\u2009\u201d Xia recalls. \u201cI was shocked that this could happen in Namibia. This is a country that is supposed to be our all-weather friend.\u201d", "As the afternoon sun weakens over the Husab Uranium Mine, most of the 2,000 or so Namibian workers return to their desert barracks. Teng and the other Chinese engineers board buses for the ride back through the moonscape to Swakopmund and the little house on Amathila Avenue. After sharing another Chinese meal together, the men disperse. Teng walks back to his apartment, where he will spend a few hours on his computer doing administrative and supervisory tasks. \u201cOur real secret,\u201d Teng says, \u201cis that we work 12-hour days while everybody else works eight.\u201d", "It\u2019s a chilly Saturday in April \u2014 the antipodal winter is coming \u2014 and Teng has worked overtime again. He has missed one of the only diversions here: Saturday-afternoon basketball games at the local sports center. (China now has so many state-owned companies in Namibia that they stage an annual 15-team championship; China Harbour Engineering, the port builder in Walvis Bay, won this year.) Strolling on the Swakopmund waterfront, Teng was no longer clad in his khaki mining uniform. Wearing jeans and a Quiksilver T-shirt and cradling a cappuccino, he looked like any tourist gazing out over the crashing Atlantic surf. During his nearly four years here, Teng has not had too many chances to be a tourist, though he took advantage of a recent holiday to go on a wildlife tour in Etosha National Park.", "In their bubble at Husab, Teng and his colleagues are mostly insulated from the tensions between China and Namibia. These huge Chinese projects all over the developing world can seem like spaceships landing on distant planets.

But those have become part and parcel of mainstream celebrity. Now, what\u2019s required are less expected, and more grounded, peeks behind the curtain.

Sometimes Mr. Henry\u2019s narrative is, to put it generously, unlikely, as when he says he did not recognize Bobby Brown at the beginning of their reading but then immediately names his daughter when shown a picture, and acknowledges he knows Mr. Brown\u2019s ex-wife, Whitney Houston.", "On \u201cHot Ones\u201d and \u201cThe Therapist,\u201d the celebrities come into the host\u2019s arena, whereas Mr. Henry takes his charade on the road, which, when he goes to a subject\u2019s house, feels like an invasion. That\u2019s especially the case when Mr. Henry visits the home of Alan Thicke and his wife, Tanya. The initial meeting was last August, a few months before Mr. Thicke died. This season, Mr. Henry returns to Ms. Thicke for a follow-up two months after her husband\u2019s death.", "\u201cI always say readings are not a cure for grief but they\u2019re a reminder that our loved ones are with us,\u201d Mr. Henry says chipperly, before revisiting the initial reading (with its ominous and very general warnings about the health of Mr. Thicke\u2019s heart) and assuring Ms. Thicke her husband is reconnecting with his family members on the other side.", "Imagine the moral vacuum required to lie straight-facedly to a grieving widow. Mr. Henry plays the role of na\u00eff but is a con man of the highest order, which is to say, he does an impressive job walking the high wire over his marks\u2019 possible disbelief.", "More interesting are the reasons that celebrities choose to submit themselves to his acting-class sorcery. Imagine a life cut off from the routine of normal interactions, and one in which disruptions to public image are considered signs of failure. Wouldn\u2019t even the tiniest bit of forgiven humanity be tempting?", "For those whose lives are surrounded by predictability and coated in plastic, the promise of an experience outside of the bubble \u2014 while still very much protected by that bubble \u2014 is likely too good an opportunity to pass up.

Mostly, there\u2019s no harm done. Even if Mr. Evans is leading his guests on a gastronomic roller coaster, he shares the ride, and offers outs along the way.

In part, he owes his 17 years leading Russia as either president or prime minister to the fact that he defeated a domestic insurgency in Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus by branding it as part of the global war on terrorism and flattening the place. Although Al Qaeda was almost certainly active in Chechnya, no one outside Russia paid much attention to Mr. Putin\u2019s warnings about extremism there \u2014 until after the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.", "His antiterrorism campaign is central to his grand overall strategy of restoring Russia to the superpower status it enjoyed in Soviet times.", "Yet given the whims of Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudolyubov and others said, it is unclear that such cooperation will endure. The unexpected manner in which the information was shared makes it difficult to assess whether it reflects a permanent shift in course.", "\u201cIt is not something that Russia can rely on, because Trump changes like the weather,\u201d Mr. Trudolyubov said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of victory that you do not really want if you want orderly policy cooperation.\u201d", "Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would work more closely with Russia, and this latest episode could indicate that he is following through.", "Previously, mistrust of Russian motives always seemed to eventually outweigh any advantage of an alliance, prompting bitter frustration in Moscow. There has been little cooperation on Syria, for example, because most Western leaders see Russian intervention as more about strengthening President Bashar al-Assad as the Kremlin\u2019s main Arab ally than fighting the Islamic State.", "Although Moscow asserted that chasing Islamist militants from the ancient ruins of Palmyra \u2014 twice \u2014 proved that it was defending civilized Western values, Russian firepower has largely been focused against the uprising confronting Mr. Assad.", "Outside of the Islamic State, a shared definition of who constitutes a terrorist in Syria does not exist, and the Pentagon has been leery about cooperation.", "\u201cThe problem is that both Russia and the U.S. mean different things when they talk about the fight against terrorism in Syria,\u201d said Ivan Kurilla, an expert on Russian-American relations at the European University at St. Petersburg. \u201cThe question is whether they will try to bridge the gap in their understanding.\u201d", "In addition, it is taken as a given in Russia that whatever Mr. Trump wants, the real establishment in Washington will put a stop to it if it clashes with its interests. \u201cIt is not a question of whether Trump wants to or not, it is a question of whether Trump can or not,\u201d said Sergei A. Markov, a political analyst close to the Kremlin.", "Still, disparaging asides about Mr. Trump that had been creeping into official newscasts will most likely vanish.", "\u201cI would expect the Russians will now stop criticizing Mr. Trump as they have done during the last month or so,\u201d Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, the director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email.", "Even if the Kremlin has reason to be pleased with the latest episode, Mr. Putin and the Russian government prefer that policy changes happen in an orderly, choreographed manner.", "If the United States and Russia are to forge genuine new cooperation on terrorism, analysts said, Russia would prefer that it emerge from a meeting between the two presidents, scheduled for July, not via Twitter and confusing, contradictory denials in Washington.", "In any case, the Oval Office episode was not big news in Russia, where the main headline of the day was Ukraine\u2019s shutting down key Russian social media and information sites, including Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, and Yandex, Russia\u2019s version of Google.", "Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, dismissed the reports from the White House. \u201cFor us, this is not a subject,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThis is the latest nonsense.\u201d", "Maria V. Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, called the reports \u201cfake news\u201d and suggested that people should stop reading American newspapers. \u201cThey can be used in various ways, but there\u2019s no need to read them \u2014 lately, this is not only harmful, but dangerous,\u201d she wrote on Facebook.", "Few here accept the idea, at least publicly, that Russia helped Mr. Trump by stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee, even if Russia has clearly stated that conducting hybrid information warfare is important to achieving its strategic goals.", "One of those goals is undermining the Western institutions that oppose it. Whether anyone accepts that idea or not, there is glee in some quarters in Moscow at the confusion in the American capital.", "\u201cOf course, from Moscow, we look at this chaos with a bit of a smile,\u201d Mr. Markov said. \u201cSo many Americans used to look at the chaos in Russia that way. It is a kind of psychological revenge.\u201d", "American officials preoccupied with domestic problems will also have less time to meddle in Russian affairs, he added.", "Most Russians expect that the United States will endure given the strength of its institutions, its economy and its overall resources. Some wonder, however, if the dysfunction at the White House will descend to the level that paralyzed the Kremlin in the worst, last days of the Soviet Union, or even to that of pre-Putin Russia.", "There were sarcastic remarks regarding the White House in a commentary on Channel One, a state-run television station, during a news program on Sunday.", "\u201cThe new action-packed series, tentatively titled \u2018Secrets of Trump\u2019s Oval Office,\u2019 becomes more fascinating every day,\u201d said a commentator named Evgeny Baranov. \u201cRussia\u2019s footprint, that is in one way or another present in each new episode, only enhances the intrigues of this bold plotline.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/25/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-indianapolis-indiana.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/style/yik-yak-bullying-mary-washington.html": ["This month, two feminist groups and several former students filed a federal complaint accusing the University of Mary Washington in Virginia and its former president, Richard Hurley, of failing to protect the female plaintiffs from cyber harassment and threats of physical and sexual violence during their time at the university.", "The platform where all of this took place? Yik Yak, the now-defunct, localized, anonymous messaging app that Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington, two students at Furman University in South Carolina, founded in 2013 and that soon became associated with bullying, discriminatory speech and threats of bomb and gun violence.", "\u201cThe lack of responsiveness and inability to control this devastating hate speech I think is what ultimately did this app in,\u201d said Debra Katz, one of the lawyers who brought the complaint against Mary Washington, located in Fredericksburg, and Mr. Hurley, in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia.", "In response to the suit, the university said it contained \u201cno new allegations\u201d and that it had, and would continue, to \u201cwork diligently to create a safe and secure campus environment and to address the issue of sexual violence.\u201d", "There was no comment from Mr. Hurley\u2019s lawyer.", "The lawsuit was just the latest twist in the rocky road the messaging app has traveled in its short life.", "In March 2014, a school in Massachusetts evacuated its students twice after Yik-Yak-based bomb threats, and during the same month, a high school in California was put on lockdown for a similar reason.", "In October 2014, Jordan Seman, a student at Middlebury College in Vermont, posted an open letter about being targeted on the app for her weight. \u201cI felt exposed, betrayed and mostly embarrassed,\u201d she wrote.", "The next month, two other high schools in California were put on lockdown after threats of violence, and in Michigan, the police arrested Matthew Mullen, a student at Michigan State whose Yik Yak post threatened a shooting. Mr. Mullen was eventually sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and ordered to pay $800 in restitution for the investigation.", "At the University of Missouri, campus police arrested Hunter M. Park and charged him with making threats of violence against black students on Yik Yak. Mr. Park received a three-year suspended sentence and five years\u2019 probation after pleading guilty to making a terrorist threat. A former Virginia Tech student pleaded guilty to using the app to threaten a repeat of the 2007 campus shooting in which 32 people were killed.", "The high point for Yik Yak came in 2014, when its founders raised $73 million in venture-capital funding. According to App Annie, a firm that tracks metrics for apps, downloads spiked in September of that year and stayed high for several months. But by early 2015, the decline began. App Annie estimates that Yik Yak had 1.8 million downloads in September 2014. By September 2016, it was 125,000.", "At the end of that year, Mr. Droll and Mr. Buffington laid off 60 percent of their employees, and last month, they shut down the operation, selling off intellectual property and employee contracts to Square Inc., a mobile payment company, for $1 million. A few months earlier, Hive, a college-based chat app with a similar color scheme to Yik Yak\u2019s, popped up in the iTunes and Google Play stores, with Mr. Buffington in one of the screenshots. Whether it was an attempt at reinvention under the Yik Yak umbrella or a side project is unclear, but it is no longer available.", "Yik Yak\u2019s image problems seemed to stem from its reliance on anonymous posts and the few solutions that were available to curtail racist, sexist, aggressive or threatening language. The app was community-monitored, meaning that users could vote down a post they found vulgar or offensive, and if the post received enough negative feedback, it was removed.", "But the app\u2019s privacy policy did not allow institutions to identify users who posed a risk without a subpoena, court order or search warrant, or an emergency request from a law-enforcement official with a compelling claim of imminent harm.", "Though neither Yik Yak nor its creators were named as defendants in the suit against Mary Washington and Mr. Hurley, the app\u2019s role was central. Its name is mentioned 51 times in the 35-page complaint, which outlines instances when members of the campus group Feminists United were targeted in \u201cYaks,\u201d or messages on the platform, after they spoke out against Greek life on campus and were connected with the suspension of a rugby team, some of whose members had sung a song \u201cthat called for violence against women, including rape and necrophilia\u201d at a party, according to the complaint.", "Messages that cropped on Yik Yak disparaged and threatened the feminist group\u2019s most visible members. Some of the worst are listed in the complaint: \u201cGonna tie these feminists to the radiator and [g]rape them in the mouth,\u201d \u201cCan we euthanize whoever caused this?\u201d", "Kelli Musick, one of the plaintiffs, who graduated in 2015, said: \u201cThere were days when I felt like I couldn\u2019t look away from my phone because a friend or someone I knew would send me a screenshot of a threatening or harassing Yak. We don\u2019t blame the app in and of itself. It was a tool. Tools can be used in any way that a person decides to use them.\u201d", "But the group did ask the university to request that Yik Yak place a virtual fence around its campus to disable the app. The solution was one Yik Yak had begun using in March 2014 in Chicago-area schools and one it gradually expanded to middle and high schools nationwide after facing criticism from parents and educators.", "\u201cWe had parents reaching out to say their 9-year-old has been threatened and harassed on the app,\u201d said Ross Ellis, the founder and chief executive of Stomp Out Bullying. \u201cKids get hysterical when people make mean comments. Their brains are not mature enough to handle it.\u201d", "The school administration, citing logistical and first amendment concerns, refused. So the group asked that Yik Yak be banned on the school\u2019s Wi-Fi network, a gesture that was primarily symbolic given that students could continue to access it on their personal data plans. The university said no again.", "\u201cThis was something over which we had no control,\u201d said Anna Billingsley, the associate vice president for university relations. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t remove the posts from Yik Yak.\u201d She said that the school offered the protection of campus police and suggested that the students contact Yik Yak and the Title IX office at the university.", "\u201cThey told us to report the Yaks to Yik Yak, and if they were found to be credible, Yik Yak would then respond, which is not the case for any other threats of violence on campus,\u201d Ms. Musick said. \u201cWhen it has been a threat of a bomb or a gun, other schools did not say, \u2018Report it to Yik Yak and they\u2019ll follow up.\u2019\u201d", "In trying to react to complaints about its product, Yik Yak created geo-fences and added filters that recognized certain keywords, such as \u201cbomb,\u201d and would ask users if they wanted to proceed with the message by suggesting: \u201cPump the brakes, this Yak may contain threatening language. Now it\u2019s probably nothing and you\u2019re probably an awesome person but just know that Yik Yak and law enforcement take threats seriously. So you tell us, is this Yak cool to post?\u201d", "But little changed and students at schools across the country began to fight back. The College of Idaho student senate requested that Yik Yak geo-fence their campus, and in Georgia Emory University\u2019s student government denounced the app in a formal resolution. Students at Clemson University in South Carolina unsuccessfully demanded that the school ban the app after a spate of racist messages.", "And at the University of Mary Washington, Ms. Musick and her classmates turned to Ms. Katz to file a complaint with the Education Department. Its Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation, but before it could issue a decision, the White House changed hands and many of the office\u2019s employees left. So the women went to district court.", "Yik Yak tried to put in place further preventive measures in 2016 first by allowing users to have profiles and handles, then by requiring them. After blowback, the identity markers became optional once again.", "Despite these efforts, by this past March, about two and a half years after it had closed a round of funding that raised millions in venture capital, its active users over age 18 had fallen to 264,000, an enormous decline from nearly 1.9 million in November 2014, according to comScore.", "Was Yik Yak really that bad? A study at the MIT Media Lab that compared it to Twitter found that posts on the anonymous platform were only slightly more likely to contain vulgar words. The difference was less than 1 percent. \u201cWe find that on anonymous platforms, users are only slightly more likely to use vulgar language than on public ones, and when they do it is not acceptable and leads to negative feedback,\u201d the authors wrote.", "Morgan Hines, who will start her fourth year at Northeastern University in Boston this fall, never encountered nastiness on Yik Yak. \u201cI thought it was funny,\u201d she said. \u201cIt formed a lot of camaraderie between students. There would be random shout-outs to things happening on campus, like people who are attractive or being annoying in the library, or a fire alarm going off at 4 a.m.\u201d", "But Ms. Hines criticized Yik Yak\u2019s hyper-localization. \u201cYik Yak was for pockets of people on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the fire alarm went off at 4 a.m., it only went off at your building, so no one else will give it a thumbs-up.\u201d", "That hyper-localization is also what made the cases of harassment particularly galling. Ms. Musick, one of the plaintiffs, said, \u201cWith Yik Yak, in the back of your mind, you know they\u2019re not from around the world or other parts of the state, they\u2019re right there in your classroom, in your dining hall. On a campus with 4,500 students, that\u2019s a pretty small group of people. This isn\u2019t some creepy guy in his mom\u2019s basement in Indiana.\u201d", "In the end, it may have been this aspect of the app that really did it in. Danielle Levitas, the senior vice president for research at App Annie, pointed out that bad press would not necessarily override an app\u2019s popularity if it fulfilled a useful function (consider Uber, for example). But, she said, if it does not have something sustainable to offer, it will burn out.", "In this case, it seems that being local was to Yik Yak\u2019s detriment. When Ms. Hines went home to Kentucky after her freshman year, she forgot about the app. \u201cI wasn\u2019t on campus anymore and I wasn\u2019t with my friends anymore,\u201d she said. And back at Northeastern, \u201cno one was on campus to comment on anything.\u201d She added, \u201cIt kind of just became irrelevant in my life.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/briefing/manchester-ariana-grande-roger-moore.html": ["Good morning.", "Here\u2019s what you need to know:", "\u2022 A 22-year-old British man, Salman Abedi, was identified as the bomber who struck a concert by the American pop star Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena, killing 22 people and injuring 59 others in the deadliest terrorist attack in Britain since 2005.", "Mr. Abedi, whose parents had emigrated from Libya, died in the bombing.

If it had been created by a single company, it might have ended up like the phone network: useful for certain tasks, but not a broad-based engine of economic opportunity.", "\u201cSimilarly, as powerful A.I. systems come online, the intent and motivations of their creators will be major factors in determining their impact,\u201d Mr. Brockman said. \u201cIf A.I. development is done entirely in for-profit companies, then these systems are likely to be deployed to benefit just one organization and group of people.\u201d", "What\u2019s interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the start-up incubator.", "Google also favors federal funding for tech research. In May, Eric Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, was one of the authors of an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing that federal funding of science and technology had created a \u201cmiracle machine\u201d: a public-private partnership that has churned out dozens of new industries over decades.", "\u201cIf we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages,\u201d he wrote.", "In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world.

This he made clear by periodically screwing up his face into a huge yawn.", "Mr. Neti, 38, pressed on earnestly, suggesting that he could demonstrate the internet\u2019s potential by Googling the history of the Gond tribe, to which they both belonged. Since acquiring a smartphone, Mr. Neti couldn\u2019t stop Googling things: the gods, Hindu and tribal; the relative merits of the Yadav caste and the Gonds; the real story of how the earth was made.", "Access to this knowledge so elated him that he decided to give up farming for good, taking a job with a nongovernmental organization whose goals include helping villagers produce and call up online content in their native languages.

There has never been a single telephone landline. Electricity is available to only half the houses. When Mr. Neti was growing up, if someone in the village needed emergency medical care, farmers tied the patient to a wooden cot and carried him five miles through the forest to the nearest hospital, a journey of four hours.", "By comparison, India\u2019s battling telecoms have wired Taradand with breathtaking speed. Two years ago, Mr. Neti counted 1,000 mobile phones in the village, which has a population of 2,500. This tracks with India as a whole; last year it surpassed the United States to become the world\u2019s second-largest market for mobile phones behind only China, according to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association, an industry group known as G.S.M.A.", "With the cost of both smartphones and data plummeting, it is fair to assume that Taradand\u2019s next technological leap will be onto the internet.", "Those who work in development tend to speak of this moment as a civilizational breakthrough, of particular significance in a country aching to educate its children. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has made expanding internet use a central goal, shifting government services onto digital platforms. When Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, toured India in 2014, he told audiences that for every 10 people who get online, \u201cone person gets lifted out of poverty and one new job gets created.\u201d", "So it is instructive to follow Mr. Neti as he tries to drum up a little interest in Taradand. Young men use the internet here, but only young men, and almost exclusively to circulate Bollywood films.

When he finally did, he blurted out: \u201cFriend, I have bought this mobile. Is this your number and your name? I am Babulal!\u201d The next day his phone stopped working and he returned to the shop, telling the salesman that something was wrong with the phone.", "\u201cI had no idea what to do,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Your balance is over.\u2019\u201d", "But this experience in no way prepared Mr. Neti for his first encounter with the smartphone, which he spotted about a decade ago in the hand of a computer operator in Taradand\u2019s local administration building.", "The official was an agreeable sort, and Mr. Neti began borrowing his phone for two- and three-hour stretches.

He was interested, for example, in knowing whether the residents of other countries worshiped Ram, the Hindu deity and, upon discovering that they did not, hastened to inform his neighbors of this startling news. He decided to fact-check the assertion of a childhood friend, who is from the Yadav caste, that the Yadavs had been present at the creation of the earth and learned this was not a universally accepted view.", "\u201cI told him I wasn\u2019t personally saying anything about the Yadavs, it was Google saying something negative,\u201d Mr. Neti said. \u201cHe was very offended.\u201d", "At some point, Mr. Neti discovered that he had become skeptical of nearly everything he had been taught. \u201cI tried to find out if the gods created the earth,\u201d he said. \u201cI found out it was not true. But still I cannot answer the question of who created the earth. But I believe Google contains the answer.\u201d", "Mr. Neti finds it maddening that, in a region whose farmers are desperate to educate their children, his neighbors still regard the internet principally as a way to watch movies.", "\u201cThe villagers do not yet understand,\u201d he said \u201cThey don\u2019t know that the whole world rests inside the mobile. The day people realize that, they will stop going out to study.\u201d", "If Mr. Neti\u2019s audience was tougher than usual, there was a reason: A 15-year-old girl from Taradand had just eloped with a 17-year-old boy from a different caste, and everyone was blaming technology.

She reached a senior district bureaucrat whose contacts he had programmed into the phone, and Mr. Neti had to beg the official\u2019s forgiveness.

We weren\u2019t simply reintroduced to these people and their web of meth, cash and forced bonhomie. We learned new parts of their back stories and thus their motivations.", "Specifically, we learned why Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis) loathes Gus. Gus\u2019s meth is so profitable that when his patron, a toupee-sporting Juan Bolsa (Javier Grajeda), shows up to pay tribute to Don Eladio, he brings far more greenbacks than Hector. And the superior haul is even packed and presented more neatly. It\u2019s humiliating! It\u2019s plain that Hector and his Albuquerque operation, fronted by an ice cream store called El Griego Gui\u00f1ador (\u201cThe Winking Greek\u201d), is no match for Gus and his operation, fronted by fried chicken. Hector\u2019s supply route was \u201ccompromised\u201d in the previous episode, and now we understand a new facet of Hector\u2019s rage: No doubt he suspects that Gus was behind the \u201caccident\u201d that led the D.E.A. to El Griego, which is busted early in this episode. Worse, without those ice cream trucks driving back and forth to Mexico, Gus is going to out-earn Hector yet again.", "It\u2019s too much for one cantankerous homophobe and bully to take. So he resorts to tactics as blatant and public as Gus\u2019s are subtle and invisible.

It\u2019s not only that Hector might have just blown Gus\u2019s carefully devised cover as a civic-minded entrepreneur \u2014 who is glad-handing the fire department right as his flagship store is being invaded. Hector is also the man who, years earlier, shot Max Arciniega, Gus\u2019s original Pollos Hermanos partner and, by all accounts, the only man that Gus ever loved.

One of many blanks yet to be filled in this yarn is how, exactly, Hector winds up mute and in a wheelchair, speaking only by means of a bell he rings with one finger. It seems obvious now that Gus will have a decisive hand in whatever lands Hector in that terrible condition.", "At the same time, Round 27 of the Jimmy vs. Chuck battle royale finds Jimmy back to his underhanded ways. He has called in a favor, asking Mike to show up at Chuck\u2019s house as a handyman to fix the door Jimmy busted.

Second, the shot that tickles Jimmy the most is the one of a gas lantern sitting on top of a stack of newspapers. (\u201cThat tells the whole story,\u201d he tells Mike, while they eat together at a diner.) Third, in addition to photos, Mike also hands over a piece of paper.

Bring on wicked Kim!", "Less impressive to me was the moment in the opening scene when Don Eladio tells Hector that he appears jealous of all the money produced by Gus. As the maxim has it, great writers show, they don\u2019t tell. It was blatantly obvious that Hector\u2019s feelings were hurt.

We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future.", "But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives \u2014 like tales of getting rich through \u201cflipping\u201d houses and shares of initial public offerings \u2014 that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.", "Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn\u2019t tell us why.", "Real home prices rose 75 percent from February 1997 to December 2005, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, corrected for inflation by the Consumer Price Index. And then, from 2005 to 2012, real prices reversed course, falling to just 12 percent above their 1997 level. In the years since 2012, they have climbed 29 percent, about halfway back to their 2005 peak. This is a roller coaster in national home prices \u2014 it has been even scarier in some more volatile cities \u2014 yet we have no clarity on why it happened.", "The problem for economists is that these changes don\u2019t correspond to movements in the usual suspects: interest rates, building costs, population or rents. The Consumer Price Index for Rent of Primary Residence, compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and corrected for inflation, went up only 8 percent in 1997 to 2005, so unmet demand for housing services can\u2019t explain the huge increase in real home prices. It doesn\u2019t explain the 29 percent rise in real home prices since 2012 either, because inflation-adjusted rents increased only 10 percent in that period. So what has been driving the wild ride in home prices?", "I believe the price swings have something to do with the changing mentality of the times, changes caused by narratives that have gone viral and swept across the population. Looking for answers in such popular stories contrasts starkly with the prominent approach of modeling people as though they react logically to economic forces. But a less orthodox approach can be quite useful.", "One thing is clear: The prevalent narratives of 1997 to 2005 did not include the concept of a housing bubble, not at first. A computer search using ProQuest or Google Ngrams shows that the phrase \u201chousing bubble\u201d was hardly used until 2005, the end of the boom. What is a bubble? It typically includes the notion that, spurred by the public\u2019s expectation of ever further price increases, demand eventually reaches levels that cannot be sustained, and so the enthusiasm wanes and the bubble collapses. But that thought was just not on many people\u2019s minds then, the evidence suggests.", "Instead, during the 1997 to 2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit. These stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn\u2019t flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.", "In his book \u201cThe Complete Guide to Flipping Properties,\u201d published in 2004, Steve Berges extolled what he called \u201cthe O.P.M. principle,\u201d meaning \u201cother people\u2019s money.\u201d He wrote, \u201cYour objective is to control as much real estate as possible while using as little of your own capital as possible.\u201d In other words, borrow as much as you can. He wrote about the upside of leverage but not about the perils of leverage during the kind of big price drops that were just around the corner.", "It can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was \u201ca thing\u201d in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and \u201980s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.", "This generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for down payments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.", "Some people eager to make quick profits bought Donald J. Trump\u2019s well-timed 2004 book, \u201cTrump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,\u201d written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasized real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.", "Narratives about flipping weren\u2019t restricted to real estate. Just after the time of the condo boom, stories of rapid buying and selling of initial public offerings took off as well. As with the condo promoters, I.P.O. underwriters would sell some shares below market prices to customers, who might then flip the I.P.O. for a quick profit.", "The promoters of condo conversions and I.P.O.s were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but made fortunes anyway.", "By now, the notion of getting rich by flipping houses is entrenched. I searched Amazon for books on \u201cflipping houses\u201d and came up with 328 hits, most written in the past few years. Buying and rehabbing existing houses for resale is a legitimate business. But many of these books make extravagant pitches and seem aimed at inspiring amateurs to plunge into risky ventures.", "The public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators\u2019 power. These narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/california-today-university-of-california-audit.html": ["Good morning.", "(Want to get California Today by email?

They stand to receive a windfall under proposed Trump administration tax policies that would allow them to repatriate that money at a very low rate, perhaps 10 percent, compared with the current statutory federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent.

On Thursday, it notified Congress that it intends to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). But the parameters of that renegotiation have narrowed sharply, perhaps in response to substantial resistance to many of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies by companies that have prospered under Nafta.

That, too, could lead to more business for internationally minded American capitalists.", "The International First companies have also been helped by signs of economic improvement in Europe and strong performance in foreign stock markets, many of which have been outperforming the American stock market in both local currency and in dollar terms. In short, American companies with heavy exposure to foreign markets have gotten some international tailwinds.", "Domestic problems \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s political struggles, and Congress\u2019s inability to enact major legislation \u2014 may have led the stock market to ignore the Trump agenda.

The rule, with the blandly mellifluous title \u201cFinancial Instruments\u2013Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,\u201d or Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, will change the way companies, both big and small, account for their equity investments in other companies, specifically for those stakes smaller than 20 percent.", "Like much of what the accounting standards board tries to do, the new rule is intended to provide investors and creditors with better information and more clarity around a company\u2019s financial statements, with the lofty goal of helping them make more informed decisions when providing capital to a company or business.", "But Update 2016-01 could significantly affect \u2014 and distort \u2014 the way companies like Alphabet, Intel, IBM and Salesforce.com, which make a lot of small investments in other companies, report their earnings. It could also curtail such investments from being made in the first place, because some businesses say the costs of complying with the rule are too high.", "Here\u2019s how things would change with the new rule: Now, when a company buys a stake of less than 20 percent in another company, it usually accounts for the investment on its balance sheet at cost \u2014 the price it paid for it. Over time, under the old rules, if the value of the investment goes down, the rules required a corresponding write-down of the value, both through the company\u2019s income statement and on its balance sheet. But if the value increases over time, the investment can still be kept at cost.", "While investors were fully informed when an investment lost value, there was less transparency for them when an investment increased in value. What investors lost in transparency on the upside, it has been argued, was gained in not requiring corporate executives to place a number on these often difficult-to-value investments every quarter.", "That\u2019s what is going to change after Dec. 15. From then on, each minority investment a public company makes will have to be valued quarterly, whether that value has increased or decreased. That potential volatility will soon be required to flow through a company\u2019s income statement, with the possibility of causing fluctuations to earnings per share from something that is not even a core business.", "Corporate executives will have two choices on how to go about valuing these investments.", "They can either spend the time valuing these investments themselves (or hire an accounting firm or a valuation firm like Duff & Phelps), or they can choose to wait until there is a market-driven valuation event and then mark up the value of the investment accordingly. How a company chooses to value these investments \u2014 whether every quarter or when there is a market event \u2014 has to be selected soon, and then cannot be changed. This, too, has added to the corporate executives\u2019 concerns.", "Take, for example, investments that have been made over the years in Uber, which now has a valuation of around $70 billion. In 2013, Google Ventures, now part of Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, invested $258 million in Uber at a post-money valuation of $3.76 billion. Four years later, that investment is now worth around $4.8 billion.", "That\u2019s a nice return on investment, although it has nothing to do with Google\u2019s core business. At the moment, the word \u201cUber\u201d does not appear in Alphabet\u2019s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In Alphabet\u2019s latest quarterly filing, it explains that all of its minority investments in private companies have a so-called carrying value of $1.7 billion, which presumably includes its investment in Uber at the cost of $258 million.", "Under the new rules, Alphabet will basically have to value its Uber investment at market, or closer to the $4.8 billion (either because of its own valuation or based on the recent new investments in the company). That increase in the value of Google\u2019s investment in Uber, around $4.5 billion, would have to flow through Alphabet\u2019s income statement. Considering that in the first quarter of 2017 Alphabet had net income of $5.4 billion, adding in the Uber gain of around $4.5 billion could have quite the distorting effect. It could have a similar effect on the downside if in subsequent quarters Uber\u2019s valuation takes a hit.", "The whole matter could be further complicated if Alphabet chooses to take one approach to how it values Uber and, say, Microsoft, another small Uber investor, takes a different one. It will soon be possible for Alphabet to value its stake in Uber using a different methodology than Microsoft does for the exact same investment.", "Or take Google\u2019s 2014 investment in Cloudera, a chip manufacturer, at a $1.8 billion valuation. Then, Intel invested at a $4.1 billion valuation \u2014 big gain. But Cloudera went public at a $2 billion valuation \u2014 big loss.", "I am sure the Financial Accounting Standards Board was intended well when it passed this new rule. In its 232-page document outlining the new proposal, it eloquently described how the new disclosure would add transparency and understanding of what these outside investments are worth. And that may well turn out to be the case.", "But the new rule also has the potential to confuse investors about the value of these equity stakes, too.

While autonomous car designs use numerous sensors, including ultrasonic, radar and video camera components, lidar has unique abilities. Unlike cameras, for example, lidar cannot be fooled by shadows or blinded by bright sunlight.", "The biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption is an economic one, and that is where the battle is being waged.", "When Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research eight years ago, the lidar sensors it used cost roughly $75,000. Those sensors were made by Velodyne Lidar, an industry leader. Velodyne declined to say what the current pricing is for such systems, but Waymo\u2019s chief executive, John Krafcik, said in a recent presentation that his company had reduced the cost of its lidar system by 90 percent.", "But even at $7,500, such systems are seen as too expensive to meet automakers\u2019 demands.", "\u201cCar companies want it to cost $100 and perform 10 times better, be smaller \u2014 and very reliable,\u201d said Omer Keilaf, chief executive of Innoviz Technologies, a lidar developer based in Israel. \u201cSo there\u2019s a big vacuum in the industry right now.\u201d", "The race to fill that void is largely focused on producing solid-state lidar systems, which would shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts involved in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that could bring costs down, said Hongbo Zhang, a research associate at Virginia Tech who is working on a lidar design. Established automotive suppliers, such as Velodyne and Valeo; technology companies like Waymo and Uber; and relative newcomers like Innoviz, LeddarTech and Quanergy all have their sights set on making less expensive sensors.", "Solid-state lidars tend to have a reduced field of view, about 120 degrees compared with the 360-degree view offered by rooftop models. \u201cSo to create a cocoon around the car, you need to integrate four to six solid-state lidar sensors,\u201d said Marc A. Morin, a spokesman for LeddarTech.", "But most of the researchers working on these designs still believe they can produce them for much lower prices, and Hyundai has demonstrated in its Ioniq autonomous test cars how such sensors could be made less conspicuous and concealed in the bumpers and roof pillars of vehicles.", "Luminar Technologies, a lidar company that recently came out of stealth mode, is focusing on improving the performance of sensors by extending the effective range of lidar past 200 meters. (Top-of-the-line sensors now have a range of 120 meters.)

Our singular foresight created civilization and sustains society.

Other animals have springtime rituals for educating the young, but only we subject them to \u201ccommencement\u201d speeches grandly informing them that today is the first day of the rest of their lives.", "A more apt name for our species would be Homo prospectus, because we thrive by considering our prospects. The power of prospection is what makes us wise. Looking into the future, consciously and unconsciously, is a central function of our large brain, as psychologists and neuroscientists have discovered \u2014 rather belatedly, because for the past century most researchers have assumed that we\u2019re prisoners of the past and the present.", "Behaviorists thought of animal learning as the ingraining of habit by repetition. Psychoanalysts believed that treating patients was a matter of unearthing and confronting the past. Even when cognitive psychology emerged, it focused on the past and present \u2014 on memory and perception.", "But it is increasingly clear that the mind is mainly drawn to the future, not driven by the past. Behavior, memory and perception can\u2019t be understood without appreciating the central role of prospection. We learn not by storing static records but by continually retouching memories and imagining future possibilities. Our brain sees the world not by processing every pixel in a scene but by focusing on the unexpected.", "Our emotions are less reactions to the present than guides to future behavior. Therapists are exploring new ways to treat depression now that they see it as primarily not because of past traumas and present stresses but because of skewed visions of what lies ahead.", "Prospection enables us to become wise not just from our own experiences but also by learning from others. We are social animals like no others, living and working in very large groups of strangers, because we have jointly constructed the future. Human culture \u2014 our language, our division of labor, our knowledge, our laws and technology \u2014 is possible only because we can anticipate what fellow humans will do in the distant future. We make sacrifices today to earn rewards tomorrow, whether in this life or in the afterlife promised by so many religions.", "Some of our unconscious powers of prospection are shared by animals, but hardly any other creatures are capable of thinking more than a few minutes ahead. Squirrels bury nuts by instinct, not because they know winter is coming. Ants cooperate to build dwellings because they\u2019re genetically programmed to do so, not because they\u2019ve agreed on a blueprint. Chimpanzees have sometimes been known to exercise short-term foresight, like the surly male at a Swedish zoo who was observed stockpiling rocks to throw at gawking humans, but they are nothing like Homo prospectus.", "If you\u2019re a chimp, you spend much of the day searching for your next meal. If you\u2019re a human, you can usually rely on the foresight of your supermarket\u2019s manager, or you can make a restaurant reservation for Saturday evening thanks to a remarkably complicated feat of collaborative prospection. You and the restaurateur both imagine a future time \u2014 \u201cSaturday\u201d exists only as a collective fantasy \u2014 and anticipate each other\u2019s actions. You trust the restaurateur to acquire food and cook it for you. She trusts you to show up and give her money, which she will accept only because she expects her landlord to accept it in exchange for occupying his building.", "The central role of prospection has emerged in recent studies of both conscious and unconscious mental processes, like one in Chicago that pinged nearly 500 adults during the day to record their immediate thoughts and moods. If traditional psychological theory had been correct, these people would have spent a lot of time ruminating. But they actually thought about the future three times more often than the past, and even those few thoughts about a past event typically involved consideration of its future implications.", "When making plans, they reported higher levels of happiness and lower levels of stress than at other times, presumably because planning turns a chaotic mass of concerns into an organized sequence. Although they sometimes feared what might go wrong, on average there were twice as many thoughts of what they hoped would happen.", "While most people tend to be optimistic, those suffering from depression and anxiety have a bleak view of the future \u2014 and that in fact seems to be the chief cause of their problems, not their past traumas nor their view of the present. While traumas do have a lasting impact, most people actually emerge stronger afterward. Others continue struggling because they over-predict failure and rejection. Studies have shown depressed people are distinguished from the norm by their tendency to imagine fewer positive scenarios while overestimating future risks.", "They withdraw socially and become paralyzed by exaggerated self-doubt. A bright and accomplished student imagines: If I flunk the next test, then I\u2019ll let everyone down and show what a failure I really am. Researchers have begun successfully testing therapies designed to break this pattern by training sufferers to envision positive outcomes (imagine passing the test) and to see future risks more realistically (think of the possibilities remaining even if you flunk the test).", "Most prospection occurs at the unconscious level as the brain sifts information to generate predictions. Our systems of vision and hearing, like those of animals, would be overwhelmed if we had to process every pixel in a scene or every sound around us. Perception is manageable because the brain generates its own scene, so that the world remains stable even though your eyes move three times a second. This frees the perceptual system to heed features it didn\u2019t predict, which is why you\u2019re not aware of a ticking clock unless it stops. It\u2019s also why you don\u2019t laugh when you tickle yourself: You already know what\u2019s coming next.", "Behaviorists used to explain learning as the ingraining of habits by repetition and reinforcement, but their theory couldn\u2019t explain why animals were more interested in unfamiliar experiences than familiar ones. It turned out that even the behaviorists\u2019 rats, far from being creatures of habit, paid special attention to unexpected novelties because that was how they learned to avoid punishment and win rewards.", "The brain\u2019s long-term memory has often been compared to an archive, but that\u2019s not its primary purpose. Instead of faithfully recording the past, it keeps rewriting history. Recalling an event in a new context can lead to new information being inserted in the memory. Coaching of eyewitnesses can cause people to reconstruct their memory so that no trace of the original is left.", "The fluidity of memory may seem like a defect, especially to a jury, but it serves a larger purpose. It\u2019s a feature, not a bug, because the point of memory is to improve our ability to face the present and the future. To exploit the past, we metabolize it by extracting and recombining relevant information to fit novel situations.", "This link between memory and prospection has emerged in research showing that people with damage to the brain\u2019s medial temporal lobe lose memories of past experiences as well as the ability to construct rich and detailed simulations of the future. Similarly, studies of children\u2019s development show that they\u2019re not able to imagine future scenes until they\u2019ve gained the ability to recall personal experiences, typically somewhere between the ages of 3 and 5.", "Perhaps the most remarkable evidence comes from recent brain imaging research. When recalling a past event, the hippocampus must combine three distinct pieces of information \u2014 what happened, when it happened and where it happened \u2014 that are each stored in a different part of the brain. Researchers have found that the same circuitry is activated when people imagine a novel scene. Once again, the hippocampus combines three kinds of records (what, when and where), but this time it scrambles the information to create something new.", "Even when you\u2019re relaxing, your brain is continually recombining information to imagine the future, a process that researchers were surprised to discover when they scanned the brains of people doing specific tasks like mental arithmetic. Whenever there was a break in the task, there were sudden shifts to activity in the brain\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d circuit, which is used to imagine the future or retouch the past.", "This discovery explains what happens when your mind wanders during a task: It\u2019s simulating future possibilities. That\u2019s how you can respond so quickly to unexpected developments. What may feel like a primitive intuition, a gut feeling, is made possible by those previous simulations.", "Suppose you get an email invitation to a party from a colleague at work. You\u2019re momentarily stumped. You vaguely recall turning down a previous invitation, which makes you feel obliged to accept this one, but then you imagine having a bad time because you don\u2019t like him when he\u2019s drinking. But then you consider you\u2019ve never invited him to your place, and you uneasily imagine that turning this down would make him resentful, leading to problems at work.", "Methodically weighing these factors would take a lot of time and energy, but you\u2019re able to make a quick decision by using the same trick as the Google search engine when it replies to your query in less than a second. Google can instantly provide a million answers because it doesn\u2019t start from scratch. It\u2019s continually predicting what you might ask.", "Your brain engages in the same sort of prospection to provide its own instant answers, which come in the form of emotions. The main purpose of emotions is to guide future behavior and moral judgments, according to researchers in a new field called prospective psychology. Emotions enable you to empathize with others by predicting their reactions. Once you imagine how both you and your colleague will feel if you turn down his invitation, you intuitively know you\u2019d better reply, \u201cSure, thanks.\u201d", "If Homo prospectus takes the really long view, does he become morbid? That was a longstanding assumption in psychologists\u2019 \u201cterror management theory,\u201d which held that humans avoid thinking about the future because they fear death.

One common response was to become more assertive about one\u2019s cultural values, like becoming more patriotic.", "But there\u2019s precious little evidence that people actually spend much time outside the lab thinking about their deaths or managing their terror of mortality.

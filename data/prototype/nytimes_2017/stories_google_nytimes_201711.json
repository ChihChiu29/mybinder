The South will rise again!\u201d The ad, created in October of 2016, cost approximately $1,300 and garnered roughly 40,000 clicks.", "Representatives also noted that some ads, including one from the account \u201cTEN_GOP,\u201d were shared by members of the Trump campaign and administration, including Kelly Anne Conway, Michael Flynn and President Trump\u2019s son, Donald J. Trump Jr.", "\u201cWhether knowingly or unknowingly, they helped legitimize and spread Russian disinformation,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut.", "One ad from a Facebook account called \u201cBack the Badge\u201d saw more than 1.3 million impressions and more than 73,000 likes.", "The timing and content of the ads were no accident. Last year, as the Black Lives Matter protest movement gained steam, the Internet Research Agency in Russia created groups that supported the movement \u2014 like the far-reaching account \u201cBlacktivists\u201d \u2014 and opposed to it, like \u201cBack the Badge.\u201d That suggested a surgical deployment of incendiary content across all three platforms with the aim of dividing Americans at critical moments in the election season.", "\u201cIt was undertaken by people who understand social media,\u201d Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch said, referring to the Russian agencies who created the accounts. \u201cThese people were not amateurs.\u201d", "Lawmakers used a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee to stake partisan positions on the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential campaign, either defending President Trump\u2019s election or asserting that his narrow victory could have been delivered by Russian efforts on social media.", "Republicans strongly pushed back on the idea that Facebook, Google, and Twitter were responsible for the election results.", "\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily.\u201d", "Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, emphasized that the real intent of Russian propaganda was to generally spread misinformation and chaos.", "\u201cThese operations, they\u2019re not limited to 2016 and not limited to the presidential race, and they continue to this day. They are much more widespread than one election,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.", "Democrats, however, trained their remarks on the direct connection between Russian activity and the election.", "\u201cThe Russians created Facebook pages, posted YouTube videos, all trying to appeal to specific audiences,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon, said.", "The partisan dynamics put the social media companies in a difficult position, and Facebook wouldn\u2019t take a side.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve provided all the information we can about the content that we\u2019ve identified on the system,\u201d said Mr. Stretch, suggesting that the committee assess \u201call of the online and offline activity that would be necessary to effectuate a campaign.\u201d", "Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat from New Mexico, aimed at Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the role of social media in his win.", "\u201cLast month President Trump called Russian purchased Facebook ads a hoax. I\u2019ve looked at those Russian sponsored Facebook ads. I certainly hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review them. Are they, in fact, a hoax?\u201d Mr. Heinrich said.", "\u201cNo. The existence of those ads were on Facebook, and it was not a hoax,\u201d Mr. Stretch said", "Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, got to the heart of the Facebook and Twitter\u2019s dilemma: its business models are built on generating viral content.", "\u201cPart of what made the Russia social media campaign successful is that they understood algorithms you use that tend to accentuate content that is either fear-based or anger-based,\u201d said Mr. Schiff, who then asked the companies what their \u201csocietal obligation\u201d is to change those dynamics.", "The companies pushed back on the idea that their algorithms only reward viral content, which would make the sites vulnerable to the most outrageous posts.", "\u201cYes we do have an obligation to prevent foreign interference in the election. We take that obligation seriously,\u201d Mr. Stretch of Facebook said. \u201cWith respect to the algorithm, our goal is to provide the most relevant information. It\u2019s primarily driven by friends and family. That\u2019s the core of Facebook.\u201d", "Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who has largely spearheaded the effort prodding Facebook into handing over data, immediately went after the social media giant in his questioning.", "In a seven-minute exchange, most of Mr. Warner\u2019s time was spent dressing down Mr. Stretch for what he characterized as a lack of responsiveness from Facebook as his office repeatedly asked for more data on the extent to which Russian meddling influenced the election.", "\u201cI have more than a little bit of frustration that many of us on this committee have been raising this issue since the beginning of this year, and our claims were frankly blown off by the leadership of your companies,\u201d Mr. Warner said.", "Mr. Warner hammered his point with blown-up prints of some of the Facebook posts that circulated. One featured an illustration of Hillary Clinton in a fistfight with a picture of Jesus, an inflammatory ad aimed at riling up conservative Americans.", "Several senators trained their attacks on Facebook on Wednesday for its inadvertent role in the Russian influence campaign, a repeat of Tuesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing.", "\u201cI must say, I don\u2019t think you get it,\u201d said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who was also at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI went home last night disappointed. I asked specific questions, I got vague answers.\u201d", "As senators pressed Facebook\u2019s general counsel on Facebook\u2019s role in the election, one of the hallmarks of Facebook\u2019s explanation has been the issue of \u201cauthentic accounts.\u201d", "Since Facebook went public with its findings, the company\u2019s reasoning for taking down more than 80,000 fake, Russian-linked ads, was not the type of content they posted, but because those responsible for them had misrepresented who they were when creating the accounts.", "That distinction is key for Facebook. Outside of some parameters like nudity or incitement to violence, executives at the company are wary of becoming the arbiters of what content is or is not allowed on Facebook, fearing accusations of censorship.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t take for granted that each one of you uses Facebook to connect with your constituents, and that the people you represent expect authentic experiences when they come to our platform to share,\u201d Mr. Stretch said in his opening remarks on Tuesday.", "Mr. Burr asked if Facebook would have shut down the 470 Russian-linked accounts if they weren\u2019t fake.", "\u201cDoes it trouble you it took this committee to look at the authentic nature of the users and the content?\u201d Mr. Burr asked Facebook\u2019s general counsel.", "Mr. Stretch didn\u2019t directly answer. \u201cThe authenticity issue is the key,\u201d Mr. Stretch said, noting that many of those accounts would have been shut down anyway because they violated other terms of service.", "Political ads are just part of the problem, Mr. Warner said at Wednesday\u2019s first hearing.", "Russian agents spread nonpaid content through the creation of pages on Facebook dedicated to hot-button issues like race. On Twitter, the Kremlin-connected internet Research Agency used automatic messaging tools known as bots that could quickly spread tweets through multiple accounts.", "\u201cFor Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans. However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg,\u201d Mr. Warner said. \u201cThe real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed pages, which then spread widely on the news feeds of tens of millions of Americans.\u201d", "Earlier this week, Twitter, Facebook and Google revealed new information and numbers showing that foreign interference on their site was worse than they first reported. But the companies all stressed that the amount of Russian propaganda that reached users was just a sliver of the total amount of content their platforms produce every day.", "But some lawmakers think the companies are holding back information.", "Twitter said it identified 2,752 accounts controlled by Russian operatives and more than 36,000 \u201cbots\u201d that tweeted 1.4 million times during the election. The company had previously told lawmakers it found only 201 accounts linked to Russia.", "The new numbers still seem low, according to Mr. Warner.", "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly underestimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation. Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15 percent of Twitter accounts \u2013 or potentially 48 million accounts \u2013 are fake or automated,\u201d Mr. Warner said in his opening statement.", "Mr. Burr also noted the slow reaction by internet companies.", "With Facebook\u2019s acknowledgment that 126 million people were exposed to Russia-linked content instead of the 10 million people they originally estimated, \u201ctells me that your companies are just beginning to come grips with the scale and the depth of the problem,\u201d Mr. Burr said.", "\u201cYour actions need to catch up to your responsibilities,\u201d he added.", "For a second straight day, Ms. Feinstein asked Google why it continues to allow RT to continue to publish videos on YouTube even though a report from the American intelligence community has described RT, formerly known as Russia Today, as the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cprincipal international propaganda outlet.\u201d", "Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, walked a fine line, saying that RT\u2019s influence goes beyond merely YouTube; he noted that RT is available on cable and satellite television packages. It advertises in newspapers and can be found on hotel television channels.", "Google has reviewed RT\u2019s content and found that no violations to YouTube\u2019s community guidelines, Mr. Walker said. He said that the company provides information about the \u201cgovernment-funded nature\u201d of RT on Google \u2014 presumably on search results \u2014 and said it is considering expanding that to YouTube. He didn\u2019t elaborate how Google plans to do so.", "On Tuesday in a separate hearing, Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security, said Google dropped RT from its top advertising tier because of \u201ca drop in viewership\u201d \u2014 not because of its content.", "Ms. Feinstein said Google\u2019s answers were unsatisfactory. She repeated an earlier admonition of the tech companies: \u201cWe\u2019re in a different day now.\u201d", "\u2014 Daisuke Wakabayashi", "Despite being located in the San Francisco Bay Area, all of three tech companies position themselves as \u201cglobal platforms.\u201d The internet, as Mr. Stretch noted on Tuesday, is borderless.", "But the distinction presents a number of problems for the companies, particularly on foreign interference in American elections. Are technology companies beholden to protecting the interests of the nations they reside in? Or do they answer to some higher authority?", "Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, noted that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks continue to use Twitter and other digital outlets to publish document dumps and email leaks, some of which are damaging to Americans.", "\u201cIs it biased to side with America against our adversaries?\u201d Mr. Cotton asked, painting Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks as anti-American.", "Twitter\u2019s acting general counsel, Sean Edgett, demurred. \u201cWe try to be unbiased across the world.\u201d", "Facebook has also faced criticism for allegedly suppressing content at the request of some governments. In Myanmar, whose government\u2019s violence against the Rohingya people has been labeled by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing, Facebook is in a bind when it is forced to take sides with either the government or a faction deemed to be outlaws by the state.", "Recently, Twitter broke ranks with Google and Facebook in its treatment of Russia Today and Sputnik, state-backed media agencies in Russia. Twitter banned RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform and donated the funds to external research into how Twitter is used for civic engagement and elections. Facebook and the Google-owned YouTube have not taken the same route, citing that RT and Sputnik have not broken their terms of service agreements.", "But Twitter\u2019s move puts the company in a difficult position: What if Russia, for example, claims that an American news network is a state-backed propaganda arm in America, and demands that such a network be banned from advertising as well?", "Top executives for the three companies appeared before a judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday armed with regrets and pledges to do better. The lawmakers appeared to be unimpressed.", "Facebook came under particularly heavy fire, as senators from both parties pressed the companies on their sluggish responses.", "\u201cWhy has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem, see it clearly for the problem it is, and begin to work in a responsible way to address it?\u201d Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asked in one pointed exchange.", "The senators also raised doubts that efforts outlined by the companies \u2014 Facebook, for instance, said that it would hire more than 1,000 people to review political ad purchases \u2014 would protect the United States from outside influence.", "\u201cI\u2019m trying to get us down from La-La Land here,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, you have five million advertisers that change every month. Every minute. Probably every second. You don\u2019t have the ability to know who every one of those advertisers is, do you?\u201d", "Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, pushed the executives to weigh in on legislation that would require the companies to report who funds political ads online. In response, they suggested voluntary efforts already underway but said they hoped to work with lawmakers on such requirements.", "The House intelligence committee is expected on Wednesday to publicly release much-anticipated copies of Facebook ads purchased by Russian-linked accounts.", "The top Republican and Democrat leading the investigation, Representatives Mike Conaway of Texas and Adam Schiff of California, pledged to do so this month after a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.", "A few of the ads have leaked out, and others have been described by people who have viewed them, but the release should help cast new light on the Russian efforts.", "Wednesday will be a particularly busy day for Facebook, which will also report its third-quarter earnings at 4 p.m. Eastern, around the middle of the day\u2019s second hearing.", "The company, which is used by more than 2 billion people worldwide, is expected to post stellar results, with revenues from advertising jumping 41 percent from the same quarter last year to $9.88 billion.", "With its stock trading at a record high and the company\u2019s market capitalization over $500 billion \u2014 more than the gross domestic product of countries like Columbia and Taiwan \u2014 Facebook\u2019s business success clashes with the posture it will present to lawmakers.", "To members of Congress, Facebook will be contrite and stress the challenges of fixing its technology to prevent abuse of its site by foreign governments. But to investors, the message this afternoon will be decidedly bullish.", "That contradiction is at the heart of the problem Facebook is confronting. Its business model, all based on advertising, is largely automated and reward the most viral content, even at the sake of the public interest.", "Facebook, Twitter and Google said on Monday, before their testimony, that the problems on the platforms were much worse than initially disclosed, illustrating the breadth and complexity of Russian efforts.", "According to testimony by the companies, Russian agents spread inflammatory posts that reached 126 million Facebook users, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded more than 1,000 videos to Google\u2019s YouTube service.", "The latest disclosure will most likely serve to underline complaints among lawmakers that the tech giants have been slow to recognize and react to the significance of the Russian campaign.", "Mr. Warner has been sharply critical of Twitter, in particular, telling reporters in September that the company\u2019s initial efforts \u201cshowed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is.\u201d", "On Wednesday, Mr. Warner and others are likely to bore into the details of the companies\u2019 internal investigations, questioning their rigor, as well remedies the companies have already volunteered.", "They will also want to hear about solutions to issues beyond the disclosure of paid political advertising, like the influence of bots and \u201corganic posts\u201d harnessed by foreign powers.", "\u201cTransparency in advertising alone, however, is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages,\u201d Mr. Schiff said recently."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/briefing/texas-shooting-paradise-papers-shalane-flanagan.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

As the most celebrated producer of television comedy in England in the last 15 years, from \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cThe IT Crowd\u201d to \u201cPeople Just Do Nothing,\u201d the current BBC Three mockumentary about a group of scraggly underground club kids, the 44-year-old Atalla cultivates writers who share his lacerating black humor. Often, it finds its source in his hapless characters\u2019 everyday awkwardness, with which Atalla \u2014 who considers himself a \u201clow-level, ineffectual troublemaker\u201d \u2014 sympathizes.", "The son of doctors who emigrated from Cairo to Northern Ireland when he was 4, Atalla has lived in London since he was 20. Though he was raised in a warm, knickknack-filled townhouse in Fleet, outside the city, decorated in good English tradition \u2014 down to the dark-wood tables and overstuffed sofas \u2014 the desire to make a permanent home of his own eluded him into adulthood. Even after HBO signed his company, Roughcut TV, to a deal in 2015, he lived quite lean: Unlike his friend Ricky Gervais, who bought himself a massive brick mansion in Hampstead, Atalla\u2019s grandest possessions until recently were an Audi A7 and a rose gold Rolex Daytona. He kept an apartment within the Gothic Revival St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel in the once-gritty King\u2019s Cross neighborhood, where the big attraction was the room service, which he learned too late had an 100-pound-an-order minimum. (\u201cA bloody expensive spaghetti Bolognese,\u201d he concedes.)", "Finally, in 2013, as the long-planned King\u2019s Cross development \u2014 a mixed-use complex, now home to the fashion college Central Saint Martins and soon to Google U.K. \u2014 began to rise on a 67-acre derelict plot in his beloved, bedraggled city center, he decided it was time for a space that better expressed his minor-key heart. Despite reveling in the raucous, often messy, atmosphere created by the young staff in his nearby office, Atalla wanted a refuge that was minimalist and fetchingly gloomy. He purchased a two-bedroom penthouse at the 15-story Tapestry building, a residential tower in the complex designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects. Finished last year \u2014 Atalla moved in March \u2014 it has a bold, unfussy exterior, with a skin of terracotta-colored concrete.", "BEHIND THE FLAT\u2019S massive black door now lies a dramatic world created by the polymathic East London-based designer Faye Toogood, whose studio Atalla heard about from a design-minded friend, and whose aesthetic overlaps with his, uncannily. While he was deeply involved in the process (\u201cI\u2019m not someone who likes to give up control,\u201d he says), he appreciated that the design team understood his desire to have \u201calmost nothing around,\u201d while creating cerebral, challenging rooms that were effortlessly functional. The only thing in the windowless 170-square-foot entry, for instance, is a 16-foot totem that Toogood fashioned from stacked plaster rectangles in chalky shades of gunmetal, charcoal and ivory. It seems to pierce the skylight, like a missile on a launchpad.", "\u201cThe idea with the sculpture is that guests would immediately know they were no longer in a regular, predictable environment,\u201d says Toogood, who began her career as decoration editor for The World of Interiors magazine, and, since striking out on her own a decade ago, now designs furniture (such as her signature resin Roly-Poly chair, which resembles the bottom half of a cartoon elephant), art and even unisex, smocklike garments. While some British designers fight against the country\u2019s climate by whitewashing walls and installing abundant lighting, Toogood, like Atalla, embraces its dreariness. \u201cPainting things white means you lose a lot of the nuance that comes with the subtle light that passes through a space over the course of a day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt flattens things and makes them boring.\u201d", "While she\u2019s known for her ability to harmonize the embellishments of classic British architecture with her dusky, organic modernism (in a recent project\u2019s bathroom, she hung Baroque gilt mirrors over an industrial trough sink), in this case, the building was brand new, unmoored from cultural touchstones: There were no Regency-era moldings to accommodate; no marble mantels to respect. Indeed, the only nod to Englishness are the floors \u2014 herringbone parquet. They contrast harmoniously with the walls, which are plaster, painted a greenish-gray hue Toogood calls Sludge, then waxed and polished to create a textured swirl that\u2019s velvety to the touch. The furnishings are spare and the surfaces are nearly clear of decorative objets; the lines geometric and uncompromising. \u201cI hate quirk in home d\u00e9cor,\u201d Atalla says. \u201cThe idea of funny shapes just for the sake of it strikes me as embarrassing.\u201d", "The overall effect is monumental and a bit formal, but leavened by clear, pale sunlight that, on good days at least, streams through the 12-foot windows and the three skylights. The public areas are divided by an atrium with a retractable glass ceiling; Toogood turned the area beneath into a contemplative place for morning coffee by staggering five floating plaster shelves on the wall, each topped with a bonsai, with hopes that Atalla would tend to them for years to come. In the evening, as the lights of Regent\u2019s Canal flicker below, and the sprawling city is laid out in endless vistas, Atalla says the spare space is \u201cso glamorous you just don\u2019t want to move.\u201d", "Another reason the apartment feels welcoming despite its austerity is that everything is a bit closer to the ground than usual; Atalla, who had polio as a baby, uses a wheelchair. By playing with scale \u2014 emphasizing the horizontal over the vertical, and slightly changing the proportions of some furniture, including the sofa and bed \u2014 Toogood didn\u2019t have to sacrifice streamlined beauty for accessibility.", "The design team did face one challenge, though: getting Atalla to feel comfortable with art. In the past, he shied from it. \u201cI never wanted to be one of those pretentious people who get rich and suddenly they\u2019re spending all their money in galleries, pretending they have taste,\u201d he says. Still, Toogood\u2019s staff convinced him to let her craft a few pieces. Above his concrete desk is a blown-up black-and-white photo of Slough, the industrial suburb where \u201cThe Office\u201d was set; on a floating shelf nearby is a set of small abstract matte plaster sculptures inspired by the shapes of his many awards, none of which are on display. \u201cI feel as though we did what we set out to do, which was to make somewhere really cool but not obnoxious,\u201d Atalla says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to become a caricature \u2014 for me, that would be death.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/opinion/forget-trump-and-discover-the-world.html": ["Mumbai, INDIA \u2014 In a recent MSNBC interview I described President Trump as a \u201cbrain-eating disease.\u201d", "I did so because his indecent behavior, and nonstop outrageous tweets and actions, force you as a commentator into a terrible choice: either ignore it all and risk normalizing Trump\u2019s excesses or write about him constantly and risk not having the time to learn and report about the big trends now reshaping the world \u2014 trends that one day will surprise your readers and leave them asking, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know this?\u201d", "To inoculate myself against Trump eating my brain, I occasionally get as far away as I can.

In 2009, my friend Nandan Nilekani, the tech entrepreneur, led a team of experts that helped the then-Congress Party-led government launch a national digital identity system, known as Aadhaar (Hindi for \u201cbase\u201d).", "Every Indian, rich or poor, goes into a field office, has fingerprints and irises scanned into a biometric database and then linked to the individual\u2019s 12-digit ID number with basic identifiers: name, address, date of birth and sex. When the Congress Party left office in 2014, and Narendra Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party took over, Modi continued and impressively energized the Aadhaar project, bringing it today to 1.18 billion users, out of a population of about 1.3 billion.", "In a country where many poor people lacked any form of ID, like a birth certificate or a driver\u2019s license, this has been a revolution, because they can now open a bank account and get government aid sent directly to them \u2014 rather than having bureaucrats, bankers or postal workers skim off 30 percent each year through the mail \u2014 and then link their bank account to their mobile phones, from which they can buy, sell, transfer money and receive payments digitally anytime anywhere.", "The digital network platforms that have broken the one-billion-plus user mark \u2014 like Facebook, Google and WhatsApp \u2014 all came out of the private sector. Aadhaar, noted the Harvard Business Review, is the only non-U.S. platform \u201cto have broken the one-billion-user threshold and the only such system to have been developed by the public sector.\u201d It also has the distinction of \u201chaving reached one billion users the fastest.\u201d", "When the British laid railroads in India it led to the more efficient extraction of natural resources. Now the Indian government, through the combination of a trusted unique ID platform \u2014 tied to cellphones and mobile bank accounts \u2014 is creating a kind of digital railroad enabling the more efficient empowerment of human resources.", "\u201cIt\u2019s transforming the lives of ordinary people,\u201d explained Alok Kshirsagar, a McKinsey partner based in Mumbai. \u201cMillions are already benefiting from digital payments and credit. There are already more than 30 percent productivity gains when digital capabilities are used in agriculture, transportation and manufacturing. We are in the early stages of a transformation that could generate as much as $1 trillion in economic value over the next seven to 10 years.\u201d", "Now any Indian farmer can just go to one of 250,000 government community centers \u2014 each with a computer, Wi-Fi and a local entrepreneur who manages it \u2014 log into a government digital services website with the farmer\u2019s unique ID and instantly print out a birth certificate or land records needed for transactions.", "An Indian friend told me: \u201cMy driver has two bank accounts, and he has given one debit card to his wife and another to his son. And now he tells me he puts X amount of his salary into one account and Y into another, using his cellphone, so his wife is empowered and not asking her mother-in-law for money, because she has her own debit card, and the son, who is off in school training to be a doctor, can be independent.\u201d", "Nilekani and his wife, Rohini, have built a foundation, EkStep, to create mobile education apps to help parents, teachers and students \u2014 armed only with cellphones \u2014 to learn faster, using these new digital networks.

All three said they would build artificial intelligence tools to combat fake and problematic content.", "Some lawmakers used the hearings to stake a position on the influence of the Kremlin\u2019s social media use in the election. The conclusions, particularly among senators, split along political lines. Republicans offered an implicit defense of the legitimacy of President Trump\u2019s victory and dismissed the effect of Russian meddling.", "\u201cA lot of folks, including many in the media, have tried to reduce this entire conversation down to one premise: Foreign actors conducted a surgically executed covert operation to help elect a United States president,\u201d said Senator Richard M.

Publicly and in private, Mr. Burr and Mr. Warner have taken pains to preserve bipartisan comity, and their success has set the committee apart from the other panels investigating Russia\u2019s efforts.", "But the difference in their emphasis on Wednesday also underscored the political realities buffeting their work. In advancing an investigation tied to Mr. Trump, Mr. Burr has been careful to make clear that the committee\u2019s work is larger than an individual candidate, and he has repeatedly tried to tamp down expectations about what it might find.", "Democrats did not have such reticence.", "\u201cWhether the Russians and the campaign coordinated these efforts, we do not yet know, but it is true that the Russians mounted what could be described as an independent expenditure campaign on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf,\u201d said Representative Adam B.

This one\u2019s on the record.", "Stephenson is battling the Justice Department, which this week sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. The suit marks the first time in nearly 40 years that Justice has tried to quash such a deal, known as a vertical merger. The Obama administration approved a similar merger \u2014 one that brings together companies that don\u2019t compete and that offer different products and services \u2014 between Comcast and NBC Universal in 2011.", "What\u2019s different this time? Vertical mergers have long had liberal critics, and Senate liberals Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and others have expressed public misgivings about AT&T\u2019s bid.", "But this is supposed to be a pro-business, antiregulation, conservative administration. And Makan Delrahim, a political appointee who served as Donald Trump\u2019s deputy White House counsel before taking over Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division, previously said of the deal, \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a major antitrust problem.\u201d", "That was before he got his current job. Once he did, Stephenson says, \u201cTemperatures change rather quickly, and Delrahim\u2019s own attitude changes rather quickly.\u201d", "Consider the timeline: Delrahim is confirmed on Sept. 27 as his department seems to be moving toward a consent decree for the merger. On Oct. 27, CNN breaks the story that the special counsel Robert Mueller filed charges in the Russia probe. On Oct. 30, the president and the vice president are to have a private lunch with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is nothing if not eager to get back into his boss\u2019s good graces.", "On Nov. 2, The Wall Street Journal gets the bombshell scoop that the Justice Department is inclined to block AT&T\u2019s bid. The same day, the president answers a radio host\u2019s question about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails by saying he is \u201cvery frustrated\u201d that he is \u201cnot supposed to be involved with the Justice Department.\u201d", "In other words, either Delrahim has miraculously seen the liberal light when it comes to vertical mergers, or he\u2019s channeling the wishes, implied or explicit, of the \u201cvery frustrated\u201d man who has made his feelings about the merger well known and could yet make him Sessions\u2019s successor.", "The government claims that the merged company could jack up prices on other distributors for must-watch content like H.B.O.\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and that it would also \u201cslow the industry\u2019s transition to new and exciting video distribution models.\u201d But the arguments, Stephenson notes, are \u201cbizarre at best.\u201d", "\u201cOne has to assume two things,\u201d he says of the idea that the merger will lead to higher prices for consumers. \u201cThat [Time Warner subsidiary] Turner has market power, and that [AT&T subsidiary] DirecTV has market power.\u201d But with roughly 10 percent and 20 percent of their respective markets, they don\u2019t.

Then there\u2019s the political one. Donald Trump makes no secret of his feelings about CNN, a Turner subsidiary. On Tuesday he reiterated his view that the merger was \u201cnot a good deal for the country.\u201d", "I ask Stephenson whether the government proposed the divestiture of CNN as a condition for its consent. He won\u2019t say, citing the confidentiality of negotiations with the government. It has been widely reported that the government had suggested the sale of Turner as one possible way out of the impasse.", "But the circumstantial case that the Justice Department\u2019s decision is politically motivated is compelling. For conservatives, it\u2019s a fresh reminder that the administration\u2019s pro-business convictions go only as far as the president\u2019s convenience. A Sanders presidency would also have opposed the merger, though at least it would have done so honestly. What we have instead is economic policy conducted as an extension of presidential pique.", "As for liberals, those inclined to agree with Justice\u2019s decision should note how similar it is to the administration\u2019s curious outreach to Russia. The curiosity isn\u2019t that there is no rational argument for improving relations with Moscow or opposing the merger. It\u2019s that the argument is being made by an administration whose ideological instincts otherwise lean in the opposite direction.", "I ask Stephenson if the government\u2019s suit smacks of the kind of political risk multinational companies often face in autocratic countries such as Russia or Turkey, where the whims of the ruler have a way of translating into the judgment of regulators and courts.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know if there has been political interference, but it\u2019s logical to ask questions,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be na\u00efve not to.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/opinion/trump-china-xi-jinping.html": ["BEIJING \u2014 Amid the pomp that President Xi Jinping of China is bestowing upon his visiting American counterpart, President Trump, it\u2019s hard not to see two leaders \u2014 and two countries \u2014 heading in very different directions.", "Mr. Xi emerged from last month\u2019s Communist Party Congress the undisputed master of the Middle Kingdom. \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d was enshrined in the party constitution \u2014 an honor previously granted only to Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.

A mountain of debt. Rising inequality. Slowing growth, dragged down by an aging population, lower productivity and inefficient state-owned enterprises. Poisonous air and scarce water.

In 1942, newly graduated from Russell Sage College, Caracristi was recruited to work in the stuffy attic of a former girls\u2019 school in the Washington area that had been converted to a secret military code-breaking office.

That era can give us clues to performing better in all sectors today. During the worst, costliest, bloodiest war in American history, it was an inclusive mind-set that helped the Allies defeat the Nazis.", "Women were key to any number of wartime advances, but their presence was crucial in intelligence and communications, as well as in the arena that combines both: signals intelligence, or code breaking. World War II was a war of encrypted signals. As armies and navies fought in distant corners of the globe, combatants developed myriad code and cipher systems to cloak their radio and telegraph communications, and code breaking came into its own as a way to eavesdrop on enemy plans.", "More than half of the American code-breaking force was female \u2014 roughly 10,000 women. Many were college graduates who had been shut out of graduate schools and excluded from fields such as math and engineering, and who now had a place for their talents.", "Even before America\u2019s formal entry into war, women formed an important part of the civilian staff in clandestine offices that were attempting to break Japanese and European systems.

She joined a team trying to break \u201cPurple,\u201d a cipher-generating machine used by Japanese diplomats.", "The team labored for more than a year; in September 1940, Grotjan spotted the coincidence that broke the cipher.

The country also benefited from the contributions of other marginalized groups, including Navajo code talkers, Tuskegee airmen and other black troops (including women) serving in a segregated military.", "There is a lesson here for the tech bros. Economists have long been mystified by the impulse to discriminate, given that shutting out any group deprives society of advances. Studies show that diverse teams get better results. Inclusion never entails \u201clowering the bar.\u201d It enlarges the pool of talent and brings the best people in.", "To be sure, even during the war, inclusion was seen as a temporary emergency measure, and the spectacle of tens of thousands of young women boarding trains to the nation\u2019s capital unnerved many. Ads and posters featured plaintive children asking, \u201cMother, when will you stay home again?\u201d After the war, backlash set in. The female code breakers got very little public credit for their achievements, and credit would be a long time coming for towering figures like Grace Hopper. And so here we are: The notion that genius is a male trait has once again raised its head.", "In today\u2019s rhetorical climate, it\u2019s not just a handful of entitled engineers who feel empowered to impugn certain groups. The same animus lies behind the Trump administration\u2019s eagerness to exclude refugees, and behind the proposed ban on transgender people serving in the military. In gratuitously acting to exclude willing citizens from military service, the president has declined to avail himself of the array of ingenuity and courage this nation has to offer.", "World War II is a reminder that, when freedom hung in the balance, inclusion kept us safe. It\u2019s also a reminder that our military once took the lead on social change at a time when more families felt connected to military service. Now we are greatly divided. We\u2019re losing a key military edge and could lose a technical one, if we give in to the notion that some groups are more gifted than others.

She reveals the painful process of unlearning and psychic deprogramming that black people in America must navigate in order to undo the rhetoric of a culture that attempts to condition them to think they are inferior. She talks about the surreal disorientation she experiences when a (white) neighbor mistakes her (black) father for a gardener.

Normally no one would invest $100 to earn only $90 back. But under the Senate plan, where some business expenses could be immediately deducted at a 35 percent rate, you would get $35 back in 2018. So your actual cost is $65. By the time your $90 earnings are paid in 2019, though, the tax rate would be 20 percent. That would cost you $18 in taxes, and leave $72 in your wallet.

The analyst Benedict Evans, in a representative essay, located a promising future specifically in chat bots \u2014 conversational interfaces for artificial intelligence, designed to assist with particular tasks. Facebook, the year before, created a personal-assistant chat bot, and the company would soon open its Messenger app up to outside developers, who it hoped would create more bots to help people shop, look things up or otherwise organize their lives. Amazon\u2019s Echo, by then already a surprise mainstream success, provided a tailwind: Here was a widely used artificial intelligence just sitting there on millions of countertops.", "These predictions were self-interested, of course. But they were plausible and appealing, not least because they were already coming true. By 2016, I was talking on my phone less but speaking to it more; my Echo and I had settled into a mutually beneficial, if lopsided, relationship (my commerce and privacy in exchange for the weather, some music and voice control of the fan).", "But despite the tech industry\u2019s efforts and hopes, the bots that have most effectively lodged themselves in the public\u2019s consciousness over the last year were not here to help \u2014 at least, not us. A different sort of bot \u2014 undercover but public-facing, highly political but comparatively primitive \u2014 was implicated in toxic and disorienting online conversations throughout the 2016 election cycle. Before the election, researchers at Oxford University suggested that between the first and second presidential debates, more than a third of pro-Trump tweets and almost a fifth of pro-Clinton tweets came from bot accounts. Political social bots have been stealing headlines ever since, described variously as \u201cfake Americans,\u201d as \u201cweaponized\u201d and as \u201cfake-news-disseminating\u201d agents of Russia.", "Such motive-centric descriptions tend to give too much credit to the influence bots. Mostly they are crude imitations of regular, if single-minded, people that, by virtue of existing and posting \u2014 a lot \u2014 are able to manipulate platforms\u2019 shared spaces: They increase visible follower counts and sharing metrics; they create Twitter trends and hijack or pollute hashtags into uselessness; they flood searches around breaking news. They probably don\u2019t follow you, and you probably don\u2019t follow them, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. They find their strength in numbers. They thrive just out of sight but fully within earshot.", "This type of bot bears little resemblance to the ones demonstrated on the stages of tech campus auditoriums. But each sort of bot is made, in its own way, to exploit untapped opportunity in large-scale automation. Where commercial bot-makers see an almost-too-good-to-be-true chance to simultaneously personify their brands and automate their businesses, political bot-makers see an opportunity to exploit anonymity with a humanlike touch at an inhuman scale. While tech companies stand proudly behind their bots, the people who create prolific and ideological social bots hide behind them. (Their provenance remains murky even today.)", "Anonymous social bots are obviously distinct from carefully designed software programmed in good faith. Technologically speaking, the efforts of Facebook and Google and Amazon represent the forefront of A.I. research, while crudely scripted social bots must merely clear the low bar of passing for an angry stranger. They were, in the memorable words of one researcher, \u201cyelling fools,\u201d promoting partisan messages and disinformation or merely registering their simulated agreement or anger, appearing maniacally focused, but not conclusively inhuman. A personal-assistant bot interacts with its users, whereas this breed of social-media bot stages performances for audiences and algorithms alike.", "But the proximity is toxic, and custody of the word is slipping. Bots, it turns out, make an excellent foil. Angela Merkel, in the run-up to this year\u2019s German federal election, talked about bots, generally, as if they were an invading army. In May, Hillary Clinton pointed to Russia-backed online efforts \u2014 including \u201cthe bots\u201d \u2014 as \u201cjust out of control.\u201d The phrase \u201cnot a bot\u201d now litters the profiles of politically engaged Twitter users (and, presumably, some bots). At the same time, President Trump, or a staff member, has indulged a habit of wandering into Twitter\u2019s uncanny valley to retweet supportive accounts whose humanity is hard to discern, or which eventually and mysteriously just disappear.", "Somewhere between the automated \u201cyelling fools\u201d of online political discourse and commercial tech\u2019s dream of increasingly sophisticated helpers is a third sort of social bot, which is both foolish and sophisticated in its own way. My longest and most fruitful relationship with a bot like this began through a private chat group I have with a handful of friends. We installed, as a member of the group, a free piece of software called Hubot \u2014 officially designed as a \u201ccoding assistant\u201d for workplace chat apps, but which we customized mainly for work avoidance. Most often, Hubot performed menial tasks \u2014 calling up photos or animations, performing various sorts of searches \u2014 but it soon came to function as a sort of group storytelling sidekick, developing something like a personality. Hubot lurked, responded and interjected, accumulating an intimate set of routinized in-jokes. Eventually, it learned to (obliviously and dutifully) summon fresh pictures of a famous actor in the service of a joke the origins of which, after a few years, none of us could even remember. It was, like all bots, a tool. What made all the difference was that we were the ones using it, and not \u2014 as is the case with the bots that have inserted themselves into our national discourse and our living rooms \u2014 the other way around.", "A 2016 essay by the New York-based think tank Data & Society \u2014 a so-called botifesto \u2014 identified this playful sort of bot as an evolutionary precursor to the various expressions of bothood today. The essay described how mindfully created bots, not unlike our version of Hubot, had been functioning in the wild, on public social media. Some were jokes and larks, whose \u201cvery \u2018botness\u2019 is funny, surreal or poetic\u201d: bots that used a social-media personality\u2019s corpus to create a (usually funny, always revealing) surrogate account, or bots that automated the dispersal of information in controlled, open and even journalistic ways. But the botifesto\u2019s intention was to sound an alarm. Less transparent social bots \u2014 primarily on Twitter and other social platforms \u2014 posed a risk to media and discourse. \u201cPlatforms, governments and citizens must step in and consider the purpose \u2014 and future \u2014 of bot technology before manipulative anonymity becomes a hallmark of the social bot,\u201d the authors cautioned.", "This warning wasn\u2019t just a prediction; it was based in observation. Anonymous bots masquerading as citizen and political actors had been a creeping feature in foreign elections for years. The 2012 election of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico was supported by armies of automated social-media accounts, which flooded Twitter with supportive messages. \u201cPe\u00f1abots\u201d became a feature of online Mexican political discourse through at least 2015. But bots hadn\u2019t yet run rampant on American tech companies\u2019 home turf. Manipulation by A.I. was typically seen as \u201csomething that was happening somewhere else,\u201d M.C. Elish, a researcher at Data & Society who contributed to the report, told me. \u201cWe only notice something when it\u2019s arrived on our doorstep.\u201d", "This arrival is likely to result in action. Twitter, for example, insists that it has been working hard on the problem. One of the most frequently proposed solutions to the problem of \u201cmanipulative anonymity\u201d among researchers in the field is some form of bot disclosure \u2014 a requirement, enforced by social platforms, that an account operated by third-party software disclose that fact. (Wikipedia, for example, already does this.) Bot disclosure could plausibly stem the tide of bots intended to exert crude influence or to harass people. Humans would, in theory, be able to interact with bots electively, and to better judge some sources of information or expressions of sentiment. A grand sorting could begin to restore order, but Twitter\u2019s discourse nightmare didn\u2019t start with bots and won\u2019t end with them.", "Social automation is both disruptive and revealing. Twitter in particular dehumanizes users in the process of giving them access to one another, so of course bots could thrive there \u2014 and of course they\u2019d closely resemble our worst-tweeting selves. Voice-and-text-activated assistants help monopolistic companies further consolidate power, and they complicate the stories we tell ourselves about privacy, as we invite the eyes and ears of the world\u2019s most ambitious tech businesses into our most personal spaces. Alexa reminds us what Amazon wants; Twitter bots show us how online mass communication breaks down. What was truly great about Hubot, the cobbled-together, inscrutable, mostly useless chat automaton, was the suggestion it made, through each absurd routine: that online, it\u2019s necessary that we build spaces for ourselves."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/education/edlife/bilingual-mfa-writing.html": ["When the discussion warms up in Andrea Cote-Botero\u2019s graduate seminar, English and Spanish flow freely, just as they do amid the afternoon foot traffic across the nearby Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez border.

For example, maybe your biggest problem is that you just don\u2019t know how to find great journalism that you actually care about it because it doesn\u2019t show up in your apps or feeds. Or, maybe you regularly discover interesting things but simply don\u2019t have the time to enjoy it \u2014 because who actually has 45 minutes to read a 5,000-word story on a Tuesday? Or, you may just prefer to read a book or watch a movie when you have free time because they give you that satisfying, relaxing feeling of having a clear beginning, middle and end. In that case, is there a news outlet out there that can give you a neat beginning, middle and end to catch up?", "Here are some steps you can take. Together they may take you a week or more since you may have to repeat them until the mix feels right.", "A) Ask yourself, What kinds of news or sources should I have in my daily diet?", "What is missing from my list? What do I have too much of, and what might I not have enough of? What new topics do I want to learn more about? What new sources could I explore? How reliable is the news I\u2019m getting now?

How useful for my everyday life?", "Nearly everyone who writes about news literacy recommends getting news from a variety of sources to ensure what you\u2019re taking in is trustworthy.

If so, here is a resource from the University of Michigan that can help: What news sources are left-leaning, centrist, or right-leaning?", "\u2022 Or, maybe you\u2019ve decided that you\u2019d like to get a global view via more international news \u2014 or, conversely, maybe you\u2019d like to focus more locally, on your own city, town or even neighborhood.", "\u2022 Is there a topic you\u2019d like to follow in depth \u2014 say, coverage of a particular community, issue or trend?

Or, if you want to understand someone whose politics are different than yours, are you reading any news sources that they follow to understand their worldview? Do you know anything about the communities where those voters live and how they might be different from your own?", "B) You can also consider how you get your news. Maybe you want to exclusively use your smartphone, or maybe you want to use a computer. You might like to read the paper or magazines in print because your family subscribes.

It has a label for \u201cdisputed\u201d stories, brought in independent fact-checking partners and allows users to report false articles.", "It\u2019s not clear whether these attempts to tackle misinformation will work; critics have called them ineffective and slow. But there\u2019s another problem, too. So far, Facebook and the public have focused almost solely on politics and Russian interference in the United States election. What they haven\u2019t addressed is the vast amount of misinformation and unevidenced stories about reproductive rights, science and health.", "Evidence-based, credible articles about abortion from reputable news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post didn\u2019t make it to the top of the list of \u201cmost shared\u201d articles on Facebook last year, according to BuzzSumo. But articles from the site LifeNews.com did.", "LifeNews, which has just under one million followers on Facebook, is one of several large anti-abortion sites that can command hundreds of thousands of views on a single post. These sites produce vast amounts of misinformation; the Facebook page for the organization Live Action, for instance, has two million Facebook followers and posts videos claiming there\u2019s a correlation between abortion and breast cancer. And their stories often generate more engagement than the content produced by mainstream news organizations, said Sharon Kann, the program director for abortion rights and reproductive health at Media Matters, a watchdog group. People on Facebook engage with anti-abortion content more than abortion-rights content at a \u201cdisproportionate rate,\u201d she said, which, as a result of the company\u2019s algorithms, means more people see it.", "Facebook\u2019s current initiatives to crack down on fake news can, theoretically, be applicable to misinformation on other issues. However, there are several human and technical barriers that prevent misinformation about reproductive rights from being identified, checked and removed at the same \u2014 already slow \u2014 rate as other misleading stories.", "First, the question of what\u2019s considered a \u201cfake news\u201d site is not always black and white. Facebook says it has been tackling the sources of fake news by eliminating the ability to \u201cspoof\u201d domains and by deleting Facebook pages linked to spam activity. For example, this year Facebook identified and deleted more than 30 pages owned by Macedonian publishers, who used them to push out fake stories about United States politics, after alarms had been sounded about sites in the country spreading misinformation about the 2016 campaign. (Facebook says some of the sites may have been taken down for other terms-of-service violations.) But anti-abortion sites are different. They do not mimic real publications, and they publish pieces on real events alongside factually incorrect or thinly sourced stories, which helps blur the line between what\u2019s considered a news blog and \u201cfake news.\u201d", "Second, Facebook says one of its key aims in tackling fake news is to remove the profit incentive, because it says \u201cmost false news is financially motivated.\u201d It says it hopes to do that by making it more difficult for the people behind the fake news sites to buy ads on its platform and by detecting and deleting spam accounts, which it says are a major force behind the spread of misinformation.", "However, the incentive for the people who write content for anti-abortion news sites and Facebook pages is ideological, not financial. Anti-abortion, anti-science content isn\u2019t being written by spammers hoping to make money, but by ordinary people who are driven by religious or political beliefs. Their aim isn\u2019t to profit from ads. It\u2019s to convince readers of their viewpoint: that abortion is morally wrong, that autism is caused by vaccines or that climate change isn\u2019t real.", "Finally, public pressure influences where Facebook directs its attention. Facebook may be focused on fake news and the United States election now, but its efforts to prevent the spread of misinformation in the buildup to the election were practically nonexistent.

It remains popular among American teenagers, perhaps the most highly coveted marketing demographic in the world. Snapchat has more users in the United States who are 12 to 24 years old than either Facebook or Instagram, according to eMarketer. It has also been able to buck Silicon Valley trends and introduced some truly innovative ideas, like the concept that not all digital communication should be permanently archived. And while Snap is losing money, many of its losses stem from changes it has made in order to compete with Facebook.", "Still, the fact that Snap\u2019s future is uncertain should worry you, even if you\u2019ve never used its products. A world in which every successful internet platform is expected to behave like Facebook is a more boring, less innovative world, with no companies to challenge Facebook\u2019s vision of the future.

Its disappearing photos encouraged honest sharing with close friends, rather than showing off to a large audience of acquaintances. Snapchat\u2019s Discover program was one of the first examples of a social network paying publishers to create original, high-quality content.

I asked Mr. Gallagher why Snap needed to compromise its values in pursuit of Facebook-style growth. Couldn\u2019t it reject Wall Street\u2019s demands, concentrate on making its existing users happy and be satisfied as a smaller and more focused company?", "Mr. Gallagher said Snap\u2019s employees, many of whom joined because they believed that the company would grow to enormous size, might bristle at any strategy that would hurt the value of their stock options.

The conceit is also animating Billy Crudup, who after a four-year absence from the New York stage appears to be having the time of his life in a sly role terrifically suited to his gifts.", "Among those gifts is the ability to build a performance from various angles at once, as if in a trifold dressing-room mirror. Mr. Crudup plays not only Philip \u2014 and Philip as his alter ego, Harry \u2014 but also dozens of people who pass through their lives. He doesn\u2019t impersonate those people, exactly, but sketches them for us as they might be seen through Harry\u2019s or Philip\u2019s eyes. In other words, he uses the secondary characters to characterize the main ones.", "In the first part of the play, those supporting characters include sad young Philip\u2019s alcoholic father and overwhelmed mother, both of them bewildered by the emergence of their \u201cpansy\u201d son\u2019s new persona at age 8. (Not many American third graders say \u201cDon\u2019t get your knickers in a twist, darlin\u2019.\u201d) Mr. Crudup gives the father, who is verbally and physically abusive, a flat Midwestern accent that seems all the more brutal in contrast to Philip\u2019s jaunty Brit speak \u2014 and hints at why he adopted it.", "At other times, especially after Philip moves to New York City and lets the insouciant Harry off the leash, the characters we meet through him are rendered more satirically. (If you don\u2019t know what a Hanukkah Brazilian is, go and learn.) It\u2019s an especially neat trick that in portraying several members of one family \u2014 the wealthy Schmidts, whom Harry infiltrates \u2014 they in turn are portraying him. Their infatuation, based though it is on credulousness, shows us how confident and attractive he\u2019s become.", "Because we\u2019ve seen where he started, we cannot disapprove too much of Harry as he attains comforts and companionship that Philip never could. One of the best things about the play is that for a long time it leaves us bamboozled into believing, despite the evidence of our senses, that they are different people.", "If you\u2019ve ever seen Mr. Cale perform his own work, you\u2019ll know that, in Philip, Mr. Crudup is doing a deft impersonation, with his wordless stammers, nervous smile and arms that dangle like parentheses at his sides. His Harry, though, has the randy swagger of a leprechaun.", "The realization that the \u201ctwo\u201d men are actually one \u2014 a realization that they must face as well \u2014 eventually forces us to confront some rather large issues about the construction of identity. If Philip can become Harry just by acting like him, does that not mean Harry was always inside him? Is personality really so multiple and mutable? What about sexuality and morality?", "These questions keep the play leaping forward, as Harry tests the edges of his fabulous new life. But in the last quarter, when he goes too far, so does Mr. Cale. The minute you feel the action straining toward an existential climax, you start to resist any further manipulation.", "This was probably inevitable. Born in England, Mr. Cale first became known in New York for the swift, dreamlike monologues he performed in the 1980s at downtown spaces such as Dixon Place and P.S. 122. (He started out as a singer-songwriter but, facing rejection, took to reading his lyrics instead.) The marvelous compression of works like \u201cThe People in Your Life for 30 Seconds\u201d is hard to maintain in a play of 80 minutes. And perhaps having a star of Mr. Crudup\u2019s wattage additionally encouraged Mr. Cale to turn up the heat.", "He needn\u2019t have.

She had been passing through a dangerous intersection \u2014 busy roads, no stoplights \u2014 and her first thought, as she waited for the ambulance to arrive, was about the inadequacy of local governance: In the Northern Virginia exurbs, rapid growth has long outstripped traffic oversight. Still, as a young Democratic campaign manager, it seemed to her vaguely unprofessional to have broken her neck on such a politically momentous day. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even out fighting the machine,\u201d she said, \u201cjust coming back from the dry cleaners.\u201d The first to arrive at her hospital bed \u2014 before her mother \u2014 were David Reid, a local businessman, and his wife, who had called around to every regional emergency room until they found her.", "Even if she hadn\u2019t broken her neck, she most likely couldn\u2019t have taken even a few hours off work to attend the march: She was the manager, and sole employee, of the two-week-old David Reid for Delegate campaign. Sorenson met Reid on New Year\u2019s Day for a mutual interview; Reid, a well-kept, goateed father of two in his mid-50s, was a latecomer to politics, and was relieved when Sorenson agreed to lead his campaign for the House of Delegates, the 100-member lower chamber of Virginia\u2019s legislature. In her six years out of college, Sorenson had worked continuously on campaigns, all but one of them in Northern Virginia, and despite her youth, she exhibited the grim, sardonic cheer of the veteran operative.", "Sorenson agreed to work with a novice like Reid because he seemed committed to real issues, and he made a sincere first impression. Also, she liked his odds. Virginia\u2019s 32nd house district is part of Loudoun County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country and, by median income, the wealthiest. Verdant, indistinguishable subdivisions are laid out in self-contained loops between windowed blocks of strip mall and windowless blocks of data center. There are overpasses to nowhere; there are construction sites that look like Caterpillar sales lots as well as actual Caterpillar sales lots. The county and its schools are around 30 percent nonwhite, with a large immigrant population. (Sorenson\u2019s favorite local lunch spot is an Afghan kebab joint.) The 32nd went for Hillary Clinton by 19 points. There was, Sorenson quickly got into the habit of saying, \u201cabsolutely no reason this district has a Republican delegate.\u201d", "The day she took the job, Sorenson put together an Excel document with all the precinct-level returns from the 2013 race, which the Democrat lost by only 651 votes. \u201cI looked for where we needed to run it up, where we needed to hold our own and where it was going to be hand-to-hand combat.\u201d She soon came to understand, however, that her seasons of training had hardly prepared her for the new political reality. Twelve days after her accident, she went to a meeting of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, expecting to encounter the usual 30-odd regulars. Instead, she found 300 new faces. \u201cWho the heck are all these people?\u201d she wondered. It was, after all, an off-election year, and it was winter.", "They had come, she realized, on behalf of what she began to call \u201cthe pop-up groups.\u201d She went to as many of their meetings as she could and found that many of their members were largely unacquainted with politics, especially on the local level. Some of them weren\u2019t even county residents; they were from McLean, and Arlington, and D.C., and even Maryland. Though a majority of these meetings might have been better described as meetings about meetings, she nevertheless admired all these new faces and the vitality they were prepared to bring to what were ordinarily considered marginal down-ballot races.", "Sorenson, whose one-woman campaign \u2014 the candidate had a demanding day job \u2014 was limited by a cumbersome and unsightly cervical collar, had few illusions that all these new volunteer hearts had been set aflame by the local business owner and retired Navy Reserve commander David Reid, even if everybody who met him agreed right away that he seemed like a profoundly decent guy with the right priorities. She knew that their primary motivation was their hatred for the president, and that their secondary motivation was their hatred of their local Republican congresswoman, but she was optimistic that they might be taught to direct some of their umbrage toward Reid\u2019s incumbent Republican opponent, Tag \u2014 \u201cSorry,\u201d she\u2019d say, with mock solemnity, \u201cDelegate Greason.\u201d", "What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues \u2014 how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed \u2014 were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, \u201cThat\u2019s not a congressional thing, that\u2019s a state thing!\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s not a state thing, that\u2019s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!\u201d Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: \u201cDon\u2019t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don\u2019t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn\u2019t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!\u201d", "If a more grizzled campaign manager might have thought only to harness this energy, Sorenson saw an opportunity to help organize it. When the volunteers made proposals that seemed impractical or irrelevant, she did not issue judgment. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to rain on their ideas,\u201d she said. Instead, she gently tried to usher them in productive directions. She told them about what a great guy David Reid was, how he\u2019d come from poverty and sent his two girls to local public schools and today stood for full-day kindergarten and gun control and Medicaid expansion and distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. She also told them about Reid\u2019s Republican opponent, Tag \u2014 \u201cSorry, Delegate Greason\u201d \u2014 and all the party-line votes he\u2019d made down in Richmond. \u201cHe votes 99 percent of the time with the Republican leadership. From assault rifles to bazookas to ninja stars, he\u2019s for it.\u201d", "To get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn\u2019t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn\u2019t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large \u201csteering committees\u201d \u2014 and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit \u2014 but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen.", "In the months after Trump\u2019s inauguration, there was no shortage of expressive opportunities for the left \u2014 protests, actions \u2014 but few electoral conduits for its new resolve. Virginia provided one of them. In what Sorenson unsentimentally called \u201c16,\u201d Hillary Clinton carried the state by more than five points, but the previous year\u2019s election had preserved for the Republicans a considerable edge in the House of Delegates: 66 to 34. Not a single incumbent lost. Now, in advance of 2017, Democrats couldn\u2019t help thinking it auspicious that exactly 17 of those Republican delegates came from Clinton districts. If the party could flip only those seats this year, it would come away with a 51-49 majority. This seemed like a totally fanciful possibility to Sorenson herself, but she wasn\u2019t blind to its inspirational potency: Flip the Hillary districts, flip the house.", "A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia \u2014 and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid\u2019s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn\u2019t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups\u2019 lists with what she called \u201chair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.\u201d", "Though in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. \u201cThere\u2019s just this huge energy,\u201d Sorenson told me, \u201cwith people saying, \u2018We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.\u2019\u2009\u201d They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn\u2019t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority.", "She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women\u2019s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery.", "Sorenson\u2019s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification \u201c(co-leader?)\u201d or \u201c(steering committee member?).\u201d She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (\u201call talk no plans\u201d); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they\u2019d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests \u2014 \u201cWill you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?\u201d \u201cWere you endorsed by Senator Sanders?\u201d \u2014 and Sorenson\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn\u2019t need the help badly enough.", "Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her \u201cCadillac plan.\u201d The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts \u2014 the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community \u2014 are gated and thus \u201cunknockable,\u201d which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort.", "Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason\u2019s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates \u2014 bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law.", "It wasn\u2019t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn\u2019t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson\u2019s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial \u2014 volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message \u2014 was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig.", "In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, \u201cNo one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.\u201d Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and \u201cthis here is ground zero.\u201d", "By the middle of June, Sorenson had hired a field director and a field organizer, both from the Clinton campaign. They chose the weekend of June 24 for their earnest summer opener \u2014 a \u201cWeekend of Action\u201d \u2014 in part because it coincided with a Network NoVA event called the Women\u2019s Summit. This daylong happening brought together participants from across the pop-up group universe to hear speeches from 35 of the House of Delegate candidates left standing after the Democratic primaries the week before. These primaries had delivered a remarkable slate \u2014 most of them first-time candidates, a majority of them women, including many from the working class and many of color. Sorenson did not feel competitive, and had great warmth for her colleagues in other races, but she knew that some of the pop-up groups would be tempted to exchange Reid for a candidate of greater charisma or a more diverse background, like the sheep farmer in a nearby district. She didn\u2019t want her outside collaborators to forget that they joined up with her (and Reid\u2019s) effort early and for good reasons.", "The other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff\u2019s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff.", "Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid\u2019s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family\u2019s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed.", "Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. \u201cAm I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?\u201d", "Reid looked to Sorenson before responding. \u201cNobody will ask you because you look like the district \u2014 it\u2019s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it\u2019s really starting to make a difference.\u201d The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid\u2019s biography \u2014 a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country \u2014 than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory.", "Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She\u2019d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. \u201cNow the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It\u2019s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren\u2019t caring about Black Lives Matter, well \u2014 it kind of opened my eyes. We can\u2019t ever not be engaged again. It\u2019s like the Founding Fathers\u2019 idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they\u2019re on Facebook but they\u2019re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There\u2019s nothing else going on in \u201917, and there\u2019s all this pent-up energy.\u201d", "Francesca said she had gone to the Women\u2019s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn\u2019t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn\u2019t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgender former journalist and \u201cfreshman member of the Democratic Party\u201d who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. \u201cMy opponent,\u201d she said with national-stage charisma, \u201ccares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!\u201d Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. \u201cWe\u2019re literally fighting for our democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "We got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people\u2019s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home.", "In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so.", "\u201cI don\u2019t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,\u201d she said.", "\u201cWell, I was never out canvassing before, either!\u201d Francesca said.", "Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a \u201c1\u201d on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a \u201c5.\u201d On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip.", "By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn\u2019t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign\u2019s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home\u2019s \u201cno soliciting\u201d sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote.", "This didn\u2019t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups \u2014 an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues \u2014 and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn\u2019t sure there was much she could do. \u201cThey have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.\u201d", "The interaction was, Sorenson thought, a bummer, but she couldn\u2019t afford to dedicate any more time to it just then. She had email to answer, and as she took out her phone, I looked down at mine. There was a news alert that the Supreme Court had upheld part of Trump\u2019s travel ban, and I read it aloud. At first Sorenson didn\u2019t seem to know what I was talking about. Then she said: \u201cOh, him. I can\u2019t even worry about him. I can\u2019t even think about him.\u201d She was late for another call, this one with the group that had the wrong compliance box on their folksy print-at-home postcards. It lasted an hour.", "It is never easy to assess a campaign\u2019s progress, particularly one that is likely to be won or lost by a few hundred votes, but over the summer the Reid campaign appeared to have cultivated a meaningfully committed base, among local voters and elsewhere. A San Francisco group called the Sister District Project, which pairs volunteers in deeply blue or red districts with campaigns in purple ones and had quickly become one of Sorenson\u2019s most useful and beloved allies, had helped them set up an Amazon Wish List. Now far-flung supporters could buy them toner or printer paper. They handily outraised Delegate Greason for the month of June \u2014 $53,000 to his $39,000 \u2014 with five and a half times as many total contributions and 12 times as many grass-roots donors. Greason was still up $36,000 in cash on hand, but there was almost certainly enough time to close that gap, especially since the Reid campaign had raised enough money to hire a finance director, a young woman who had worked on the Ohio senatorial campaign; she would save Sorenson countless trips to the Post Office and the bank. On the third weekend in July, Sorenson was working from home when she checked the campaign\u2019s Facebook page and saw a photo of some 30-odd canvassers, 20 of them from the group that had done the campaign\u2019s website. \u201cI was like, Holy cow, you usually see those numbers later in the year.\u201d By the end of August they\u2019d visited 32,556 doors. The House Democratic Caucus looked at their stats and decided to award them two additional paid positions.", "The major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state\u2019s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate \u2014 a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie \u2014 hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president\u2019s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama.", "It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson\u2019s race, though the summer poll wasn\u2019t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they\u2019d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations.", "Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He\u2019d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. \u201cThere\u2019s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs\u201d for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, \u201cafter what we\u2019ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.\u201d He did not seem like the sort of person who\u2019d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer.", "For canvassers, the script was slightly different in this phase of the campaign. They were now instructed to ask directly if the campaign could count on the respondent\u2019s vote. The field organizer explained that if volunteers found themselves in a position to discuss Delegate Greason\u2019s record in Richmond, they should mention that he missed more than 700 votes \u2014 713, to be precise. A volunteer raised his hand to ask how many pieces of legislation actually came before the delegates; he thought it would be more impressive to express Greason\u2019s absences as a percentage. Sorenson, at her computer, rolled her eyes. Once he left, she looked up. \u201cI know exactly how many pieces of legislation came before the chamber, and I picked that number for a reason! We do not want to express it as a percentage.\u201d", "For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign\u2019s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp.", "With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign\u2019s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they\u2019d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson\u2019s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken \u201ctens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.\u201d Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. \u201cWell, that last part\u2019s true.\u201d", "Sorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, \u201cWe need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.\u201d Sorenson didn\u2019t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, \u201cis just beautiful to me.\u201d And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia \u201cthe first statewide referendum on Trump,\u201d that was fine with her, as long as they didn\u2019t set expectations so high that their support couldn\u2019t survive a disappointment.", "Election Day was a dark deluge of hard, driving rain. Sorenson put on high green galoshes and met Reid at his polling place at 7 a.m., then sent him on a tour of polling locations to shake hands and take selfies. She went back to their staging location in the rec room of some dedicated supporters. Everybody seemed to have a different idle conviction about which kind of voter was most susceptible to the weather, but Sorenson screened out the chatter, sitting on a high stool in front of her laptop, an overheated phone in her hand. She left only to vote herself, and to check up on an alarming but ultimately false story she heard about an older supporter who\u2019d had her ballot disqualified for no reason.", "The foot traffic \u2014 not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa \u2014 was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they\u2019d done, over their 11-day \u201cmobilization window,\u201d of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered \u201cI voted\u201d stickers. Then they\u2019d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. \u201cWhen do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.\u201d", "Sorenson didn\u2019t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in \u2014 turnout, she thought, couldn\u2019t realistically be as high as it seemed to be \u2014 but by 4 o\u2019clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign\u2019s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct.", "The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun\u2019s precincts were reporting. Reid\u2019s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. \u201cYou are so [expletive] awesome,\u201c one said. \u201cYou brought happiness back into our lives,\u201d said another.", "Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors \u2014 the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory \u2014 to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s guy.\u201d", "Her finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: \u201cHow are you so calm? I feel like we\u2019ve all been in our little bubble, but look\u201d \u2014 she gestured toward the television overhead \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re on MSNBC!

She is a sister of Mr. Dickinson, & seems to be the climax of all the family oddity. She has not been outside of her own house in fifteen years.\u201d The details were tantalizing: \u201cShe dresses wholly in white, & her mind is said to be perfectly wonderful. She writes finely, but no one ever sees her.\u201d", "More than a century later, a gentleman in Yonkers wrote an article for his local paper about a man named Don DeLillo, who lived on the same street and whom he\u2019d often run into while walking his dog. \u201cDeLillo didn\u2019t seem all that approachable,\u201d he noted of the author, admitting he was more of a Carl Hiaasen fan. \u201cOh, he\u2019d nod and smile faintly when we passed on the parkway bridge leading to Bronxville. But serious writers don\u2019t advertise their presence. They tend to be quiet, solitary types who fight internal battles. You don\u2019t want to bug them during their death struggle with writer\u2019s block.\u201d", "It\u2019s hard to say when, precisely, the myth of artistic reclusiveness finally lost its luster \u2014 certainly before Sia came out from behind her wig, or even before Thomas Pynchon, the last of our great literary recluses, voiced himself on \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on two episodes in 2004 drawn with a bag over his head. (The irony, of course, is that if Pynchon simply had a recent author photo \u2014 the only known portraits of him are from the 1950s \u2014 no one would really care about unmasking him anymore.)", "Part of the myth\u2019s allure, naturally, was the notion of the artist as a kind of fragile oracle whose genius must be protected from the world, historically by \u201cmuses\u201d (often wives who dealt with domestic and managerial affairs). But as the boundaries of private life dissolve, there\u2019s not much space for reflection, to say nothing of vulnerability. No one wants to imagine Virginia Woolf on book tour, or Joseph Cornell submitting to a magazine profile, showing off his files of Hedy Lamarr cutouts in his Utopia Parkway basement. Once upon a time, not turning up for an awards ceremony held a kind of clout: \u201cWhen a writer doesn\u2019t show his face,\u201d as DeLillo wrote in his 1991 novel, \u201cMao II,\u201d about a reclusive novelist who becomes a prisoner of a terrorist organization, \u201che becomes a local symptom of God\u2019s famous reluctance to appear.\u201d Now it feels a little rude, like not showing up to a dinner party held in your honor. Terrence Malick, who disappeared for two decades following 1978\u2019s \u201cDays of Heaven,\u201d reappearing in 1998 with \u201cThe Thin Red Line,\u201d may be the last person in Hollywood with the God-like privilege of opting out of self-promotion. To be left alone with one\u2019s work, in an era in which even Banksy is on Twitter, is an uncommon luxury.", "What could be more noble or pure than forsaking society and vanity for one\u2019s art? Henry David Thoreau\u2019s call in 1854 to \u201csimplify, simplify\u201d was a kind of recluse\u2019s mantra, as well as an act of protest against the modern world that would serve as a future model for solitary artists, but as Kathryn Schulz argued in a Thoreau takedown in The New Yorker in 2015, reclusiveness can also breed narcissism and sententiousness. Today, it can feel a little adolescent. It\u2019s hard to buy into Thoreau\u2019s concept of self-reliance while knowing that his mother was doing his laundry. Reclusiveness can also appear to arrest people in time, rendering even the most brilliant high-mindedness eccentric and sad, the most famous example being the late J.D. Salinger, who was still railing against \u201cthe phonies\u201d and writing to teenage girls from his New Hampshire farmhouse well into middle age, 20 or so years after he began his self-imposed exile in the 1950s. Thomas Bernhard\u2019s neighbors in his Austrian village used to warn their children when they misbehaved that they would send \u201cthat weird recluse\u201d after them.", "Now that we have terms like social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia and drugs like Paxil, retiring to one\u2019s bedchamber feels less Emily Dickinson, more hikikomori. It\u2019s all too easy to believe the age of the artistic recluse is over, given that most artists now cultivate a cyclical relationship with the spotlight, intermittently stepping into and receding from it. It\u2019s almost impossible for the artist not to engage with the public today, and so the standards of privacy have lowered. These days, using a painting of yourself as an album cover (Lorde) or limiting press interviews (Frank Ocean) seems to count as mystery.", "But what has increased in the age of distraction is our concern for the necessary conditions in which art could flourish. No longer can the world be kept at bay with the closing of a door; Woolf\u2019s room of her own is now wired for internet. To look at my shelves of favorite novels written in feverish solitude and think that they might never have come to pass is also to know there must be many more today that are simply not being written. And so the greater truths found in solitude \u2014 in nature, like the Romantics\u2019 \u201cthoughts of more deep seclusion,\u201d or in a country in which you don\u2019t speak the language, in which no one knows your name \u2014 have never felt more rare and hard-won. The hermit sits alone no longer; he has a Facebook page to update.", "IT\u2019S SURELY NO COINCIDENCE that the more we live our lives in public, the more we yearn to flee it. In a troubled, fractious world, in which political debates and social change occur in hashtags, Thoreau\u2019s form of civil disobedience, to withdraw instead of to Tweet, has a profound appeal, regardless of whether or not he was, to steal Salinger\u2019s word, a phony. But even we technological Bartlebys who would prefer not to post the contents of our closets/bookshelves/hearts on social media have to concede the internet\u2019s potential for connectivity, inspiration and serendipitous expression. Publicly responding to the news of the day is now as important a prerequisite for a serious artistic persona as restraint was for Pynchon\u2019s generation. For every Jonathan Franzen, with his sealed Ethernet port and noise-canceling headphones, there\u2019s an Elif Batuman, who uses social media as a natural extension of her creative self. For each of us who believes that a selfie might, in fact, damage the delicate membranes of our souls, there\u2019s another who believes it might be an asset for a shy artist, amplifying a presence that might otherwise remain unknown. While it\u2019s disconcerting to imagine a parallel literary history with Proust Instagramming madeleines, just think what a sensation Dickinson, the woman who seemed to think in 140-word epigrams, would have been on Twitter. (To say nothing of Miss Havisham on Tinder.)", "What has endured in the act of creation is the idea of getting lost in order to be found in art. This negotiation can also go terribly wrong: Nell Stevens\u2019s darkly funny memoir, \u201cBleaker House,\u201d recounts the six weeks she spent in one of the most remote parts of the Falkland Islands with the hopes of writing a novel, only to find herself watching \u201cEat Pray Love\u201d over and over again and making lists of things she would Google if she could. Isolation has a way of becoming its own subject. But then I think of Howard Axelrod\u2019s \u201cThe Point of Vanishing,\u201d the extraordinary book he wrote about the two years he spent alone in a wooded Vermont cabin after losing the vision in one eye. \u201cSome people say solitude is their biggest fantasy; some say it\u2019s their biggest fear,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cBut when I ask why, they all give the same reason: hearing themselves think.\u201d", "The desire to uncover our one true voice, the dread of hearing what it has to say: This seems to me the tension of modern life, the thing that has us searching for a cell signal on yoga retreat. Being in a place where nothing has an agenda for your attention, as Axelrod found, means looking and listening in an unguarded way. \u201cNatural curiosities and affinities emerge,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cbecoming the filters for experience.\u201d How we breathe in the world, then, defaults to a function of an unbidden part of identity, rather than a function of what others want us to be \u2014 or, perhaps even more crucially, how we want others to think we are.", "Elena Ferrante, the Italian author whose pseudonymity became part of her mystique, once wrote to me in an email interview, \u201cIf my book were publicly mine from the beginning, I would be careful not to damage my image, I would censor myself.\u201d Writing was a \u201cbattle against lying. Only with the confidence of anonymity can I decide occasionally to publish. In the end, if I\u2019m forced to choose, I prefer to lose the role of writer rather than spoil my passion for writing \u2014 that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been.\u201d When she was allegedly unmasked by an Italian investigative journalist, her fans were outraged at the violation. It was invasive, they argued, which it was, but it seemed to me that not only were they defending Ferrante from the indignity of having her financial and real-estate records unveiled, they were also defending their own right not to know, to be free to imagine that she was, in fact, Elena Greco, the narrator of her Neapolitan Novels, the woman they knew with the intimacy and deep interiority only possible in literature.", "And so contemporary artists find ways to battle for truth on their own terms. I think of young women like Emma Cline, who push back against having their photos on the dust jackets of their books, or David Hammons, who declines to participate in the accepted machinations of the art world, or Bob Dylan, who took nearly two weeks to even publicly acknowledge that he won the Nobel Prize in literature last year. But maybe the best display of resistance against the role of artist-as-performer was the quietly myth-demolishing article by this year\u2019s Nobel laureate in literature, Kazuo Ishiguro, who wrote for The Guardian about the four-week period of seclusion in 1987 he and his wife called the \u201ccrash,\u201d a desperate attempt to \u201creach a mental state in which my fictional world was more real to me than the actual one.\u201d The result was \u201cThe Remains of the Day,\u201d a monumental yesteryear portrait of renunciation, and a life passed by, tragically unlived. Now, of course, all is reversed: It\u2019s renouncing the world that requires nerve and imagination, and the roar of silence that dares us to listen."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/briefing/democratic-party-china-texas.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

Two decades later, the idea attracted the attention of Patri Friedman, the grandson of the economist Milton Friedman, who seized on the notion.", "Mr. Friedman, a freethinker who had founded \u201cintentional communities\u201d while in college, was living in Silicon Valley at the time and was inspired to think big. So in 2008 he quit his job at Google and co-founded the Seasteading Institute with seed funding from Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire. In a 2009 essay, Mr. Thiel described seasteading as a long shot, but one worth taking. \u201cBetween cyberspace and outer space lies the possibility of settling the oceans,\u201d he wrote.", "The investment from Mr. Thiel generated a flurry of media attention, but for several years after its founding, the Seasteading Institute did not amount to much. A prototype planned for San Francisco Bay in 2010 never materialized, and seasteading became a punch line to jokes about the techno-utopian fantasies gone awry, even becoming a plotline in the HBO series \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d", "But over the years, the core idea behind seasteading \u2014 that a floating city in international waters might give people a chance to redesign society and government \u2014 steadily attracted more adherents. In 2011, Mr. Quirk, an author, was at Burning Man when he first heard about seasteading. He was intrigued by the idea and spent the next year learning about the concept.", "For Mr. Quirk, Burning Man, where innovators gather, was not just his introduction to seasteading. It was a model for the kind of society that seasteading might enable. \u201cAnyone who goes to Burning Man multiple times become fascinated by the way that rules don\u2019t observe their usual parameters,\u201d he said.", "The next year, he was back at Burning Man speaking about seasteading in a geodesic dome. Soon after that, he became involved with the Seasteading Institute, took over as president and, with Mr. Friedman, wrote \u201cSeasteading: How Floating Nations Will Restore The Environment, Enrich The Poor, Cure The Sick and Liberate Humanity From Politicians.\u201d", "Seasteading is more than a fanciful hobby to Mr. Quirk and others involved in the effort. It is, in their minds, an opportunity to rewrite the rules that govern society. \u201cGovernments just don\u2019t get better,\u201d Mr. Quirk said. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck in previous centuries. That\u2019s because land incentivizes a violent monopoly to control it.\u201d", "No land, no more conflict, the thinking goes.", "Even if the Seasteading Institute is able to start a handful of sustainable structures, there\u2019s no guarantee that a utopian community will flourish. People fight about much more than land, of course, and pirates have emerged as a menace in certain regions. And though maritime law suggests that seasteading may have a sound legal basis, it is impossible to know how real governments might respond to new neighbors floating offshore.", "Mr. Quirk and his team are focusing on their Floating Island Project in French Polynesia. The government is creating what is effectively a special economic zone for the Seasteading Institute to experiment in and has offered 100 acres of beachfront where the group can operate.", "Mr. Quirk and his collaborators created a new company, Blue Frontiers, which will build and operate the floating islands in French Polynesia. The goal is to build about a dozen structures by 2020, including homes, hotels, offices and restaurants, at a cost of about $60 million. To fund the construction, the team is working on an initial coin offering. If all goes as planned, the structures will feature living roofs, use local wood, bamboo and coconut fiber, and recycled metal and plastic.", "\u201cI want to see floating cities by 2050, thousands of them hopefully, each of them offering different ways of governance,\u201d Mr. Quirk said. \u201cThe more people moving among them, the more choices we\u2019ll have and the more likely it is we can have peace, prosperity and innovation.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/briefing/new-york-city-facebook-iphone-x.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/dealbook/five-technologies-that-will-rock-your-world.html": ["After the Russian hacking of the 2016 election, many people worry that technology has gone too far.

The new wave of artificial intelligence will reduce jobs, but will also improve your health and products like your smartphone. Here are five areas where tech companies, large and small, will change the way we live.", "Over the last half decade, with help from the complex algorithms deep neural networks, computers have learned to see. Loosely based on the web of neurons in the human brain, a neural network can learn tasks by identifying patterns in vast amounts of data. By analyzing millions of bicycle photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a bicycle.", "This means that services like Facebook and Google Photos can instantly recognize faces and objects in images uploaded to the internet. But artificial intelligence will also lead to a revolution in health care. Using these same techniques, machines can also learn to identify signs of disease and illness in medical scans. By analyzing millions of retinal photos, a neural network can learn to recognize early signs of diabetic blindness. By analyzing CT scans, a neural network can learn to spot lung cancer.", "Such technology will improve health care in places where doctors are scarce. But eventually, it will streamline care in the developed world as well. Google is already running tests inside two hospitals in India, and the start-up Infervision has deployed similar technology in hospitals across China.", "In the longer term, similar methods promise to rapidly accelerate drug discovery and so many other aspects of health care. \u201cEverything from the nature of the food that we grow and eat to the drugs that we give ourselves to how we monitor the impact of these things is all being transformed by A.I. in deeply profound ways,\u201d said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at DCVC, a San Francisco venture capital firm that has invested heavily in this area.", "Neural networks are not limited to image recognition. Far from it. These same techniques are rapidly improving coffee-table gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which can recognize spoken commands from across the room, and online services like Skype, which can instantly translate phone calls from one language to another. They may even eventually produce machines that can carry on a conversation.", "Recently, said Luke Zettlemoyer, a University of Washington professor, there has been a \u201chuge phase shift\u201d in the area of natural language understanding \u2014 technology that understands the natural way people talk and write. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are at the forefront of this movement, which promises to fundamentally change how we interact with phones, cars, and potentially any machine. Many companies are moving down the same path, including Replika, a San Francisco start-up.", "With help from machine learning, Replika offers a smartphone \u201cchatbot\u201d that acts as a kind of personal confidante, chatting with you in moments when no one else is around. But the hope is that these techniques will improve to where they serve you in so many other ways. What if Alexa was truly conversational, if you could have a back and forth dialogue? Right now, it is about basic questions and commands. Today, it \u201crecognizes\u201d words very very well. But truly \u201cunderstanding\u201d complex English sentences is beyond machines at this point. What if machines could carry on a dialogue like Hal in 2001?", "Some people argue there are even better ways of interacting with computers by using brain waves. Rather than telling a computer what you want, many companies say they believe you could just think it.", "Using electroencephalography, or EEG \u2014 a longstanding means of measuring electrical brain activity from sensors placed on the head \u2014 the start-up Neurable is building a virtual reality game that can be played with the mind. EEG is limited for this kind of use, but other researchers, including at Facebook, aim to build a far more powerful systems using optical sensors. Facebook hopes that, in a few years, this technology will let people type with their minds five times faster than they can with a smartphone keyboard.", "These techniques will also face physical limits, and that may bar the way to Facebook\u2019s goal. But various start-ups, including Neuralink, founded by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, are going several steps further, hoping to read brain activity from chips implanted inside the skull. At first, they will limit this technology to people with disabilities. But ultimately, Mr. Musk and others hope to also implant chips in healthy people.", "\u201cIt is implausible that this technology would go straight into healthy people,\u201d said Ed Boyden, an M.I.T. neuroscientist who is also an adviser to Neuralink. \u201cBut there is a natural trajectory where, if a medical technology proves effective, it can move into normal individuals as well.\u201d", "Want more science fiction in your everyday reality?

Nor are they hustlers, the relentlessly outgoing types who quit their jobs to gamble on audacious ventures. They are two bookish friends, ages 27 and 29, who until recently lived across the street from each other on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Horwitz worked for Columbia University\u2019s endowment fund; Cogan had a job analyzing consumer behavior. Their hobbies are quiet. Cogan dreams of earning a Ph.D. in philosophy someday \u2014 \u201cafter all this is said and done,\u201d he says. Horwitz enjoys tracking various aspects of his life in Excel spreadsheets: restaurants visited, books read, jogs taken. Scrolling through those files, he says, fills him with a sort of data-based nostalgia. For years, the two men met for dinner every week or so, where talk often turned to business ideas. Spit-balling plans for start-ups became their equivalent of fantasy football.", "One night in the summer of 2015, over Sichuan at Han Dynasty on 85th Street, Cogan asked Horwitz for advice about his latest notion: selling contact lenses online. The contacts business was dominated by a handful of companies like Johnson & Johnson and Bausch & Lomb, which seemed to charge whatever they wanted \u2014 at least in Cogan\u2019s view, based on the price increases for his own lenses. Surely a low-cost competitor could tempt away customers. Cogan pulled his laptop from his bag and opened it at the table in the middle of dinner, pushing aside plates of dumplings and scallion pancakes. He had two plans to show Horwitz. They could sell a cheap disposable lens to doctors. Or they could mimic Cogan\u2019s employer, a wildly successful start-up called Harry\u2019s.", "By late 2015, Harry\u2019s, which sold safety razors and shaving cream, was in the vanguard of upstart online retailers known as direct-to-consumer companies. The business model works like this: Firms sell only their own products, only through their own websites. By cutting out retailers and distributors, they can charge less for their specialty products than entrenched competitors. That year, Casper, then a direct-to-consumer mattress and bedding seller, was reported to be on track to exceed $100 million in sales in its second year of business. Dollar Shave Club, another seller of razors, had reached $152 million in revenue. Warby Parker, the eyeglasses purveyor that many credit with pioneering this business model in 2010, had recently closed an investment round that reportedly valued the company at $1.2 billion. Venture capitalists \u2014 convinced that consumers would increasingly patronize specialty online retailers as they grew more comfortable shopping online \u2014 were pouring money into direct-to-consumer start-ups, more than $2 billion over the past four years, according to CB Insights.", "Horwitz, by now bored in his job, pushed Cogan to keep pursuing his idea and volunteered to help him do research. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to intellectualize whether an idea is good or not,\u201d Horwitz says. \u201cYou have to just start doing it and see.\u201d", "By February 2016, after many nights and weekends of emailing Asian manufacturers and reading up on Food and Drug Administration compliance, the vision of a viable business was coming into focus. The pair had found an F.D.A.-approved manufacturer in Asia and figured out how to meet the necessary regulations. Still, Cogan was reluctant. He had been accepted to Wharton and had even put down a deposit. He believed that was the smarter option. At best, the contact-lens business would become a side project.", "Before shelving their venture, they decided to try one more tack. They recruited two friends: Paul Rodgers, a buddy of Horwitz\u2019s from Columbia who knew how to write computer code, and Dan Rosen, a friend of Cogan\u2019s from Bronx Science who was handy with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Together the four built what is known in the world of online retailing as a demand experiment. The technique, credited to Harry\u2019s founders (who give away its basic code), amounts to a two-page website. The first page explained the concept of a monthly subscription for contacts and asked those who were interested to submit their email addresses. Visitors who did so were taken to a second page and were made an offer: Share this referral code with friends, and if enough of them sign up, you\u2019ll get free contacts.", "They posted a link to their site on the walls of about 40 Facebook friends. Within a few days, not only had their own friends signed up, but friends of friends of friends had, too \u2014 some 2,000 people in all. Some of those distant connections were even evangelizing the company on their own Facebook walls. \u201cIt went mini-viral,\u201d Cogan says.", "He and Horwitz applied to tech incubators \u2014 organizations that invest in and coach young companies in exchange for minority stakes \u2014 using the demand experiment as one slide in their 16-page PowerPoint presentation. They pitched a few venture capitalists based in New York as well. They decided that if they were admitted to an incubator, they would work on the project full time. If not, Cogan would go to Wharton. By April, they had not only been called back for interviews with five incubators; venture funds were also offering to invest a total of $3.5 million in their idea.", "Cogan dropped his Wharton plans. He and Horwitz ordered 50,000 contact lenses and, with Rosen as creative director and Rodgers as chief technology officer, began working out of their investors\u2019 offices, stacking boxes and boxes of lenses along the walls by their desks. They eventually named their enterprise Hubble, after the orbiting telescope that can see into deep space.", "Facebook helped them succeed with their demand test; now it would generate their first sales. During the summer of 2016, a friend of one of Hubble\u2019s prospective investors, a start-up veteran named Joshua Liberson, recommended that the founders try a new type of Facebook advertising called Lead Ads. No outside website was needed: Would-be customers simply clicked a button on the ad to submit their email addresses, directly from Facebook. Hubble directed its ads to ZIP codes in New York and Chicago, where they had already signed up optometrists willing to write prescriptions. After people clicked the ads, Horwitz emailed them to coordinate appointments and take their orders.", "When Hubble\u2019s online store opened officially on Nov. 1, 2016, Cogan and Horwitz knew how to run a Facebook advertising campaign, and they were confident it would continue to generate sales. They planned to spend the additional $3.7 million they raised almost entirely on Facebook ads.", "In 2017, everyone seems to be wondering: Is Facebook taking over the world? Most of us now realize that the social network has become far more than a repository for selfies and political rants of its more than two billion users. To ad sellers, Facebook is now a gluttonous monster, which, along with Google, is gobbling up the digital advertising business in the United States; according to Pivotal Research Group, the two companies controlled 70 percent of the market and most of the growth in 2016. From the perspective of American intelligence agencies, Facebook is practically a weapon, used by a company linked to the Kremlin to foment extremism and influence the 2016 presidential election with at least $100,000 worth of targeted ads. For those with privacy concerns, Facebook plays the role of Big Brother, compiling ever more data on what we like, what we post and what we buy and even tracking where we are both online and in the physical world by tapping into the GPS locator on our phones.", "In considering Facebook\u2019s far-reaching influence, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind the perspective of the more than five million advertisers whose money is financing the social network\u2019s rampant growth. For them, Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, are the stuff of fantasy \u2014 grand bazaars on a scale never seen before. By advertising directly in users\u2019 news feeds, companies can, at any time of day, target potential customers at moments when they are often bored and open to novelty. What better time to hear a product pitch?", "\u201cFacebook created the world\u2019s greatest infomercial,\u201d says Roger McNamee, a founder of Elevation Partners, who invested early in Facebook but has since become critical of the company\u2019s influence. \u201cIt\u2019s really inexpensive to produce ads and unbelievably inexpensive to reach exactly the market that you\u2019re looking for.\u201d As a result, Facebook has become especially lucrative for companies trying to sell new products online. The leaders of more than half a dozen new online retailers all told me they spent the greatest portion of their ad money on Facebook and Instagram.", "\u201cIn the start-up-industrial complex, it\u2019s like a systematic transfer of money\u201d from venture-capital firms to start-ups to Facebook, says Charlie Mulligan, the founder of BrewPublik, which uses a \u201cBeergorithm\u201d to deliver personalized selections of craft beers to customers every month. At 500 Startups, the tech incubator based in Silicon Valley that funded BrewPublik, Facebook advertising is a topic covered in classes. In fact, social-network advertising is an assumed prerequisite for anyone studying marketing at a tech incubator these days \u2014 or at any business school across the country. \u201cThere is a formula for this stuff,\u201d Mulligan says. \u201cAnd the reason why there is a formula is because it works.\u201d", "The process is easy, cheap and effective. With a few hundred dollars and a morning\u2019s effort, an entrepreneur can place his or her ads before social-media users that same afternoon. Companies unsure which ads are best can upload a handful of them and let Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence software test their efficacy. If they don\u2019t know who should see their ads, they can embed code on their websites that enables Facebook to monitor the traffic and then show ads to recent visitors. Or companies can send the email addresses of their existing customers to Facebook, and it will locate their Facebook accounts and put ads in front of so-called Lookalikes, users who like and click on the same things that your proven fan base does. It\u2019s all about as straightforward as setting up an online dating profile. Steph Korey, a founder of Away, a luggage company based in New York that opened in 2015, says that when the company was starting, it made $5 for every $1 it spent on Facebook Lookalike ads.", "The ease of opening a business on Facebook has in turn spawned a wild proliferation of specialty digital sellers that depend on the social network\u2019s algorithm to find their early customers. Many of them follow the same playbook and even share a similar aesthetic. They spend money on traditional public relations, on sponsored links that appear next to Google search results and on \u201cinfluencer\u201d marketing, or giving away their product to people with large social-media followings, in hopes of creating buzz. Then they buy ads on Facebook and Instagram. Inevitably you will encounter them there: They feature a sleek photograph or a video loop of a product \u2014 a wood-handled water filter, woolen shoes, an electric toothbrush. At the top, in bold, the company\u2019s name appears, often ringing with the same friendly, typically two-syllable whimsy. Soma. Allbirds. Goby.", "\u201cSometimes we\u2019ll look at each other and say, \u2018God, there are just so many of them,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Ellie Wheeler, a partner at the venture fund Greycroft Partners, which invested in Hubble last year. Her firm has also taken ownership stakes in Thrive Market, which sells health foods; Plated, a meal-kit delivery service; Trunk Club, which mails a box of clothes to its customers; and Eloquii, a fast-fashion retailer specializing in plus sizes.", "While not all of these companies and others like them will survive, plenty are encroaching on established brands, which are taking the threat seriously. In July 2016, Unilever, the European consumer-products conglomerate, acquired Dollar Shave Club for a reported $1 billion. In June, Walmart agreed to buy Bonobos, an internet-based apparel brand, for $310 million. Companies that sell products exclusively online continue to grow faster than any other type of retailer in the United States \u2014 some 17 percent annually since 2011, more than six times the rate of retail over all, according to Euromonitor International.", "And Facebook has even been taking steps to influence offline sales, in order to bring traditional retailers into its orbit. In September, the social network introduced a tool that lets businesses with physical stores show ads to shoppers and their Lookalikes even if they visit the store but don\u2019t buy anything. Day by day, Facebook is extending its reach further and further into the American marketplace.", "One afternoon in March, I watched as Rosen selected three new ads from an extensive photo shoot the week before, his third in four months. Rosen resembled a sleep-deprived new parent \u2014 mussed hair, dull gaze. He spoke in a monotone. He attributed his fatigue, I would learn later, to Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence software that placed Hubble\u2019s ads. Rosen and his colleagues simply referred to it as \u201cthe algorithm.\u201d", "The basic building block of Facebook advertising is an ad set. It consists of the ads themselves and choices in three other categories: audience, goal and budget. That day, Rosen was designing a set to reach an audience of people on Instagram who had visited hubblecontacts.com in the past 30 days. His goal was \u201cconversions,\u201d or persuading users who had seen the company\u2019s ad to make a purchase. Finally, he set a budget of $1,000 per day. He uploaded the three images. Now they were ready to be tested, to see if any of them were winners in the eyes of users and the algorithm.", "What happened at 8 a.m. the next morning, when the ad set became active, was complex \u2014 and far removed from human sight. Just before Facebook places an advertisement in a user\u2019s feed, it holds a sort of instantaneous auction to determine which advertiser gets the space. The amount of each advertiser\u2019s bid is influenced by its budget size, of course, but the algorithm also weighs what it knows about the company, the ad and the individual Facebook user. Seeking to act like an intuitive matchmaker, the algorithm draws inferences from personal interests, current online behavior, the user\u2019s potential value to each advertiser and the ad\u2019s general appeal. Sometimes the winner is the advertiser that offered Facebook the most money. Sometimes the algorithm decides you are more likely to click a different ad and awards the space to that advertiser for less money.", "This detailed handicapping process involves thousands of advertisers per auction. Millions of auctions take place every minute as users across Facebook load their feeds. The process is never the same twice. The algorithm is constantly learning, using past results to inform how it weighs bids in the next auction. The intent, Facebook says, is to maximize value for everybody: to pair the advertiser with its likeliest customers, and to show ads that users want to see. And, of course, to make money for Facebook.", "But from Rosen\u2019s perspective, nothing much had happened before he ambled into the office a little after 10 a.m. Facebook had spent a grand total of $1.86 on his ads. It had shown the first ad to 51 people, the second to 45 and the third to only two. The first ad had been clicked once. Rosen, unperturbed, poured himself a cup of coffee from the single-serve machine. The algorithm takes a little while to get warmed up, he said. \u201cIn an hour, it\u2019ll get exciting.\u201d", "Twenty minutes later, Rosen refreshed his browser. The Ads Manager window displayed the latest numbers: Rosen could see only the results, not the process that produced them, but it seemed as if the click had inspired the algorithm to favor the first ad. During those 20 minutes, the first ad appeared before 76 more people \u2014 that is, it won 76 more auctions than the other two ads. Over the next hour, the algorithm showed the first ad, which featured a photo of colorful Hubble boxes against a blue background, to more and more users; the algorithm had begun to favor it, apparently. As Rosen refreshed his browser, the sensation was like watching a seed sprout. The ad got more views. Some led to clicks. And eventually, sometime between 11:28 a.m. and 11:53 a.m., one of those clicks led to the test\u2019s first sale. Commerce was in bloom.", "The moment felt odd. Obviously there was science behind the scenes; the algorithm was a set of rules written by Facebook engineers. But from where Rosen sat, the operation might as well have been run by the Holy Spirit. Facebook\u2019s artificial-intelligence algorithm had wound its way through the server farms, reached out among two billion users, found an individual and showed her a Hubble ad on Instagram \u2014 and she used her credit card to buy a subscription for contact lenses.", "In quick succession, the first ad generated two more sales. The algorithm started increasing how much it bid on Hubble\u2019s behalf, thus winning even more auctions for ad space and spending more of Hubble\u2019s money on it \u2014 first $1 a minute, then $2 a minute, then more than $3. By 2 p.m., Facebook\u2019s A.I. had charged Hubble $306.50 to put that ad in front of 9,684 users. The second ad, after an outlay of $8.03, had been all but abandoned. And the third ad was hardly given a chance: Since 8 a.m., it had appeared before only 30 people.", "\u201cNo idea why,\u201d Rosen said, shaking his head. Rosen could see all sorts of data arranged in neat rows on Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager program: the number of views, clicks, sales and the average cost, in advertising, of acquiring each new customer. But none of the metrics at Rosen\u2019s fingertips could resolve a fundamental mystery: why the algorithm behaved as it did, why it preferred some ads over others and why the third ad got little attention whatsoever.", "The morning\u2019s ads were incredibly similar: \u201chubblecontacts,\u201d the company\u2019s Instagram handle, appeared at the top, above pictures of boxes in peach, blue, yellow and green. The only differences were that the first ad showed the boxes of contact lenses lined up against a blue background; in the second and third ads, they were set against a split pink-and-blue background and were arranged diagonally in the second and scattershot in the third. But they were all just boxes! Did Instagram users really prefer contact-lens ads with strict rows of boxes or blue backgrounds? Had rules been written into the algorithm favoring orderly arrangements? (The Hubble team knew Facebook favored certain aesthetics.) To what extent was the day\u2019s outcome, apparently set in motion when the first ad happened to get that first click in the morning, actually random? Rosen could only guess.", "Advertising has always been an uncertain business. No one has ever known why, exactly, some people respond to an ad in a newspaper or a spot on TV, much less why specific individuals decide to buy products when they do. (The oldest clich\u00e9 in the ad world, usually attributed to the department-store magnate John Wanamaker: \u201cHalf my advertising is wasted. The trouble is, I don\u2019t know which half.\u201d) But to make money in advertising, you don\u2019t have to be all-knowing; your ads simply need to work better than those of a competitor. To this end, advertisers inevitably pursue some combination of two major approaches. They test and refine their messages, trying to craft one as efficient and targeted as possible (junk-mailers of preapproved credit-card offers, for example). Or they showboat, putting on a huge spectacle that\u2019s sure to attract someone (Super Bowl advertisers).", "In the early 2010s, direct-to-consumer companies showboated. But lacking the money for big TV ad campaigns, they relied instead on old-fashioned public relations, panache and luck. Warby Parker hired a public-relations firm to pitch its concept to Vogue and GQ and debuted its website on the same day issues reached subscribers. It also held an event featuring bespectacled models at the New York Public Library during Fashion Week. Dollar Shave Club first succeeded on account of the exquisite timing, both commercial and comedic, of its founder, Michael Dubin. He made a funny, low-budget video introducing his company, then uploaded it to YouTube on the same day TechCrunch reported Dollar Shave Club\u2019s first round of venture funding. Within days, after some immediate attention at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., Dubin had three million views online.", "Facebook\u2019s sales pitch \u2014 putting the right ad in front of the right person, thanks to the wonders of data technology \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly new. As far back as 1964, William Allan, a business editor for The Pittsburgh Press, reported that in the near future, \u201ccomputers will tell businessmen which half of their advertising budgets are being wasted.\u201d Thirty years later, The Economist described an effort to take advantage of American Express\u2019s transactional records: \u201cPowerful data-crunching computers known as massive parallel processors, equipped with neural-network software (which searches, like the human brain, for patterns in a mass of data), hold out a vision of marketing nirvana.\u201d Companies like Acxiom, Experian and Datalogix have been offering similar data-mining services to direct marketers for years. What sets Facebook (and Google) apart are scale and sophistication.", "A recent study by a Princeton professor, Arvind Narayanan, and a doctoral candidate, Steven Englehardt, provides a sense of how thoroughly the two online giants monitor user behavior. In early 2016, they examined the top one million websites in the world, using special bots they developed to scour them for tracking mechanisms. Google had trackers on 76 percent of these sites, Facebook on 23 percent of them. (Twitter, in third place, had trackers on just over 12 percent of the sites.) The tech giants can examine all this data looking for patterns and then match them back to prospective customers.", "What also sets Facebook and Google apart from their direct-marketing forebears is that they give access to everyday advertisers. Anyone with a credit card can go online and test ads on Facebook\u2019s platform, one of the most sophisticated direct-marketing operations ever. But while average people can use the machine, there\u2019s still a lot of mystery about how it works. The methods and calculations of the algorithm \u2014 why it ends up pushing some ads and not others \u2014 are all hidden.", "Almost as soon as they began, Rosen, Horwitz and the others at Hubble became determined to fathom the algorithm\u2019s secrets \u2014 to figure out why some ads succeeded and others didn\u2019t. Soon they were trading hypotheses with other entrepreneurs, cribbing ideas from other companies\u2019 ads and taking a formal approach to testing, rooted in the scientific method. They uploaded ads with identical images but different wordings, for example. The Hubble team wound up concluding all sorts of things. Ads with third-party endorsements \u2014 from GQ, say, or BuzzFeed \u2014 beat those with their own slogans. Ads featuring close-ups of the Hubble boxes outperformed those with human models. Ads that included a button that said \u201cShop Now\u201d or \u201cLearn More\u201d fared worse than an ad with no button at all; viewers simply preferred to click anywhere on the picture to go to the website.", "But even as the Hubble team gleaned more about what yielded successful Facebook ads, the algorithm could be unpredictable, almost moody. If you kept loading the same ads into the same ad set every day, they stopped performing as well. The founders figured at first that users were tiring of the same ads. But actual viewer numbers revealed that practically no individual user had seen any ad more than once. The algorithm itself seemed to grow bored. At night, meanwhile, the algorithm spent lots of money and rarely found customers. The Hubble executives started shrinking the budgets at 11 p.m., which they called \u201cputting the algorithm to bed.\u201d The algorithm could also be impulsive and streaky \u2014 some days it might go on a sudden jag, blowing a thousand dollars in a few hours with nothing to show for it. At any time, any one of the 15 different ad sets might go haywire. Rosen found himself checking the Ads Manager compulsively on his laptop and his iPhone. (Facebook offers an iOS app for advertisers.) \u201cIt occupies my brain constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of \u2018Did you leave the oven on?\u2019\u2009\u201d", "One night we went to a standup-comedy night Rosen hosted at a bar called Muchmore\u2019s in Brooklyn. (For the past four years, he has moonlighted as a comedian.) But while the other comics were onstage, Rosen was on the Ads Manager the whole time. \u201cWho cares about jokes?\u201d he quipped afterward.", "Eager for help, Rosen sought guidance from a former Facebook employee named Faheem Siddiqi, who now runs his own marketing agency. Hubble\u2019s sales representative at Facebook told him that Siddiqi had figured out the best ways to optimize Facebook advertising campaigns. But it turned out that Siddiqi and his employees checked the Ads Manager even more compulsively than Rosen \u2014 every half-hour, for up to 16 hours a day. When I asked Siddiqi to share his tips for managing Facebook ads, he replied, \u201cStep\u20091 is meditation.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s like a baby,\u201d Jesse Horwitz told me. \u201cIf you go more than half an hour without checking in on it, it\u2019s probably dead.\u201d (Horwitz, who is married, does not yet have children.)", "Middlemen \u2014 creative agencies, media planners, publishers \u2014 have long ruled the advertising business. Yet until recently they have not been as omnipresent, opaque and inhuman as Facebook. The social giant now dictates, more fully and precisely than ever before, which ads we see and who sees which ads. Some of the implications of this are amusing, others troubling.", "In my house, the strange new world of advertising announced itself in the form of a water pitcher. The Soma 6-Cup Pitcher is a paragon of Brooklynite beauty: folksy oak handle, sleek minimalist reservoir, filter cones made out of coconut shells (or something). I had never heard of it before my wife ordered one online. Plenty of my friends hadn\u2019t, either. When our visitors opened the fridge, half of them were like me: Soma ignorant. The other half knew the brand immediately: Hey! You got a Soma? They had seen the pitcher on Facebook, on Instagram, all over the place. What was a familiar brand to some was totally unknown to me and others. We had been divvied up. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve noticed again and again: I see an ad for Aaptiv, a running app; my wife sees ads for a furniture website called Article that I\u2019ve still never visited. Just as Facebook steers conservative and liberal talking points to users who already share those perspectives, we\u2019re being sorted into commercial bubbles as well.", "Recently ProPublica, the investigative-journalism nonprofit, showed how bad actors can abuse this process: Facebook\u2019s software gave advertisers the option to target \u201cJew Haters,\u201d for instance. In a separate investigation, ProPublica found that Facebook made it possible to exclude specific \u201cethnic affinities\u201d from seeing ads, noting that ads excluding people based on race are prohibited by federal housing and employment laws.", "This stereotyping isn\u2019t a glitch of Facebook\u2019s machine-learning process \u2014 it\u2019s how the software works. To formulate audiences, the algorithm scours profiles and analyzes them for shared traits and correlations and self-identified interests and, it assumes, our preferences, grouping us into tribes that can be targeted. It\u2019s up to Facebook and advertisers to constrain this amoral process in ethical and lawful ways. Yet the ethics of targeting are not clear-cut. In May, The Australian reported that Facebook employees had prepared a document showing how they could gather details on teenagers during vulnerable moments \u2014 when Facebook users feel \u201cstressed,\u201d \u201cinsecure,\u201d \u201cdefeated\u201d or \u201cworthless.\u201d Is that immoral, or simply crass?", "Such challenges are opening a new front for companies and corporate-responsibility watchdogs. Bad human actors don\u2019t pose the only problem; a machine-learning algorithm, left unchecked, can misbehave and compound inequality on its own, no help from humans needed. The same mechanism that decides that 30-something women who like yoga disproportionately buy Lululemon tights \u2014 and shows them ads for more yoga wear \u2014 would also show more junk-food ads to impoverished populations rife with diabetes and obesity.", "\u201cSometimes data behaves unethically,\u201d Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook employee who worked on the advertising team, wrote in an essay in The Guardian. He provided an example from his time at the company: \u201cSomeone on the data-science team had cooked up a new tool that recommended Facebook pages users should like. And what did this tool start spitting out? Every ethnic stereotype you can imagine.\u201d", "As algorithms sort users in increasingly complex ways \u2014 already the multivaried criteria for determining a Lookalike group defies human comprehension \u2014 regulators and companies will have to confront how to determine who is being nudged, and why, and whether that\u2019s benefiting the public or exacerbating societal ills. An algorithm that draws its lessons from the present reality can\u2019t be counted on to improve the course of the future on its own.", "Facebook\u2019s A.I. isn\u2019t operating unattended, certainly: Garcia-Martinez wrote that Facebook decided not to release the recommendation tool. Facebook points out that it makes efforts to prevent harmful advertising. It does not, for instance, allow ads for payday loans, which prey on the poor. It says it has removed advertisers\u2019 ability to target users by ethnicity when promoting housing, employment or credit; it removed \u201cJew Haters\u201d and other objectionable categories and said it would increase human review of its ad-targeting options. In response to the report in The Australian, Facebook said the analysis \u201cwas intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads.\u201d", "Yet managing a platform this way \u2014 seeing what mischief the algorithm and its users gets up to, then responding with countermeasures \u2014 can be difficult to sustain. \u201cThis is a whack-a-mole problem, one among many Facebook has,\u201d Garcia-Martinez told me. It makes Facebook, a company still largely controlled by a single man, Mark Zuckerberg, the ultimate arbiter of morality and taste for all two billion of its users. It also means the company has unilateral power to make or break companies when it tweaks its system.", "This is not a hypothetical possibility. In 2013, media sites like those measured by the BuzzFeed Partner network, which includes BuzzFeed, Thought Catalog and The New York Times, noticed a huge surge in referrals from Facebook \u2014 a jump of more than 50 million page views from August to October. A year later, Facebook announced that it had adjusted its news-feed algorithm to eliminate so-called click bait. Upworthy, a peddler of stories with headlines like \u201c9 Out of 10 Americans Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact,\u201d had its total page views decline by half in the span of three months, from 90 million to 48 million visitors. (At the time of these huge shifts, 30 percent of Americans got news from Facebook. In 2017, 45 percent of Americans do, according to Pew Research Center.)", "\u201cWe always knew that Facebook is sort of like the weather,\u201d says Eli Pariser, Upworthy\u2019s co-founder and president. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be sunny days and stormy days.\u201d In response to the algorithm adjustment, Pariser instructed his staff to stop posting as many videos to YouTube, which is owned by Google, and start publishing more videos directly to Facebook instead.", "\u201cThat certainly served Facebook well,\u201d Pariser admits. \u201cBut you know, I also wouldn\u2019t be able to reach 200 million people on any other medium,\u201d he says, citing the reach of Upworthy\u2019s videos on Facebook. The platform may be mercurial, but Upworthy still relies on it.", "Imagine, now, that Facebook tweaks its algorithm in a way that \u2014 rather than cause wild swings in web traffic to a purveyor of viral videos \u2014 leads to a steep decline in advertising and sales for a consumer-products company, one that happens to be the largest employer in a small town. Or imagine multiple companies shaken up by such an adjustment, or an entire industry overhauling its practices to suit Facebook. Even the threat and uncertainty of those possibilities could hurt businesses, which depend on predictable returns to invest in future projects.", "As we delegate more control to artificial intelligence, both businesses as well as users are venturing into uncertain territory. In the meantime, more and more companies \u2014 start-ups, mom-and-pop stores, major corporations \u2014 are handing their dollars and their data to the social-networking giant. Facebook\u2019s Ads Manager is user-friendly. Sales are plentiful. And if you don\u2019t take advantage of it, your competitors will. How could you not go there?", "By mid-March, a few weeks after I first followed Rosen, the Hubble team no longer had 15 Facebook and Instagram ad sets. It had 40 \u2014 all pointed at discrete audiences, each with its own handful of ads. But Rosen looked more rested, less frazzled. He explained that he and Paul Rodgers had developed something they called \u201cRobo-Dan,\u201d a few lines of code that checked the Ads Manager every hour, then adjusted the budget as Rosen would. He could wake up and let the ads run (although he had to fight the compulsion to check on Robo-Dan). Soon, he told me, they would upgrade to Robo-Dan 2, which would switch in new ads, taking over the nightly bedtime routine. (With 40 audiences, he told me, going through the process lasted almost as long as an entire episode of \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d) Finally, he said, he was getting some distance from Facebook\u2019s everyday machinations. Someday soon, he would be able to go to bed early, he told me. Or have an evening to himself.", "But by the end of June, Rosen\u2019s stress-free life was still a dream. A new problem arose: No matter what new ads they put in an ad set, the growth rate of sales declined and the cost per acquisition went up. They began to think it was an audience problem: Had they found all the customers in those groups? With their ad sets going fallow, the Hubble team scrambled to find fresh and fertile ground. Their ideas for new audiences got quirkier, more outlandish. One week they zeroed in on people who like Sweetgreen, the salad chain. Next they went after people who had indicated that they were fans of bottled water, whoever they are. Each group fizzled after a few days \u2014 the cost per each new customer climbed higher and higher; sales dwindled. As they searched for more and more audience descriptors, they landed upon a novel idea: They began trading their Lookalike groups with other online retailers, figuring that the kind of people who buy one product from social media will probably buy others. This sort of audience sharing is becoming more common on Facebook: There is even a company, TapFwd, that pools together Lookalike groups for various brands, helping them show ads to other groups.", "Cogan and Horwitz have decided that they need to reduce their dependence on Facebook advertising, for the sake of their business and their own sanity. In May, they tested their first 15-second cable-television commercials. With TV, the data is vaguer, and it takes longer to get results back. Yet even though the old medium provides them with less information than Facebook, in some ways the ignorance is bliss. \u201cThere\u2019s fewer levers; there\u2019s less to stress out about.\u201d Rodgers says. \u201cYou can push the button and get on with your life.\u201d", "In August, the Hubble team finally handed over their domestic Facebook advertising work to an outside agency, Ampush, that charges them based on how many new customers sign up. Ten people at Ampush now do the job of Rosen and Robo-Dan. Still, the handoff was bittersweet. \u201cWe ran their numbers \u2014 it\u2019s something we could beat,\u201d Rosen says, meaning Hubble could get more customers for less money if it did the ad buying in-house. \u201cBut it would destroy our lives.\u201d", "Thanks largely to Facebook, Hubble is on track to finish its first full year in business having made $20 million in revenue. In August, Hubble raised $10 million, valuing the company at $210 million. In January, Hubble will use those funds to expand its business to Continental Europe. Its advertising strategy? Robo-Dan, with some help from Rosen.

Because he is killing net neutrality outright, not merely weakening it, he will have to explain to a court not just the shift from 2015 but also his reasoning for destroying the basic bans on blocking and throttling, which have been in effect since 2005 and have been relied on extensively by the entire internet ecosystem.", "This will be a difficult task. What has changed since 2004 that now makes the blocking or throttling of competitors not a problem? The evidence points strongly in the opposite direction: There is a long history of anticompetitive throttling and blocking \u2014 often concealed \u2014 that the F.C.C. has had to stop to preserve the health of the internet economy. Examples include AT&T\u2019s efforts to keep Skype off iPhones and the blocking of Google Wallet by Verizon. Services like Skype and Netflix would have met an early death without basic net neutrality protections. Mr. Pai needs to explain why we no longer have to worry about this sort of threat \u2014 and \u201cYou can trust your cable company\u201d will not suffice.", "Moreover, the F.C.C. is acting contrary to public sentiment, which may embolden the judiciary to oppose Mr. Pai. Telecommunications policy does not always attract public attention, but net neutrality does, and polls indicate that 76 percent of Americans support it. The F.C.C., in short, is on the wrong side of the democratic majority.", "In our times, the judiciary has increasingly become a majoritarian force. It alone, it seems, can prevent narrow, self-interested factions from getting the government to serve unseemly and even shameful ends. And so it falls to the judiciary to stop this latest travesty."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/technology/china-facebook.html": ["HONG KONG \u2014 China does not allow its people to gain access to Facebook, a powerful tool for disseminating information and influencing opinion.", "As if to demonstrate the platform\u2019s effectiveness, outside its borders China uses it to spread state-produced propaganda around the world, including the United States.

Facebook\u2019s general counsel replied that to his knowledge it had not.", "There is no indication that China meddled in the American election, but the Communist government\u2019s use of Facebook is ironic given its apparent fear of the platform. It also hasn\u2019t been reluctant to use it as a soapbox where China\u2019s relationship with the United States is concerned.", "China has been a major priority for Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s founder, has spent years courting it. Facebook executives even set up a page to show CCTV, one of Beijing\u2019s chief propaganda outlets, how to use the platform during President Xi Jinping\u2019s 2015 trip to the United States.", "While China\u2019s propaganda channels on Facebook are not nearly as subtle as Russian groups when it comes to influencing opinion, their techniques are nonetheless instructive.", "Rather than divisive advertisements, many of the Chinese Facebook posts replicate the sort of news propaganda delivered at home: articles stressing China\u2019s stability and prosperity mixed with posts highlighting chaos and violence in the rest of the world.", "A similar blend of stories \u2014 pandas and idyllic Chinese landscapes next to heavy coverage of the mass shooting in Texas \u2014 has proliferated across China\u2019s official Facebook channels in the lead-up to Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Beijing, which began on Wednesday.", "While much of it is unlikely to sway the average American\u2019s mind, such posts reach people across the world, many of whom are newer to the internet and may have a less sophisticated understanding of media. China\u2019s state media has Facebook channels dedicated to Africa and other regions of the world, and it seems evident that it is offering itself as an alternative to the Western media for a more global audience.", "Recently, for example, Xinhua posted an article titled \u201cChina\u2019s IP protection system works well, says U.S. professional\u201d \u2014 a rebuke of a congressional investigation into Chinese trade policies that critics say encourage intellectual property theft.", "A more anodyne post offered a ham-handed attempt to find common ground between China and the United States, pointing to the basketball player Yao Ming, pandas and American students making dumplings as examples of the countries\u2019 close relationship.", "A video posted by Xinhua, which already has about 100,000 views, presents a series of man-on-the-street interviews with Chinese people talking about the United States.

But the company acknowledged to Congress that more than 150 million users of its main site and a subsidiary, Instagram, potentially saw inflammatory political ads bought by a Kremlin-linked company, the Internet Research Agency.", "Ms. DiResta contended that that is still just the tip of the iceberg.

The worm has been a favorite of biologists for 50 years because its inner workings are much the same as our own.", "C. elegans relies on many of the same genes that we do to control the division of cells, for example, and to program faulty cells to commit suicide.", "In 1993, Dr. Kenyon discovered that a gene called daf-2 greatly influenced the life span of these worms. Shutting down the gene more than doubled the worm\u2019s lifetime from 18 days to 42 days.", "That finding, which Dr. Kenyon made while a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, led to the discovery of an entire network of genes involved in repairing cells, allowing animals to live longer.

They mutated a gene in the worms, leaving them unable to make sperm. The eggs in these entirely \u201cfemale\u201d worms were filled with damaged proteins and did not get repaired.", "These experiments raised the possibility that the sperm were sending out a signal that somehow prompted the eggs to rid themselves of damaged proteins.

The protein clumps within the egg \u201cstart to dance around,\u201d said Dr. Bohnert.", "The clumps come into contact with little bubbles called lysosomes, which extend fingerlike projections that pull the clumps inside.

The eggs accumulate a lot of damage, but make little effort to repair it.", "Only in the last minutes before fertilization do they destroy protein clumps and damaged proteins, so that their offspring won\u2019t inherit that burden. The detritus may even be recycled, Dr. Kenyon speculated, into building blocks needed to make the new proteins that are required to develop an embryo.", "\u201cOnce the oocyte hears the knocks on the door, then it can just clean it all out and even use it as food, maybe,\u201d she said.", "If her previous research is any guide, then we may very likely use the same strategy in human reproduction. \u201cThe hypothesis is that it\u2019s not just a worm thing,\u201d Dr. Kenyon said.", "That remains to be seen.

But none of these information sources exist in the regulatory world of the Federal Communications Commission, where core media ownership rules presume the marketplace for news is defined entirely by pulp, rabbit ears and transistor radios. In this archaic world, Americans get their news only from newspapers and broadcast television and radio stations, and the internet doesn\u2019t exist.", "For over four decades, the F.C.C. has restricted the ability of broadcast media outlets to also own newspapers, and vice versa, in the same market, under what is known as the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule.", "This rule was established in 1975 with the stated purpose of preserving and promoting a diversity of viewpoints. Arguably, it made sense at the time. But with the internet now dominating the news landscape, the rule is no longer needed, and may actually be undermining the diversity of viewpoints it was intended to foster.", "The print newspaper business is dying, and for some papers, this rule has probably hastened their demise. Roughly one-quarter of American newspapers have gone out of business since 1975, and many of those that remain are struggling. Today, only 18 percent of Americans read print newspapers regularly. Less than 10 percent under the age of 50 do. By a large margin, people instead turn to the internet for news.", "For newspapers to continue to play an important role in civic engagement, they need more access to capital. Their decline has created a real threat to independent reporting at the state and local level. A broadcaster\u2019s investment in a newspaper could go a long way toward keeping citizens informed. (Indeed, the number of TV and radio stations has doubled over the past half-century, even as newspapers have been vanishing.)", "There\u2019s ample evidence that the cross-ownership rule has led to less local reporting. When the F.C.C. adopted the rule, some newspaper-broadcast combinations were allowed to continue. Multiple studies have found that, on average, a cross-owned TV station produces more local news than comparable non-cross-owned stations. And a cross-owned radio station is four to five times more likely to have a news format. This makes sense, because a company that owns both a newspaper and broadcast outlet is able to gather the news and distribute it more cost-effectively across its multiple platforms.", "Simple fairness is another reason to change the rule. We need to create a level regulatory playing field. It makes no sense for internet giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter to be allowed to buy newspapers while a small AM radio station is prohibited from purchasing its local paper. Those companies increasingly dominate advertising, the major revenue source for news outlets; Google and Facebook have claimed 100 percent of recent online advertising growth, and their digital ad revenue this year alone will be more than twice the entire 2016 revenue of the radio industry. This rule thus singles out struggling news outlets for stringent regulation while leaving the biggest players untouched.", "Critics of this proposal have expressed concern that eliminating the rule will lead to additional media consolidation. I understand that point of view and recognize that some limits are needed. That\u2019s why, for example, F.C.C. rules will continue to prohibit any company from owning more than two television stations in any market.", "But as with any issue, it is important to go beyond the slogans and look at the specifics. And whether we look at the history of grandfathered newspaper-broadcast combinations in bigger cities like Chicago or smaller ones like Scranton, Pa., experience does not show that the residents in those communities have been harmed or their news marketplaces have been monopolized. Rather, we generally see news outlets that have been able to better serve the public.", "For these reasons, the F.C.C. is scheduled to vote at its meeting next Thursday to repeal the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule. This common-sense move is not only long overdue, it also has support that crosses partisan lines.

Instead, it has sent a schizophrenic message, which means the few remaining companies with a chance to rival big tech have no way of knowing where the administration stands or what values it will enforce.", "On the one hand, the F.C.C. has signaled it will eliminate net neutrality, the rule that ensures equal access to the internet for all websites. If this happens, internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T will be able to charge extra fees for high-quality streaming and exclude certain content from the all-in data plans they offer. Critics say this move would be devastating to the websites and applications that can\u2019t pay the fees.", "On the other hand, just a day before the F.C.C. announcement, the Justice Department communicated starkly different values. Announcing its opposition to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it used an argument based on the very kind of thinking that\u2019s often used to defend net neutrality: The department made the case that if the merger were allowed to go through, AT&T might favor the Time Warner content it would own post-merger, to the disadvantage of rivals.", "The incoherence of these conflicting positions on competition is staggering, but this kind of cognitive dissonance is not unique. Don\u2019t forget that the Obama administration \u2014 at the behest of Amazon, which controlled almost 80 percent of the online book market \u2014 brought an antitrust suit alleging Apple and five publishers colluded on pricing for digital books. That administration did not have a consistent view of media monopoly power that is enforced equally on all parties, and neither does the current one.", "For instance, internet service providers operate under a totally different set of privacy regulations than the online service providers (like Google and Facebook) that dominate the online advertising market. According to Morgan Stanley, Google and Facebook took an astonishing 85 percent of all new online ad revenue last year. And yet Google spends millions lobbying Congress to prevent any rivals from entering its unique surveillance capitalism business. Essentially, the government is giving a pass to the largest media advertising firms that have no restrictions on consumer privacy, while suing to block potential rival services that operate under strict privacy restrictions.", "It could be that the notion of net neutrality that the F.C.C. seems determined to jettison should also be applied to media monopolies. When the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion in June for unfairly favoring some of its own services over those of rivals, it was essentially for a violation of neutrality: The union noted that Google was both a service provider (that users could use to conduct searches) and a content provider (that provided its own restaurant, hotel and other product recommendations) and was favoring its own content in search results over that of rivals that also provided recommendations, like Yelp.", "Of course, being buried deep in Google\u2019s search results or being forced to pay Google for prominent placement hurts smaller firms. This is arguably no less harmful to a business than being forced to pay Verizon for good video quality for its streaming site \u2014 the fate that many content producers will meet if net neutrality rules are rolled back under the plan the F.C.C. has hinted at. It is what economists call \u201crent seeking,\u201d and it is a cancer on any open media system in any context, but the Trump administration doesn\u2019t treat it the same in all contexts.", "Mr. Trump is nothing if not sensitive to a populist uprising, and the net neutrality decision will probably be opposed on both the left and right. It could be that during the F.C.C.\u2019s comment period, the resistance to overturning net neutrality may be too strong and the ruling will be withdrawn.", "But that leaves the larger questions unanswered. What exactly would a consistent antitrust policy for the media sector look like? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicting signals from the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice?", "The answer is that regulators must realize where the real market power lies and use this as the basis for their decisions about competition. Time Warner\u2019s market capitalization is $70 billion. Google is worth 10 times as much, at $723 billion. Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner\u2019s largest advertising subsidiary, brought in $1.2 billion in ad revenue in the last quarter, while Google reported $22.5 billion in ad revenue in the same period. It should be noted that AT&T has almost no appreciable ad revenue. So, if there is to be a coherent approach to competition, the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates Google and Facebook, and the F.C.C., which regulates AT&T, must find common ground on the regulation of ad-supported content networks.", "For the Trump administration to try to block the merger of two relatively small media players while letting Google operate freely with no privacy restrictions is to be fighting the last war. The notion that television is the major media power in America ignores reality. It may be that the assistant attorney general for antitrust, Makan Delrahim, has a decent case that internet service providers and content providers need some sort of separation. But if that is true, then the same rules on neutrality and consumer privacy need to apply to companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and the F.C.C. should keep net neutrality rules in place.", "The administration can\u2019t have it both ways."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-justice-department.html": ["Good Tuesday afternoon.

It published an analysis on Wednesday of benefits at 250 large or high-profile employers for couples who need medical help to have children.", "It found that technology companies as well as employers in consulting and banking tended to offer generous coverage for costly assisted-reproduction techniques like in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F.", "FertilityIQ was founded by Mr. Anderson and Deborah Bialis, a married couple who saw a need for more detailed information after undergoing treatment for infertility themselves. FertilityIQ gathers information from more than 10,000 verified I.V.F. patients who contribute to its database. Employers examined in the report included companies where FertilityIQ\u2019s participants work, as well as additional employers identified by fertility clinics or researched by Fertility IQ itself, Mr. Anderson said.", "FertilityIQ\u2019s goal is to provide as much detail as possible, he said, to help people navigate their way through a stressful process. Mr. Anderson\u2019s advice to those seeking infertility treatment was simply, \u201cBuckle in, financially and emotionally.\u201d", "Employer benefits are important, the couple said, because I.V.F. is costly and demand for it is increasing.", "In 2015, United States clinics performed nearly 232,000 assisted-reproduction cycles \u2014 mostly I.V.F. \u2014 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was up about 68 percent from 2006. (In I.V.F., doctors extract a woman\u2019s eggs, fertilize them in a lab, then transfer the resulting embryos into the woman\u2019s uterus. Doctors may use a woman\u2019s own fresh or frozen eggs, or eggs from donors.) About 12 percent of American women have difficulty becoming pregnant, according to the C.D.C.", "Treatment isn\u2019t cheap. The cost of a single cycle of I.V.F. is often about $12,000, but that number is just a start. Drugs and related procedures, like genetic screening, push the average price in most major metropolitan areas to well above $20,000 per cycle, FertilityIQ found. And most couples undergo at least two cycles on average, Mr. Anderson said.", "The report ranks individual employers and broad sectors, based on criteria that include the value of the benefits and the ease with which employees can use them. Some companies rank higher because they avoid preauthorization rules, like trying unsuccessfully to conceive for a period of time or receiving a specific infertility diagnosis, that can be particularly restrictive for same-sex couples or single women, Mr. Anderson said.", "The technology industry, in particular, shines at making infertility benefits widely accessible, the report found, and some employers are in a sort of benefits arms race, offering more generous coverage to remain competitive in recruiting and retaining workers. Facebook ranks high on the list of tech companies, as it did in FertilityIQ\u2019s report last year. The company covers up to four I.V.F. cycles, including genetic testing, with no preapproval required. (FertilityIQ values the cycles at $25,000 each, for a total benefit value of $100,000.)", "Other tech companies are beefing up coverage, according to the new analysis.", "Microsoft is expanding its benefit in January, replacing a fixed amount of $15,000 with a more flexible offering. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re providing industry-leading benefits,\u201d said Sonja Kellen, director of global health and wellness benefits at Microsoft.", "Microsoft will work with Progyny, a fertility benefits manager, to offer up to three treatment cycles. The benefit includes genetic testing as well as the freezing of eggs or embryos and storage for up to four years. The new policy makes treatment available to employees without demonstrated infertility issues, so gay couples pursuing parenthood through surrogacy or a single woman who wants to freeze eggs for use in the future can use the benefit.", "The new approach aims to make benefits more broadly available and helps reduce pressure on employees undergoing I.V.F. to maximize their benefit, Ms. Kellen said.", "For instance, a couple undergoing I.V.F. with a dollar cap on their employer benefit may decide to have multiple embryos transferred at one time, perhaps resulting in twins or triplets. Those pregnancies are more likely to have complications.", "Medications for the treatment are covered separately, through the company\u2019s prescription drug benefit, she said.", "Pinterest, the online social network, covered up to $20,000 for treatment costs this year, but will change its benefit in January to cover up to four rounds of I.V.F., said a company spokeswoman, Malorie Lucich. The expansion, she said, was based on feedback the company received from its 1,200 employees.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a very family friendly culture here,\u201d she said.", "Among other big tech companies, Google covers three cycles including genetic testing, a benefit that FertilityIQ values at $75,000, and Apple offers a $20,000 benefit. Neither company requires preapproval. Amazon\u2019s benefit of $15,000 with a required preauthorization placed it relatively low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list of tech companies.", "Some companies in consulting, like Bain, and finance, like Bank of America, offer unlimited I.V.F. benefits as long as employees meet preauthorization rules, the report found.", "Other financial companies offer more limited coverage, yet are moving to expand it. American Express, for instance, increased its cap for treatment this year to $35,000, up from $20,000, for full-time and part-time employees.", "Retail companies generally rank low on FertilityIQ\u2019s list, Mr. Anderson said, but Starbucks is notable for making a $15,000 I.V.F. benefit available, including to part-time store workers.", "Here are some questions and answers about infertility coverage:", "What should I do if my employer doesn\u2019t offer I.V.F. benefits?", "Employees can lobby their human resources departments to offer coverage, particularly if their employers are \u201cself insured\u201d \u2014 meaning the companies pay claims themselves, rather than paying a premium to an insurer, said Barbara Collura, president and chief executive of Resolve, an infertility support and advocacy group.", "Self-insured employers \u2014 typically companies with more than 250 workers \u2014 have more leeway to expand coverage, Ms. Collura said. Employers that don\u2019t self-insure have less flexibility because the benefits are determined by the insurer, she said.", "Eights states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island) require employers to offer some level of I.V.F. benefit, Ms. Collura said. But coverage isn\u2019t necessarily generous, and self-insured employers and small employers are typically exempt from the laws.", "Is financial help available for the cost of infertility treatment?", "Several nonprofit groups offer grants that can help couples who cannot afford treatment themselves. And some companies offer financing options. Resolve lists the various grants and finance companies on its website, but does not endorse any particular program and urges patients to review the details carefully.", "What proportion of employers over all offer I.V.F. benefits?", "About a quarter of employers with 500 or more workers cover the procedure, while 37 percent of employers with 20,000 or more workers cover it, according to a 2017 report from the benefits consultant Mercer \u2014 about the same level found the previous year."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/middleeast/iraq-amadiya-tolerance.html": ["AMADIYA, Iraq \u2014 This once-pretty picture postcard town, on its own 4,000-foot high mesa nestling between a pair of much higher mountain ranges, is in a bad neighborhood when it comes to tolerance.", "So the mystery of the Jewish holy figure Hazana, who is revered here by people of all the local faiths, is even more profound than it might otherwise be.", "Amadiya is in the semiautonomous province of Kurdistan, which is the target of a crackdown by Baghdad after aiming to achieve independence from Iraq. This part of northern Iraq has been convulsed by violence since the advance of the Islamic State, which sent Christians fleeing, enslaved Yazidi women and killed Shiites on sight, until finally being wiped out in the area last month.", "Today Amadiya\u2019s population of 9,000 is overwhelmingly Kurdish Muslim. But in the early 20th century there were said to be about two-thirds that many people, about evenly divided among Muslims, Christians and Jews \u2014 although there were 10 mosques compared with two churches and two synagogues. Everyone was packed into a circumference of a mile and a half.", "Amadiya\u2019s Jews all left after the creation of Israel in 1948. And so many Christians have left amid successive regional upheavals that the remaining 20 or 30 families can no longer sustain both churches.", "All three faiths here are brought together by a longstanding reverence for Hazana, a Jewish religious figure of unknown antiquity \u2014 variously described as a son of David, the grandson of Joseph or just a little-known prophet \u2014 whose tomb is in Amadiya.", "\u201cAll the religions are going to that grave to pray,\u201d said Muhammad Abdullah, a local teacher and amateur historian. \u201cFor all three religions, it\u2019s a sacred place. Each of them thinks he belongs to them.\u201d", "Hazana\u2019s biography is so hazy that he defeats a Google search. Locals don\u2019t have much to add. He was \u201ca really great guy, a pure person,\u201d said Bzhar Ahmad, 55, a retired government worker who had just emerged from noon prayers at the town\u2019s Amadi Grand Mosque, with a group of other Muslim worshipers nodding agreement.", "None of the men found it strange that Muslims and Christians also prayed at Hazana\u2019s tomb. \u201cThe Jews were always our friends,\u201d Mr. Ahmad said. \u201cWe never thought about what we were, we were just people living together.\u201d", "Directions given by locals to find Hazana\u2019s tomb varied, but all ended up in a crooked lane narrow enough that in Amadiya\u2019s heyday there were footbridges connecting roofs from one side to the other so that residents could use their rooftops to go to the mosque while avoiding the visitors in the overcrowded lanes below. Or so they say.", "On the way, opposite a chicken coop with a roof festooned in flowering potted plants, Saran Sabah stood with her 18-year-old daughter, Amal. In the side alley leading to her house was a huge pile of firewood, ready for the coming winter. A Sunni Muslim, Ms. Sabah had prayed to Hazana, and it had worked, she said; there was a daughter to prove it.", "The men hadn\u2019t mentioned that Hazana\u2019s popularity rested on his ability to bring fertility to supplicants, but later confirmed it. Borhan Said, a local Muslim resident and retired government worker, said people asked for other things as well. \u201cHe was a religious man who was so clear and so devout,\u201d he said.", "It almost sounded as if they had met, but it turned out that Mr. Said was not even sure what epoch Hazana came from. \u201cHe was before my father\u2019s father, that\u2019s all I know,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Said pointed out the nondescript red metal gate of what had been the old synagogue, unlocked and unguarded, and said visitors were welcome. Inside was a garden of fig trees and pomegranates, trumpet creepers and hibiscus, unkempt but well-watered. Purple and blue prayer cloths, used by those who came to ask Hazana\u2019s help, were hanging on some of the bushes.", "Here and there were piles of rubble, old stone building blocks and sections of walls \u2014 the remains of the synagogue itself. Cut into the earth was a stone staircase leading to an underground tomb.", "On the plastered walls inside the tomb was some fairly recent graffiti in Hebrew script, the verses of a religious song, along with an emoji-like smiley face, plus a Star of David sketched over Hazana\u2019s plain rectangular sarcophagus.", "Just what accounts for the town\u2019s communal tolerance, people say they\u2019re not sure, except that it has always been so. \u201cWe grew up like this,\u201d Mr. Said said. \u201cMy father always taught me to be like this and I teach my son the same.\u201d", "Partly the town benefits from its remoteness; even when Kurds engaged in civil war from 1994 to 1997, fighting never arrived here, though both warring factions were present.", "Some attribute it to Amadiya\u2019s history. Take the Amadi Grand Mosque, for example, the biggest and oldest of the town\u2019s 10 mosques. Speculation runs that it was originally a temple for the ancient Romans\u2019 Mithraic cult. Then, say locals, the building became a Jewish synagogue for centuries before becoming a Christian church for more centuries and finally, after the arrival of Islam 800 years ago, a mosque.", "How much of that is actually true is debatable; Amadiya is such an out-of-the-way place that it seems not to have been much studied.", "It would be easy to say that part of the secret of Amadiya\u2019s harmony is simply that most of the other faiths have now left town, though some Jews have visited recently to help restore Hazana\u2019s tomb and to pray there.", "But locals insist that would be unfair. Nafae Paulis is the caretaker of the Chaldean church and a veteran of the Kurdish pesh merga Special Forces who is now retired after years of battling the Islamic State. He talked as if the other faiths were still around in numbers as before.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of Amadiya,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this small place you can find Muslims, Jews, Christians.\u201d", "Even if not actually true, it is a nice sentiment."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/technology/snapchat-redesign-social-media.html": ["Snapchat has long thumbed its nose at social media conventions. The messaging app initially emphasized posts that disappeared rather than remained permanent. It encouraged users to connect with just a few friends instead of many. And it prized human editing and curation instead of encouraging anybody to post anything.", "On Wednesday, its parent company, Snap, continued that unconventional approach, unveiling a redesign that effectively separates social and media into two parts of the Snapchat app.", "Where users of Facebook see one giant news feed of information, typically determined by what they have liked and what their friends post, Snapchat users will now see a left side of the app that includes chats and stories shared with, or by, their friends. That\u2019s the social part. On the right side, there will be content from publishers, amateur creators, celebrities and stories that Snap curates from user-generated videos and photos. That\u2019s the media part.", "\u201cWhile blurring the lines between professional content creators and your friends has been an interesting internet experiment, it has also produced some strange side effects (like fake news) and made us feel like we have to perform for our friends rather than just express ourselves,\u201d Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, said in a blog post about the redesign, which is to begin rolling out on Wednesday and continue through the end of the week.", "The redesign is partly born of necessity. Since Snap, which is based in Venice, Calif., went public in March, its user and revenue numbers have not grown as fast as Wall Street had hoped. That is partially because of Snap\u2019s chief rival, Facebook, which has sought to keep users from turning to Snapchat by copying some of its most popular features.", "Snap\u2019s stock has fallen below its initial public offering price, and the company remains unprofitable. Snap delivered a disappointing earnings report this month, causing its stock to plunge even further. .", "Some things about Snapchat are not changing. For instance, the app still opens to the phone camera, allowing users to make and share photos and videos.", "But the redesign otherwise moves Snapchat even further away from a traditional social media model.", "Material shown on the app\u2019s right side \u2014 what is now the media part \u2014 must meet content and community standards, Snap has decided, whether that material is produced by a newspaper, a television studio, the company\u2019s in-house news and stories teams or so-called influencers. All must be vetted and approved.", "By contrast, those who create content do not need to be vetted to distribute it widely on Facebook and Google. That has allowed hate speech, fake news and disturbing videos aimed at children to proliferate on those platforms. During the presidential election last year, Russian propagandists used Facebook, Google and Twitter to spread material meant to sow division and influence the outcome of the race.", "\u201cSeparating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content \u2014 while addressing many of the problems that plague the internet today,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.", "Philip Napoli, a professor of public policy at Duke who studies media and democracy, said that Snapchat\u2019s redesign would test people\u2019s willingness to embrace a social media app that relied more on human curators than algorithms.", "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there\u2019s enough of a consumer backlash to make this potentially viable, especially in light of the last year,\u201d Professor Napoli said.", "Snap said it was using a kind of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to understand what people like to see, based on their activity, and planned to offer them new content in line with those preferences.", "There are limits to the amount of personalization that Snapchat will provide. In an approach similar to how Netflix widely promotes some television shows and movies, Snap will continue to promote some material \u2014 including breaking news, a new video series or a popular sporting event \u2014 to all of its users.", "Human curators will also program content to make sure that users\u2019 preferences are not keeping them from seeing a wide array of opinions and ideas, the company said.

Prescriptions can be filled through Hims\u2019 own network of pharmacy partners, or sent to patients\u2019 current pharmacies for pickup.

What that means to us is someone who tackles their health head on. Not the \u2018rub some dirt on it, walk it off\u2019 mentality that people are brought up with. While that might work for a charley horse, it doesn\u2019t enable you to be the best partner to your significant other, and it doesn\u2019t enable you to stay around as long for your children.\u201d", "The new Roman empire is being conquered via Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The potential downside, of course, is misdiagnosis or abuse, as Dr. Steven Lamm, the director of the Tisch Center for Men\u2019s Health at N.Y.U.

You want to be certain you have the right screening procedures to rule out the person who is inappropriate to be put on this. I think the companies that are going to be initiating this field understand that. They\u2019d have to be idiots not to.\u201d", "However, he said, he was bullish on the prospect, as Roman may bring men unaccustomed to regular doctor\u2019s visits into the medical fold.

But he and a collaborator soon realized that Facebook might render personality tests superfluous: Instead of asking if someone liked poetry, you could just see if they \u201cliked\u201d Poetry Magazine. In 2014, they published a study showing that if given 200 of a user\u2019s likes, they could predict that person\u2019s personality-test answers better than their own romantic partner could.", "After getting his Ph.D., Kosinski landed a teaching position at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and soon started looking for new data sets to investigate. One in particular stood out: faces. For decades, psychologists have been leery about associating personality traits with physical characteristics, because of the lasting taint of phrenology and eugenics; studying faces this way was, in essence, a taboo. But to understand what that taboo might reveal when questioned, Kosinski knew he couldn\u2019t rely on a human judgment.", "Kosinski first mined 200,000 publicly posted dating profiles, complete with pictures and information ranging from personality to political views. Then he poured that data into an open-source facial-recognition algorithm \u2014 a so-called deep neural network, built by researchers at Oxford University \u2014 and asked it to find correlations between people\u2019s faces and the information in their profiles. The algorithm failed to turn up much, until, on a lark, Kosinski turned its attention to sexual orientation. The results almost defied belief. In previous research, the best any human had done at guessing sexual orientation from a profile picture was about 60 percent \u2014 slightly better than a coin flip. Given five pictures of a man, the deep neural net could predict his sexuality with as much as 91 percent accuracy. For women, that figure was lower but still remarkable: 83 percent.", "Much like his earlier work, Kosinski\u2019s findings raised questions about privacy and the potential for discrimination in the digital age, suggesting scenarios in which better programs and data sets might be able to deduce anything from political leanings to criminality. But there was another question at the heart of Kosinski\u2019s paper, a genuine mystery that went almost ignored amid all the media response: How was the computer doing what it did? What was it seeing that humans could not?", "It was Kosinski\u2019s own research, but when he tried to answer that question, he was reduced to a painstaking hunt for clues. At first, he tried covering up or exaggerating parts of faces, trying to see how those changes would affect the machine\u2019s predictions. Results were inconclusive. But Kosinski knew that women, in general, have bigger foreheads, thinner jaws and longer noses than men. So he had the computer spit out the 100 faces it deemed most likely to be gay or straight and averaged the proportions of each. It turned out that the faces of gay men exhibited slightly more \u201cfeminine\u201d proportions, on average, and that the converse was true for women. If this was accurate, it could support the idea that testosterone levels \u2014 already known to mold facial features \u2014 help mold sexuality as well.", "But it was impossible to say for sure. Other evidence seemed to suggest that the algorithms might also be picking up on culturally driven traits, like straight men wearing baseball hats more often. Or \u2014 crucially \u2014 they could have been picking up on elements of the photos that humans don\u2019t even recognize. \u201cHumans might have trouble detecting these tiny footprints that border on the infinitesimal,\u201d Kosinski says. \u201cComputers can do that very easily.\u201d", "It has become commonplace to hear that machines, armed with machine learning, can outperform humans at decidedly human tasks, from playing Go to playing \u201cJeopardy!\u201d We assume that is because computers simply have more data-crunching power than our soggy three-pound brains. Kosinski\u2019s results suggested something stranger: that artificial intelligences often excel by developing whole new ways of seeing, or even thinking, that are inscrutable to us. It\u2019s a more profound version of what\u2019s often called the \u201cblack box\u201d problem \u2014 the inability to discern exactly what machines are doing when they\u2019re teaching themselves novel skills \u2014 and it has become a central concern in artificial-intelligence research. In many arenas, A.I. methods have advanced with startling speed; deep neural networks can now detect certain kinds of cancer as accurately as a human. But human doctors still have to make the decisions \u2014 and they won\u2019t trust an A.I. unless it can explain itself.", "This isn\u2019t merely a theoretical concern. In 2018, the European Union will begin enforcing a law requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, on penalty of fines that could cost companies like Google and Facebook billions of dollars. The law was written to be powerful and broad and fails to define what constitutes a satisfying explanation or how exactly those explanations are to be reached. It represents a rare case in which a law has managed to leap into a future that academics and tech companies are just beginning to devote concentrated effort to understanding. As researchers at Oxford dryly noted, the law \u201ccould require a complete overhaul of standard and widely used algorithmic techniques\u201d \u2014 techniques already permeating our everyday lives.", "Those techniques can seem inescapably alien to our own ways of thinking. Instead of certainty and cause, A.I. works off probability and correlation. And yet A.I. must nonetheless conform to the society we\u2019ve built \u2014 one in which decisions require explanations, whether in a court of law, in the way a business is run or in the advice our doctors give us. The disconnect between how we make decisions and how machines make them, and the fact that machines are making more and more decisions for us, has birthed a new push for transparency and a field of research called explainable A.I., or X.A.I. Its goal is to make machines able to account for the things they learn, in ways that we can understand. But that goal, of course, raises the fundamental question of whether the world a machine sees can be made to match our own.", "\u201cArtificial intelligence\u201d is a misnomer, an airy and evocative term that can be shaded with whatever notions we might have about what \u201cintelligence\u201d is in the first place. Researchers today prefer the term \u201cmachine learning,\u201d which better describes what makes such algorithms powerful. Let\u2019s say that a computer program is deciding whether to give you a loan. It might start by comparing the loan amount with your income; then it might look at your credit history, marital status or age; then it might consider any number of other data points. After exhausting this \u201cdecision tree\u201d of possible variables, the computer will spit out a decision. If the program were built with only a few examples to reason from, it probably wouldn\u2019t be very accurate. But given millions of cases to consider, along with their various outcomes, a machine-learning algorithm could tweak itself \u2014 figuring out when to, say, give more weight to age and less to income \u2014 until it is able to handle a range of novel situations and reliably predict how likely each loan is to default.", "Machine learning isn\u2019t just one technique. It encompasses entire families of them, from \u201cboosted decision trees,\u201d which allow an algorithm to change the weighting it gives to each data point, to \u201crandom forests,\u201d which average together many thousands of randomly generated decision trees. The sheer proliferation of different techniques, none of them obviously better than the others, can leave researchers flummoxed over which one to choose. Many of the most powerful are bafflingly opaque; others evade understanding because they involve an avalanche of statistical probability. It can be almost impossible to peek inside the box and see what, exactly, is happening.", "Rich Caruana, an academic who works at Microsoft Research, has spent almost his entire career in the shadow of this problem. When he was earning his Ph.D at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1990s, his thesis adviser asked him and a group of others to train a neural net \u2014 a forerunner of the deep neural net \u2014 to help evaluate risks for patients with pneumonia. Between 10 and 11 percent of cases would be fatal; others would be less urgent, with some percentage of patients recovering just fine without a great deal of medical attention. The problem was figuring out which cases were which \u2014 a high-stakes question in, say, an emergency room, where doctors have to make quick decisions about what kind of care to offer. Of all the machine-learning techniques students applied to this question, Caruana\u2019s neural net was the most effective. But when someone on the staff of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center asked him if they should start using his algorithm, \u201cI said no,\u201d Caruana recalls. \u201cI said we don\u2019t understand what it does inside. I said I was afraid.\u201d", "The problem was in the algorithm\u2019s design. Classical neural nets focus only on whether the prediction they gave is right or wrong, tweaking and weighing and recombining all available morsels of data into a tangled web of inferences that seems to get the job done. But some of these inferences could be terrifically wrong. Caruana was particularly concerned by something another graduate student noticed about the data they were handling: It seemed to show that asthmatics with pneumonia fared better than the typical patient. This correlation was real, but the data masked its true cause. Asthmatic patients who contract pneumonia are immediately flagged as dangerous cases; if they tended to fare better, it was because they got the best care the hospital could offer. A dumb algorithm, looking at this data, would have simply assumed asthma meant a patient was likely to get better \u2014 and thus concluded that they were in less need of urgent care.", "\u201cI knew I could probably fix the program for asthmatics,\u201d Caruana says. \u201cBut what else did the neural net learn that was equally wrong? It couldn\u2019t warn me about the unknown unknowns. That tension has bothered me since the 1990s.\u201d", "The story of asthmatics with pneumonia eventually became a legendary allegory in the machine-learning community. Today, Caruana is one of perhaps a few dozen researchers in the United States dedicated to finding more transparent new approaches to machine learning. For the last six years, he has been creating a new model that combines a number of machine-learning techniques. The result is as accurate as his original neural network, and it can spit out charts that show how each individual variable \u2014 from asthma to age \u2014 is predictive of mortality risk, making it easier to see which ones exhibit particularly unusual behavior. Immediately, asthmatics are revealed as a far outlier. Other strange truths surface, too: For example, risk for people age 100 goes down suddenly. \u201cIf you made it to this round number of 100,\u201d Caruana says, \u201cit seemed as if the doctors were saying, \u2018Let\u2019s try to get you another year,\u2019 which might not happen if you\u2019re 93.\u201d", "Caruana may have brought clarity to his own project, but his solution only underscored the fact the explainability is a kaleidoscopic problem. The explanation a doctor needs from a machine isn\u2019t the same as the one a fighter pilot might need or the one an N.S.A. analyst sniffing out a financial fraud might need. Different details will matter, and different technical means will be needed for finding them. You couldn\u2019t, for example, simply use Caruana\u2019s techniques on facial data, because they don\u2019t apply to image recognition. There may, in other words, eventually have to be as many approaches to explainability as there are approaches to machine learning itself.", "Three years ago, David Gunning, one of the most consequential people in the emerging discipline of X.A.I., attended a brainstorming session at a state university in North Carolina. The event had the title \u201cHuman-Centered Big Data,\u201d and it was sponsored by a government-funded think tank called the Laboratory for Analytic Sciences. The idea was to connect leading A.I. researchers with experts in data visualization and human-computer interaction to see what new tools they might invent to find patterns in huge sets of data. There to judge the ideas, and act as hypothetical users, were analysts for the C.I.A., the N.S.A. and sundry other American intelligence agencies.", "The researchers in Gunning\u2019s group stepped confidently up to the white board, showing off new, more powerful ways to draw predictions from a machine and then visualize them. But the intelligence analyst evaluating their pitches, a woman who couldn\u2019t tell anyone in the room what she did or what tools she was using, waved it all away. Gunning remembers her as plainly dressed, middle-aged, typical of the countless government agents he had known who toiled thanklessly in critical jobs. \u201cNone of this solves my problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be able to visualize another recommendation. If I\u2019m going to sign off on a decision, I need to be able to justify it.\u201d She was issuing what amounted to a broadside. It wasn\u2019t just that a clever graph indicating the best choice wasn\u2019t the same as explaining why that choice was correct. The analyst was pointing to a legal and ethical motivation for explainability: Even if a machine made perfect decisions, a human would still have to take responsibility for them \u2014 and if the machine\u2019s rationale was beyond reckoning, that could never happen.", "Gunning, a grandfatherly military man whose buzz cut has survived his stints as a civilian, is a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. He works in Darpa\u2019s shiny new midrise tower in downtown Alexandria, Va. \u2014 an office indistinguishable from the others nearby, except that the security guard out front will take away your cellphone and warn you that turning on the Wi-Fi on your laptop will make security personnel materialize within 30 seconds. Darpa managers like Gunning don\u2019t have permanent jobs; the expectation is that they serve four-year \u201ctours,\u201d dedicated to funding cutting-edge research along a single line of inquiry. When he found himself at the brainstorming session, Gunning had recently completed his second tour as a sort of Johnny Appleseed for A.I.: Starting in the 1990s, he has founded hundreds of projects, from the first application of machine-learning techniques to the internet, which presaged the first search engines, to the project that eventually spun off as Siri, Apple\u2019s voice-controlled assistant. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a dinosaur,\u201d he says with a smile.", "As of now, most of the military\u2019s practical applications of such technology involve performing enormous calculations beyond the reach of human patience, like predicting how to route supplies. But there are more ambitious applications on the horizon. One recent research program tried to use machine learning to sift through millions of video clips and internet messages in Yemen to detect cease-fire violations; if the machine does find something, it has to be able to describe what\u2019s worth paying attention to. Another pressing need is for drones flying on self-directed missions to be able to explain their limitations so that the humans commanding the drones know what the machines can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 be asked to do. Explainability has thus become a hurdle for a wealth of possible projects, and the Department of Defense has begun to turn its eye to the problem.", "After that brainstorming session, Gunning took the analyst\u2019s story back to Darpa and soon signed up for his third tour. As he flew across the country meeting with computer scientists to help design an overall strategy for tackling the problem of X.A.I., what became clear was that the field needed to collaborate more broadly and tackle grander problems. Computer science, having leapt beyond the bounds of considering purely technical problems, had to look further afield \u2014 to experts, like cognitive scientists, who study the ways humans and machines interact.", "This represents a full circle for Gunning, who began his career as a cognitive psychologist working on how to design better automated systems for fighter pilots. Later, he began working on what\u2019s now called \u201cold-fashioned A.I.\u201d \u2014 so-called expert systems in which machines were given voluminous lists of rules, then tasked with drawing conclusions by recombining those rules. None of those efforts was particularly successful, because it was impossible to give the computer a set of rules long enough, or flexible enough, to approximate the power of human reasoning. A.I.\u2019s current blossoming came only when researchers began inventing new techniques for letting machines find their own patterns in the data.", "Gunning\u2019s X.A.I. initiative, which kicked off this year, provides $75 million in funding to 12 new research programs; by the power of the purse strings, Gunning has refocused the energies of a significant part of the American A.I. research community. His hope is that by making these new A.I. methods accountable to the demands of human psychology, they will become both more useful and more powerful. \u201cThe real secret is finding a way to put labels on the concepts inside a deep neural net,\u201d he says. If the concepts inside can be labeled, then they can be used for reasoning \u2014 just like those expert systems were supposed to do in A.I.\u2019s first wave.", "Deep neural nets, which evolved from the kinds of techniques that Rich Caruana was experimenting with in the 1990s, are now the class of machine learning that seems most opaque. Just like old-fashioned neural nets, deep neural networks seek to draw a link between an input on one end (say, a picture from the internet) and an output on the other end (\u201cThis is a picture of a dog\u201d). And just like those older neural nets, they consume all the examples you might give them, forming their own webs of inference that can then be applied to pictures they\u2019ve never seen before. Deep neural nets remain a hotbed of research because they have produced some of the most breathtaking technological accomplishments of the last decade, from learning how to translate words with better-than-human accuracy to learning how to drive.", "To create a neural net that can reveal its inner workings, the researchers in Gunning\u2019s portfolio are pursuing a number of different paths. Some of these are technically ingenious \u2014 for example, designing new kinds of deep neural networks made up of smaller, more easily understood modules, which can fit together like Legos to accomplish complex tasks. Others involve psychological insight: One team at Rutgers is designing a deep neural network that, once it makes a decision, can then sift through its data set to find the example that best demonstrates why it made that decision. (The idea is partly inspired by psychological studies of real-life experts like firefighters, who don\u2019t clock in for a shift thinking, These are the 12 rules for fighting fires; when they see a fire before them, they compare it with ones they\u2019ve seen before and act accordingly.) Perhaps the most ambitious of the dozen different projects are those that seek to bolt new explanatory capabilities onto existing deep neural networks. Imagine giving your pet dog the power of speech, so that it might finally explain what\u2019s so interesting about squirrels. Or, as Trevor Darrell, a lead investigator on one of those teams, sums it up, \u201cThe solution to explainable A.I. is more A.I.\u201d", "Five years ago, Darrell and some colleagues had a novel idea for letting an A.I. teach itself how to describe the contents of a picture. First, they created two deep neural networks: one dedicated to image recognition and another to translating languages. Then they lashed these two together and fed them thousands of images that had captions attached to them. As the first network learned to recognize the objects in a picture, the second simply watched what was happening in the first, then learned to associate certain words with the activity it saw. Working together, the two networks could identify the features of each picture, then label them. Soon after, Darrell was presenting some different work to a group of computer scientists when someone in the audience raised a hand, complaining that the techniques he was describing would never be explainable. Darrell, without a second thought, said, Sure \u2014 but you could make it explainable by once again lashing two deep neural networks together, one to do the task and one to describe it.", "Darrell\u2019s previous work had piggybacked on pictures that were already captioned. What he was now proposing was creating a new data set and using it in a novel way. Let\u2019s say you had thousands of videos of baseball highlights. An image-recognition network could be trained to spot the players, the ball and everything happening on the field, but it wouldn\u2019t have the words to label what they were. But you might then create a new data set, in which volunteers had written sentences describing the contents of every video. Once combined, the two networks should then be able to answer queries like \u201cShow me all the double plays involving the Boston Red Sox\u201d \u2014 and could potentially show you what cues, like the logos on uniforms, it used to figure out who the Boston Red Sox are.", "Call it the Hamlet strategy: lending a deep neural network the power of internal monologue, so that it can narrate what\u2019s going on inside. But do the concepts that a network has taught itself align with the reality that humans are describing, when, for example, narrating a baseball highlight? Is the network recognizing the Boston Red Sox by their logo or by some other obscure signal, like \u201cmedian facial-hair distribution,\u201d that just happens to correlate with the Red Sox? Does it actually have the concept of \u201cBoston Red Sox\u201d or just some other strange thing that only the computer understands? It\u2019s an ontological question: Is the deep neural network really seeing a world that corresponds to our own?", "We human beings seem to be obsessed with black boxes: The highest compliment we give to technology is that it feels like magic. When the workings of a new technology is too obvious, too easy to explain, it can feel banal and uninteresting. But when I asked David Jensen \u2014 a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and one of the researchers being funded by Gunning \u2014 why X.A.I. had suddenly become a compelling topic for research, he sounded almost soulful: \u201cWe want people to make informed decisions about whether to trust autonomous systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re depriving people of the ability to be fully independent human beings.\u201d", "A decade in the making, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation finally goes into effect in May 2018. It\u2019s a sprawling, many-tentacled piece of legislation whose opening lines declare that the protection of personal data is a universal human right. Among its hundreds of provisions, two seem aimed squarely at where machine learning has already been deployed and how it\u2019s likely to evolve. Google and Facebook are most directly threatened by Article 21, which affords anyone the right to opt out of personally tailored ads. The next article then confronts machine learning head on, limning a so-called right to explanation: E.U. citizens can contest \u201clegal or similarly significant\u201d decisions made by algorithms and appeal for human intervention. Taken together, Articles 21 and 22 introduce the principle that people are owed agency and understanding when they\u2019re faced by machine-made decisions.", "For many, this law seems frustratingly vague. Some legal scholars argue that it might be toothless in practice. Others claim that it will require the basic workings of Facebook and Google to change, lest they face penalties of 4 percent of their revenue. It remains to be seen whether complying with the law will mean a heap of fine print and an extra check box buried in a pop-up window, some new kind of warning-label system marking every machine-made decision or much more profound changes.", "If Google is one of the companies most endangered by this new scrutiny on A.I., it\u2019s also the company with the greatest wherewithal to lead the whole industry in solving the problem. Even among the company\u2019s astonishing roster of A.I. talent, one particular star is Chris Olah, who holds the title of research scientist \u2014 a title shared by Google\u2019s many ex-professors and Ph.D.s \u2014 without ever having completed more than a year of college. Olah has been working for the last couple of years on creating new ways to visualize the inner workings of a deep neural network. You might recall when Google created a hallucinatory tool called Deep Dream, which produced psychedelic distortions when you fed it an image and which went viral when people used it to create hallucinatory mash-ups like a doll covered in a pattern of doll eyes and a portrait of Vincent Van Gogh made up in places of bird beaks. Olah was one of many Google researchers on the team, led by Alex Mordvintsev, that worked on Deep Dream. It may have seemed like a folly, but it was actually a technical steppingstone.", "Olah speaks faster and faster as he sinks into an idea, and the words tumbled out of him almost too quickly to follow as he explained what he found so exciting about the work he was doing. \u201cThe truth is, it\u2019s really beautiful. There\u2019s some sense in which we don\u2019t know what it means to see. We don\u2019t understand how humans do it,\u201d he told me, hands gesturing furiously. \u201cWe want to understand something not just about neural nets but something deeper about reality.\u201d Olah\u2019s hope is that deep neural networks reflect something deeper about parsing data \u2014 that insights gleaned from them might in turn shed light on how our brains work.", "Olah showed me a sample of work he was preparing to publish with a set of collaborators, including Mordvintsev; it was made public this month. The tool they had developed was basically an ingenious way of testing a deep neural network. First, it fed the network a random image of visual noise. Then it tweaked that image over and over again, working to figure out what excited each layer in the network the most. Eventually, that process would find the platonic ideal that each layer of the network was searching for. Olah demonstrated with a network trained to classify different breeds of dogs. You could pick out a neuron from the topmost layer while it was analyzing a picture of a golden retriever. You could see the ideal it was looking for \u2014 in this case, a hallucinatory mash-up of floppy ears and a forlorn expression. The network was indeed homing in on higher-level traits that we could understand.", "Watching him use the tool, I realized that it was exactly what the psychologist Michal Kosinski needed \u2014 a key to unlock what his deep neural network was seeing when it categorized profile pictures as gay or straight. Kosinski\u2019s most optimistic view of his research was that it represented a new kind of science in which machines could access truths that lay beyond human intuition. The problem was reducing what a computer knew into a single conclusion that a human could grasp and consider. He had painstakingly tested his data set by hand and found evidence that the computer might be discovering hormonal signals in facial structure. That evidence was still fragmentary. But with the tool that Olah showed me, or one like it, Kosinski might have been able to pull back the curtain on how his mysterious A.I. was working.

The rules prohibit high-speed internet service providers, or I.S.P.s, from stopping or slowing down the delivery of websites. They also prevent the companies from charging customers extra fees for high-quality streaming and other services.", "The announcement set off a fight over free speech and the control of the internet, pitting telecom titans like AT&T and Verizon against internet giants like Google and Amazon. The internet companies warned that rolling back the rules could make the telecom companies powerful gatekeepers to information and entertainment. The telecom companies say that the existing rules prevent them from offering customers a wider selection of services at higher and lower price points.", "\u201cUnder my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the F.C.C. would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that\u2019s best for them.\u201d", "Mr. Pai, a Republican who has pursued an aggressive deregulation agenda, was widely expected to have his plan approved during a meeting on Dec. 14.

Only the largest companies, they say, would be able to afford the expense of making sure their sites received preferred treatment. Companies like Etsy and Pinterest, for example, credit their start to the promise of free and open access on the internet.", "And consumers, the online companies say, may see their costs go up if, for example, they want high-quality access to popular websites like Netflix, a company that depends on fast connections for its streaming videos.

Those practices, they said, would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department.", "The plan to repeal the existing rules, passed in 2015, would reverse a hallmark decision by the agency to consider broadband a public utility, as essential as phones and electricity. The earlier decision created the legal foundation for the current rules and underscored the importance of high-speed internet service. It was put in place by Tom Wheeler, an F.C.C. chairman under President Obama.", "Mr. Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump in January, has eliminated numerous regulations during his first year.", "The agency has stripped down rules governing television broadcasters, newspapers and telecom companies that were meant to protect the public interest. On Tuesday, in addition to the net neutrality rollback, Mr. Pai announced a plan to eliminate a rule limiting any corporation from controlling broadcasts that can reach more than 39 percent of American homes.", "The fight over net neutrality could end up being one of his biggest and most fraught decisions.

The intricate pieces, shown at the Akris spring 2016 show in Paris, were inspired by the Naoshima Pavilion in Japan, a geometric meshlike steel structure by the architect Sou Fujimoto.", "Albert Kriemler, creative director Akris, a Swiss fashion house, said, \u201cI am always thinking about how to bring new methods of creation into our studio, but when VOJD approached us in 2015 I was fascinated by what they thought was possible.\u201d", "\u201cOnce the rings were completed, and in a range of colors, I was even more impressed,\u201d he said, calling the project something that \u201cexpanded the imagination.\u201d The rings were sold in Akris boutiques for $245 each.", "Mr. Kriemler said no further collaborations were planned but added that he continuedto be excited about 3-D printing and incorporating it into the Akris design process.", "Of course, the higher the prices, the higher the product standard needs to be, putting constant pressure both on brands and their manufacturing partners to innovate.", "Mr. Hartung said that a signature of VOJD work was intricate geometries and interlocking elements impossible to replicate elsewhere.", "\u201cMany of the brands we work with have long had projects or concepts because of them being impossible, too difficult or expensive to realize traditionally,\u201d he said, noting that the cost of an average 3-D printed object had fallen roughly 10 percent a year since 2013.", "So, for example, a piece could be printed now for 52 euros ($60) that would have cost \u20ac80 in 2013, allowing the savings to be spent on improving aspects like finishing and coloring.", "And Mr. Hartung said his long-term aim was to create manufacturing programs that can be licensed to brands so they can use the technology themselves.", "\u201cThree-D printing is revolutionizing processes in many industries outside the world of fashion,\u201d said Mr. Kriemler of Akris. \u201cTraditionally, this has a been a sector resistant to embrace change.

Bardugo\u2019s version offers a new explanation for Princess Diana\u2019s departure from Themyscira. A young woman named Alia Mayeux Keralis is shipwrecked off the coast, and Diana rescues her. But Alia is a Warbringer, a descendant of Helen of Troy whose very presence causes conflict and chaos. If Diana can help Alia get to Helen\u2019s final resting place before time runs out, she can change Alia\u2019s destiny \u2026 and the world\u2019s.", "After a slow start (the somber Themysciran scene-setting and stilted, formal way the Amazons speak aren\u2019t much fun), the plot takes off, with a lot of action and humor. Alia, who is half Greek-American and half black, brings Diana to her country. (When the duo magically land in New York Harbor, Diana looks up to see \u201ca vibrant yellow torch held aloft by the statue of an Amazon, her stern face framed by a crown like a sunburst.\u201d) They team up with Alia\u2019s older brother Jason, crush object Theo and best friend Nim, racing to change the course of history. Meanwhile, terrifying gods of war and chaos, as well as human soldiers, keep attacking. Nim is a delicious character \u2014 an asymmetrical-haircut-sporting Indian-American girl with multiple piercings and a wicked sense of humor.

He picks up a rose at a flower shop (who will he give it to? His best friend, Angela? His ex, Enzo? His current boyfriend, Linus?) and pricks his thumb \u2026 and as the drop of blood falls we\u2019re suddenly in a different world.

Gradually, it becomes clear that both narratives are about the power of a single moment to change everything. It sounds heavy, but it isn\u2019t \u2014 Adam and his friends are very funny, and seeing flawed characters trying their hardest to forgive and to grow is truly touching.

Almost every other bit of square footage on the editorial floor is occupied by a dude at work \u2014 dudes carrying props, dudes spitting tobacco juice into plastic bottles, dudes typing up blog posts and tracking page views. The center of the space, marked by a giant menorah, operates as a full-time modular studio, pumping out all sorts of content: Barstool produces a Sirius XM radio show (soon to be a whole channel), a growing list of podcasts and up to 90 blog posts a day. The dudes who make this stuff are uniformly young and white. In the three days I spent at Barstool headquarters, the only women I saw were Erika Nardini, the company\u2019s chief executive; Asa Akira, the world-famous porn star who co-hosted a Barstool podcast; and the security guard.", "On an overcast day in June, Dave Portnoy, Barstool\u2019s wiry, 40-year-old founder \u2014 known to followers as El Presidente \u2014 stood shirtless in front of a green screen rapping, trying to recreate an Instagram video LeBron James had posted from the gym. At the other end of the office, a gaggle of dudes in impressively obscure jerseys hyped up a one-on-one basketball game between two bloggers called Smitty and Gay Pat. I sat down next to Noah Ives, a pale, slightly hunched intern, who was 21 and recently graduated from a communications program at Syracuse University. In decades past, Ives might have spent his summers at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Conn., coiling wires and fetching coffee. \u201cESPN was definitely on my mind when I got to college,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut Barstool is just a cooler brand that people my age just respect more.\u201d When I asked him what he meant by \u201crespect,\u201d Ives smirked and said: \u201cThe takes are just much more relatable. It\u2019s like Pres says \u2014 Barstool is by the common man, for the common man.\u201d He paused before adding: \u201cESPN is just spitting facts and political correctness.\u201d", "Ives spoke the language of the culture war raging in sports media \u2014 a mix of marketing jargon and Bannon-lite populism directed, at all times, at the self-proclaimed Worldwide Leader in Sports, which stands accused of losing touch with the young bros whose attention it once owned. This is surely part of why, early this fall, ESPN announced \u201cBarstool Van Talk,\u201d a half-hour talk show that would air at 1 a.m. on a secondary channel and feature two of Barstool Sports\u2019s most palatable personalities: Consciously or not, the network wanted to co-opt the resistance.", "But the day before the Oct. 17 premiere of \u201cVan Talk,\u201d Sam Ponder, host of ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday N.F.L. Countdown,\u201d tweeted \u201cWelcome to the ESPN family\u201d to one of the show\u2019s hosts \u2014 along with two screen captures of a Barstool blog post from 2014, in which Portnoy called her a \u201cBible-thumping freak\u201d and wrote that her job\u2019s \u201c#1 requirement\u201d was to \u201cmake men hard.\u201d Other outlets, like USA Today\u2019s For the Win blog, surfaced audio from a Barstool show in which Portnoy calls on Ponder to be more \u201cslutty.\u201d Just six days after the first episode aired, John Skipper, ESPN\u2019s president, announced the cancellation of the show in a P.R. statement. \u201cI erred,\u201d he wrote, \u201cin assuming we could distance our efforts from the Barstool site and its content.\u201d", "The cancellation sparked joy in sports media\u2019s more progressive ranks, which tend to view Barstool with the same disdain that their colleagues in political news might view Breitbart or The Daily Caller. Skipper\u2019s statement was, however, paying Portnoy a kind of compliment. Only two years ago, any business that wanted to partner with Barstool knew it would be partnering with the unfiltered chauvinism that made Portnoy a minor celebrity in Boston, his hometown. Now the president of the biggest sports network in the world was admitting that he had believed there was a way to temper Barstool for a mainstream market. \u201cOnce upon a time, they\u201d \u2014 ESPN \u2014 \u201cwere the coolest people in the room,\u201d said Richard Deitsch, a media columnist for Sports Illustrated, in a podcast discussing the controversy. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case in 2017. It\u2019s the opposite. They are polarizing; people dislike them on all sides.\u201d By partnering with Barstool, he said, they were trying \u201cto associate themselves with who they believe are the cool kids in the room.\u201d", "Portnoy says he doesn\u2019t really think ESPN\u2019s future depends on the implied politics of its on-air personalities, but he knows a branding opportunity when he sees one. And the entrenched narrative \u2014 that the once-irreverent network has fed its soul to the hounds of political correctness and liberal fake news \u2014 is certainly an opportunity. As professional athletes have knelt for the national anthem, criticized the president and railed against police violence, ESPN has been repeatedly accused of being too sympathetic to them and too liberal for its own good. A company once built on an aggressively apolitical foundation has somehow become a locus of almost every imaginable type of political fight. As it has blundered its way through widely publicized incidents like Jemele Hill\u2019s tweets about the president and the N.F.L., the sports-radio host Clay Travis has taken to calling the network \u201cMSESPN\u201d; the reporter Britt McHenry has suggested that she was fired from the network for professing her conservative beliefs. Whether these critiques are accurate seems largely irrelevant. Neither does it particularly matter that Portnoy and his cast of bloggers are largely liberal-leaning dudes from the breeding grounds of the coastal elite. There exists a swarm of angry sports fans who maintain that they do not want to talk about Colin Kaepernick or the national anthem, and Barstool has cleared a space for them to gather and talk, mostly, about just how much they don\u2019t want to talk about politics. They claim to be an overlooked majority \u2014 the vast market inefficiency that will richly reward anyone who will let them watch their games, memes and funny videos without having to feel bad about themselves. Barstool is their safe space.", "So on a balmy day in October, Portnoy \u2014 who looks like Mark Zuckerberg after five years of hard drinking and even harder tanning \u2014 called an \u201cemergency press conference\u201d in his offices to address the cancellation of \u201cVan Talk.\u201d Portnoy\u2019s addresses to readers tend to ramble and veer off on tangents, but they do so triumphantly. This one was no different: He sidled up to a makeshift lectern made out of a water jug, stared straight into a camera and delivered an unapologetic seven-minute rant. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Mickey Mouse push us around,\u201d he said, referring to Disney, which owns ESPN. \u201cThere is actually nothing that ESPN could have done to illustrate\u201d \u2014 he meant better illustrate \u2014 \u201cwhy we are rising and they are falling.\u201d", "El Presidente, who grew up in Swampscott, Mass., an upper-middle-class suburb, isn\u2019t the most obvious choice for a champion of the common man, but he does describe his own life as thoroughly, unceasingly average. He says he did O.K. in school and was an O.K. baseball player. He considers himself an average-looking guy. He attended the University of Michigan, where, he says, he had average fun with his average friends. His rise to prominence came not from his skills as a sports analyst but from his ability to sniff out untapped markets. After graduating from Michigan in 1999, he worked in the sales department of a consulting firm in Boston but quickly tired of corporate life. He wanted to start his own business, preferably in the gambling scene. In 2003, on a trip to Las Vegas, he met with people in the online-gaming industry and found them desperate for places to advertise. Portnoy\u2019s idea was to start a sports publication that might be attractive to poker advertisers \u2014 and because the only ad model that seemed viable at the time was in print, he planned to pass it out as a tabloid at T stops throughout Boston.", "Early in the decade, the only sports blogs with any significant audience were Sports by Brooks \u2014 which mostly aggregated news \u2014 and the writer Bill Simmons\u2019s column on AOL\u2019s Digital City Boston. (I later worked for Simmons for three years at Grantland, the ESPN website where he was editor in chief.) Portnoy revered Simmons and agreed with his assessment that Boston\u2019s sports coverage, which was still centered in the column inches of The Globe and The Herald, had grown stale and out of touch with the common man. Not so for Portnoy: In an early mock-up, calling himself Devilfish Dave, he wrote that \u201cthe people at Barstool Sports are a bunch of average Joes, who like most guys love sports, gambling, golfing and chasing short skirts.\u201d", "Barstool went through the usual spate of early hardships, and there\u2019s every chance that had it been born out of some actual journalistic ideal, it would have folded within the year. But Portnoy\u2019s talent was for gathering feedback from readers and advertisers and tweaking his product accordingly: \u201cWe could pivot really easily,\u201d he told me, \u201cand chase money.\u201d The first breakthrough came when a local photographer told Portnoy he should start putting photos of area women on the tabloid\u2019s covers \u2014 and offered to take the pictures himself. (A version of this idea still exists on the website, under the title \u201cLocal Smokeshow of the Day.\u201d) Around the same time, Portnoy noticed that readers seemed to respond more to stories about drinking, women and gambling than day-to-day sports news. He sold ads to bars and breweries and catered more and more to a certain archetypal Boston bro \u2014 the type who puts on a collared shirt to get blackout drunk every weekend while ruefully cheering on the Red Sox. His writing voice fell into a distinct rhythm, half-cocked and prone to fits of anger. When he finally mustered up a web version of Barstool, it looked like a relic from the 1990s and often crashed, but he called such inconveniences \u201cthe Barstool difference\u201d \u2014 a sign, he maintained, of true authenticity.", "By the time Barstool began publishing, Simmons had started a national column for ESPN and moved to Los Angeles to write for television. Portnoy had Boston to himself. \u201cWhen Bill was writing on Digital Cities, he was reaching regular guys like me,\u201d Portnoy told me. \u201cI\u2019m reaching the new me.\u201d", "Whether he knew it or not, Portnoy was also building a modern online-media business well before its time \u2014 with low overhead, an investment in brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams that could withstand fluctuations in advertising. He started hawking T-shirts and merchandise on the site, another venture that fell prey to the Barstool difference; printing and shipping could take months. He built up a network of bloggers in other cities, like Dan Katz in Chicago and Kevin Clancy in New York \u2014 Big Cat and KFC, per their Barstool nicknames. When Portnoy realized that readers were more invested in these bloggers as personalities than in their opinions on sports, he began turning the site into a sort of online reality show: Every office argument and personal-life development was written up and fed to a growing legion of \u201cStoolies.\u201d", "Part of what Barstool offered these readers was escapism, something that retains a lot of power among sports fans who still see games as a nightly release from their responsibilities. The site\u2019s enduring slogan, \u201cSaturdays Are for the Boys,\u201d promises a day free from girlfriends and wives. Search for the phrase on social media, and you\u2019ll find videos of Stoolies relaxing at beach houses, on boats or at tailgates, surrounded by nothing but shirtless men; in some, they actually push women out of the camera\u2019s frame. Sports could also be a reprieve from office work. In his initial mock-up, in 2003, Portnoy wrote that \u201cwe don\u2019t take ourselves very seriously and view working at Barstool Sports as a way to avoid becoming slaves to cubicle life.\u201d When Clancy, who calls himself \u201cthe king of average,\u201d started writing Barstool New York, he was working as an accountant at Deloitte; when he saw that his tales of mind-numbing corporate boredom were getting traction with readers, he began writing a column called \u201cCubicle Chronicles,\u201d grumbling rancorously about everything from bad coffee to the \u201cfat secretary blasting Dominic the [expletive] Donkey\u201d around Christmas.", "The only thing the Stoolies wouldn\u2019t do, it turned out, was \u201cpolitics.\u201d For the most part, Portnoy and his readers employed the time-honored bro tactic of saying they had no problem with anyone \u2014 until, of course, \u201canyone\u201d started complaining. A particularly illustrative example of this can be found in an article from 2009, in which a reader informed Portnoy about the \u201cFagbug,\u201d an art installation aimed at raising awareness about homophobic violence. \u201cI could give a [expletive] less if somebody is gay or not,\u201d Portnoy responded, insisting that, much as he enjoyed the female anatomy, if another man preferred the male one, then \u201cmore power to him.\u201d But what, he asked, was the point of the installation? \u201cI thought gay dudes hated being called fags? Or is this like when a black person uses the N-word as a compliment?\u201d He closed by saying all this \u201cfag talk\u201d reminded him of last night\u2019s television: Did anyone else see Adam Lambert on \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d? Every line was aimed directly at dudes who, like Portnoy, would not identify as bigots, but who also scratched their heads at the weird tendencies of anyone who wasn\u2019t exactly like them, self-proclaimed common men.", "By 2010, Barstool was doing well enough that Portnoy had an office in Milton, Mass., local pages for New York, Chicago and Philadelphia and a handful of employees, including the future YouTube megastar Jenna Mourey, a.k.a. Jenna Marbles. That year, he hired a local white rapper named Sammy Adams and set up a tour of New England colleges. \u201cWhen we showed up on the campuses, they had our signs on their dorms, people were rushing after our bus,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was the first time I really thought this might be bigger than I anticipated.\u201d", "The following year, he started a nationwide party tour called \u201cBarstool Blackout.\u201d The college students who attended danced under blacklights and occasionally \u2014 the obvious implication \u2014 drank until they blacked out. (One of the slogans: \u201cBy the C- student, for the C- student.\u201d) It was Barstool\u2019s first real encounter with controversy. Early in 2012, students in the Boston area demonstrated against the Blackout Parties, claiming that they promoted rape culture and circulating Portnoy\u2019s writings on the subject. \u201cJust to make friends with the feminists,\u201d he\u2019d written on the site, \u201cI\u2019d like to reiterate that we don\u2019t condone rape of any kind at our Blackout Parties in mid-January. However, if a chick passes out, that\u2019s a gray area though.\u201d And: \u201cThough I never condone rape, if you\u2019re a Size 6 and you\u2019re wearing skinny jeans, you kind of deserve to be raped, right?\u201d The parties, which were held at private spaces near campuses, went ahead as planned. Portnoy issued no retractions or apologies. \u201cI think the controversy probably helped us,\u201d he says now. \u201cOur fans liked that we didn\u2019t back down. They realized that I was on their side.\u201d", "In January 2016, Portnoy stood in Times Square, dressed in a tuxedo and flanked by Clancy, Katz and a Barstool editor, Keith Markovich. After a few bars of Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York,\u201d he made what he called a \u201cshocking\u201d announcement: \u201cI am no longer the majority owner of Barstool Sports. We have taken investment from an investment company called Chernin Digital.\u201d He went on to describe Peter Chernin \u2014 head of the Chernin Group, the former president of News Corporation and the Fox film executive who greenlit \u201cTitanic\u201d and \u201cAvatar\u201d \u2014 as a \u201cbig swinging [expletive] at the cracker factory,\u201d and alluded to Barstool\u2019s business and technological shortcomings, all of which would presumably be fixed soon. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a young comedian in the \u201980s,\u201d he said, \u201cand you graduate, right, you had to send your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 Five years, all these little kids, all these beautiful people \u2014 there\u2019s only going to be one place to send their r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Barstool Sports.\u201d", "In a blog post about the sale \u2014 which concluded with the coy signoff \u201cPS \u2014 I\u2019m kinda rich now\u201d \u2014 Portnoy added something prescient: \u201cChernin knows about the Size 6 skinny-jean joke. They know about Babygate.\u201d (The \u201cBabygate\u201d controversy stemmed from Portnoy\u2019s speculating about the size of Tom Brady\u2019s baby\u2019s penis.) \u201cThey know about Al Jazeera.\u201d (In this one, Clancy questioned the legitimacy of any news outlet with an Arabic-sounding name.) \u201cThey get it.\u201d", "The Barstool acquisition was engineered by the president of Chernin Digital, Mike Kerns. \u201cWhen I got access to Barstool\u2019s Google analytics, I knew this was something different,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey had something like 20 percent of their visitors coming back about 20 times a day. I\u2019ve been in this business for two decades, and all their numbers bucked the usual trends.\u201d Portnoy kept full editorial control; Chernin\u2019s bet was that it could serve cheap content to his loyal fan base, which would then pay for things like T-shirts, events and premium content. The brand would be scaled up into something that could be sold to advertisers, big media partners and even sports leagues. Every Barstool executive I spoke to mentioned the possibility of opening branded sports bars across the country; all of them talked about partnerships with networks. Since its acquisition, Barstool has released a raft of popular podcasts \u2014 including \u201cPardon My Take,\u201d which, with downloads running up to one million per episode, is one of the biggest sports podcasts in the country. It has partnered with Facebook on a roving pregame college-football show (since canceled) and produced a widely watched baseball show that regularly features former major-league players.", "This bullish transition has been helmed by Erika Nardini, a 42-year-old former marketing executive who once served as the chief marketing officer for AOL. Nardini, who grew up playing sports with her younger brother, seems uniquely qualified to deal with both the business of turning Barstool into a national brand and the inevitable public- and human-relations disasters that will arise along the way. She is also a woman, and despite its growth since the Chernin acquisition, Barstool still has to work around how bad its worst moments can get \u2014 from Portnoy\u2019s rape jokes to posts like the one a blogger named Chris Spagnuolo wrote this summer: \u201cIs Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?\u201d", "The Rihanna incident highlighted how much has changed since the Chernin acquisition, but also how much has stayed more or less the same. The post was quietly taken down. But Portnoy also opined on the site that he thought the post wasn\u2019t \u201cas bad as many are making it out to be,\u201d and that he was angry mostly because Spagnuolo had given \u201cfeminists\u201d fodder to say \u201cthere goes Barstool being Barstool again.\u201d And yet Portnoy himself cannot seem to stop personally offering up more and more of that fodder. A controversy last month, involving the terms of a contract offered to a sports personality named Elika Sadeghi, began on relatively professional footing. Within days, though, Barstool had released a seven-minute animated video in which a cartoon Portnoy says Sadeghi\u2019s surname sounds like \u201cthe monkey from \u2018The Lion King.\u2019\u2009\u201d It also portrays her hanging upside down over a boiling caldron.", "I spoke to several women in sports media who have had run-ins with Barstool. All described the same pattern: They would tweet something critical of Barstool\u2019s statements about women, which would prompt a response from Portnoy or one of his bloggers. Then came the swarm of Stoolies on social media, who would harass them with misogynist slurs and threats, often for days. Even random sports fans have been targeted. A few years ago, a Cubs fan named Missy suffered a brain injury after a fall; during her recovery, she found that she had trouble reading anything longer than a paragraph, so she moved her usual sports-media consumption over to Twitter. When she saw an article detailing the way Clancy and an army of Stoolies had responded to the Al Jazeera incident, Missy tweeted her support for the author of the article and women she felt had been abused online. Stoolies responded almost immediately, with three days of the usual misogynist epithets and vague threats. A year later, she says, after another comment critical of Barstool, a reader found photos she had posted memorializing a cousin who died of cancer \u2014 and reposted them on Twitter, tagging Barstool writers to do God knows what with them.", "There\u2019s a uniform response from Barstool employees about the worst of the Stoolies. \u201cI hate seeing it,\u201d Katz told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s just a few idiots who have nothing better to do, and it sucks that people use them to smear an entire company.\u201d The average Stoolie, Portnoy, Clancy and Markovich all argue, is not a misogynist abuser but has been painted with a broad brush by other media outlets. \u201cI\u2019m used to it by now,\u201d Nardini said of the constant negative press surrounding Barstool\u2019s attitudes toward women. \u201cEvery time anyone mentions us in the media, they\u2019re always going to write that requisite paragraph.\u201d She used to be part of a network of female executives, she told me, but \u201cafter they heard I was coming here, every single one of them dropped me like a bad habit.\u201d", "The wrath of the Stoolies can occasionally extend to Barstool\u2019s own employees. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a single day that would go by without me seeing the N-word in the comments,\u201d Maurice Peebles, Barstool\u2019s first black employee, told me. Peebles ran Barstool\u2019s Philadelphia page for three years. His administrator access allowed him to see that the racial slurs were coming mostly from a concentrated number of IP addresses, which meant that only a few readers were posting the slurs, and over time the site\u2019s filters became better at blocking them. But he doesn\u2019t absolve Barstool of all responsibility. \u201cThey could\u2019ve done more about it,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of the guys who worked at Barstool ever said anything racist to me, but I don\u2019t know if they all understand what it\u2019s like to see that word every day.\u201d", "Barstool\u2019s reputation \u201cwas certainly listed as a risk,\u201d Kerns says. \u201cBut I think time is on our side. The younger folks within agencies and brands get Barstool and recognize the world is increasingly taking itself less seriously.\u201d Over the past year, that time seemed to have already arrived. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, the advertiser most associated with Boston sports, had long been wary of dealing with Portnoy, but this year, Barstool dedicated an entire month to promoting the chain\u2019s new energy drink. Wendy\u2019s had also expressed hesitation to partner with Barstool, but this summer the company sponsored \u201cBarstool 5th Year,\u201d a Snapchat channel specifically targeted at college students.", "The question of whether Barstool should be held responsible for the worst behaviors of its fans reflects a fundamental question facing online media \u2014 the same one at the core of Facebook\u2019s issues with fake news, Twitter\u2019s with neo-Nazis and Reddit\u2019s with various toxic communities. Unlike those companies, Barstool can\u2019t hide behind the notion of being an open, neutral platform for the free speech of others. Its readers may come from all sorts of backgrounds, but the core Stoolies are an organic online community that grew under the caring, thoughtful hand of their very own El Presidente. Every new-media venture seeks out an \u201corganic online community\u201d like this \u2014 one that can, in Nardini\u2019s words, \u201cconvert content into commerce.\u201d That community could mean, say, subscribers of The Daily Skimm, an email for millennial women that recaps the news in a peppy, corporate voice. But it can also mean tribes of angry, disaffected young men who gather online to find shelter from the floodwaters of political correctness. This leaves companies like ESPN with a discomforting dilemma. Should they try to create their own communities \u2014 an almost impossible enterprise, especially with young audiences who have grown up on completely independent, unfiltered personalities on YouTube and social media? Or should they co-opt, sanitize and scale audiences like the Stoolies?", "There are two distinct visions of how Barstool could work at the scale Nardini and Chernin envision. The first would involve running back into the understanding embrace of the Stoolies and building an uncouth, unapologetic brand aimed exclusively at boorish young men. Last August, Barstool purchased Old Row, a site that posts frat-boy fight videos and photos of college girls in bikinis and sells T-shirts celebrating the Trump presidency. This month, Barstool announced that it had bought Rough N Rowdy Brawl, an amateur boxing company from West Virginia that features untrained locals knocking one another out. In an \u201cemergency press conference\u201d announcing the acquisition, Portnoy thanked Ponder, saying the ESPN controversy had led to \u201cthe biggest couple weeks we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d \u201cIt does not matter if you like us, hate us, whatever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe speak directly to our own consumers.\u201d", "The other road is to take the popular material that has been built since the Chernin acquisition and take another crack at entering media\u2019s mainstream. I have friends and relatives \u2014 the majority of whom would be considered progressive, many of whom are not white \u2014 who read Barstool regularly, like its videos on Instagram and listen to \u201cPardon My Take.\u201d Some are vaguely aware that Portnoy has said disturbing things about women, but they shrug it off in the same way they shrug off the cloud of bad news that continually engulfs the N.F.L. The vast majority of the Barstool content they consume ticks between standard-fare aggregation (funny videos, memes, weird stories from Florida) and genuinely enjoyable content aimed directly at men who, like me, grew up watching sports and went to colleges where we watched sports with our sports-watching friends.", "During the N.H.L. finals in June, I went to the Barstool offices to watch a recording of \u201cPardon My Take.\u201d Katz, who is not as fat as he claims to be on air, sat in a La-Z-Boy, idly watching hockey and scribbling notes. His co-host, who goes by the pseudonym PFT Commenter, tried out jokes about handshake lines and the superiority of the N.H.L. to the N.B.A. When the game ended, they settled on a list of segments and piled into a small recording studio, completely bare except for poorly stapled acoustic tiles and posters of Chris Berman and Lenny Dykstra.", "They rattled through the show without second takes or pauses, the jokes and banter falling into a familiar, rapid rhythm. Katz is the straight man; he is mostly playing himself, an affable dude who loves his Chicago sports and could easily slide into the chair of any ESPN opinion show. PFT Commenter, who has shoulder-length hair and wears Hawaiian shirts, has created a type of character that has never really been seen in sports media \u2014 a gag version of a commenter on the well-trafficked N.F.L. blog Pro Football Talk, his tweets and columns filled with the spelling errors, prejudices and leaps of logic that plague all open forums about sports. In 2015, covering the early part of the presidential campaign, in character, for SB Nation, he would pound airplane bottles of Fireball whiskey and walk straight into scrums of reporters; outside a Republican debate in Cleveland, he held up a sign behind Chris Matthews that read, \u201cIs Joe Flacco a ELITE Quaterback?\u201d", "Almost everything about \u201cPardon My Take\u201d is a densely referential sports-fan in-joke. Even the title plays off two ESPN talk shows, \u201cPardon the Interruption\u201d and \u201cFirst Take.\u201d If you\u2019ve never watched Chris Berman run through a highlight reel or admired the sports-yelling talents of Stephen A. Smith, Katz and Commenter might as well be speaking a foreign language. But most sports fans have watched hundreds of hours of ESPN programming, absorbing all the tics, clich\u00e9s and motifs that Katz and Commenter have quilted together into a pitch-perfect satirical pidgin. One of its catchiest elements derives from the N.F.L.-coach habit of explaining some bit of masculine bluster by saying \u201cI\u2019m a football guy\u201d \u2014 in my time at Barstool, at least 70 percent of conversations seemed to include some deadpan variation on \u201cI\u2019m a huge [something] guy.\u201d This entertaining mix has attracted an impressive list of high-profile athletes and media figures to the show. Before the Chernin deal, Portnoy had not seen the value in producing podcasts, which he admitted to me was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d; now \u201cPardon My Take\u201d is Barstool\u2019s flagship product. Katz and Commenter were, until October, proof that Barstool could be scrubbed clean and scaled up.", "During our conversations, Portnoy kept bringing up \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d mentioning it as a model for Barstool. What he meant was that he wanted to create a broad cast of characters, each capable of his or her own independent success. Barstool has hired the ESPN sideline reporter Julie Stewart-Binks; Michael Rapaport, the character actor who hosts a popular podcast; the former major-league pitcher Dallas Braden; Pat McAfee, an N.F.L. punter who retired midcareer to sign with Portnoy; and Adam Ferrone, a battle-rap champion who told me that he pestered Barstool for two years for a job. By choosing Barstool, each seems to be signing on with the gospel of Portnoy: Say what\u2019s on your mind \u2014 and if anyone has a problem with it, fight back.", "The morning after Skipper sent out the ESPN memo canceling \u201cVan Talk,\u201d I met Portnoy in his hoarder\u2019s den of an office, where Tom Brady memorabilia and stacks of paper occupied every surface. He seemed unusually subdued. His nearly manic manner had dissipated into a fog of half-formed sound bites and what felt like sincere anxiety. He expressed regret over hurting Katz and Commenter\u2019s television prospects, denounced ESPN\u2019s cowardice and called out the hypocrisy of any female journalist at ESPN who had ever tweeted an edgy joke in the past. \u201cI used to think of Barstool like a comedy club,\u201d he said. \u201cJust me talking to my guys. But things have definitely changed.\u201d Then, after a pause, he seemed to have a change of heart: \u201cESPN thought they were going to get Barstool without Barstool. How does that even work?\u201d", "Over the days to come, Portnoy and a handful of bloggers \u2014 alongside hundreds of Stoolie volunteers \u2014 scrubbed through the social-media accounts of women at ESPN who had spoken out about them, resurfacing every comment that was even slightly off-color. (\u201cI hate hypocrisy,\u201d Portnoy told me \u2014 and that image, of ugly honesty triumphing over hypocrisy, probably explains Barstool\u2019s appeal to young men better than any of its content.) A week later, Henry Lockwood, the producer of \u201cPardon My Take,\u201d tweeted that Britt McHenry had \u201ccankles,\u201d leading to another spat. It was as if Barstool was doubling down on being more Barstool than ever, even though ESPN wasn\u2019t the only partner that had been scared off: Portnoy told me another network had backed away from a deal, and that some advertisers had expressed concern.", "We talked about something that happened a few hours before ESPN\u2019s announcement, while Portnoy was recording one of his daily pizza reviews \u2014 a Barstool programming staple in which Portnoy tries to review every pizza joint in Manhattan. That day, his guest was Jake Paul, the 20-year-old YouTube heel who might be the only person on the internet better than Portnoy at turning hate and controversy into merchandising opportunities. \u201cPeople know I\u2019m a Jake Paul guy,\u201d Portnoy said. \u201cI respect people who take over the internet, and this guy has got maybe more haters than I do, which I also love.\u201d He ventured that \u201cif you put Team 10\u201d \u2014 the name of Paul\u2019s company \u2014 \u201cwith the Stoolies, I think we can bring down, like, the entire country.\u201d", "He was joking, but if companies like ESPN want to corral the millions of young people who have cut cable cords, turned off \u201cSportsCenter\u201d and flocked to unfiltered and anarchic internet personalities, they will have to reckon with Jake Pauls and Dave Portnoys. The truth about ESPN\u2019s supposed bias will not really matter: A lot of people, like Ives the intern, believe that the Worldwide Leader in Sports no longer speaks to them. Their grievances, like those of the angry men who fume over the female cast of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d or ethics in video-game journalism, will seem absurdly petty, whether they\u2019re complaining about the rare yet somehow oppressive sight of a female sportscaster or the unbearable burden placed upon their consciences by a two-minute conversation about Colin Kaepernick. But they will voice these grievances online with enough volume and vitriol to worry even the most reasonable media executive. And if that executive doesn\u2019t bend to their will, they will seek out someone, anyone, who feels more authentic to their experience, whatever that may mean. For huge media conglomerates, this dynamic might matter only in the margins; ESPN surely has more immediate business concerns. But gains in media right now occur only in the margins. The market inefficiencies will not be ignored.", "In his office, I asked Portnoy why he thought ESPN had been interested in partnering with Barstool in the first place, given its past. A half-smile crept over his face. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like that Batman quote,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a time of desperation, you turn to a man you don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/technology/personaltech/new-iphones-slow-tech-myth.html": ["It happens every year: Apple releases new iPhones, and then hordes of people groan about their older iPhones slowing to a crawl.", "Just look at the recent data.

Politics have apparently intruded on a transaction that until recently was considered relatively uncontroversial.", "Combining AT&T, which distributes digital content over its wireless networks, with a news and entertainment provider like Time Warner is what economists and antitrust experts consider a classic vertical merger. Because the companies don\u2019t compete, their combining would not alter the competitive landscape in either the telecommunications or entertainment industries.", "For more than 40 years, through Republican and Democratic administrations, the courts have not blocked a vertical integration like this one.", "Typically more problematic for the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division are horizontal mergers, where two competitors in the same industry seek to combine. But this past summer the Trump administration waved through the horizontal merger of the giant retailer Amazon, already active in food sales, with a leading upscale grocer, Whole Foods. To now block a vertical integration of AT&T and Time Warner would indicate an inexcusably scattershot approach to antitrust decisions that would create enormous uncertainties for the broader business community and shake public confidence in the rule of law that underpins our democracy.", "Businesses seek to integrate vertically because such mergers tend to create efficiencies and synergies \u2014 benefiting both companies without posing major risks to their competitors or, more crucially, to consumers. With all the options available to consumers for receiving video programming these days \u2014 including cable, satellite, internet broadband and smartphones \u2014 the market is vibrantly, almost chaotically, competitive and innovative. When viewed in light of this creative turmoil, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction does not pose a competitive threat.

It underscored the competitive new dynamics of the marketplace: Companies are throwing around cash like never before to attract viewers already happily distracted by an array of programming and viewing alternatives in this new golden age of television.", "Rather than Time Warner holding anything resembling a dominant position in the entertainment industry, it finds itself competing with emerging video powerhouses like Netflix and Amazon. And consumers are increasingly cutting the cable because they have numerous, often cheaper streaming options for getting content they want.", "This is the proper context for assessing AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner. The newly created entity would have no incentive to erect walls around its content. To the contrary, the fundamental goal of content distribution \u2014 maximizing the number of people who watch any given program \u2014 hasn\u2019t changed. Fears that AT&T might act to undermine competition by, for example, withholding prime content from competing distribution companies would make no business sense.", "How do we know? One need only look at perhaps the closest comparison to the AT&T-Time Warner merger \u2014 the marriage of the nation\u2019s largest cable and internet broadband provider, Comcast, to NBC Universal, which the Justice Department blessed in 2011. Despite the arguments of opponents at the time, there has been no negative impact to consumers or competitors. Quite the opposite \u2014 the competitive and creative forces that continue to change the industry have only accelerated since the Comcast-NBC merger.", "If the Justice Department cannot cite persuasive antitrust grounds for blocking the AT&T-Time Warner merger, the public will be left wondering whether political motives were involved or that the department\u2019s thinking was muddied by vague opposition to media consolidation. Neither of those reasons would likely stand up in federal court.", "By any objective analysis, the real power in the information industry these days is not in the wireless or entertainment industries.

I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 psychological warfare, the endless grim clashing of economic forces \u2014 but I am being literal. When we ponder America\u2019s defining war, the Revolution, we think of Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Lexington and Concord, yet its largest battle, a vast and ferociously fought chess match in August and September of 1776, right after the formal declaration of the colonies\u2019 independence, ranged over what are now the five boroughs. As to why the place was so hotly contested, you already know the answer. Then, as now, as ever, New York City was the center of it all. Both sides believed that if the British took control of New York and the Hudson River, the American resistance would likely collapse.", "The battle isn\u2019t as well known today as other encounters during the Revolution, in part because the city has done an excellent job of removing most traces of it. Where Boston sets aside hallowed historic precincts and wends a handsome brick Freedom Trail through its Revolutionary sites, New York City buries its past under mountains of concrete and steel. Hills have been flattened, islands swallowed up by landfill, shorelines redrawn.", "But I was determined to find Revolutionary New York, and I did eventually, after a fashion. It helped that I had an organizing principle. I was researching a book, and, since my book isn\u2019t about military strategy I wasn\u2019t trying to cover all of the complex maneuverings of troops. I write narrative history, which to me means focusing on people\u2019s lives. Getting to know the places in which those lives unfolded helps me in my efforts to get into the individuals\u2019 heads and hearts.", "The book tells the story of the founding era by following the interwoven stories of six people from the period, from birth to death. They include a Connecticut slave, a Seneca warrior, a British aristocrat and an Albany shoemaker. But it was because of the other two \u2014 a Virginia planter and the teenage daughter of a British officer \u2014 that I found myself going from subway to bus to ferry around the five boroughs, with old maps in one hand and Google Maps in the other. These two figures of 18th-century America were caught up in the mayhem of New York. They gave my journey through the city\u2019s past what I always crave when I write, research or travel: a personal angle.", "George Washington is everyone\u2019s touchstone for the Revolution, and I made him mine as well. To orient myself alongside the commander of the American Army in New York, I began at \u201cthe commons,\u201d now City Hall Park, joining municipal workers on the benches at lunch hour. On July 9, 1776, as British soldiers were gathering on Staten Island and preparing to attack Manhattan, Washington arrayed his troops here and had the newly minted Declaration of Independence read aloud to them. The men were so roused up they charged southward and pulled down the statue of King George at what is now Bowling Green. I hiked down to the same spot and stood there, surrounded by the skyscrapers of the Financial District. Washington was furious at the lack of discipline, but pleased at the men\u2019s ardor.", "The cheery mood of the troops ended abruptly. Walking a few blocks westward gave me a view of the Hudson River, where Washington was able to join the rest of the shocked town in observing two British warships race up the river with their guns blasting, sending cannonballs careering into the streets. It was a test of the American defenses; they failed.", "In truth, it was a harrowing situation for the would-be nation, and Washington was frankly uncertain of his ability. His military record was mixed, and most of his service had come two decades earlier, in the French and Indian War. Much of what he had learned of military leadership had been from a book. He was 44, burning with ambition but saddled with an inferiority complex due to his lack of formal education. He was learning on the fly.", "While he was trying to perform the impossible task of defending miles of shoreline, an odd diplomatic comedy ensued. The British wanted to negotiate, and officers arrived bearing letters intended for Washington. But the letters did not give the American commander his proper title. Washington knew how important protocol was, and refused to accept them.", "Then another letter arrived. Surprisingly, it was not addressed to Washington, but to a Miss Margaret Moncrieffe. She was the daughter of Major Thomas Moncrieffe, who had chosen to side with the British. The father was now on Staten Island, but Margaret was trapped behind enemy lines \u2014 i.e., in New York with the Americans \u2014 and Major Moncrieffe wanted Washington to deliver her over to him.", "I chose young Margaret Moncrieffe as one of my subjects in part because of this slender connection to Washington, in part because of the vibrancy of her personality, but most of all because as her life unfolded I saw her as embodying one aspect of the wider yearning for freedom that America\u2019s Revolution was a part of: the desire of women for some measure of independence. In the summer of 1776, Margaret was only 14, but she was about to reveal her nature by standing up to the most powerful man in America.", "Washington likely had no idea who this girl was when the letter arrived, but he soon found out. While standing in the little grassy teardrop of Bowling Green, I focused on one of the office buildings before me, 1 Broadway, and held up over it an engraving of the structure that had once stood on or about this same spot. That building had served as the American military headquarters. Here, in the midst of preparations for war, and following the collapse of peace negotiations, Washington hosted a formal dinner. A toast was offered to the Continental Congress, the gathering of representatives from the 13 colonies in Philadelphia. General Washington noticed that the girl at the table did not raise her glass. Margaret Moncrieffe had been invited to join the American officers while they decided what to do with her. Despite having partly grown up in the city, Margaret followed her father\u2019s loyalties and, like thousands of other New Yorkers, was rooting for the British. She now scandalized the gathering and personally affronted Washington by offering a counter toast, to Gen. William Howe, Washington\u2019s opposite on the British side.", "For a moment, the reserved and deeply formal commander of American forces faced off with an impudent and headstrong teenager. Then Washington ended the standoff with a bit of levity, promising to find a way to send the girl to her father on Staten Island, and asking that once there she offer a toast to the American commanders.", "Since the building at the foot of Manhattan was alive with military secrets, and seeing as this girl was both observant and openly disposed toward the enemy, Washington thought it prudent to send her away until arrangements could be made to transfer her to the British. She found herself shipped to one of the many fortifications the Americans had constructed, at Kingsbridge, in the Bronx, just opposite the northern tip of Manhattan.", "I went there too. From the 231st Street subway it was a steady uphill hike. The fort is gone, of course. In place of farms and military outposts I found Chinese takeouts and check-cashing outlets. Then I was met by a steep set of stairs \u2014 a step-street \u2014 flanked by a Kingsbridge Heights community art project: two painted trees.", "I climbed the trees \u2014 that is, I marched to the top of the steps. Up here, wedged between three avenues \u2014 Sedgewick, Reservoir and Webb \u2014 lies a scallop of a playground and a weedy strip of park. Part of it, emerging from an outcropping of schist, is called Washington\u2019s Walk. There\u2019s a plaque marking this as the location of one of the American defensive posts. Looking up from the plaque, I saw why the spot was chosen. You\u2019re high up. The expanse of sky is a surprise. Down below, the Jerome Park Reservoir, though man-made in 1906 and bound by land, reminds you of what these forts were for: monitoring the rivers for signs of the British Navy.", "Here young Margaret was meant to wait until diplomats could arrange for her to be reunited with her father. And here, improbably, she fell in love. None other than Aaron Burr, who at age 21 was already known as a ladies man, was stationed at Kingsbridge. The two young people apparently managed to find some time alone amid the soldiers and the gathering chaos, for Margaret later declared that Burr \u201csubdued my virgin heart.\u201d", "As a result, suddenly, she changed her mind. She had been desperate to reach her father, but now she didn\u2019t want to leave Burr. But the two enemy commands had made their arrangements. Against her will, she was rowed out into the Hudson River and southward, toward Staten Island.", "I followed her, on the Staten Island Ferry. When we were somewhere in the Upper Bay \u2014 past Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, the choppy green-brown water below as somber as death \u2014 I imagined the scene of her wobbly transfer from an American to a British boat, as two armies that were about to engage in a world-historic conflict paused to do this small human thing.", "From the terminal on Staten Island I marched uphill to Tompkinsville Park, which I understood roughly marked the place where the British Navy gathered as General Howe prepared to attack. It was a windswept little triangle of urban greenery, hemmed in by traffic, but with a bit of wandering I was able to get a view down onto the bay, which would have been crowded with naval vessels flying the British flag.", "Those ships, 400 of them, were now fully occupying Washington\u2019s mind. Where would Howe choose to strike? With no way of knowing, Washington strung his men out in a long, skinny line across six miles of Brooklyn and Manhattan shoreline.", "Then Howe moved: On Aug. 22, 22,000 British soldiers crossed from Staten Island more or less where the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge stands, hit the beach at Gravesend Bay in Brooklyn and began decimating the American forces.", "Washington stayed on Manhattan for a time, believing Howe would launch another strike there. Then from the East River shore he saw the signal lights of his men on Brooklyn Heights indicating that the whole British force was enveloping Brooklyn. He crossed the river.", "Cobble Hill is now the name of a neighborhood, but in the 18th century it was an actual hill. The Americans had built a fort atop it, and from here Washington oversaw the action to the south. The former bank building at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street sits where the hill stood. My plan was to get to the roof and give myself the same view Washington had. But the manager of the Trader Joe\u2019s that now occupies the building informed me that the staircase to the roof was unsafe. I tried piecing together Washington\u2019s view of the Battle of Brooklyn (which is also known as the Battle of Long Island) from the upper floors of the YMCA on Atlantic Avenue and the roof of a nearby apartment building.", "But that wasn\u2019t very satisfying, so I ended up plunging into the battle. I marched down Smith Street, past hipster lounges, juice bars and bagel shops, past Carroll Street with its little front gardens, and turned left on Third Street. The neighborhood became industrial, which somehow seemed more suitable for mentally recreating a battlefield.", "Crossing the Gowanus Canal, which then was a creek, I reached the center of the fighting. With the American forces in disarray, Gen. William Alexander made a stand here, in front of the stone farmhouse of Nicholas Vechte, leading a Maryland regiment in a furious counterattack that bought time for much of Washington\u2019s bedraggled army to retreat to Brooklyn Heights.", "Imagining the fight was made immensely more satisfying by virtue of the fact that the Old Stone House, a reconstruction of Vechte\u2019s farmhouse, stands snugly in the middle of Washington Park, at Third Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Parts of the original Dutch house, around which the fighting took place, were used in the 1933 reconstruction, and the building was moved across the park from where it originally stood, but it\u2019s still as evocative of the period as it is anomalous in the neighborhood.", "Even better, inside, the new permanent exhibition, which went up in 2016, is packed with interpretive displays. Most useful to me was a three-dimensional diorama that shows Brooklyn in its original hilly state. Even more challenging for me than mentally deleting the brownstones and office buildings from the landscape was appreciating its geography. The diorama makes clear why Washington decided to deploy his smaller army as he did, along a series of steep hills that ran between present-day Fulton Street and Eastern Parkway and south to Greenwood Heights. (Later I gave myself another sense of the original terrain by hiking the hills of Green-Wood Cemetery.)", "The Americans protected the passes between the hills, but the British found that the Jamaica Pass was unguarded and swarmed through. Washington then executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of the war, using fog and the cover of darkness to get 9,000 soldiers safely across the East River to Manhattan. I mirrored their retreat, taking the ferry from Pier Six to Wall Street, on what turned out to be an appropriately heavy, gray morning.", "The escape of the American Army stunned the British, and Howe, the victor in the battle, took his time regrouping and planning how he would conquer the city and finish off Washington\u2019s army.", "Washington, on the run, guessed that Howe would attack either in the south, directly on New York itself, or to the north, at Harlem. He placed an army at Corlears Hook, just north of the city, and chose the mansion of Roger Morris, a wealthy loyalist who had earlier fled the city, as his military headquarters. From here he studied maps, held court-martials and scanned the river below. The Morris-Jumel Mansion still exists, near West 160th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, and as a museum maintains its 18th-century decorum. Its revolutionary vibe was enough to draw, among others, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who lives in the same Washington Heights neighborhood; its operators allowed him to write part of \u201cHamilton\u201d in the mansion.", "From here, on Sept. 15, Washington heard cannon fire that told him his guesses at where Howe would attack were wrong. The explosions were coming from the south, as 9,000 men landed at Kips Bay, near where the United Nations now sits. The redcoats stormed across Manhattan. Washington fought a brilliant battle at Harlem Heights, but Howe took New York City. Washington\u2019s army retreated up the Hudson River, and eventually into New Jersey.", "Once the British had control of New York, the little city of 4,000 or so houses became, in effect, two cities: a place of stench and squalor, which had already endured much, and a genteel quarter that the British officers reserved for themselves and their families. Thus Margaret Moncrieffe made a triumphant return, and lived for a time in the center of Loyalist America. She attended the theater and danced at balls with officers, feeling for a short while that she had bested the great but stern American general with whom she had clashed.", "Washington was shaken to his core by the loss of New York, writing to his cousin, \u201cIf I were to wish the bitterest curse to an enemy on this side of the grave, I should put him in my stead with my feelings.\u201d", "But war, like life, involves many twists. Despite what both sides thought, the loss of New York would not mean the end of American resolve. Washington\u2019s side would win, and he would achieve all the honor he craved and more.

It\u2019s one of the most impressive eight seconds of film acting in recent years; with a single word, an actor pulls us into his character\u2019s anguished world.", "All actors play characters, of course, but only some are called \u201ccharacter actors.\u201d The term is contentious \u2014 performers rarely use it to describe their peers \u2014 yet it has persisted for more than a century. It first became common in 19th-century theater criticism to discuss actors who immersed themselves fully in their roles, often using realistic makeup to become unrecognizable. By the 1930s, the term had changed in Hollywood to refer to entertainers who played specific types: Walter Brennan as the leathery old codger, Ward Bond as the avuncular authority figure. \u201cMany character actors had created their archetypes in vaudeville or theater,\u201d says Bruce Goldstein, director of repertory programming at New York\u2019s Film Forum. \u201cHollywood was turning out so many movies that character actors allowed for a kind of shorthand \u2014 you didn\u2019t need a lot of exposition. It\u2019s why films of that era are so breezy.\u201d", "These men also injected a note of humanity into what would otherwise have been broad, even stock, roles. \u201cYou recognize something concrete in them,\u201d wrote the critic Gilbert Seldes in a 1934 Esquire essay, \u201cThe Itsy-Bitsy Actors.\u201d Unlike a movie\u2019s charismatic leads, character actors could be \u201crude, violent, ironic, mean, brutal and mocking. They say what the audience often feels.\u201d For this, they didn\u2019t go unnoticed \u2014 Brennan won three Best Supporting Actor Oscars from 1936 to 1940, a feat no actor has since matched. By the 1980s, the definition of a character actor again had shifted, this time to include supporting players who were familiar without being famous: people like Jon Polito, Vincent Schiavelli, Xander Berkeley. (Don\u2019t recognize their names? Google their faces.) Occasionally, if he stuck around long enough, a character actor became an institution unto himself; look no further than the tributes to Harry Dean Stanton \u2014 known for playing grizzled oddballs \u2014 when he died in September.", "NOW, THE CONCEPT of a character actor is changing once more. Over the past decade, a new kind of performer has risen, one defined by his skill and versatility. Men like Mendelsohn, J.K. Simmons, Don Cheadle, Michael Shannon and Andy Serkis are among the most prolific working artists today \u2014 in-demand and highly lauded \u2014 but they are the opposite of what character actors used to be: Instead of playing types, they are hired for their ability to play no type at all, to disappear into roles completely while at the same time imbuing their performances with something memorable; they are chameleons in the truest sense of that word. A character actor \u2014 as opposed to a celebrity \u2014 never plays himself, nor does he display his ego onscreen or accept the same kind of part year after year. Between them, these actors have taken on everything from a sadistic music teacher (Simmons in 2014\u2019s \u201cWhiplash,\u201d for which he won an Oscar) to a flamboyant bounty hunter (Mendelsohn in 2015\u2019s \u201cSlow West\u201d) to actual famous people (Shannon\u2019s Elvis Presley in 2016\u2019s \u201cElvis & Nixon\u201d) to famous fictional non-people (Serkis\u2019s Gollum in 2001-03\u2019s \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series). The weirder and more singular the role, the more unforgettable the actor stands to become.", "These performers may not be conventionally handsome, nor are they truly household names, but audiences increasingly seek them out, in parts large and small, in projects that vary from billion-dollar blockbusters to tiny, barely seen indies. Their talent (often grounded by early careers in theater) is matched by their ubiquity across platforms, from movies to television, to plays, to voice-over work for video games, even to the occasional insurance commercial. Hollywood has always run on journeymen, but it\u2019s these actors who have replaced movie stars as the essential human labor in cinema. That\u2019s because celebrities can no longer be monetized the way they had been in the past: \u201cMovie stars have become an endangered species,\u201d was how Peter Bart, a journalist and former Paramount executive, predicted this shift in a 2014 essay in Variety, noting that a performer\u2019s inherent adaptability was becoming more valuable \u2014 for the actor and the producers \u2014 than star power itself. Character actors, who take on several projects simultaneously and are therefore accustomed to building diversified careers, can still become successful even if some of those choices end up being blunders. \u201cHistorically, these guys have always been the workers,\u201d says Susan Shopmaker, a veteran casting director. \u201cWhen they\u2019re not pigeonholed, they can fit into lots of places.\u201d", "While there are many forces behind the rise of such performers, chief among them is the implosion of Hollywood\u2019s star system over the past two decades. The unchecked increase in movie-star salaries in the 1980s and 1990s led to a reckoning throughout the 2000s, as expensive talents like Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise and Eddie Murphy released films that vastly underperformed. Even Will Smith \u2014 once considered infallible \u2014 has struggled to achieve anything approaching the box-office triumphs of his mid-\u201990s heyday. Studios didn\u2019t respond to these deficits by cutting budgets, though; instead, they pursued increasingly extravagant franchises, many of which were engineered solely to manufacture new celebrities to replace the outdated models. These films varied in quality \u2014 some were admittedly entertaining \u2014 but they were formulaic when it came to plotting and casting.", "That uniformity, however, made it easier to market these movies to a global audience, so even the weakest entry in an established series could gross astronomical sums. (This year\u2019s example is \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,\u201d which opened to execrable reviews, but still earned $795 million worldwide.) And as franchises continued to dominate Hollywood, the financing for serious, midbudget dramas, the sort that enthrall critics and discerning audiences, decreased with each year, making it less likely that big stars would appear in them; they were too busy doing the work of becoming global celebrities. Instead, it was the character actors, men like William H. Macy and Paul Giamatti, who took their places. Such actors \u201chave more control, in terms of being creative and pursuing fulfilling work,\u201d Shopmaker says, \u201crather than worrying about whether projects are big enough for their careers.\u201d As the nature of celebrity changed, so too did the domestic definition of a movie star.", "OVER THE COURSE OF this great fragmentation in the film industry \u2014 a system increasingly divided between major-studio blockbusters that are announced a decade in advance at shareholder meetings and tiny indies that often disappear after a week in theaters \u2014 character actors have only moved further into the mainstream. In lower-budget projects, they are cast in complicated leading roles that win them acclaim; in mega-films (especially superhero ones), they are relied upon for their ability to bring soul to underwritten, potentially clich\u00e9d parts: Cheadle is mesmerizing in what is essentially a glorified sidekick role in this decade\u2019s Marvel \u201cAvengers\u201d films; Mendelsohn brought a uniquely weasel-like quality to the one-dimensional villain of 2016\u2019s \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u2019; Shannon was unusually stirring as the nutty interplanetary invader General Zod in 2013\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d In an era in which the authentic \u2014 in food, in fashion, in social media \u2014 feels increasingly elusive, these men, all of whom have been working for decades, don\u2019t feel fake (Hollywood\u2019s favorite epithet), but slow-grown and purposeful. Especially when compared to those we call \u201cleading men,\u201d beautiful vessels who all compete for the same few superlative parts, yet seem more na\u00efve and distant from reality with each passing role.", "Indeed, what truly defines a character actor is that he \u201cmakes the person he plays feel approachable,\u201d says Avy Kaufman, the casting director of \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi.\u201d (Stars, by contrast, are never approachable: Even when they play imperfect people, there\u2019s something perfect about them.) And in the absence of new models in Hollywood, audiences and critics alike have anointed these character actors as the emotional anchors of an otherwise mundane two hours. That holds true even when they aren\u2019t playing actual humans: In Andy Serkis\u2019s motion-capture performance as Caesar, the simian protagonist of this decade\u2019s \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d series, he is completely transformed into an ape using CGI. But Serkis makes Caesar\u2019s conflict \u2014 his rage toward humans versus his need to preserve his tribe \u2014 terrifyingly real.", "There\u2019s one other reason character actors are ascendant right now: When Hollywood stopped producing scripts of real merit, veteran filmmakers and screenwriters began making \u201cprestige\u201d television, which inadvertently became a training ground for these actors, much as theater once was. \u201cI like to say that television is about character and movies are about story,\u201d says Keith Gordon, an \u201980s-era character actor who now directs television, including \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d \u201cWith a film, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 With a TV show, you ask, \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to this character I like?\u2019\u2009\u201d Only great actors \u2014 those like Mendelsohn, who won a Lead Actor Emmy last year for his role in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBloodline\u201d \u2014 can bring the required depth to roles that are meant to encourage binge-watching: hours, if not days, spent with a character (and a person) who must be compelling enough to sustain the audience\u2019s interest and emotional engagement.", "Perhaps this isn\u2019t so different from The Itsy-Bitsy Actors that Seldes eulogized almost a century ago. They, too, had the ability to break through the confines of the screen to present feelings that were recognizably human. Yet those original character actors offered a brief respite from the uniformity of Hollywood\u2019s dream machine \u2014 they supported the stars, helped them tell their stories. Today, it\u2019s the character actors who viewers remember long after the rest has faded to black.

The day before, Etsy had fired 80 people, the first big layoffs at the online marketplace for handmade and vintage arts and crafts. Among those ousted was Etsy\u2019s beloved chief executive of six years, Chad Dickerson.", "Now Mr. Silverman \u2014 an Etsy board member but an unknown to most employees \u2014 stood in the Etsytorium, trying to win over a hostile crowd. His earnest introduction was an olive branch of sorts, an effort to signal that he was attuned to Etsy\u2019s vibrant gay and transgender community, and would be respectful of the company\u2019s distinctive culture. But to many in attendance, his remarks came off as tone deaf, and his inability to read the room foreshadowed sweeping changes that would soon transform Etsy.", "The drama began last November, when Mr. Silverman joined the Etsy board and began asking tough questions of management. Soon after that, an activist investor took a stake in Etsy and called for the sale of the company. Then powerful private equity firms began buying shares, stoking fears of a takeover. The board was under pressure, and in early May abruptly fired Mr. Dickerson and installed Mr. Silverman.", "On the same day as the chief executive changeover, the company announced its first layoffs. Within weeks of assuming control, Mr. Silverman shut down several projects that had been in the works for months. Not long after that, he fired another 140 employees.", "It was a dizzying series of events at a company that has long held itself up as a paragon of righteous business practices. Etsy\u2019s founders believed its business model \u2014 helping mostly female entrepreneurs make a living online \u2014 was inherently just. Employees shared their emotions freely, often crying at the office. Perks included generous paid parental leave, free organic food and a pet-friendly workplace. Etsy was certified as a B Corp by a nonprofit called B Lab, denoting its particularly high social and environmental standards.", "But once Etsy went public in 2015, it was evaluated just like any other company traded on the stock market. By late last year, expenses were growing fast. And even as the company reported $88 million in revenues during the third quarter, it posted a net loss of $2.5 million. After a few quarters of tepid results, investors grew impatient and a classic clash of corporate governance came spilling into view \u2014 how would a company like Etsy balance the short-term demands of its shareholders with its high-minded long-term mission?", "By some important metrics, Etsy appears to be improving under Mr. Silverman\u2019s leadership. Revenues are up, as are \u201cgross merchandise sales\u201d \u2014 the total value of goods being sold on Etsy. The company\u2019s stock has risen about 50 percent in the six months since he took over.", "By other measures, however, Etsy is barely recognizable. The \u201cValues-Aligned Business\u201d team, which oversaw the company\u2019s social and environmental efforts, was dismantled. A new focus on profitability has sapped many employees of their enthusiasm. A workplace that once encouraged workers to express their feelings has clammed up. Etsy is no longer a B Corp.", "Today, as Mr. Silverman continues to push for change and investors keep close watch on the stock, what\u2019s most frustrating to some close observers of the company is that Etsy seems to have given up so much to gain so little.", "\u201cEtsy had the potential to be one of the truly great ones,\u201d said Matt Stinchcomb, an early employee who now runs the Good Work Institute, which was originally an Etsy charitable foundation before being spun off last year. \u201cBut it looks like they are cutting anything that\u2019s not essential to the business. This is a cautionary tale of capitalism.\u201d", "Etsy was founded in 2005 by a group of friends including Robert Kalin, an amateur furniture maker who was looking for a better way to sell his goods online. To explain the power of Etsy\u2019s community of buyers and sellers, Mr. Kalin often read aloud from a children\u2019s book, Swimmy, which is about a school of fish finding strength in numbers. Mr. Kalin became the chief executive, and his sensitive affect set the tone for the company culture.", "Makers and crafts enthusiasts flocked to the site, grateful that there was somewhere besides eBay and Amazon where they could buy and sell jewelry, furniture and clothing online. Abby Glassenberg was one of the site\u2019s first sellers, using it to find a market for her handmade stuffed animals, and has chronicled Etsy over the years with her popular blog and podcast. \u201cAt this point it was really hard to sell online,\u201d she said. \u201cEtsy was a godsend.\u201d", "As Etsy grew, it eschewed traditional corporate customs in favor of a more freewheeling approach. Building consensus was more important than moving fast. Employees believed Etsy could be equally beneficial to buyers, sellers, staff and the planet. The idealism was infectious, and many people turned down higher salaries from other companies to work for Etsy.", "Yet for all its efforts to stand apart, Etsy followed the established playbook when it came to financing its growth. Venture capitalists poured some $85 million into the company, making a takeover or initial public offering all but inevitable.", "In 2011, the board decided to replace Mr. Kalin with Mr. Dickerson, who was then the chief technology officer. As C.E.O., Mr. Dickerson oversaw dramatic growth. When he took Etsy public in 2015, the company had 1.4 million active sellers, nearly 20 million buyers and had gross merchandise sales of $2 billion a year.", "True to form, Etsy found ways to make its initial public offering inclusive. It marketed shares to small investors and Etsy sellers and tried to concentrate shares in a smaller than usual number of institutional holders. Besides upholding the company\u2019s egalitarian ethos, the effort had a strategic rationale. The hope was that such a shareholder base might insulate Etsy from some of the short-term pressures of the stock market.", "It didn\u2019t work. In the first nine months after the offering, the stock fell 75 percent. Etsy was still spending heavily on growth and marketing, and while revenues were up in early quarters, the company was unprofitable. Insiders were selling shares, creating more supply than demand for the stock. It didn\u2019t help that Amazon launched a competing vertical, Handmade at Amazon.", "Yet even as Etsy grew to number more than 1,000 staffers, the company\u2019s unorthodox culture survived. Mr. Dickerson held weekly \u201cOffice Hours,\u201d when any employee could ask him about anything, and spoke openly about his doubts, admitting when he didn\u2019t know the answer to a question.", "Etsy became a B Corp in 2012, completing a certification process that put the company on par with Patagonia and Ben & Jerry\u2019s in terms of social and environmental bona fides. Meditation and yoga classes were offered during the workday. Companywide meetings, known as \u201cY\u2019all Hands,\u201d featured musical performances by employees. New mothers and fathers got six months of fully paid parental leave. The company moved into an old Jehovah\u2019s Witness building in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn, giving it an eco-friendly face-lift. Men and women shared bathrooms, which were adorned with signs that read \u201cwe believe that gender is not binary.\u201d", "The emotional, individualistic culture had its drawbacks. The emphasis on go-it-alone craftsmanship meant Etsy managed its own data centers, instead of using more efficient options like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. With everyone empowered to express themselves, there was a lot of sharing going on. Inboxes were stuffed with unnecessary emails, which dragged on productivity.", "On Nov. 15, 2016, with little fanfare, Josh Silverman joined the Etsy board. Mr. Silverman had been a senior executive at eBay and chief executive of Skype. After leaving an executive role at American Express in 2015, Mr. Silverman, who is now 48, said he wanted to take on one more big job, but was waiting for the right opportunity. \u201cI was patient and picky,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was my keystone.\u201d", "Mr. Silverman said he came to his first board meeting prepared to listen. But in the Etsy boardroom, seated around a large custom-made table featuring gold inlay, a large owl sculpture looming over the directors, he said he was troubled by what he heard from Mr. Dickerson. Expenses were growing faster than revenues. Sales on the site were up, but the rate of growth was slowing.", "As Mr. Dickerson tried to move the meeting on to topics including international expansion, Mr. Silverman spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re big at all,\u201d he told the board. \u201cWe\u2019re at the early stages.\u201d", "Mr. Silverman pressed Mr. Dickerson to get more aggressive about the rate of growth, and called for a renewed focus on increasing sales. Privately, he came away concerned about the company\u2019s trajectory. \u201cThere was not a sense of crisis,\u201d Mr. Silverman said.", "Senior employees at the company during this period say that Mr. Dickerson was already pressing the team to accelerate the rate of sales growth, and that he had encouraged employees to read \u201cA Sense of Urgency,\u201d a management book by John Kotter.", "In March, things got worse for Mr. Dickerson. Black and White Capital, a small hedge fund, took a stake in Etsy and sent a private letter to the board, saying it was insufficiently focused on sales growth, that operations were inefficient, and that the company should \u201cexplore strategic alternatives\u201d \u2014 a euphemism for selling the company. Soon after that, TPG and Dragoneer, two powerful private equity firms, bought into the company\u2019s stock. Among members of the board, a consensus emerged that Mr. Dickerson had to go.", "\u201cThe house was burning and nobody was paying attention,\u201d said Fred Wilson, the co-founder of Union Square Ventures, which was an early investor in Etsy, and the board chairman. \u201cChad got the company about as far as he was going to get it. We needed somebody to take it to the next level.\u201d", "Instead of the soft skills that Mr. Dickerson brought, the board wanted someone with experience in marketing, software and e-commerce, someone who was comfortable at a big public company. In other words, someone like Mr. Silverman.", "At 4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 2, Mr. Dickerson called an emergency meeting in the Etsytorium, a cavernous conference room inside headquarters. Usually a loose public speaker, Mr. Dickerson read from a script, his voice shaking as he made an announcement: He was laying off 80 employees \u2014 the largest cuts in Etsy\u2019s history. And, he said, he had been fired by the board.", "Mr. Dickerson broke into tears, and sat down to steady himself. Many in the audience openly wept.", "Mr. Dickerson had learned that he was being replaced only days earlier, and his termination was effective immediately. Even by the unsentimental standards of corporate America, it was an abrupt transition. That night, a large contingent went drinking at local beer garden.", "The next morning, Mr. Dickerson, Mr. Silverman and Mr. Wilson all addressed the company. Mr. Dickerson told the crowd he was hung over. Mr. Wilson made some perfunctory remarks. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame anyone for this decision, I want you to blame me,\u201d he said.", "Finally, Mr. Silverman took the microphone, addressing his new staff for the first time. After introducing himself (and noting his gender), Mr. Silverman spoke about his background and experience. He said he wanted to preserve what was best about Etsy and help the company grow.", "When he began taking questions, the room turned hostile.", "\u201cYesterday felt impersonal, unempathetic and decidedly un-Etsy,\u201d the first employee said, according to a recording of the meeting. \u201cWhat is the new leadership planning to do to earn our trust and maintain the empathetic and human culture that is the entire reason that many of us chose to work here?\u201d", "\u201cTrust is earned, not granted,\u201d Mr. Silverman replied. \u201cKeep an open mind, and we\u2019ll get to know each other.\u201d", "Employees saw Mr. Dickerson one last time. The next Friday, he came back to the office to give a Last Lecture, a traditional Etsy send-off. Mr. Dickerson spoke openly about his personal life and his time with Etsy. Everybody cried.", "Mr. Silverman wasted no time making changes. His sole focus, he said, was speeding up the pace of sales growth.", "He identified 30 projects that had the best chance of boosting sales on the site. Etsy began giving buyers more assurances, telling them that it didn\u2019t share credit card information with sellers, and that the company would refund their purchases if something went wrong. It began encouraging sellers to compare prices before listing an item. And for the first time, Etsy is running sales and promoting the holidays. Each of these changes, Mr. Silverman said, resulted in modest but measurable sales increases.", "Not everything worked. A move to display all-inclusive pricing, instead of the cost of the good and shipping separately, hurt sales and upset sellers. And a new way of displaying search filters didn\u2019t move the needle. \u201cMore than half of the things we try don\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying things.\u201d", "Other projects were shut down. Etsy Studio, a new marketplace for arts and crafts supplies that had consumed significant resources, was sidelined. Plans for further international expansion were put on hold. A marketing campaign was scrapped.", "At the same time, Mr. Silverman began redrawing what he said was a convoluted organizational chart. Too many people were managers, he said, and too many managers had too few reports. On June 21, less than two months after taking over, Mr. Silverman announced another, larger round of layoffs.", "Despite the tumult, Mr. Silverman said progress was being made as small tweaks to the site began to pay off. \u201cWe subtracted people and we\u2019re getting a lot more done,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more focus, a lot more urgency.\u201d", "Several current Etsy employees said they appreciated a new sense of direction and accountability, and that the company was becoming more innovative. \u201cThe tolerance for risk has gone up significantly,\u201d said Linda Kozlowski, the chief operating officer. \u201cThere\u2019s been a cultural shift of accountability in a good way.\u201d", "With sales up, Etsy is highlighting successful sellers with a series of videos. But not all users are happy. For years, sellers and buyers have complained that as Etsy has grown more popular, mass-produced goods have flooded the site, making it harder to find handmade items, and harder for sellers to make a living.", "\u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to mimic eBay and Amazon,\u201d said Amy Stringer-Mowat, co-founder of American Heirloom, a Brooklyn company that makes customized bamboo cutting boards. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bite the hand that feeds you, but that\u2019s the best way to describe how I feel about what\u2019s going on.\u201d", "Ms. Stringer-Mowat\u2019s company got started on Etsy, but she said sales on the site have slumped in recent months. She stopped hearing from Etsy employees in the marketing department who had helped her promote her business, and she said Etsy was pressuring her to offer cheaper shipping rates, which cuts into her profits.", "\u201cI\u2019ve seen Etsy through all these changes,\u201d said Ms. Glassenberg, who has noted a dramatic change in tone from the company on her blog. \u201cAnd for the first time, I\u2019m worried.\u201d", "Inside Etsy, Mr. Silverman\u2019s reorganization has upended parts of the company once considered sacrosanct. Last month, Etsy changed its mission statement. Gone was a verbose commitment \u201cto reimagine commerce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world.\u201d Instead, the mission was reduced to just three words, \u201cKeep commerce human,\u201d accompanied by a spreadsheet outlining its goals for economic, social and ecological impact. And because remaining a B Corp would require the company to change its legal standing in Delaware, where it is incorporated, Etsy will let that certification lapse.", "Mr. Silverman insists Etsy is still a mission-driven company. Many of the perks remain in place, and the company is lobbying in Washington, including for the protection of net neutrality. But Mr. Silverman says Etsy\u2019s greatest potential for impact is helping sellers \u2014 many of whom are women running small businesses \u2014 increase their sales. \u201cThe company had the best of intentions, but wasn\u2019t great at tying that to impact,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cBeing good doesn\u2019t cut the mustard.\u201d", "On Glassdoor, the career reviews website, Etsy\u2019s overall company rating has declined sharply since May. Many of the anonymous reviews portray a company in decline. After The New York Times asked Etsy about the ratings, a member of the human relations team asked employees to talk up the company on Glassdoor. In a matter of days, several new glowing reviews appeared with titles like \u201cWhy I love Etsy.\u201d", "On the afternoon of Nov. 6, Etsy reported strong quarterly earnings. Sales, revenues and adjusted profits were all up. In after-hours trading, Etsy shares spiked. When the markets opened the next morning, however, the stock slumped. The results, fine as they were, were not good enough.", "Three days later, Mr. Silverman was back in the Etsytorium, addressing his staff. The quarter was proof that changes to the company were paying off, he said, suggesting that the tumult of the past six months had not been in vain. \u201cThe quarter that we just reported, that you all worked so hard to deliver, means so much to Etsy and to all the people who rely on us,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cI\u2019m super fired up.\u201d", "Etsy will likely grow with Mr. Silverman as chief executive, but it may never again be the sensitive community fostered by Mr. Kalin and nurtured by Mr. Dickerson. Once a beacon of socially responsible business practices with a starry-eyed work force that believed it could fundamentally reimagine commerce, Etsy has over the past year become a case study in how the short-term pressures of the stock market can transform even the most idealistic of companies.", "\u201cThere\u2019s only so much wiggle room as a public company,\u201d said Mr. Stinchcomb, the early employee. \u201cIf you really want to build a company that works for people and the planet, capitalism isn\u2019t the solution.\u201d", "Mr. Wilson, the chairman of the board, dismisses that as sentimental hooey.", "\u201cTo all the people who say taking Etsy public was a mistake, I say that\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201c There are some people who will say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s not right for me.

So the F.C.C. opted to regulate broadband service as a utility \u2014 making the internet the digital equivalent of electricity and the telephone.", "The major broadband and telecom companies like AT&T and Comcast have argued that utility-style regulation represents unnecessary government meddling that will reduce their incentives to invest and improve service.

In her book, Ms. Comella argues that, absent the early feminist sex educators and entrepreneurs behind such enlightened sex toy shops as Good Vibrations in San Francisco, success would have been less probable for a mainstream manufacturer like Doc Johnson, whose products are now sold by 7,500 brick-and-mortar stores throughout the United States, on sex-oriented sites like PinkCherry and Lovehoney, and, increasingly, by mass-market retailers.", "Unwittingly or not, the \u201cfeminist trend of educating women about their bodies, about their clitorises, about vibrators as a tool of self-empowerment,\u201d Ms. Comella said, ultimately benefited the sex toy business by altering cultural perceptions of it and initiating its migration from XXX bookshops to Walmart, Amazon and Target.", "Certainly it is hard to imagine that, without the sex-positive credos advanced by female proprietors of early sex toy shops like Good Vibrations, Eve\u2019s Garden and Babeland, Charlotte York\u2019s famous Rabbit episode in Season 1 of \u201cSex and the City\u201d would have become part of the cultural conversation, let alone \u201cToyz,\u201d Missy Elliott\u2019s ribald 2003 paean to self-sufficiency, or Abbi Abrams, a character on \u201cBroad City,\u201d and her celebrated strap-on.", "The success of a \u201cBroad City\u201d plotline involving anal penetration of a more-than-willing male partner by the character portrayed by the show\u2019s co-creator Abbi Jacobson would ultimately inspire Comedy Central, which broadcasts the show, to introduce its own line of plugs and gadgets, most notably, perhaps, a Pegasus Pegging Kit.", "And it underscored an observation made recently by Susan Colvin, a former college instructor turned sex toy manufacturer. \u201cThe younger generation doesn\u2019t have as many hang-ups as ours did,\u201d said Ms. Colvin, whose California-based CalExotics was founded in the 1970s and was responsible for introducing early innovations like vibrators in Easter egg colors, a notion first put forward by Ms. Colvin\u2019s all-female development team.", "\u201cIt used to be, \u2018Gee, I\u2019m a man, why would you need any of that?\u2019\u201d Ms. Colvin said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the woman doing the consuming, and it\u2019s not so intimidating for a partner when she introduces a toy into a relationship.\u201d", "As seemingly everywhere else in the culture, it is a millennial generation that is leading the charge in mainstream acceptance of a business few still associate with its back-alley beginnings.", "\u201cSometimes even people in the industry for decades don\u2019t realize how accepted sex toys now are,\u201d said Erica Braverman, the marketing director at Doc Johnson.", "As an example, Ms. Braverman cited the pop-up Doc Johnson sponsored last month at the Think Tank gallery in Downtown Los Angeles in collaboration with the artist Whitney Bell.

But this counterintuitive behavior is what allows them to perform calculations at rate that would not be possible on a typical computer.", "Today\u2019s computers store information as \u201cbits,\u201d with each transistor holding either a 1 or a 0. But thanks to something called the superposition principle \u2014 behavior exhibited by subatomic particles like electrons and photons, the fundamental particles of light \u2014 a quantum bit, or \u201cqubit,\u201d can store a 1 and a 0 at the same time. This means two qubits can hold four values at once. As you expand the number of qubits, the machine becomes exponentially more powerful.", "Todd Holmdahl, who oversees the quantum project at Microsoft, said he envisioned a quantum computer as something that could instantly find its way through a maze. \u201cA typical computer will try one path and get blocked and then try another and another and another,\u201d he said. \u201cA quantum computer can try all paths at the same time.\u201d", "The trouble is that storing information in a quantum system for more than a short amount of time is very difficult, and this short \u201ccoherence time\u201d leads to errors in calculations. But over the past two decades, Mr. Schoelkopf and other physicists have worked to solve this problem using what are called superconducting circuits. They have built qubits from materials that exhibit quantum properties when cooled to extremely low temperatures.", "With this technique, they have shown that, every three years or so, they can improve coherence times by a factor of 10. This is known as Schoelkopf\u2019s Law, a playful ode to Moore\u2019s Law, the rule that says the number of transistors on computer chips will double every two years.", "\u201cSchoelkopf\u2019s Law started as a joke, but now we use it in many of our research papers,\u201d said Isaac Chuang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cNo one expected this would be possible, but the improvement has been exponential.\u201d", "These superconducting circuits have become the primary area of quantum computing research across the industry.

With so much at stake, it is no surprise that so many companies are betting on this technology, including start-ups like Quantum Circuits.", "The deck is stacked against the smaller players, because the big-name companies have so much more money to throw at the problem.

The troublemakers,\u201d it begins before concluding, \u201cBecause the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.\u201d", "To be fair, the conflict in visions is less stark than it seems because the two authors are focused on different time periods. \u201cTroublemakers\u201d covers \u201cthe generational handoff\u201d that happened between the late 1960s and the early \u201980s \u201cas pioneers of the semiconductor industry passed the baton to younger up-and-comers.\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s ire primarily targets those \u201cwho helped nurture the World Wide Web to prosperity in the 1990s before turning to investing.\u201d", "One does not have to be sympathetic to a more benign view of the technology industry to appreciate Ms. Berlin\u2019s deeply researched and dramatic narrative of Silicon Valley\u2019s early years in \u201cTroublemakers.\u201d To tell this story, she selects seven lesser-known but influential figures to follow closely throughout that period. These include the first woman to take a technology company public, the first chairman of Apple, and a man who played critical roles in government to create the internet and in industry to commercialize it through the personal computer. Their names will most likely be unfamiliar, but their meticulously told stories permit the reader to gain a nuanced understanding of the emergence of the broader technology ecosystem that has enabled Silicon Valley to thrive.", "Nuance is not a word that comes to mind in reading Mr. Cohen\u2019s attack on Silicon Valley\u2019s powers that be. The first two chapters are devoted to key figures in the history of Stanford\u2019s administration and computer science department, emphasizing both the university\u2019s willingness to trade off academic rigor for financial gain and its institutional sympathy for eugenics in the early 1900s and, more recently, extreme libertarianism. These underlying themes, in Mr. Cohen\u2019s view, underpin \u201cthe Stanford model of integrating the hacker and the entrepreneur.\u201d This model is reflected in staking William Hewlett and David Packard in the 1930s, establishing the Stanford Industrial Park in the 1950s and obtaining a $336 million payout from Google stock in return for granting the exclusive PageRank license.", "It is this unholy alliance between hacker and entrepreneur values that Mr. Cohen rails against for the balance of the book.

All are found guilty of either always promoting the insidious tech dogma that places no constraints on their ability to disrupt the status quo for their own financial gain or \u2014 as in the case of the once idealistic founders of Google and Facebook \u2014 having along the way been \u201cseduced by the power and money offered by venture capitalists.\u201d", "The history that underpins that overarching thesis feels both selective and less than rigorous. Niels Reimers, the founder of Stanford\u2019s Office of Technology Licensing and one of the seven key industry figures profiled in detail in \u201cTroublemakers,\u201d is not even mentioned in \u201cThe-Know-It-Alls.\u201d Given the complex negotiations required to secure university approval, this seems like a significant oversight for a book whose thesis hinges in part on Stanford\u2019s supposed unthinking commercialism. And statements like computer science was \u201cstill something of an obscure discipline in the late 1980s\u201d just don\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. By 1990, there were almost 800 computer science degree programs offered at colleges and universities, enrolling tens of thousands of students.", "Although Mr. Cohen has identified legitimately disturbing aspects of the tech culture, he becomes repetitive, and his tone is unnecessarily conspiratorial. He also ignores when the facts contradict his assertions. Mr. Cohen complains about the \u201cPayPal mafia,\u201d former employees who \u201cprovided each other with cash, counsel and contacts.\u201d Mr. Cohen finds \u201csomething jarring about a group of self-styled survival of the fittest free marketeers committing to a strategy of collective risk and mutual support.\u201d", "When the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales is profiled as a contrast to the libertarian fanaticism and raw commercialism of the Know-It-Alls, his inability to raise funding is used to reinforce this point: \u201cWales and his partners had no rich friends to lean on in tough times.\u201d The narrative makes clear, however, that his problem was a flawed business model, not his lack of access to the PayPal mafia or other venture investors. Similarly, Mr. Cohen does not directly confront the irony that the story of Wikipedia\u2019s ultimate success was made possible only by its free-riding on Google\u2019s powerful \u2014 but in his view morally suspect \u2014 search engine.", "The tech industry has earned a takedown book that documents its self-interested justifications for any number of policies that are clearly not in the public interest. Its track record on matters including cybersecurity, gender equality and privacy is shameful. The brief profiles of \u201cThe Know-It Alls,\u201d sprinkled with gratuitous ad hominem observations (for example, Mr. Cohen writes that PayPal is responsible for \u201creleasing into the wild a self-satisfied Peter Thiel, a one-man wrecking crew who has been sowing chaos through American society up to this very day\u201d), do not get the job done.", "Given the profound impact on our lives of the technology industry and the apparent flaws in its current culture, both books leave the reader wondering where to go from here. \u201cThe Know-It-Alls\u201d suggests that \u201cEurope provides a model\u201d relying on extensive regulation but, given the absence of any European tech giants of note, this seems like throwing the baby out with the bath water. Although the compelling history in \u201cTroublemakers\u201d provides a number of tantalizing clues as to where things got off track, this is not the focus of the book. Ms. Berlin does not whitewash the aspects of even the valley\u2019s early years that foreshadow the more profound cultural issues to emerge in the industry\u2019s middle age, writing, \u201cIt takes a certain kind of audacity to think you can launch a company, much less invent an industry \u2014 and audacity often veers into arrogance.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to explore their implications, either.", "When the founding of Fairchild Semiconductor is discussed, William Shockley is mentioned in passing, but Ms. Berlin notes that he \u201chad not yet fully descended into the paranoia and eugenic fervor that would later mar his reputation.\u201d In fact, his paranoia and abusiveness at least were already well known and, given that these qualities have been recurring contemporary industry themes, would have been worth examining.", "Similarly, when it\u2019s noted that a key to the venture capitalist Don Valentine\u2019s success was his willingness to overlook \u201cdeviant\u201d behavior, some discussion of the downside of letting the hacker culture run wild might have made sense.", "Silicon Valley\u2019s history is still being written.

There\u2019s a logic to this: The company is a video streaming service, after all. Hardly anybody complains that HBO doesn\u2019t release its films theatrically.

An interlude in which Cole is pursued by the high school quarterback is long and aimless, and Cole\u2019s alliance with a more age-appropriate classmate to vanquish the devil worshipers is tepid.

Spoiler alert: Since the sequel takes up where the 2014 original, \u201cCreep,\u201d ended, it begins with Mark Duplass playing the same serial killer as before. The hook in both pictures, very appropriate for postmodern microbudget filmmaking, is that this killer attracts his victims by soliciting for videographers on Craigslist. The twist here, if it can be called that, is that Mr. Duplass\u2019s serial killer admits right off to the failed webcaster Sara (Desiree Akhavan) that he\u2019s a murderer. He wants the video he\u2019s commissioned to be his testament. Pairing male serial killer with female videographer might generate some tensions beyond the usual, and indeed, Mr. Duplass\u2019s character gets buck naked in front of Sara\u2019s camera in the first step of what he deems a trust-building exercise. But this movie generates most of its shocks the same way the first one did: via use of a deliberately clunky subjective camera, in front of which Mr. Duplass will periodically jump from behind a door or a corner and scream \u201cBoo!\u201d or some variant thereof.

Manipulating his teenage son\u2019s resentments, he enlists the boy in the homicide. Things get worse from there, with hallucinations (or are they?) of the walking dead and lots of rats.", "The film, directed by Zak Hilditch from his own screenplay, is a handsome-looking production that\u2019s sunk almost immediately by its practically reflexive devotion to cornpone clich\u00e9.

She was 15 years old, touring France on a prep-school summer program, and out to lunch at La Pyramide, a \u201ctriple-\u00e9toile establishment\u201d that her father had told her was \u201cthe best restaurant in the world.\u201d Fadiman was determined to develop a taste for the Burgundy and Bordeaux her father treasured \u2014 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be my father\u2019s daughter if I didn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 and, over a 10-course tasting menu, consumed more than her fair share of a 1962 Brut Cr\u00e9mant sparkling wine. It was a thrill-less indulgence: She drank not because she enjoyed the wine (it just made her dizzy), but because she worried about her chauffeur. The more she sipped, the less she left for her companion \u2014 the director of her study abroad program, who tended to speed his Mercedes through two-way passing lanes.", "This early experience foreshadowed the relationship the adult Fadiman would forever have with wine: Available to her in both quantity and quality, drink has always been dominated by her father\u2019s high expectations, and she partakes first and foremost out of a sense of dutiful obligation.", "Despite her persistent indifference to wine, Fadiman embraces it as a means of tracing her and her father\u2019s lives in \u201cThe Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which doubles as both a memoir and a biography of the writer and oenophile Clifton Fadiman. It is a testament to the author\u2019s idyllic upbringing that her primary conflict with her father arises from her failure to savor as he does a Cabernet Sauvignon or Pinot Noir \u2014 even though doing so \u201cwould have made my father really, really happy.\u201d", "But \u201cThe Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter\u201d is also a portrait of a more complicated relationship: her father\u2019s infatuation with the bottles he fastidiously collected and poured nightly from his crystal decanter. Fadiman\u2019s prior work has established her as a talented anthropologist; her 1997 book, \u201cThe Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,\u201d a daringly in-depth profile of a Hmong refugee family she\u2019d met in California nearly a decade earlier, won the National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction. Turning her keen powers of observation to her father\u2019s love of wine, Fadiman delivers an illuminating and nuanced case study in connoisseurship that probes the dazzling hedonism and gnawing anxieties that fuel an obsession with fermented grape juice.", "The Fadimans\u2019 lives unfold through wine-themed vignettes centered on feasts and parties in posh dining rooms \u2014 settings preferred by Clifton Fadiman, who considered pizza, lunch counters and \u201cwaitresses who used \u2018au jus\u2019 as a noun instead of a prepositional phrase\u201d intolerably \u201cvulgar.\u201d Fadiman traces this disdain back to her father\u2019s lower-middle-class childhood in Brooklyn. The son of Eastern European Jews who operated unsuccessful drugstores, he quickly concluded that \u201cthings were run by people who spoke well and who were not Jewish, not poor and not ugly.\u201d When he enrolled at Columbia, he set about refashioning himself from what his daughter calls a \u201cmeatball\u201d into \u201cfoie gras\u201d \u2014 something closer to the rich, private-school-educated WASPs who ran things. Wine, along with a cultivated accent \u201cso impeccable no one actually spoke that way except other people from Brooklyn who wished to sound as if they weren\u2019t,\u201d became indispensable accessories; he toasted early career milestones by splurging on Burgundy \u2014 evidence of his ascent to his adopted milieu. (Presuming readers are familiar with her father, the author waits until Chapter 8 to explain that he was a \u201ccelebrated multihyphenate\u201d \u2014 an essayist-columnist-radio-host-etc. who was also the editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, the book critic for The New Yorker and co-author of the encyclopedic \u201cThe Joys of Wine.\u201d)", "\u201cThe Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter\u201d also reveals how the insecurities of one generation influence the next. Fadiman p\u00e9re ensured the \u201cdemeatballization\u201d of his children through a steady gavage of literature and Pinot Noir, and the younger Fadiman admits she has \u201cspent decades concealing the privileges of my childhood.\u201d Having finally pulled back the curtain, she shares a litany of \u201cmortifyingly unbohemian\u201d luxuries: There\u2019s her tennis instructor, her swim coach from U.C.L.A.\u2019s varsity team and her family\u2019s uniformed cook, who could be summoned by a bell installed in the dining room of their eight-bathroom Bel Air home. \u201cBy the sixth grade,\u201d she writes, \u201cI would have recognized the names of all four Premier Cru Bordeaux\u201d \u2014 along with a few Grand Cru Burgundies and the best vintages for each. While she was growing up, her wine education involved once-in-a-lifetime bottles including the 1934 Domaine de la Roman\u00e9e-Conti ($25,000 today) uncorked by her father for her brother\u2019s 21st birthday.", "Unmoved by these treasures, the daughter excels in soberly analyzing why her father so adored wine. Mining his essays, tasting notes and letters, she explores the myriad ways these bottles were physically gratifying \u2014 they provided him \u201csensory pleasures equaled only by sex\u201d and \u201ca temporary release every evening from the anxiety that had filled his head or lurked in the wings all day.\u201d They were also intellectually rewarding; with a sip of wine, he \u201cincorporated Western culture: an entire world of history, literature, art and religion, straight down the esophagus.\u201d Anne Fadiman, a gifted writer with an instinct for brilliant detail, conveys the blissful suspense of uncorking a new bottle when she writes, with characteristic feeling, that when her father first tasted a wine, \u201cone could feel the entire world aligning with his aspirations.\u201d", "She also teases out the darker desires behind oenophiles\u2019 thirst, and investigates their psychology with an honesty that can be rare among wine lovers themselves. She incisively captures wine\u2019s role as a mediator of class anxiety, for example. Her father, who considered it a liability to be Jewish in an era when institutions adopted policies to exclude American Jews from power and influence, embraced wine because he considered it a gentile hobby. Of her father\u2019s preference for Bordeaux over Burgundy, Fadiman writes: \u201cI always suspected this was because Bordeaux are named after ch\u00e2teaux. Castles. The antithesis of an apartment over a Brooklyn drugstore.\u201d At the same time, as her aging father began to \u201csmell his obituaries,\u201d wine provided him a kind of immortality: \u201cHis pompadour would turn white. His body would fail. But he would still have these magnificent wines, and they would improve with each passing decade.\u201d", "Yet \u201cThe Wine Lover\u2019s Daughter\u201d occasionally feels short on another quality that drew Clifton to his prized French reds: acid, the sourness that adds complexity to both wine and life. Fadiman generally concedes that her apathy toward wine is not a serious hardship \u2014 an admission that robs the book of some of its tension \u2014 yet she sometimes reaches for drama in ways that strain credibility. In one passage, Fadiman compares her guilt at faking enthusiasm for her father\u2019s red Bandol to \u201ca daughter feeling sure that her kind but conservative father knows she\u2019s gay even though she hasn\u2019t come out to him.\u201d But the stakes are of course incomparable; there is nothing to indicate Fadiman risks being disowned because she doesn\u2019t fawn over first growths, and she shares numerous passions with Clifton, including a career as a writer. There are glimmers of friction between parent and child: Fadiman acknowledges, for example, that her father was a \u201cmale chauvinist\u201d who belittled women and expected less of his daughter than of his sons. She then spins this as a blessing in disguise: It \u201cboth devalued and protected me,\u201d she writes, arguing that the pressure placed on her brothers gave her the freedom to follow in her father\u2019s literary footsteps.", "While the canon of literary memoirs contains numerous examples of writers grappling with family trauma or struggle, Fadiman breaks with the genre in offering a portrait of a parental relationship that \u2014 differing opinions on Bordeaux aside \u2014 is, well, happy. Indeed, the book is also a study of a daughter\u2019s love for her father \u2014 reverential, deferential, apt to make an agnosticism for wine seem like a significant betrayal. Embedded within is the story of a celebrated writer honoring someone she considers a great, perhaps overlooked, talent, and Fadiman profiles her father with a tenderness that suggests she hopes readers will, in the final calculus, share her high esteem for him. \u201cIf my father were forgotten, the balance of my world would shift so disorientingly that I\u2019d lose my footing,\u201d Fadiman writes. \u201cI still check periodically to make sure he has more Google entries than I do.

He needed stitches in his arm and wondered whether it was worth it to keep running.", "Even now, Wheatcroft remained torn. He had a wife and two young sons. A wrong step on a training run could lead to severe injury or worse. But he persevered. In a marathon, he felt the same as any other runner.

Four short, rapid vibrations signaled that a left turn was ahead. Two longer vibrations signaled a right turn.", "He also wore an ultrasonic sensor on his chest. Two sharp vibrations alerted him to runners crossing his path. No vibrations meant he was free of obstacles. Gentle pulses suggested he was securely cocooned in a pack of runners moving at roughly the same speed.", "Also attached to a strap on his chest was an iPhone.

It requires running in thick bunches and maneuvering carefully to the side of the road at water stations, where the pavement is wet and littered with paper cups.", "Wheatcroft was using new technology that had not been tested in a race. He understood that many things could go wrong. The metal girders of bridges along the course scrambled the digital compass on his iPhone. He worried about other possible navigational glitches caused by Bluetooth interference.", "What if someone stopped in front of him to take a selfie? How would he refill his water bottle? Could he remain on course as the race turned off Fifth Avenue and funneled into Central Park at Mile 24, curling around the reservoir, which had seemed to befuddle his GPS on some test runs?", "He had used technology, such as Runkeeper, an app that gave his pace and distance with voice commands. But corrective navigation for visually impaired runners was in its infancy. As Sunday\u2019s race approached, Wheatcroft described himself as excited, nervous, a little fearful.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated course, there\u2019s a lot of people, you can\u2019t afford to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cReaction times need to be sharp.\u201d", "His biggest concern, he said, was correctly interpreting the patterns of vibrations on his arm and chest. If he became confused, he planned to do what marathon runners often did in times of stress: slow down.", "Wheatcroft was a seasoned distance runner, having completed the Boston Marathon three times and ultramarathons as long as 83 miles. In 2014, he ran from Boston to New York as a warm-up, then ran the New York City Marathon. He hoped to finish in four and a half hours on Sunday, more than 40 minutes faster than his previous best in New York.", "Wheatcroft and Kevin Yoo, one of three founders of WearWorks, had been testing the Wayband technology since April. As with any prototypes, there were advances and setbacks. On Friday afternoon in Central Park, and again Saturday, last-minute refining continued with the chest sensor.", "Keith Kirkland, another founder of WearWorks, joked about running along the course during the race and calling out, \u201cAnyone have a soldering iron?\u201d", "On Sunday, Yoo started his first marathon, hoping to accompany Wheatcroft for as long as he could. The Wayband device was turned off for the first two miles of the race on the ascent and descent of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Too many runners packed together. Too much risk of technological overload.", "\u201cCould we ask everyone to be considerate and please not use their cellphones?\u201d Yoo joked before the race.", "Crosswinds blowing over the chest sensor gave confusing signals to Wheatcroft on the bridge, but the roadway was wide and he had plenty of open space to run. Neil Bacon, a friend who has often accompanied Wheatcroft, reminded him not to get too exuberant.", "\u201cYou\u2019re doing 26 miles,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cDon\u2019t go off like it\u2019s a half-marathon.\u201d", "At the first water stop, about two and a half miles into the race, a guide for another runner stopped in front of Wheatcroft. His chest sensor was set to alert him when an obstacle was seven feet away. He did not have enough time to stop and clipped the woman from behind, but neither was hurt. At the second water stop, he slowed and moved to the center of the road.", "Just after Mile 3, the Wayband device signaled incorrectly that Wheatcroft was headed in the wrong direction. He stopped and walked for a minute, then renewed his pace. Tall and thin, wearing a white cap on his shaved head, he had run four miles without any assistance.", "Taking in the aromatic scents of late-morning cooking in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Wheatcroft said, \u201cI could run this thing on smell.\u201d", "But he would have to be prepared if his digital compass went haywire later in the race \u2014 while on the Pulaski Bridge at the halfway point, the Queensboro Bridge between Miles 15 and 16 or the Willis Avenue Bridge at Mile 20 \u2014 and the vibrations from his armband signaled incorrectly that he was veering off course.", "\u201cSimon needs to trust himself and utilize his sense of hearing and just go straight,\u201d Yoo said.", "Race officials would have preferred that Wheatcroft first experiment with the Wayband technology in a smaller, shorter race. A blind runner, Thomas Panek, had recently run a race assisted only by his guide dog, a yellow Lab named Gus, but the race was five miles through Central Park, not a marathon.", "Wheatcroft argued that the New York City Marathon was the perfect place to test corrective navigation in an urban environment. It simulated the way people typically moved through cities, on the street, through crowds.", "Given that Wheatcroft was running with two guides who had accompanied him a number of times \u2014 Bacon and Andrea Croak, an American \u2014 he received the go-ahead from New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon.

In that race, a bicyclist was designated to call out her time at each mile and alert her to water stops and hazards on the course.", "Later, Runyan said, Nike made a prototype watch for her with a huge display in which each digit was an inch to an inch and a half tall. But the device did not prove reliable enough to wear in a race, she said.", "In April, Erich Manser of Littleton, Mass., ran the Boston Marathon using a service for the blind and visually impaired called Aira.

By trial and error, he memorized the route, learning to avoid signs and posts. Sometimes he found himself crying at the effort and determination needed to keep running day after day.", "He was not prepared for the unseen car that had caught fire and been abandoned on his route in August 2016. He sliced his right arm. His wife urged him to quit running. What if he had broken his leg or severed an artery? He started to obsess that each time she dropped him off for training \u201cit would be the end.\u201d", "One wrong step and he might be hit by a moving car.", "\u201cIt kept me up at night,\u201d Wheatcroft said.", "After a month or so, while delivering a speech in Bangalore, India, Wheatcroft joined a group on a run through the streets \u201cto see if I still had the daring to do it.\u201d", "As a father of sons ages 7 and 4, he continues to have doubts about what he is doing. (\u201cIt starts to take its toll; it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d) But he is buoyed by the notion that technology that permits him to run could have broader implications in allowing the visually impaired to live their daily lives more freely.", "\u201cIf we move it forward by me perhaps being a little too risky, it\u2019s all for the greater good,\u201d Wheatcroft said.", "He laughed.", "\u201cSomeone needs to be the first person stupid enough to do it.\u201d", "For about 13 to 15 miles on Sunday, Wheatcroft ran mostly unassisted. But things began to go wrong. The digital compass in his iPhone and the redundant one he wore on his arm malfunctioned. His pace slowed to 13 minutes per mile from just over 10 minutes. He struggled to navigate, had two additional collisions and sometimes was essentially shouldered around curves by other runners. At other times, he relied on lines on the road that he could feel with his feet.", "The extraordinary concentration required to guide himself \u201cbroke me,\u201d Wheatcroft said.", "At about Mile 16, the ultrasonic sensor also failed, apparently because of the rain. \u201cWe pretty much hit every issue we could potentially hit,\u201d Yoo, the WearWorks founder, said.", "For the final 10 miles, Wheatcroft ran as he had in previous marathons, with Bacon and Croak alongside, advising him of turns, potholes, curbs, water stops. He appeared exhausted when he crossed the finish line in 5 hours 17 minutes 40 seconds and put an arm around Bacon\u2019s shoulder for support.", "\u201cAwful,\u201d Wheatcroft said when asked how he felt.", "A few minutes later, though, he seemed somewhat consoled by the effort.", "\u201cToday was always about pushing the technology to its limit,\u201d Wheatcroft said. \u201cWe found the limit earlier in the race than we would have liked.

But the downside is that sharing large batches of digital photos among multiple relatives is hardly straightforward.", "No family enjoys huddling around and squinting at the small screen on Grandma\u2019s smartphone as she swipes and narrates her vacation in Florida. Even worse is when a sibling bombards you with dozens of text messages of photographs of his baby, burning through your data plan. And let\u2019s not forget the uncle who still carries around a thumb drive.", "Fortunately, big tech companies like Apple and Google offer tools to quickly and efficiently share pictures.

The quickest method for everyone to share pics is to rely on a photo storage service that supports both devices.", "Mr. Rivera said that most of his family in the United States used iPhones, but that his relatives in Asia all used Android devices. So he goaded his family to use Google Photos, which is included on Android devices and works on iPhones.", "After you sign up for Google Photos, each photo you take is automatically backed up to Google\u2019s cloud. From there, you can create albums for your trip to Spain or your 2-year-old\u2019s birthday party to share with other members of the family with Google accounts. You can also create public albums that anyone can see with a web link.", "To make sharing more effortless, you can also take advantage of some neat artificial intelligence. Google Photos detects the face of a person and automatically groups all the photos of that person into an album. From there, you can set up Google to automatically share photos of that person with others \u2014 which is great for baby photos.", "To do that, inside the Google Photos app, you add a partner account that you want to share with, like your spouse or relative, and then select the option to share photos of specific people. Then select the subject you want to share. If you want to keep people up to date with photos of your toddler, this is a quick and efficient method. (An added bonus: This trick also works for dogs.)", "Google Photos is cheap. Google offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images for free. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.", "For families that entirely rely on iPhones, there\u2019s a major benefit: the ability to share photos among devices almost instantly. Apple phones and computers have AirDrop, a tool that transfers pictures directly between devices via a wireless Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection.", "Unfortunately, this useful feature is difficult to find. In iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hard press in the upper-left corner to open a hidden menu that includes AirDrop. From there, you can set up AirDrop to receive photos from everyone or just people on your contacts list.", "To share with AirDrop, make sure your relative nearby has AirDrop receiving turned on.

In the Google Photos app, a small broadcasting icon will appear in the upper-right corner. Tap that while you are reviewing photos, and they will beam onto the television screen.", "With an Apple TV, the process is just as simple with the tool AirPlay. On your iPhone, open the photo album you want to share and hit the Share button, and then tap AirPlay.

At the end of it all, it even opened a beer and handed it to a guy on a couch.", "The trick was that an engineer was operating the robot from afar, dictating its every move. But as Mr. Abbeel explained, the video showed that robotic hardware was nimble enough to mimic complex human behavior. It just needed software that could guide the hardware \u2014 without the help of that engineer.", "\u201cThis is largely a computer science problem \u2014 an artificial intelligence problem,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said. \u201cWe have the hardware that can do the job.\u201d", "Mr. Abbeel, a native of Belgium, has spent the last several years working on artificial intelligence, first as a Berkeley professor and then as a researcher at OpenAI, the lab founded by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and other big Silicon Valley names. Now, he and three fellow researchers from Berkeley and OpenAI are starting their own company, intent on bringing a new level of robotic automation to the world\u2019s factories, warehouses and perhaps even homes.", "Their start-up, Embodied Intelligence, is backed by $7 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Amplify Partners and other investors. The company will specialize in complex algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks on their own. Using these methods, existing robots could learn to, for example, install car parts that aren\u2019t quite like the parts they have installed in the past, sort through a bucket of random holiday gifts as they arrive at a warehouse, or perform other tasks that machines traditionally could not.", "\u201cWe now have teachable robots,\u201d Mr. Abbeel said during a recent interview at the new company\u2019s offices in Emeryville, Calif., just across the bay from San Francisco.", "The new company is part of a much wider effort to create A.I. that allows robots to learn. Researchers in places like Google, Brown University, and Carnegie Mellon are doing similar work, as are existing start-ups like Micropsi and Prowler.io.", "Robots already automate some work inside factories and warehouses, such as moving boxes from place to place at Amazon\u2019s massive distribution centers.

In essence, the machine learned to master this enormously complex game by playing against itself \u2014 over and over and over again.", "Other researchers, across both industry and academia, have shown that similar algorithms allow robots to learn physical tasks as well. By repeatedly trying to open a door, for instance, a robot can learn which particular movements bring success and which don\u2019t.", "Much like Google and labs at Brown and Northeastern University, Embodied Intelligence is also augmenting these methods with a wide range of other machine learning techniques. Most notably, the start-up is exploring what is called imitation learning, a way for machines to learn discrete tasks from human demonstrations.", "The company is using this method to teach a two-armed robot to pick up plastic pipes from a table. Donning virtual reality headsets and holding motion trackers in their hands, Mr. Abbeel and his colleagues will repeatedly demonstrate the task in a digital world that recreates what is in front of a robot.

There were no injuries and police said Ms. Cole, and not Uber\u2019s car, was to blame for failing to yield on a left turn.", "But what happened after the accident revealed a system that was unprepared for computer-operated vehicles. Mr. Ducey, Tempe officials and state transportation regulators did not get briefed on the collision. The self-driving task force set up by the governor, which has met twice in two years, also did not review the incident.", "Uber sent its wrecked vehicle to its Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle center, which the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration officials visited to investigate. N.H.T.S.A. said it could not comment because its investigation is still in progress.

They have turned a network whose very promise was endless innovation into one stuck in mud, where every start-up is at the tender mercy of some of the largest corporations on the planet.", "Many companies feel this shift. In a letter to Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, who drafted the net neutrality repeal order, more than 200 start-ups argued this week that the order \u201cwould put small and medium-sized businesses at a disadvantage and prevent innovative new ones from even getting off the ground.\u201d This, they said, was \u201cthe opposite of the open market, with a few powerful cable and phone companies picking winners and losers instead of consumers.\u201d", "This was not the way the internet was supposed to go. At its deepest technical level, the internet was designed to avoid the central points of control that now command it. The technical scheme arose from an even deeper philosophy. The designers of the internet understood that communications networks gain new powers through their end nodes \u2014 that is, through the new devices and services that plug into the network, rather than the computers that manage traffic on the network. This is known as the \u201cend-to-end\u201d principle of network design, and it basically explains why the internet led to so many more innovations than the centralized networks that came before it, such as the old telephone network.", "The internet\u2019s singular power, in its early gold-rush days, was its flexibility. People could imagine a dazzling array of new uses for the network, and as quick as that, they could build and deploy them \u2014 a site that sold you books, a site that cataloged the world\u2019s information, an application that let you \u201cborrow\u201d other people\u2019s music, a social network that could connect you to anyone.", "You didn\u2019t need permission for any of this stuff; some of these innovations ruined traditional industries, some fundamentally altered society, and many were legally dubious. But the internet meant you could just put it up, and if it worked, the rest of the world would quickly adopt it.", "But if flexibility was the early internet\u2019s promise, it was soon imperiled. In 2003, Tim Wu, a law professor now at Columbia Law School (he\u2019s also a contributor to The New York Times), saw signs of impending corporate control over the growing internet. Broadband companies that were investing great sums to roll out faster and faster internet service to Americans were becoming wary of running an anything-goes network.", "Some of the new uses of the internet threatened their bottom line. People were using online services as an alternative to paying for cable TV or long-distance phone service. They were connecting devices like Wi-Fi routers, which allowed them to share their connections with multiple devices. At the time, there were persistent reports of broadband companies seeking to block or otherwise frustrate these new services; in a few years, some broadband providers would begin blocking new services outright.", "To Mr. Wu, the broadband monopolies looked like a threat to the end-to-end idea that had powered the internet. In a legal journal, he outlined an idea for regulation to preserve the internet\u2019s equal-opportunity design \u2014 and hence was born \u201cnet neutrality.\u201d", "Though it has been through a barrage of legal challenges and resurrections, some form of net neutrality has been the governing regime on the internet since 2005.

The car is.", "Using a radar sensor, cameras, GPS positioning and a highly precise digital map, the CT6\u2019s Super Cruise driver-assistance system is handling all of the braking, accelerating and steering as I continue heading west to a lunch appointment in South Bend, Ind., 170 miles away.", "That leaves me free to sit back and type these words \u2014 and do much more that would otherwise be considered unsafe \u2014 as the mile markers zip by.", "Self-driving cars will soon be a reality. Waymo, the autonomous-car division of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is already testing hundreds of self-driving vehicles around the country. The ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft and big automakers including General Motors, Ford Motor and Audi are developing their own technology and test fleets.", "In some places, cars with no steering wheels and no pedals are already shuttling passengers around restricted locations, like college campuses and compact downtown areas. Modified models of today\u2019s cars are doing the same, helping passengers who would otherwise have a hard time getting around. On freeways, tractor-trailers will navigate themselves between cities while Super Cruise and similar passenger car systems turn even their drivers into, well, passengers.", "So on this brisk November day, my hands-free road trip with Super Cruise offered a glimpse into that future \u2014 a world in which the grinding daily commute will transform into quiet time, and long drives can become productive hours on the road.", "Super Cruise was introduced in September and is General Motors\u2019 answer to Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, the best known of the semiautonomous driving systems that have arrived in the past two years. Neither Autopilot nor Super Cruise is fully autonomous \u2014 both require drivers to remain alert and prepared to take control at any time.", "But Super Cruise has one big advantage: Unlike Autopilot, it does not require you to keep your hands on the steering wheel. As I\u2019m typing this, a camera mounted on the steering column is monitoring my eyes and head. As long as I glance up every so often, Super Cruise knows that I\u2019m keeping an eye on the road.", "For more than an hour, Super Cruise pilots the car with no input from me \u2014 no steering, no braking and no acceleration. In that time, I cover 65 miles. With my hands free, I scroll through Twitter and Facebook. I log into my bank account and read the headlines from The New York Times.", "As long as I look up at the road about every three seconds, Super Cruise remains in command, maintaining a safe following distance and easing the Cadillac through the freeway\u2019s contours. When Super Cruise is engaged, a thin light strip on the top of the steering wheel appears green. If I look away longer than three seconds, it flashes to bring my gaze back on the highway. If I fail to do so, the light strip turns red and the driver\u2019s seat vibrates, telling me to take control.", "That has happened only once so far. To get Super Cruise back, I need only look forward and place my hands on the wheel. After a few seconds, the light strip turns green again, and my hands are free to go back to the iPhone.", "I quickly learn how to glance regularly at the road. My host in South Bend, my cousin Pat, calls me using the video chat function in Facebook Messenger. I hold the phone up over the steering wheel so that I can see Pat on the screen while keeping my gaze looking forward, ensuring Super Cruise remains in control.", "All the while, the CT6 stays centered in the left lane of I-94. But if I want to change lanes or to pass other cars, I take the wheel myself and steer the car over. The light strip turns blue, indicating I\u2019m temporarily overriding Super Cruise. Once the car is in the new lane, the strip goes back to green and I\u2019m hands-free again. It decelerates when approaching slower vehicles. When the road clears, it accelerates back up to the speed I\u2019ve selected: 74 m.p.h., four over the speed limit.", "At one point, a car merging onto the highway scoots in front of me. Super Cruise responds quickly and brakes. I sense no danger of a collision.", "G.M. is careful to specify that it is not promoting Super Cruise as a way to let drivers text, Google or open a newspaper on the highway. \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d said Lisa Sieradski, global product manager for the CT6. \u201cIt will allow you to glance down at a phone or the radio, but you have to return your eyes to the road.\u201d", "Nonetheless, using the same video-chatting method, I watch a four-minute highlight video from a Rangers game. (They beat the Bruins, 4-2.) I also conduct a phone interview, taking notes with a pen and a pad. When my trip ended, I had covered 378 miles. My hands were on the wheel for no more than 25 of them.", "Ms. Sieradski said G.M. had tried to engineer Super Cruise to keep drivers safe \u2014 and limit opportunities to use the system improperly \u2014 by restricting how and where they could use it. The system will not operate at speeds above 85 mile per hour, for example.", "And Super Cruise can be activated only on divided, limited-access highways such as interstates \u2014 places where it need not contend with intersections, traffic lights and pedestrians. The system determines its exact location by relying on high-precision digital maps and GPS technology, while sensors track the surrounding traffic \u2014 the way sensors do for driver aides like adaptive cruise control. The system is able to determine when the car is on a service road along the highway, or even on entry and exit ramps \u2014 locations where it requires you to steer yourself.", "But when the Super Cruise system senses it is on an approved road, a white steering wheel icon appears on the instrument panel. Press a button, and the green bar lights up and the system takes over.", "For now, Super Cruise is available only on the 2018 CT6. Dealers in Michigan are offering the car with the option for about $73,000.", "The ability to cruise on the highway hands-free is a major step forward. For many drivers, systems that require them to keep their hands on the steering wheel seem almost self-defeating. What\u2019s the point of having the car steer itself if your hands have to stay on the wheel?", "While driving the CT6 over several days, I found it was actually more pleasing to leave my phone alone. One morning at rush hour, I sat quietly with my hands on my knees, sipping a latte as though I were relaxing on my couch.", "On the return leg of my South Bend trip, I turned on the back massager built into the CT6\u2019s driver\u2019s seat. From my phone, I piped a new-age meditation through the CT6\u2019s sound system.", "As I stared at the truck ahead of me, and the seat kneaded my lower back, I crossed the border into the state of Zen.

Would they ever be able to bring the profits back to the United States without incurring huge tax bills?", "Some 20 years after the tax-avoiding technique became widespread, it is poised to pay off in a big way. The Republican tax bills making their way through the House and Senate would allow companies to bring nearly $3 trillion in profits home, at greatly reduced tax rates.", "In a tax-overhaul package that would provide the greatest benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations, the so-called repatriation provision stands out. It would give companies a permanent tax break of about half a trillion dollars, rewarding the likes of Google, Apple, Pfizer and General Electric. Corporate America claims that about $3 trillion in profits were generated in places like Bermuda, Grand Cayman and Luxembourg.", "The tax breaks for bringing home such offshore profits \u201cconfirm the central tenet of tax planning that a tax deferred is a tax avoided,\u201d said David Miller, a tax lawyer at Proskauer Rose. \u201cFor decades, U.S. multinationals have shifted profits abroad and deferred their taxes on them. If either of the tax bills pass, they will be rewarded for doing so.\u201d", "To be sure, the legislation erects some potential guardrails against future efforts to shift profits offshore. It would establish a minimum tax abroad on certain types of income \u2014 at least 10 percent for the first several years in the Senate version \u2014 thus raising the tax bills for many companies on their foreign profits. And regulators in Europe and elsewhere abroad have accelerated their efforts to crack down on such profit shifting out of their countries.", "President Trump and congressional Republicans argue that it\u2019s important to get companies to bring the money home because it would be used to create jobs \u2014 although that didn\u2019t happen the last time lawmakers enacted a similar tax break. Mr. Trump predicted on Tuesday that trillions of dollars would be repatriated \u2014 money, he said, that companies currently are \u201cjust not able to bring back.\u201d", "Under current law, American companies pay taxes on their worldwide profits at a rate of 35 percent, the highest statutory rate in the world. But the law has a big caveat: Companies can indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stay overseas.", "That gives companies a powerful incentive to push as much profit as possible into subsidiaries abroad. Microsoft, Merck, Facebook and other companies attribute large chunks of their profits to entities in low- or zero-tax offshore jurisdictions and therefore enjoy effective tax rates that are nowhere near 35 percent.", "Apple has been especially adept at moving profits around in tax-advantageous ways. This month, The New York Times reported how the company, after Irish regulators jeopardized its offshore tax arrangement, deployed a new corporate structure on the island of Jersey. The company now has more than $128 billion offshore.", "But companies can defer the American taxes only as long as their profits remain offshore. If they want to repatriate the cash back to the United States, they must pay taxes at the rate of 35 percent, minus whatever they already paid abroad.", "A large loophole was opened in 1996 when the Clinton administration\u2019s Treasury Department introduced a rule that allowed different subsidiaries of the same company to move money back and forth without incurring American taxes.", "That removed one of the main deterrents to companies pushing profits into overseas tax havens \u2014 and opened the floodgates. Since then, the share of American companies\u2019 foreign profits attributed to a handful of tax havens has more than doubled. Now, nearly two-thirds of all profits that American companies claim to earn overseas are generated in tax-friendly jurisdictions including Bermuda, Ireland and the Netherlands, according to data compiled by Gabriel Zucman, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.", "The problem for corporate America, though, is that it can\u2019t easily use that overseas money for things like paying dividends or buying their own shares, techniques that publicly traded companies use to please their investors. Doing so would trigger hefty tax bills.", "After intense lobbying by big companies, Congress in 2004 passed the American Jobs Creation Act, which provided a one-time tax break for companies that wanted to repatriate their offshore profits. Companies brought home $312 billion at a rate of just 5.25 percent. Although the break was intended to spur investment and hiring, a plethora of studies showed that companies responded by spending billions buying back their shares, lifting their stock prices, and didn\u2019t expand their American work forces.", "Pfizer, for example, brought home $37 billion at the reduced rates \u2014 and shed 10,000 workers. Hewlett-Packard repatriated more than $14 billion, while eliminating more than 14,000 jobs.", "After that tax break, companies resumed pushing profits offshore \u2014 at an even brisker pace. Early in the Obama administration, Cisco Systems led a lobbying effort for yet another tax holiday, which went nowhere.", "Now, companies have accumulated approximately $2.8 trillion in profits offshore, beyond the reach of American tax authorities and barely touched by other countries, according to the Zion Research Group, a research boutique focused on accounting and tax issues.", "The proposals in the Republican tax package are different from the 2004 holiday. Under the current versions, all foreign earnings sitting offshore would be considered to be automatically repatriated, and taxes at a reduced rate would be paid over several years. The rates would vary, with earnings held in cash taxed at 10 percent in the Senate version. Other earnings would be taxed at half that rate. Companies would receive credit for some foreign taxes already paid.", "Zion Research estimated that under the Senate proposal, companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 would pay about $570 billion less than what they would if they brought the profits home under current law.", "American companies would no longer owe full taxes on overseas profits. Instead, they would pay taxes at a minimum rate of at least 10 percent on some types of foreign profits \u2014 compared with a new, lower rate on domestic earnings of 20 percent.", "Kristin J.

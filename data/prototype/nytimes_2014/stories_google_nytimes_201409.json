You can even buy one in 18-karat gold. The device, the details of which will be revealed today during an Apple press conference, is the latest in slick, wearable technology, a growing category that includes Google Glass, Jawbone\u2019s Up fitness tracker and Liquid Image\u2019s goggle-cameras.", "But will these innovations really be game-changers for travelers?", "On one hand it\u2019s amusing to contemplate the promise of wearable technology, or wearables, when the travel industry is still trying to solve basic problems like how to board 300 people onto an airplane without the process devolving into a stampede. I\u2019m reminded of the psychologist Abraham Maslow\u2019s \u201chierarchy of needs\u201d \u2014 the pyramid that illustrates how rudimentary physiological requirements like food and shelter must be met before we can concern ourselves with less crucial desires. If there were such a pyramid for travel, boarding a plane with Jetsons-style alacrity would come before watches and glasses that alert us to the nearest Margaritaville.", "On the other hand, wearables, particularly the Apple Watch, could eventually transform the way we travel. Given that sensors on the back of the device can track your pulse rate, perhaps it might also detect if you\u2019re becoming unruly during a flight and follow up with a zap to your wrist and a stress-reduction video?", "Fantasies aside, some technology and travel experts see real-world potential in wearables, even though many are most likely years away from being what we want them to be.", "Take smartwatches, which are already available from brands including LG, Motorola and Sony. They\u2019re good at pushing information and alerts from your calendar to your wrist, where it\u2019s easily glanced. The wrinkle, said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, is that most smartwatches are clunky and impersonal. They cannot pinpoint where you are or what you want, so the information they provide is not game-changing. \u201cA traveler needs that friend that\u2019s sitting on their wrist that says, \u2018I know you, I know what you like,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that Apple can do.\u201d", "A wearable should be a coach, Mr. McQuivey said in September, a day before Apple first announced the watch at a news conference in Cupertino, Calif., \u201csomeone who knows more about what you need than you do.\u201d", "Indeed, Apple said that over time the watch\u2019s Workout app \u201cgets to know you the way a personal trainer would\u201d and suggests goals based on your workout history. This ability to use your personal data and history to suggest things you might want is what could put Apple ahead of its competitors, Mr. McQuivey said. Who knows what kinds of personalized real-time recommendations the Apple Watch might be capable of making in the future? Airport restaurants you\u2019re likely to enjoy? Museum exhibitions?", "One of the biggest boons for travelers involves maps and GPS: Walk through a city and the Apple Watch can deliver different vibrations to your wrist to indicate whether you should turn left or right, so you don\u2019t have to wander the streets peering at a tiny device (or be a good map-reader) to know which way to go. \u201cIt\u2019s like having this invisible guide with you,\u201d Kevin Lynch, vice president of technology for Apple, said during the September news conference.", "Another helpful travel component is the watch\u2019s health and fitness features, particularly its ability to show how often you\u2019ve taken a break from sitting. The watch senses when you stand up and logs that information. Sitting too long? The Apple Watch reminds you to get up \u2014 welcome prodding for those who spend hours in cars or planes.", "As you might expect, the watch will also have apps from leading travel brands such as American Airlines and Starwood, although it\u2019s hard to get excited because versions of such apps are available on smartphones and tablets. There are a few twists: An app from Starwood, for instance, will allow you to unlock your room at any W Hotel in the world by waving your watch in front of the door. But frankly, opening my hotel room door with my watch was never on my wish list.", "And of course some travelers will like that the Apple Watch has Apple Pay, a new mobile system that allows you to pay at the registers of places as varied as McDonald\u2019s and Walt Disney World. Until the system is ubiquitous, I\u2019ll be carrying my wallet. I\u2019ll also be carrying my iPhone because, well, you must in order to use all the features of the Apple Watch \u2014 and that\u2019s a real drawback for travelers who aim to carry fewer, not more, devices.", "So far wearables haven\u2019t exactly taken off. And, for what they cost, they\u2019re not always practical for the average traveler. Google Glass is $1,500, while the Apple Watch starts at $349 and you have to have an iPhone 5 or higher for it to work. Ditto for the Samsung Gear smartwatch, which is about $300 and requires that you own a Samsung phone or tablet.", "Still, some analysts, including Mr. McQuivey, think Apple has the best shot at delivering on the promise of such technology in part because the company is well positioned to go beyond the smartwatch. It could eventually roll out a full-body network of devices; a system that allows travelers to access the same information in a variety of ways \u2014 for example, in an ear, not unlike the way the artificially intelligent Samantha talks to Theodore through his ear bud in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Indeed, Mr. McQuivey thinks Motorola\u2019s new Hint earpiece, which has the same abilities as its Moto 360 smartwatch but relies on the user\u2019s voice, is a \u201cdefensive move\u201d against the sort of system Apple might offer one day.", "\u201cNearly four in 10 travelers can see a benefit of using wearables when they are traveling,\u201d said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. To attract more of them, the devices should be easy to use: The typical American traveler is about 41 years old, not 21, according to Mr. Harteveldt. And if the wearable is a smartwatch, he said, it should look inconspicuous, if not beautiful. \u201cIt would have to be something that doesn\u2019t make me look like an extra on the set of an alien movie,\u201d he said.", "Apple, unlike many competitors, tackled that concern, offering an array of watch faces and bands, including leather and stainless steel mesh. \u201cIt\u2019s as much about personal technology as it is about style and taste,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, told the crowd at the news conference. Though for those of us with fashionable watches that merely tell time, the Apple Watch presents a problem. There\u2019s only so much wrist real estate.", "No matter what they look like, analysts think it will be years before wearables replace smartphones and tablets, if ever. \u201cThese will be supplemental devices for the consumer,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said.", "In the race to the bionic future, it\u2019s easy to forget that some of the best innovations transforming the way we travel today are not wearables.", "For instance Global Entry, the program that expedites the United States customs process for citizens, is a game-changer, as is T.S.A. Precheck, which speeds its members through airport security. Add to the list the car services Uber and Lyft, and touchless toilets, sinks and waste bins on the 787 Dreamliner planes.", "And let\u2019s not forget the obvious wearable: clothing. Ralph Lauren\u2019s new Polo Tech smart shirts gathered information about the heart rate and stress levels of United States Open ball boys. It\u2019s often the less flashy improvements, though, that make travel a little easier. Patagonia makes quick-dry clothes with built-in sunscreen.

After rapid growth following the introduction of Apple\u2019s iTunes store in 2003, download sales in recent years began to cool. Then, in 2013, they dropped precipitously, leading to fresh rounds of questions about whether streaming services like Spotify \u2014 which let people listen to millions of songs online, charging listeners for the access or making them listen to ads \u2014 were to blame.", "Strict causality between the rise in streaming and the fall in downloads may be difficult to prove to a scientist\u2019s satisfaction. But few music executives these days seem to dispute that people buy fewer songs when they can easily stream them online, and this shift is part of the reasoning behind recent deals like Apple\u2019s $3 billion purchase of Beats.", "Among physical formats, CD sales continue to plunge while vinyl records grow into a surprisingly robust niche. Sales of albums on CD fell 19 percent by revenue to $716 million, while LP sales grew 43 percent to $146 million. A decade ago, LP sales were barely significant. But with vinyl now firmly established as a premium-priced collector\u2019s item and an audiophile favorite, they represent about 4.6 percent of the total.", "The music industry also received some good news this week.

Among other programs, Google is running a series of workshops to help employees understand and combat their unconscious biases. Google hopes the plan will put people on alert to the many small ways that its culture may make outsiders uncomfortable.", "But several readers have raised a more basic question: Why does Google want diversity? White and Asian men make up the bulk of American software engineering graduates, and Google, like other tech giants, has done extremely well hiring from that pool. If a lack of diversity hasn\u2019t hurt Google so far, why alter how the company works, apparently for reasons of political correctness?", "I asked Google\u2019s executives and managers several versions of this question. They said Google\u2019s efforts to increase diversity had little to do with political correctness. Instead, they said, they were directly related to the company\u2019s bottom line: By increasing diversity, Google can improve its products. And it can back up this argument with both research and experience.", "\u201cIf we have an employee base that reflects our user base, we are going to better understand the needs of people all over the world,\u201d said Brian Welle, the researcher in charge of Google\u2019s diversity training workshops. \u201cHaving people with a different worldview and different ways of solving problems gives you the raw materials to be more innovative and to be able to solve problems that nobody has asked before.\u201d", "Dr. Welle pointed to a very basic instance of this. In 2012, when YouTube, a Google subsidiary, created a mobile app that allowed people to upload videos from their phones, it noticed something odd. About 10 percent of the videos being uploaded were upside down. When designers looked into the problem, they found something unexpected: Left-handed people picked up their phones differently from right-handed people, leading to upside-down videos.", "The issue here was one of ignorance \u2014 the engineers and designers who created the YouTube app were all right-handed, and none had considered that some people may pick up their phones differently. It\u2019s a small example, but a telling one. If Google\u2019s designers couldn\u2019t anticipate the needs of left-handed people with an all-right-handed product team, how could they anticipate the needs of women with a staff composed overwhelmingly of men?", "But it\u2019s not just that diverse teams can let Google identify issues important to certain segments of its audience. Diversity can also help the company come up with ideas that it would not have otherwise. Dr. Welle pointed to research showing that diverse groups outperformed homogeneous groups on creative problem-solving exercises. For instance, in one study, when given a murder mystery exercise, three-person groups with racial diversity tended to solve the puzzle better than groups with only white members.", "Katherine W. Phillips, the senior vice dean of the Columbia Business School and one of the leading researchers in diversity and innovation, has argued that diverse groups are more creative because creativity is usually a reflection of people\u2019s backgrounds. \u201cPeople who are different from one another in race, gender and other dimensions bring unique information and experiences to bear on the task at hand,\u201d she wrote recently in Scientific American.", "Dr. Welle concurs. \u201cFor conventional problems, it\u2019s better to have homogeneity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are digging a ditch, you probably want really strong people who can hold a shovel. You don\u2019t want skinny, weak people \u2014 that diversity doesn\u2019t make sense in that context.\u201d", "But Google doesn\u2019t work on conventional problems that can be solved by people with well-known skill sets. It is working on novel problems; its purposes is to come up with stuff that nobody else has thought of.", "\u201cWe\u2019re building things now that have never existed before,\u201d Dr. Welle said.

It was a sneaker.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a tectonic shift,\u201d said Bruce Pask, the men\u2019s fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, referring to Berluti\u2019s $1,580 sneakers and to an across-the-board casualization of men\u2019s wear that is clearly no passing phase.", "The best designers \u2014 Mr. Coppens is one \u2014 come prepared with a crisply resolved brief and collections that take into account this new reality. There were no gimmicks or stunt clothes in his show, just a coolly restrained group of nearly monochrome bomber jackets, parkas, shorts, a trench coat in so-called technical fabric, and a complexly woven sweater that looked as if was made from the same stuff as sock bags. What minimal ornamentation he deployed was confined to diagonal chest pocket zippers.", "Taking a cue from athletic garments, he also inset mesh panels into jacket yokes and scoop neck tank tops, lending an element of peekaboo sexuality to the boxy shapes. Even something as tricky as the computer-generated jungle sunrise prints were sufficiently abstracted as to seem restrained.", "And there were suits, exactly two, so low-key you barely noticed they were there.", "Other designers shared his stealth approach to dressing up. Todd Snyder evoked the most overused dictum in the modernist canon: \u201cform follows function.\u201d Almost invariably misattributed to Frank Lloyd Wright (Louis Sullivan said it), the actual quote is \u201cform ever follows function.\u201d", "But what matter? Form and function bear little relationship to one another in the digital age \u2014 if you didn\u2019t already know, could you guess what an iPhone does by looking at it? And Mr. Snyder built his show around utilitarian garments in which form and function are one.", "Mostly, that is, there were chinos and sweats, far from a new idea on a runway and yet one Mr. Snyder managed to spruce up with details like short sleeves or narrow ankles and proportions refined enough that the wearer won\u2019t look as if he had forgotten his sports coat at the gym. As in Mr. Coppens\u2019s show, there were a few obligatory suits, as well as safari jackets, bombers, a boxy jeans jacket. But the essence of where Mr. Snyder, who once designed for J. Crew, and much of men\u2019s wear is headed was communicated by a single outfit: a white Champion sweatshirt worn with a pair of suit pants. In the future, Casual Friday will come every day of the week.", "Or maybe that future is now. As Mr. Pask pointed out, a lot of guys have already normalized once-unthinkable customs like wearing blazers with jeans, suit jackets with shorts, sneakers with dress clothes, sandals with a tuxedo. And the influence of sports on most aspects of daily life has become so ubiquitous as to feel organic, discernible in labels as unalike as Lacoste and Hood by Air.", "The roots of the HBA designer Shayne Oliver are urban, his influences streetwear and his philosophical tendency to jape at class and gender norms. Lacoste was founded in 1933 with the straightforward aim of producing golf and tennis clothes for the moneyed elite. Each label has a strong and unmistakable logo. And that is where, you would think, any apparent similarity ends.", "Yet if you stripped away the gimmicky \u201cSeditionaries\u201d styling at the Hood by Air show (plexiglass handcuff stocks, bondage straps, handbags made from bicycle handles, excuse me, Boychild, can I borrow your Great Dane?), the leather logo baseball jackets, the deconstructed suits, the shredded jeans, the translucent nylon shorts and shirts and trousers that looked as if made from repurposed spinnakers had more than you had imagined in common with the fine sailing-inspired collection Felipe Oliveira Baptista designed for Lacoste.", "Backstage before the show, Mr. Oliveira, 39, laid out an ambition to produce clothes that, while they exploit technological innovation, are \u201crelatable for today first, before making a fashion statement.\u201d What that really means, he said, is that he aims to outfit a generation with few preconceived notions about what constitutes workwear or, for that matter, work itself.", "Why not head for your office at a Coworking space in an ice-blue three-button Lacoste suit in lightweight nylon or trousers with a windbreaker attached to the waistline and left to dangle behind the wearer like a train? What about a neoprene sweatshirt or knit football jersey with elbow-length sleeves and an abstracted sailboat print on it that would not be out of place on the Google campus?", "While Mr. Oliver may have intended with his show, as he claimed backstage, to critique machismo and sex-based hierarchies, what appeared on the catwalk had a lot more in common with Mr. Oliveira\u2019s easeful and straightforwardly commercial efforts than you might think.", "Commercial is not a dirty word, after all, as proved by Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne at a Public School collection that added elegant layering to the streetwear silhouettes and styles that made their name; at a softly tailored Billy Reid show whose traditional patterns seemed to owe a debt to the boro prints Junya Watanabe sent out in a beautiful spring collection in Paris; and also at Parke & Ronen, a label whose designers Parke Lutter and Ronen Jehezkel applied the lessons in precision picked up designing swimwear to a tightly edited group of shirts and pants and cargo shorts inspired by the ill-fated Patricia Highsmith character Dickie Greenleaf \u2014 or anyway to the idyllic summer he spent on the Italian coastline before Tom Ripley brained him with an oar.", "\u201cThis is the most commercial collection we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d said Steven Cox, who designs Duckie Brown with his partner, Daniel Silver, before his show last weekend at Industria Superstudio in the West Village. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably go the opposite direction next season, knowing us.\u201d", "It\u2019s a measure of the singularly eccentric position Duckie Brown occupies in a largely conformist landscape that Mr. Cox would make that statement about a collection that looked as if designed for a groovy 80-year-old you might spot trolling the Metamucil aisle at a Publix in Boca Raton.", "That\u2019s intended as a compliment.", "Geezer chic has been with us at least since Macklemore, bragging that \u201cIm\u2019a take your grandpa\u2019s style,\u201d made a persuasive case for velour jumpsuits and house slippers in the multiplatinum \u201cThrift Shop.\u201d", "In the Duckie Brown rendition, the oldster silhouette \u2014 boxy, short-sleeved shirts in a washed-out camel-check plaid; voluminous shorts; dropped crotch trousers whose waistline situates the midpoint on a man\u2019s body somewhere north of the belly button \u2014 was so expertly executed and starkly counter to every prevalent trend in men\u2019s wear that it somehow looked prophetic.", "True, Kim Jones, the Louis Vuitton designer, experimented at his Paris show this summer with high-waist trousers inspired by those that many men in north India favor. But the Duckie Brown trousers, with their ballooning proportions, curved outseams and narrow bottoms recast the male anatomy in a sculptural way that has less to do with styling tricks than with true design.

We had planned it secretly, down to surreptitiously asking our waiter at lunch to change a nickel for five pennies.", "He was, predictably, appalled. \u201cAre you guys kidding?\u201d Jon said. \u201cYou\u2019re really paying 1 cent?\u201d He then apologized to the man, paying for his own admission and tacking on an additional $5 for each of us.", "I would later leave $10 in the donation box, too \u2014 the museum\u2019s collection of Native American artists alone is worth it. But the experiment showed that travelers on budgets even lower than ours can pay very little and not be humiliated.", "I stopped in Seattle during a trip through the Pacific Northwest, meeting up with two of my favorite travel companions, my high school classmates Jon (who flew in from Boston) and Doug (who hopped up from Santa Cruz, Calif.), making it a bit of a male-centric mini-reunion. I had proposed to keep our budget low by spending as close to nothing as possible by day \u2014 eating breakfast in the hostel, choosing cheap or free activities and not eating lunch until Seattle\u2019s ubiquitous afternoon happy hours, which often feature sharply discounted food, started opening up at 3 p.m. \u2014 and loosening up, at least a bit, in the evenings.", "Lodging turned out to be our biggest challenge: When we began planning in July, all reasonably priced hotels anywhere near the city center had been booked. Then we found City Hostel, in the central Belltown neighborhood, where I reserved four spots, creating essentially a private bedroom for $148 total a night (taxes included) \u2014 cheaper by far than any downtown hotel available during our dates. It\u2019s also quite stylish, for a hostel at least \u2014 each room is decorated by a local artist, shared bathrooms are clean, and breakfast is free if not particularly good.", "Frugal activities, on the other hand, were plentiful. We started with Jake Schlack\u2019s energetic Seattle 101 tour, which is given daily through Seattle Free Walking Tours. (The cost is \u201cpay what you feel.\u201d) Jake knows his audience, and mixed history and trivia with lots of budget travel ideas. Among the advice we took: get your sweeping city view by going up the Smith Tower rather than the Space Needle ($7.50 instead of $19), download the Cocktail Compass app, which tracks happy hours across the city, and take the free Pike Brewing Co. tour that would begin just after his tour ended.", "Jake led us from one tourist spot to another \u2014 Pike Place Market to historic Pioneer Square and down to the waterfront \u2014 but wowed us by pointing out that many of Seattle\u2019s manhole covers are in maps of downtown that show your current location, like Google Maps in cast iron. He also peppered the tour with tidbits you couldn\u2019t see, like Seattle\u2019s underground city (the level of 19th-century streets and storefronts buried when the city was raised 12 feet), and noted that the city would never be what it was today if it hadn\u2019t served as the prime staging ground for fortune seekers during the Klondike Gold Rush. (The Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park in town is also free.)", "The tour ended outside Ivar\u2019s a waterfront seafood restaurant, where Jake disappeared and returned with generous free samples of its ultra-creamy clam chowder and orders of French fries that customers toss to eagerly awaiting sea gulls, creating quite a squawky spectacle. (\u201cIn the afternoon, a staff member comes out and tosses them Lipitor,\u201d Jon said.)", "We headed straight for the brewery tour, given by Abil Bradshaw, a nutritionist, performance artist and one of the more pro-beer people you\u2019ll meet. Beer, she reminded us, was once the safest way to hydrate.", "\u201cWater has always given us a really hard time,\u201d she said, referring to diseases and gastric distress. Beer was \u201ca hydrating beverage that didn\u2019t kill us in a week. We are here because of beer, and that is no exaggeration.\u201d", "As we walked through the brewery, she took us through the science of brewing, including what helps make amber ale amber (caramelized sugar) and what hops can add to I.P.A.s.", "Appropriately, it was time to hit up those happy hours. We started classy at Lecosho, which serves \u201cEuropean-influenced dishes using the best ingredients available from the Northwest,\u201d in car-free Post Alley. We sat outside and ordered from the happy hour list: a blackcurrant cider for Doug, a Maritime Pacific Portage Bay Pilsener for Jon and an I.P.A. from Schooner Exact for me. Each was $3, a preposterous amount for such a quality selection amid such a peaceful setting. We ordered just one dish, house-made sausage and soft-boiled egg served on lentils laced with fennel mustard for $7. Next up was Owl N\u2019 Thistle pub, where $4.95 gets you enough of their critically acclaimed fish and chips to qualify as a meal. After several more stops we ended with $2.25 cans of Hamm\u2019s beer and a few 50-cent rounds of Galaga at Shorty\u2019s, a popular pinball- and video-game-filled bar across from our hostel.", "On one of the three days, I broke our happy hour rule to drag Doug and Jon on the light rail out to Tukwila (one stop short of the airport) in search of a Somali restaurant called Marwa. (Seattle has sizable immigrant groups from the Horn of Africa.) We had to walk down highway-like International Boulevard from the station, but as we looked for the restaurant I detoured us into an Ethiopian market where we bought a $3 bottle of Hakim Stout beer, then into the parking lot of a Taco Time restaurant to drink it. We had to ask around to find Marwa, which appeared not to have any signage.", "The restaurant setup was simple \u2014 a cross between informal diner and a basement social club \u2014 and so was the menu. We ordered three dishes: barbecued chicken, bone-in goat meat, and chicken suqaar, small pieces of saut\u00e9ed chicken flavored with a complex spice mixture, vegetables and onions. All three cost $9.99 and came on platters with vegetables and rice or wafer-thin, buttery chapati. The chicken was by far the best \u2014 with just barely charred meat pulled off the bone in what tasted like a pretty American barbecue sauce.", "There were also, of course, bananas. I say \u201cof course\u201d for the benefit of my Somali readers, who know what we did not: that bananas accompany many Somali meals. Our waiter, in fact, brought them before our main dishes, like a breadbasket.", "The food was not award-winning, but our waiter and fellow customers were nice; it was certainly worth the experience. (The sparse online reviews note that there is a family room for those not comfortable eating with the typically all-male crowd.)", "\u201cConsidering the odds I\u2019ll ever get to Somalia are almost nil, I thought it was great,\u201d Doug said.", "\u201cI\u2019ll never look at a banana the same way again,\u201d Jon added.", "We made our way to Kubota Garden \u2014 one rail stop and a bus ride (or a long walk) from Marwa. The \u201cAmerican Japanese Garden,\u201d is pleasant enough \u2014 but its history is more interesting. It was started by a Japanese immigrant, Fujitaro Kubota, in 1927, who ran a gardening business out of it. It grew but was abandoned during World War II when Mr. Kubota spent four years at an internment camp. (It was bought by the city in 1987.) I don\u2019t recommend going without a car, but if you do, consider a Somali lunch while you\u2019re there.", "The Far East theme extended into the evening, which we planned to spend in Seattle\u2019s International District, home to several Asian communities. It started with a dirt cheap dinner at Ping\u2019s Dumpling House, where the house specialties start at $5 a dozen. We found the pot stickers ($6.99 for 10) to be our favorites, flipped right out of the pan and still stuck together by a latticework of what seemed like cheese but was actually simply oil and flour, we were told. I had invited my cousin Brad, who lives in town and helped us plan the trip, and the four of us feasted for $34 total, including tip. (Add $6 for a bag of five big chocolate almond cookies next door at A Piece of Cake, another Chinese spot.)", "Then it was on to (respectable) massages at Imperial Massage, where a female friend had recommended the 60-minute foot and body massage for $29 \u2014 about the best price you\u2019ll find this side of the Pacific. Entering the mostly empty Pacific Rim Center mall just after 9 p.m. was an odd experience, but in Imperial\u2019s common massage area most of the Barcalounger-style chairs were full. As soothing music played, we received what we agreed were skilled if very standardized foot and body massages \u2014 they ended at almost the same second.", "As I left Doug and Jon in Seattle, where they would stay a few more days freed from my budget constraints, I considered what would happen if I went back in time to 1988 to tell our high school selves about our visit together. \u201cWould you believe that in 2014, you three will meet in Seattle, stay in a youth hostel, swill beer in a fast-food parking lot, pay a penny to enter a museum, stuff yourselves at a bargain dumpling place and get a cheap massage?\u201d", "I\u2019m pretty sure our response would have been: \u201cSounds about right.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/technology/fcc-revisits-net-neutrality-exemption-for-mobile-broadband.html": ["WASHINGTON \u2014 High-speed cellular Internet access has been largely exempt from regulations aimed at preventing Internet providers from slowing down or blocking websites and applications.

My guess is, if you\u2019d asked three or four years ago, you\u2019d have found under 1 percent of U.S. companies interested in selling in China. Since then, there have been lots of stories in the media about China business. Plus, Alibaba\u2019s initial public offering has raised awareness of its size and the size of the Chinese e-commerce market.", "Q. Did you lose a lot of money?", "A. We kept our losses within budget. We have a somewhat complicated business model, and we knew the first year or two would be challenging.", "Q. Did you change your approach?", "A. On the marketing side, we\u2019d clearly fallen short. We went through a furious series of experimentations.", "Q. What did you learn?", "A. There were two related flaws. We were attracting tire kickers, but the other flaw was that the department store model was noninviting or maybe even off-putting to the serious brands. If you are a serious brand committed to China, you want your own e-commerce flagship store. You don\u2019t want to be on the shelf with other goods. So we changed the offer. We said, \u201cWe will do an e-commerce flagship store for you and help you build your brand.\u201d Of course, that costs more money. We opened our first flagship store about a year ago for the N.F.L. And since then, we\u2019ve started bringing on larger clients, those with revenues of $100 million to $1 billion. Today, we have more than a dozen larger clients that more than compensate for the departure of the very small clients.", "Q. Are you helping them with advertising?", "A. The first thing we say is, if you\u2019re selling in the digital space, your advertising needs to also be in the digital space.", "Q. How have you changed your own marketing?", "A. One step we took about a year ago was going on Google Ad Words and buying \u201cHow do I sell on Alibaba?\u201d; \u201cHow do I sell on Tmall?\u201d; \u201cHow do I use e-commerce in China?\u201d People searching on Google with those questions, now see our advertisements. We also realized that webinars make more sense than big city presentations.", "Q. What kinds of adjustments do American companies have to make when they go into China?", "A. I would tell every U.S. consumer product company: Your product will probably work in China, but not necessarily in the same way. You\u2019ll need some diagnostics on your pricing and your selection and then probably need to do some engineering on how you merchandise your product. The N.F.L. has a very powerful brand, but it\u2019s not powerful in China. The N.F.L. realizes it has to do a lot of outreach activity to explain the game, so the N.F.L. is heavily active in social media in China. One of our flagship stores is Totes, the umbrella and rainwear company. In the U.S., the brand is positioned as a very functional, utilitarian brand.

I have to say that I find it fascinating and revealing that Steve Jobs was personally in the mix of all this while companies like Adobe and Intel delegated it away from their chief executives. Actually, this is one of the things I liked about Steve Jobs. He was hands-on when it was a critically important issue for Apple, and he put his own butt on the line. \u201cIf you hire a single one of these people, that means war,\u201d he told competitors.", "When employees got wind of the secret collaboration, they filed a class-action lawsuit, arguing that the collaboration suppressed wages. The primary motivation seems to have been to retain talent, but no doubt a direct consequence was that it also kept a lid on salaries.", "This is a tough issue because both sides think they are right.", "The former employees say it is illegal because it prevents them from earning a better living. They are very much aware that the secret pact violated the very free market principles that helped all of these companies demand higher pricing and earn higher profits. And they are correct.", "But as an entrepreneur who built a fast-growth company, I see the other side, too. The employees affected by the secret talks were not exactly coal miners who had been exposed to black lung disease and low wages. Total compensation ranged from $100,000 to $1 million and more. And, boy, it hurts so badly when you invest time, money and resources to ramp up new hires and then they walk out the door for a few dollars. Not only do you lose your investment in the employees, they also often take your intellectual property, your business processes and critical customer information. It can be a huge and demoralizing loss for the culture and the profits of a company.", "But there are things that can be done to make it better \u2013 things that don\u2019t involve secret meetings and breaking the law. In fact, I put a dent in this problem with the information technology company I founded, STI, where we had a consulting division that would train new hires on how to customize software and then bill them out at $2,000 a day. Even taking into account the substantial cost of training those employees and the risk we were taking and the customer-acquisition costs, there was a lot of margin between the full-time salaries and the revenue generated from their billable hours. Of course, those margins were even greater for competitors that were able to lure away our already-trained employees, which is why they were able to offer to pay them more.", "It was especially embarrassing to lose one of these employees because they were our connection with our clients. Our chief financial officer would just frown at me when he heard one was leaving. Then one day it hit me: When recently hired employees leave, it costs them nothing. They come out ahead on the separation. Likewise, my competitors make money because they bill their clients for work that I trained the employees to do. So I came up with the idea of a new hire \u201cbreak-up fee,\u201d much the way there\u2019s a break-up fee in merger talks when one side decides to walk away after a deal has been struck.", "Here\u2019s how it worked: We offered talented new hires an ascending salary structure that started low but guaranteed automatic increases each month. These employees started at about 50 percent less than market rate, but by month 12 they were 20 percent ahead of the market. By the end of the second year, they were 40 percent ahead of the market, and by year five they could be as much as 100 percent ahead of the market \u2014 and worth every penny.", "The idea worked because it attracted people with a long-term mentality and because, if they did choose to leave, they had something to lose. It did take us longer to find people who were willing to sign up for what I called the new deal but once they came on board, their hearts and minds were with us. While I\u2019m sure there are other ways to solve this problem, this one worked for us, and I\u2019m sure it would work for others as well.", "This problem is not going away. Whether they are in Silicon Valley or New York or Atlanta or anywhere in between, when entrepreneurs gather, they talk about how hard and how expensive it is to hire real talent, especially top computer engineers.

The number of millennials entering the workforce does not match the number of baby boomers leaving it, and these crucial positions already have an unemployment rate of less than zero.

Barnes & Noble has struggled to compete in the online retail and e-book market after its Nook e-reader was overwhelmed by more popular devices from Amazon and Apple.", "For the quarter that ended Aug. 2, the first in its 2015 fiscal year, the company reported revenue of $1.23 billion, down from $1.33 billion in the same period a year ago. It had a net loss of $28.4 million, or 56 cents a share, an improvement over last year\u2019s first quarter, when it posted a net loss of $87 million, or $1.56 a share. The loss was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.

In an effort to offset the losses from the Nook, Barnes & Noble is spinning off its Nook Media division into a separate business from its retail stores, a move it aims to complete by the end of March 2015.", "The decision to spin off the Nook unit led to a rise in the company\u2019s stock price earlier this year.

Arguably, though, Scott was really chasing what contemporary observers call a sufferfest. He set himself up for trouble: Scott brought Manchurian and Siberian ponies that quickly fell through the snow and ice; he planned, in part, for his crew to \u201cman-haul,\u201d meaning that the men would pull sleds full of gear, instead of relying on dogs. Even when Scott\u2019s men faltered, they continued collecting specimens, including rocks. The expedition ended terribly; everybody who made the push to the pole died. Miserable, starving and frostbitten, one of Scott\u2019s last four men killed himself by walking into a blizzard without even bothering to put on his boots.", "In the taxonomy of travelers, the word \u201cexplorer\u201d suggests a morally superior pioneer, a man or woman who braves the battle against nature to discover new terrain, expanding our species\u2019 understanding of the world. \u201cAdventurer,\u201d by contrast, implies a self-indulgent adrenaline junkie, who scares loved ones by courting puerile risk. The former, obviously, is the far better title, but it\u2019s tough to claim these days. The world is Google-mapped. Reaching the actual virgin territory of space or the deep ocean requires resources that few possess. In short, the noble fig leaf of terra incognita has fallen away and laid bare the peripatetic, outsize bravado of Scott\u2019s kindred spirits. The resulting itineraries are pretty strange. We now have guys like Felix Baumgartner sky-diving from a balloon-borne capsule at 128,100 feet.", "Baumgartner falls squarely \u2014 and for more than four minutes, breaking the speed of sound \u2014 into the adventurer camp. But then there\u2019s Sarah Marquis, who perhaps should be seen as an explorer like Scott, born in the wrong age. She is 42 and Swiss, and has spent three of the past four years walking about 10,000 miles by herself, from Siberia through the Gobi Desert, China, Laos and Thailand, then taking a cargo boat to Brisbane, Australia, and walking across that continent. Along the way, like Scott, she has starved, she has frozen, she has (wo)man-hauled. She has pushed herself at great physical cost to places she wanted to love but ended up feeling, as Scott wrote of the South Pole in his journal: \u201cGreat God! This is an awful place.\u201d Despite planning a ludicrous trip, and dying on it, Scott became beloved and, somewhat improbably, hugely respected. Marquis, meanwhile, can be confounding. \u201cYou tell people what you\u2019re doing, and they say, \u2018You\u2019re crazy,\u2019 \u201d Marquis told me. \u201cIt\u2019s never: \u2018Cool project, Sarah! Go for it.\u2019 \u201d Perhaps this is because the territory Marquis explores is really internal \u2014 the nature of fear, the limits of stamina and self-reliance and the meaning of traveling in nature as a female human animal, alone.", "Meeting Marquis is strange if you\u2019ve only seen her trip photos. In those, she is filthy, her hair is a rat\u2019s nest and her eyes are introspective, beseeching and very alert. In person, she\u2019s beautiful and charming; she always has a smile for waiters and cabdrivers, and her bangs are so well cut that they make her seem French. (Marquis\u2019s hairdresser squashed her idea of shaving her head for her recent trek, saying, \u201cAfter all the work we\u2019ve done?!\u201d)", "Marquis grew up in Montsevelier, a village of 500 people in the Jura Mountains, in what Marquis describes as \u201cthe northern part of Switzerland \u2014 it\u2019s not the nice part.\u201d Her father, who worked as an engineer, paid Marquis one franc for every 100 slugs she picked out of the family garden. She befriended the family ewe, Moumou, and trained the pet rabbit to come when called. She liked people less. \u201cMy mom had nine sisters, and my dad had eight sisters and brothers, and those aunts and uncles all had three or four kids, so it was a big, screaming family, and for me it was a nightmare,\u201d Marquis told me when I met her last winter in Washington. At age 8 she ran into the woods with her dog and spent the night in a cave. Marquis\u2019s mother called the police, but when Marquis returned, her mother didn\u2019t scold. Fighting Marquis\u2019s wanderlust was hopeless.", "When she was 16, Marquis answered a classified ad for a train company that promised free travel. She loved the idea of seeing Paris and Milan, but once Marquis started work, her colleagues, almost all of whom were older men, harassed her relentlessly. On the first day one man claimed he could smell that Marquis had her period. The experience was a boot camp \u2014 punishing but character-strengthening. \u201cI learned how to build myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI built the tough skin I needed for later on. I learned how men worked.\u201d", "Marquis\u2019s desire to travel began to coalesce around the question of whether she could survive by herself in nature. First, she decided to ride a horse across Turkey. On that trip, she ate apricots off trees and slept with her head on her saddle. Muslim women bathed her in warm goat\u2019s milk. But after that, Marquis\u2019s itineraries veered away from romance and pleasure into solitude and suffering. In her early 20s she flew to New Zealand and set out on a four-day backpacking trip with some noodles, a huge radio and three or four books \u2014 \u201ceverything except what I needed.\u201d The outing, by typical standards, was a fiasco. Day 1 it poured; Marquis didn\u2019t know how to set up her tent, and she was freezing and bored because, she now said wryly, \u201cat night there was nothing to do.\u201d But near the end of the trip she had a sort-of epiphany. \u201cSomething happened,\u201d she said. (Articulating her reasons for pursuing her travels is not one of Marquis\u2019s strengths.) \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve had this feeling again and again.\u201d Chasing that inexplicable sensation is why she walks.", "Marquis spent the winter after that trip earning money by bartending in Verbier, a fancy off-piste ski resort in the Alps. The next summer she returned to New Zealand. This time she walked into the South Island\u2019s Kahurangi National Park without food to see if she could survive for 30 days. That trip, too, was a trial. Marquis failed at spearfishing, consumed only mussels and lost 20 pounds. But she not only recaptured that inchoate feeling she craved; she also glimpsed the savageness of her desire. \u201cThat was the first time I actually got in touch with the wild,\u201d Marquis said. \u201cYou know when you\u2019re really, really hungry? You have to teach yourself that food is not a big issue. You just need sleep and sweet water.\u201d", "Marquis returned to Switzerland and embraced the cycle \u2014 work for money, then leave on some extreme challenge she devised for herself. She canoed through Canada\u2019s Algonquin park without knowing how to portage; she was attacked by beavers camping near water in Patagonia; she hiked the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail. She remained captivated by what she describes as \u201cthis wild call from inside me\u201d and decided to walk 8,700 miles around Australia.", "For that trip, Marquis lined up her first sponsor, the North Face. She doesn\u2019t think she impressed the company by her pitch. She believes it gave her a few backpacks, a couple of tents and some clothes because, she said, \u201cwhen I told them what I was going to do, they thought, We can\u2019t let that little thing go out without gear.\u201d To supplement the inadequate supply of noodles she could carry, Marquis brought a slingshot, a blow gun, some wire to make snares and a net for catching insects. In the warm months, Marquis ate goannas, geckos and bearded dragons. In the cold months, when the reptiles hid, she subsisted on an Aboriginal standby, witchetty grubs \u2014 white, caterpillar-size moth larvae that live in the roots of Mulga trees. (Raw, Marquis said, they taste like unsweetened condensed milk; seared in hot sand, they crisp up nicely.) Throughout, Marquis tried to minimize human contact. She hid her femininity with loose clothes, big sunglasses, hair piled up in a hat. When water was scarce, she collected condensation, either by digging a deep hole and lining the cool bottom with plastic or by tying a tarp around a bush. If those techniques didn\u2019t yield enough liquid \u2014 and they rarely did \u2014 she drank snake blood. At night Marquis slept close to the trunks of trees, touching the bark in a way that she describes as \u201calmost carnal.\u201d She fell in love with a particular twisted and wind-bent Western myall tree on Australia\u2019s Nullarbor Plain.", "On June 20, 2010, Marquis\u2019s 38th birthday, she set out to walk from Siberia through Asia and, once back in Australia, trek to her beloved tree. The video of Marquis walking away from her starting point in Irkutsk feels like the setup for a horror film. \u201cHello, O.K., so here we are,\u201d she said just before turning away from the camera. \u201cTime to go now!\u201d On her back is a 75-pound pack, and trailing behind her, overflowing with gear secured by bungee cords, is a custom-made cart that looks like a cross between a wheelbarrow and a giant roller bag \u2014 her dry-land sled. After Australia, Marquis couldn\u2019t handle slaughtering more animals; she says it felt \u201clike killing a friend.\u201d So she decided to carry rice and hard biscuits (the latter inedible without \u201ca nice, hot cup of tea\u201d), which meant she would need to pull a cart. It now weighed 120 pounds.", "To prepare for the expedition, Marquis spent two years walking or snowshoeing 20 miles a day, wearing 75 pounds. On the trip itself, she carried, among other things, five pairs of underwear, a large pocketknife, wide-spectrum antibiotics, tea-tree oil for massaging her feet, a solar-powered charger, a beacon, a BlackBerry, a satellite phone, Crocs, a compass, a tiny emergency stash of amphetamines (\u201cthat\u2019s the backup backup backup of the backup; in case you lose a foot and you need to get out and not feel a thing\u201d) and pink merino-wool pajamas (\u201cyou put them on and you feel good, you feel gorgeous\u201d).", "The afternoon she departed from Irktusk, Marquis walked just a few miles and set down her load. \u201cThat first day I don\u2019t even eat or do anything,\u201d Marquis explains. \u201cBy that point, I\u2019m so exhausted, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d", "In truth, the first six months on Marquis\u2019s trips are always harrowing. She describes it as \u201cthe washing machine\u201d: endless agitation, physical pain, emotional pain, nonstop bargaining among opposing internal voices \u2014 the inner demons that whisper, Remember the delicious foam on the cafe latte? and the inner angels that reprimand, Coffee isn\u2019t accessible now, so why talk about it? \u201cYou can\u2019t move your hands, you can\u2019t move your feet, you just want to die,\u201d Marquis said. \u201cYou think about sleep all the time, because maybe sleep will set things straight.\u201d", "A few months into her journey, Marquis shot a video of herself in her sleeping bag. Like a hostage clutching a newspaper, she holds a thermometer that reads minus 20 Celsius. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep much these days. I do not know what time it is. Maybe midnight, or something like that?\u201d In the next day\u2019s video, she looks wrecked. The previous night a wind- and sandstorm ripped across the Mongolian plains. To keep the nylon of her tent from tearing, Marquis removed the metal poles holding it up. But she still feared the gales would blow away her gear, so she unzipped herself from her collapsed shelter and lay atop her pack, tent and cart.", "Another night during those first months, while Marquis camped on a vast, overgrazed steppe that she describes as looking like an ugly golf course, she heard horses galloping toward her. The visitors turned out to be Mongol horsemen, all in traditional overcoat-like deels, making a vodka-fueled raid on her camp. After trying to steal her tent, they rode off. But for weeks, in the evenings, the men returned, treating Marquis, she said, as \u201cthe little entertainment.\u201d To protect herself, she began waking before dawn, walking until midafternoon, then looking for a place to hide for the night \u2014 if possible, in a cement sewage pipe. \u201cEverything is going on under those roads,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is waste. There are dead sheep. But for me it was not a problem. I was safe.\u201d", "Eventually, however, Marquis passed out of Mongol territory. The washing-machine cycle ended. Her body changed, and her mind changed, too. Her senses sharpened to the point that she could smell shampoo on a tourist\u2019s hair from a mile away. \u201cOne day you walk 12 hours, and you don\u2019t feel pain,\u201d Marquis said. The past and present telescope down to an all-consuming now. \u201cThere is no before or after. The intellect doesn\u2019t drive you anymore. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore. You become what nature needs you to be: this wild thing.\u201d", "As Francis Spufford writes in his history of British polar exploration, \u201cI May Be Some Time,\u201d for ages, men have wandered intentionally into extreme hardship, and they \u201care notoriously bad at saying why.\u201d Marquis and her female peers \u2014 women who, say, walk across the Sahara alone with a camel or pull a 200-pound sled to the South Pole \u2014 don\u2019t explain it much better. \u201cPeople always ask, \u2018Was it something in your childhood?\u2019 \u201d says Felicity Aston, the first woman to ski solo across Antarctica. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it endlessly: no.\u201d", "The rest of Marquis\u2019s trip was not all Zen bliss. Seven months into the walk, she lost a molar. Her gum abscessed, and the attendant infection, which couldn\u2019t be controlled with the antibiotics, started moving down her neck, and she had to be evacuated from Mongolia. Marquis returned to the precise G.P.S. coordinates she left and made it to China, where, one day, some children followed her. She sang with them and taught them how to set up her tent \u2014 and then they stole her BlackBerry. In Laos, drug dealers descended on Marquis\u2019s camp one night, firing their automatic weapons into the air. Soon after that, Marquis contracted dengue fever. She tied her left leg to a tree so she wouldn\u2019t wander off in her delirium and drown herself in a river.", "The trip smoothed out during the last year. Thailand was uneventful. Australia was lovely, despite the heat and the last couple of hundred miles, when Marquis\u2019s legs cramped so badly that it was difficult to walk. She wrote a book about the experience, \u201cWild by Nature\u201d (available only in French). The last page is profoundly anticlimactic. \u201cI have arrived,\u201d Marquis writes. \u201cI touch the back of the tree with my right hand. \u2018I\u2019m back, darling.\u2019 I sit down.\u201d", "In Washington last winter, Marquis met with people from the National Geographic Speakers Bureau, because that\u2019s what explorers do (and pretty much have always done): come home and sell their stories. It was nine months after re-entry into mainstream life, and she was happy to return to some physical comforts: sleeping in a bed, taking two baths a day. But she found being among people overwhelming, and her senses remained so acute that even just sitting in a cafeteria was grating. \u201cYou hear the dishwasher?\u201d Marquis asked me, pointing toward an unseen kitchen. I shook my head. Marquis said, resigned, \u201cThere\u2019s a radio playing back there, too.\u201d", "Marquis plans to return to northwest Australia in 2016. She said it\u2019s her \u201cdream to go with just a sarong and a knife\u201d \u2014 the ultimate test of survival. It\u2019s hard not to wonder where these urges come from. Geneticists, neuroscientists, psychologists and religious scholars have all taken stabs at answering, with unsatisfying results. But perhaps the real reason to court a sufferfest \u2014 to explore or adventure, or whatever you want to call it \u2014 is that it makes a person feel alive. The literature of survival is weirdly upbeat. A few days before dying, in 1912, Robert Falcon Scott wrote a letter telling a friend that he wished that friend were with him \u201cto hear our songs and the cheery conversation.\u201d The day of his death, Scott said of his trip, \u201cHow much better has it been than lounging in too great comfort at home.\u201d", "Of course, if you don\u2019t die \u2014 well, then the experience of extreme travel is fantastic. After swimming across a river infested with crocodiles, Marquis wrote that every time she finds herself in the bush, \u201cmy happiness increases tenfold.\u201d Perhaps among the purest expressions of joy ever recorded is of the Norwegian explorer Aleksander Gamme on the 86th day of his unsupported 1,410-mile expedition from Hercules Inlet to the South Pole and back in 2012. Desperately hungry and dreadlocked, he comes upon a cache that he buried in the snow for himself a few months earlier. From the frozen duffel he pulls matches, Vaseline and zinc ointment. Then he starts screaming: \u201cYEAAAAA! AAAAHHH! HAHA! YEAA! WHOOOWHOOO.\u201d His elation at seeing a double pack of Cheez Doodles might be greater than any most of us will feel in our entire lives."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/technology/can-apple-build-a-cool-and-convenient-iwatch.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is trying to have another iPod experience.", "The company was not the first to create a digital music player when it introduced the iPod 13 years ago.

The catalog offers no new research. Its most substantial entries are a reprinted 2007 essay by the art historian David Joselit and reproductions of Paik manuscripts from an archive donated by his nephew Ken Hakuta to the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, which did its own full-scale Paik survey in 2012-13.", "Still, the show is worthy of notice, because Paik is, as is quite evident here, a prescient thinker as well as a born entertainer. And its very presence at Asia Society raises at least one relatively unexplored question: How American was he? Although he based the better part of his long career in New York, he always seemed to be geographically unfixed and culturally unaligned, an existential floater who made some of his most interesting art from pixels and sound waves bounced off satellites circling in space.", "Paik (pronounced pake) was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1932, the youngest son of a wealthy businessman. In advance of the Korean War, the family moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and Japan a year later. At Tokyo University, Paik studied art and music, writing an undergraduate thesis on Arnold Schoenberg. In 1956, he pursued further musical studies in Germany where, in a kind of conversion experience, he met the visiting composer John Cage.", "Cage, with his punctilious zaniness and absorption in Zen Buddhism, was a crucial, liberating influence. Paik, also a Buddhist, ran with the influence and elaborated on it. In addition to composing music, he began experimenting with sculpture, performance and what were at the time still front-edge electronic media: television, personal videotape recorders, primitive home computers. And he combined them with a sensationalist flair pitched to a popular audience.", "Returning to Japan in 1964, he funneled this geekish theatricality into creating his first life-size, remote-controlled robot in collaboration with an electronics engineer, Shuya Abe. Named Robot K-456 \u2014 the reference is to a Mozart piano concerto \u2014 and now on loan from a German collection, it\u2019s the first thing we see in the show, and it\u2019s quite a sight. A futuristic antique, its mechanics now look fragile in the extreme, but its oddness and wit are intact.", "Originally fitted with female breasts and male genitalia (the penis was removed when the robot was shipped to a censorship-prone New York City the same year), K-456 was designed to be sociable, political and a little gross. Rolling down a city sidewalk, it waved, bowed, broadcast a tape of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1961 inaugural speech, and periodically defecated white beans. Like much of Paik\u2019s work, it was both conceptually sophisticated and kid stuff, the way Ryan Trecartin\u2019s comic-apocalyptic YouTube productions are now.", "It was also a prototype for more polished things to come. In the 1980s, Paik built a family of robots \u2014 father, mother, baby \u2014 from stacked-up vintage television monitors. Looking as monumental and boxy as armored samurai, the figures didn\u2019t move, but were internally animated by video montages playing on their many screens with images of war planes, Korean porcelains, African crowds and abstract shapes flashing by too fast to be taken in at a glance but constantly repeated, like online news.", "Paik made a variety of such video sculptures. Some took a swipe at a knee-jerk celebration of technological \u201cprogress.\u201d The interactive 1968 \u201cTV Chair\u201d has no more elevated function than to video-surveil a given sitter\u2019s derri\u00e8re. At the same time, Paik fully understood that technology was here to stay, commanding and inexorable, and he wanted to use art to soften its effects, reduce its might, tease it, tweak it, make it enlightenment friendly. One way he maintained this perspective was by working with like-minded human collaborators, mostly artists, with the most important being Charlotte Moorman.", "Moorman was born in Little Rock, Ark., in 1933. She studied musical composition at Centenary College in Shreveport, La., but also trained as an instrumentalist and in 1957 moved to New York to study the cello at Juilliard. Although she played the standard repertoire and did a stint with Leopold Stokowski\u2019s American Symphony Orchestra, she was attracted to experimental music and gained a reputation for playing the unplayable, including some of Cage\u2019s more intensely micromanaged scores. With her full figure, cascading dark hair and pale skin, she was a charismatic visual presence onstage. Paik met her in New York in 1964, and they bonded instantly.", "Both thrived on controversy. Paik was eager to give vanguard music, so spiky and taxing, the sensuous aura he felt was necessary to attract a general audience. He looked to Moorman to provide that, and she did. For a piece called \u201cCello Sonata No. 1 for Adults Only\u201d she played Bach while doing a striptease. She performed Paik\u2019s composition \u201cOpera Sextronique\u201d in the nude, as called for by the score, and earned news headlines \u2014 far more valuable than reviews \u2014 when she was arrested on a charge of public indecency.", "In part because she was a woman, and one who at least ostensibly exploited traditional models of femininity, her role in late-20th-century American vanguard culture has been undervalued, though not by Paik. After her death from breast cancer in 1991, he created a memorial tribute to her at the 1993 Venice Biennale, with articles of her clothing floating like spirits on high. That installation is replicated in the Asia Society show, organized by Michelle Yun, the museum\u2019s curator of modern and contemporary art. And a new book, \u201cTopless Cellist: The Improbable Life of Charlotte Moorman\u201d by Joan Rothfuss, due in mid-October from the MIT Press, gives a full and evenhanded account of her accomplishments.", "The book provides exactly the kind of fresh, re-evaluative information the catalog lacks, but even without it, the show lets us see Paik in a somewhat new light, not as an Asian artist, exactly, but not as a Western artist either, or even as an artist generically \u201cglobal.\u201d Specific references to Asia recur in his work: A robot brandishes a book of verse by the great Tang dynasty poet Li Po (A.D. 701-762); a statue of a meditating Buddha contemplates its own image on a video screen. The paint-smeared late televisions, mere souvenirs of a long career, suggest the brash, hand-altered, recycling spirit of technological culture in Beijing and Mumbai today.", "And then there\u2019s the installation \u201cThree Camera Participation/Participation TV\u201d (1969/2001) in a gallery of its own. Consisting of three cameras, a video monitor and a projector, the piece barely exists until someone enters and activates it. Only when you walk in front of the cameras does an image appear: your own, as three hazy colored silhouettes \u2014 red, green and blue \u2014 on the monitor and as a kind of barely embodied aura on the gallery wall. Step out of camera range, and the image is gone. In much of his art, Paik used technology, busy and brash, to create the equivalent of the wake-up slap of Zen master. Very occasionally, as here, he uses it to say something about nothing \u2014 about words, and information, and connectivity going away \u2014 and that takes mastery, too."], "https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/train-2/": ["", "Before we get to this week\u2019s puzzle \u2014 several days ago I asked Donald Knuth, the legendary computer scientist currently at Stanford University, how he would have solved our recent Bugs on a Square problem, which is a classic among software engineers.

And then he followed with a fitting analogy for the kind of puttering that defines Numberplay.", "When you\u2019re trying to solve a problem, you initially spend a lot of time in the foothills. Your progress is very slow. Then you reach a point where you can carry the problem with you, and your progress becomes very rapid.

The inaptly named \u201cSprinter\u201d (it\u2019s the slower, local train) stops first at Zuid, then at Noord, on its way to Amsterdam. It\u2019s about a 15-minute walk to either station, and it takes 5 minutes for the train to travel between the two stations.", "Trains come every 15 minutes, right on the dot, but I never remember what the scheduled times are \u2013 so one minute is as likely as another. If I want to get to work as quickly as possible, does it matter which station I walk to? What if I really care about how long I have to stand on the platform, but don\u2019t mind being late? What if I value a minute waiting equally to a minute late?", "But the trains in Holland are not always spot on time. Imagine they come down the track at (uniformly) random intervals, say between 10 and 20 minutes? Can I get an advantage (either in arrival time or in waiting time) by walking to one station vs. the other?", "Finally, in either of these scenarios, does it make a difference if, like a good Dutchman, I ride my bicycle to the station instead of walking, which takes only 5 minutes?", "That concludes this week\u2019s puzzle.

It makes sense to head to Noord. The most intuitive way I see this is, at any given time the train has a 5/15 = 1/3 probability of being between Zuid and Noord. Since you would arrive at both stations station at the same (random) time, you would have probability p of missing the train at Zuid and catching it at Noord and thus arriving early. (Thus it also doesn\u2019t matter if you take a bicycle).", "As far as waiting goes, the complicated way is to compare outcomes: since the train arrives later at Noord, you do inevitably wait 5 minutes longer there in cases where you would have caught the same train. But the expected platform waiting time at each station is equal: the longer waits at Noord are exactly balanced out by longer waits at Zuid when the train is between stations. The distribution of the difference is unfriendly per Eric #10:", "You can never save time by traveling South. The easiest way to see that is to recognize that you go the same speed traveling both directions, which means that, by the time the train you could catch at the south station arrives at the north station 5 minutes later, you were necessarily waiting there at least five minutes.", "However, there are instances where you save time by going North; as Frank said, that happens when there is a train between stations when you arrive there. The probability of that is essentially the interval (which we are told varies between 10 and 20 minutes) divided by the time between stations (which is five minutes). So there is something between a 25% and 50% chance that you will get to work five minutes earlier by going North.", "Oddly, going South seems to save you time on the platform, but not really. If the train is between platforms only 25% of the time, for example, then the wait will be shorter at the South station 75% of the time. But this ignores that the other 25% of the time you miss big by going south (a one minute wait at north station becomes a 21 minute wait at south station). The mean waiting time is the same; but the odds of waiting at all are longer up north. If you REALLY hate having to wait on the train platform AT ALL, I suppose you could go South.", "Alternatively: simply observe that a train comes every 15 minutes and you arrive at either platform at a random time. So the expected wait time will be equal, with the difference in overall travel time driven by the cases where you would have missed the train at Zuid.", "Finally, a couple of observations on math & puzzles & life in general. I find that these kinds of decisions are interesting potential sources for puzzles. So, for instance: if I am walking and my destination is across the street, several blocks down, should I cross the street as soon as I have an opportunity, or save my option until later? If I am driving a long distance, does my cost-benefit tradeoff for speeding change as I approach my destination?", "This puzzle had the advantage of being relatively easy to specify (and simpler to solve). Indeed, the challenge is finding any reason to walk Zuid, as several commenters pointed out!", "Finally, the everyday/real-life nature of the puzzle raised a kind of \u201cdueling intuitions\u201d \u2013 for me, at least.

Taobao is a frenetic and eclectic online bazaar that offers a huge range of goods. Tmall, by contrast, is a more refined platform that established brands use to sell their goods. Together, Alibaba\u2019s marketplaces sold $296 billion worth of goods in the 12 months through the end of June, which is estimated to be more than Amazon and eBay combined.", "Facebook\u2019s public offering faltered in 2012 when it became clear that the company did not yet have a strong footing in mobile devices. But Alibaba appears to be handling the retailing transition to mobile devices. In the second quarter of this year, mobile accounted for a third of the value of goods sold on Alibaba\u2019s Chinese marketplaces, up from 12 percent in the same period a year earlier.", "Alibaba is also reaping enormous profits from the torrent of commerce that takes place on its websites. In the second quarter, it made 43 cents of operating profits for every dollar of revenue, a staggering margin for a large, fast-growing company. Sometimes, outsize margins can be an indicator that a firm is somehow managing to overcharge \u2014 an advantage that might lessen as competition increases. But investors assert that the fees and commissions that Alibaba charges its sellers seem to be in line with those of its rivals.", "\u201cThere is no evidence that it is gouging its customers, despite its dominance,\u201d said Alistair Way, a fund manager at Standard Life Investments.", "And even though consumers\u2019 habits can change quickly, especially on the Internet, Alibaba\u2019s fans expect it to remain dominant.

James Cordwell of Atlantic Equities, for instance, says that Alibaba is worth about $100 a share, or 30 times the $3.35 a share that he estimates the company will make in profits in 2016. Alibaba, he contends, deserves a multiple of 30 times because that is in line with other Chinese Internet companies \u2014 and because he expects Alibaba\u2019s earnings to grow at about 30 percent a year.", "\u201cAlibaba is highly profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is easier to value than Facebook and Twitter at their I.P.O.s.\u201d", "But even bullish analysts like Mr. Cordwell have their concerns.", "A big one is whether Alibaba will eventually end up spending a lot of money to stockpile goods and distribute them, potentially depleting future profitability. Right now, a main attraction of Alibaba is that it does not consume large amounts of cash holding inventory, as is the custom for most retailers, including Amazon. Like eBay, Alibaba merely matches buyers and sellers. Nor has Alibaba used up cash building its own fully fledged distribution network. Given the size of the company\u2019s business, such a network would most likely be punitively expensive. Alibaba has, however, invested in a joint venture with delivery companies to establish a logistics network.", "But rivals that are building their own networks may do better in crucial parts of the market. JD.com, a Chinese online retailer that focuses on electronics, has its own logistics network \u2014 and analysts say that it appears to be notching up better electronics sales than Alibaba in China\u2019s largest cities.", "\u201cIt suggests that its fulfillment capacity is giving it a competitive edge in these cities,\u201d Mr. Cordwell said.", "Beyond its financial performance, Alibaba presents investors with other potential headaches. Its offering effectively asks investors to give up some basic rights and protections.", "As is the case with any public company, outside investors have no real way of testing the accuracy of the Alibaba\u2019s financial filings. Investors usually expect outside auditors to assess a company\u2019s books. And American investors might take some comfort in the fact that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regulates audit firms, to help ensure they are doing their job. But the Chinese government does not allow the board to inspect Chinese audit firms. And the regulator has not inspected Alibaba\u2019s auditor, PricewaterhouseCooper\u2019s affiliate in Hong Kong.", "Alibaba\u2019s corporate structure is another reason to pause.", "The actual entity that is going public, the Alibaba Group, is not based in the United States, but in the Cayman Islands. This entity also does not give investors a true ownership stake in Alibaba\u2019s operating businesses. Instead, the Alibaba Group merely has contractual rights to profits from the businesses, an arrangement that allows foreign investors to effectively find a way around Chinese law that would otherwise ban such investment. Adding to concerns over control, Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, has majority stakes in the company\u2019s underlying Chinese entities.", "Shareholders might find it hard to rein in Mr. Ma and his associates if they make decisions that outside shareholders disagree with. This fear arose a few years ago when Mr. Ma unexpectedly spun out Alipay, the company\u2019s payments business, causing a rift with Yahoo, which has a big stake in Alibaba.", "The questions about Mr. Ma\u2019s latitude reasserted themselves after Alibaba made a string of deals that recently raised eyebrows. In April, the company lent $1 billion to Simon Xie, one of its founders, to finance an investment. Alibaba also took a stake in a Chinese soccer team this year. And after buying a movie production company, Alibaba said that it might have unearthed accounting irregularities at the firm, suggesting it did not do good due diligence.", "The acquisition numbers are not insignificant: The $1.85 billion that Alibaba spent on acquisitions in the second quarter exceeded the $1.64 billion in cash flows from the company\u2019s operations.", "Still, for now, the issues of control and oversight may not be enough to derail Alibaba\u2019s strong financial performance.", "\u201cIf you are looking for growth, this company is offering that,\u201d Mr. Ahern, the mutual fund manager, said.", ""], "https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/change-of-heart/": ["THURSDAY\u2019S PUZZLE \u2014 O.K., here\u2019s the thing: I watched a lot of people solve this puzzle \u2014 or try to solve it \u2014 at Lollapuzzoola last month, and the results made even the judges grading the puzzles weep. So if you\u2019re still wondering what just happened to you, this is the guy (below right) you should be mad at.

Let\u2019s forget about piddling topics like abbreviations and partials and cluing for today, and just look at what Mr. Blindauer hath wrought.", "On the face of it, this seems like a fairly straightforward puzzle, with easy cluing.

When was the last time you remember seeing a title on a weekday puzzle? We\u2019re supposed to have a \u201cChange of Heart,\u201d as the title suggests, and I don\u2019t think that Mr. Blindauer and Will Shortz are hinting at perhaps abandoning crossword solving and finding another hobby. They want us to change something in the grid.", "So we\u2019re going to go slowly on this one, because it\u2019s easy to get yourself into a tizzy about which letter to change and when.

The middle letter in some of the entries \u2014 the heart of the entry \u2014 will change. 3 Down is OAK, so MOUSE becomes MOOSE.", "At 17 Across: The clue \u201cDismantle\u201d is pretty easy. That would be TAKE APART. So far, so good. But we\u2019re going to have a change of heart when we get to 5 Down. The \u201cCow in Borden ads\u201d is, of course, ELSIE. Hey, wait! There\u2019s an A where you\u2019re supposed to write that S. There\u2019s your change. Write the S over the A and then help yourself to a piece of chocolate. No, leave the bag out. You\u2019re going to need it.", "Your job is to find these changes and make them appropriately, so that you wind up with the Downs as your final answer.

Talk about serendipity.", "Oh, and speaking of irony: the change of heart in the southeast \u2014 where people seemed to have made the most mistakes, probably because of exhaustion, is from FIRE EATER to FIRE WATER, which everyone could probably use after solving this puzzle.

Patrick and Brian visited me before the tournament to borrow some supplies, though, and they told me about some of the cool things they had scheduled, including this. I asked if I could run it in The Times. But for when? It didn\u2019t feel wacky enough for a Sunday variety puzzle, or open enough gridwise for a Saturday. So I scheduled it for a Thursday (today), which is typically the hardest theme day. I know this hybrid of a crossword/variety puzzle is not to everyone\u2019s taste. I\u2019m prepared for the \u201chate\u201d comments! Still, solvers who love this will probably really love it, so I think it\u2019s worth running.", "By the way, I changed a few of the tournament clues to make them slightly easier and less trivia-oriented than the originals. For example, not all solvers may know that \u201cPinky or the Brain, e.g.\u201d (Patrick\u2019s clue at 1A) is a MOUSE, or that \u201cGuitarist Saul Hudson of Guns N\u2019 Roses, familiarly\u201d (28D) is SLASH.

It was our dreaded Puzzle 4, meant to be the trickiest puzzle of the day (like Puzzle 5 at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament), though looking at the standings just now, I see that Andrew Feist solved it perfectly in 6:45. Nicely done, Andrew! Some got stumped until they were allowed to use their Google tickets (our sanctioned method of \u201ccheating\u201d), and some solved it, but put two letters in each of the key squares, which we had decided to count as incorrect (sorry!) Also, two solvers had an odd advantage: They chose to compete in our Downs Only Division for the day, so they didn\u2019t have the Across clues to throw them off. As such, Joon Pahk solved the puzzle correctly with only the Down clues in 4:41. Wowza. If anyone had noticed this and done some lateral thinking, it might\u2019ve been a big help in deciphering the puzzle\u2019s diabolical secrets.

It\u2019s hard to find a United States company that\u2019s directly comparable, but Professor Greenwald said eBay comes the closest. Like Alibaba, it has an auction site that benefits from a powerful network effect, it offers a vast e-commerce site and it has a pay system, PayPal.

No one company dominates e-commerce in the United States or in Europe, and none are as large as old-economy Walmart. China may now be underserved by national brick-and-mortar chains, but that could change.

But over eBay\u2019s life as a publicly traded company, its P/E ratio has averaged a little over 26.", "No Chinese Internet company is quite like Alibaba, so comparisons with Chinese stocks are difficult. But Baidu, China\u2019s version of Google, which also benefits from network effects and the growth in Chinese Internet use, has a market capitalization of about $80 billion, and a P/E ratio of 45. Tencent Holdings, which is classified as social media rather than e-commerce, although it has elements of both, is even further afield. Its market capitalization of $147 billion is also smaller than Alibaba\u2019s, although its P/E ratio is a steep 51.", "Alibaba\u2019s valuation may not be outrageous, but to Professor Greenwald, these comparisons are \u201cpretty scary.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hype in Alibaba, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the price.\u201d", "That doesn\u2019t change the Alibaba story, and sometimes a story is enough.

More high-voltage power lines could link wind farms and solar panels in disparate locations, smoothing out the variations. This is politically difficult, but some such lines are being built in both the United States and Germany.", "For Germans, the unpredictability of onshore renewable power explains the appeal of offshore wind. The stiff, steady breezes in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea mean that turbines built there will produce far more power than land turbines.", "That is why three utilities have virtually seized control of the tiny resort island of Heligoland, renting out one hotel for 10 years straight. It is the most convenient body of land to use as an operations base for the huge wind farms they are installing, with long-range plans to go as far as 125 miles offshore.", "The streets of the island are thronged with well-paid workers. \u201cReally, all areas on Heligoland are profiting,\u201d declared Eike Walenda, the manager of a local outfitter and fueling station.", "The costs of building in the sea are far higher than on land, of course. The price tag of up to $30 million per turbine is not just for the machine itself, but also for power cables, installation and many other items. To induce utilities to go forward, the government has had to guarantee them power prices of several times the market rate.", "But, just as with earlier forms of renewable technology, the Germans expect the costs of harnessing offshore wind to drop sharply as the market grows over the coming decade. If that happens, the United States could be a big beneficiary. Studies have shown that offshore wind could supply as much as 15 to 20 percent of the power needed by East Coast cities, and construction is about to start on a handful of American projects.", "For now, the German offshore farms are adding billions to the costs consumers are already bearing for solar panels, onshore wind turbines, biogas plants and the rest of the transition to renewable energy.

They described themselves as Christians who had signed a pledge to run the stores in accordance with \u201cbiblical principles,\u201d including being closed on Sundays.", "The court was also careful to say that public corporations did not qualify. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority, rested this rationale on the problem of divining shareholder beliefs, stating that \u201cthe idea that unrelated shareholders \u2014 including institutional investors with their own set of stakeholders \u2014 would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems improbable.\u201d Instead, the decision was limited to what Justice Alito termed \u201cclosely held corporations.\u201d But he didn\u2019t state exactly what that meant.", "Hobby Lobby is an outlier though \u2014 how many company shareholders sign religious pledges? And so we are left to figure out the difference between Hobby Lobby, owned by a small religious family, and General Electric, with tens of thousands of shareholders.", "The federal government is the first to deal with this issue. The Department of Health and Human Services and other government agencies including the Internal Revenue Service have proposed new rules that would define a \u201cclosely held corporation\u201d for purposes of asserting a religious exemption from the contraceptive requirements of the Affordable Care Act.", "The problem is the government has no idea what to do.", "In the rule proposal, the government does not even try to define a \u201cclosely held corporation.\u201d Instead, it has solicited comments from the public on what the definition should be. In other words, when you have a question you cannot answer, ask it back to divert attention.", "In fairness to the government, it did suggest two possible approaches, though neither seems to comport with the court\u2019s ruling.", "The first approach suggested by the agencies is to define a \u201cclosely held corporation\u201d as one \u201cwhere none of the ownership interests in the entity is publicly traded and where the entity has fewer than a specified number of shareholders or owners. \u201d In other words, a closely held corporation could have only a set number of shareholders. How many shareholders? Well, the government refers to tax provisions that could define a closely held corporation as one with up to 100 shareholders, which could describe most private corporations.", "The second approach would define a \u201cclosely held corporation\u201d as one in which \u201ca specified fraction of the ownership interest is concentrated in a limited and specified number of owners.\u201d Here, the government means that the number of shareholders is not as important as having the bulk of the corporation held by a limited number of them.", "Both government approaches appear to ignore the real basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Justice Alito held that a corporation could assert religious protections under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act when the interests of the corporation and the shareholders were identical so that the religion of the owners could be imputed to the corporation. After all, it would be hard to say that G.E. or even Google, with its \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d mantra, followed a religion, given that companies typically have no common set of interests other than profit.", "If you adopt this approach, the rule that the government should be exploring is one that picks up corporations whose shareholders\u2019 interests are identical to the company\u2019s. It is difficult to think that a for-profit company with 100 shareholders could have interests that aligned perfectly.", "In this vein, perhaps the government might do better to go back to the basics and focus on corporate law. Many corporate law experts have been skeptical of the logic behind the Hobby Lobby decision. The reason is that one of the chief benefits of a for-profit company is that it has limited liability. Shareholders cannot be held responsible for the debts of the company because it exists separately. Because of this, imputing the intent of the shareholders has always been on thin ice from a corporate law perspective because having a separate existence is the whole reason for creating a corporation in the first place.", "Corporate law also has an answer to this issue, though: veil-piercing. This is an age-old doctrine that courts use to ignore the limited liability shield of a corporation and hold shareholders personally liable. Courts pierce the corporate veil when there is no difference between the shareholders and the company. In other words, veil-piercing looks to whether the identity of the shareholders and the corporation is indistinguishable and they are acting as one. It is typically limited to companies that have only a few shareholders \u2014 certainly fewer than five or so because of the difficulty in identifying mutual interests.", "Whether the court intended to or not, it implicitly endorsed this solution. In his majority opinion, Justice Alito stated: \u201cState corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing structure.\u201d He then wrote, \u201cCourts will turn to that structure and the underlying state law in resolving disputes.\u201d", "In other words, if you follow the court\u2019s inclination, the test appears to be a small number of shareholders \u2014 full stop. Even then, you need to determine that the interests are aligned using veil-piercing doctrine.", "The irony is that the shareholders of companies that assert they can take advantage of the Hobby Lobby decision may find that they are liable for the company\u2019s debts as they acknowledge grounds to pierce the corporate veil.", "For now, we await the public\u2019s input and the government\u2019s decision. Of course, any rule is likely to face a court challenge and could wind up before the Supreme Court again. And perhaps Congress may even get its act together and weigh in. In other words, the fight over which among millions of corporations can assert religious protections has only just begun.", " "], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/technology/google-is-target-of-european-backlash-on-us-tech-dominance.html": ["BRUSSELS \u2014 A top German official called for Google to be broken up.

Supreet Kaur, an economist at Columbia University; Michael Kremer, an economist at Harvard; and I tracked the productivity of Indian data entry workers for over a year. These workers were well motivated. Their pay depended directly on how much data they entered.", "To gauge the extent of their self-control problems, we gave them an offer. Usually the workers were paid 2 rupees for every 100 fields of data they entered. (A field of data typically included a single number containing several digits.) For some, we gave the option of working under a different contract, in which they would choose a target, say 5,000 data fields in a single day. If they failed to hit the target their usual rate of earnings would be cut in half. They would earn only 1 rupee for every 100 fields of data. If they did make the target they would earn exactly the same rate as before, and no more: just 2 rupees per 100 fields.", "At any given level of productivity, this contract paid a rate that was less or the same as the old one, never more. And the workers knew this. Yet they chose it because it helped them work much harder and earn much more. The effect on earnings was as large as the benefit, for data entry workers, of an additional year of education or an increase in their piece rate of 50 percent.", "In fact, Greg Clark, a professor of economics at the University of California, Davis, has gone so far as to argue that the Industrial Revolution was in part a self-control revolution. Many economists, beginning with Adam Smith, have argued that factories \u2014 an important innovation of the Industrial Revolution \u2014 blossomed because they allowed workers to specialize and be more productive.", "Professor Clark argues that work rules truly differentiated the factory. People working at home could start and finish when they wanted, a very appealing sort of flexibility, but it had a major drawback, he said. People ended up doing less work that way.", "Factories imposed discipline. They enforced strict work hours. There were rules for when you could go home and for when you had to show up at the beginning of your shift. If you arrived late you could be locked out for the day. For workers being paid piece rates, this certainly got them up and at work on time. You can even see something similar with the assembly line. Those operations dictate a certain pace of work. Like a running partner, an assembly line enforces a certain speed.", "As Professor Clark provocatively puts it: \u201cWorkers effectively hired capitalists to make them work harder. They lacked the self-control to achieve higher earnings on their own.\u201d", "The data entry workers in our study, centuries later, might have agreed with that statement. In fact, 73 percent of them did agree to this statement: \u201cIt would be good if there were rules against being absent because it would help me come to work more often.\u201d", "Of course with newer forms of technology, showing up for work on time need not mean being physically at a given workplace. A study by the economists Nicholas Bloom, John Roberts and Zhichun Ying of Stanford and James Liang of Peking University looked at call center workers in China. In their experiment, some workers were randomly assigned to work at home, others worked in group call centers. The work habits of both groups were carefully monitored electronically, and the workers knew it. The researchers found that those working at home were 13 percent more productive than those in call centers. With modern technology, we now have so many ways to quantify, track and motivate productivity. We do not need to lock factory doors or even have a factory. Yet we have not yet begun to scratch the surface of motivating production in this way.", "Frederick Taylor, the American efficiency expert, revolutionized manufacturing at the turn of the 20th century with a simple insight. Most manufacturing work was a sequence of physical motions. You would load coal onto a shovel, carry it to a furnace, throw it into the furnace, walk back to the coal pile and repeat. In a time and motion study, he would quantify each step and how long it would take. Then he would analyze how to improve the whole process.", "He noted, for example, that a typical worker could lift 21 pounds for maximum efficiency. Of course, workers varied in size and strength but on average this weight balanced the number of shovel lifts per minute against the volume per lift. In those early days, workers used the same shovel for all materials, irrespective of the density of the stuff being lifted, so less weight was being lifted for the less dense materials. His elegant and simple solution \u2014 bigger scoops for shovels used to haul the less dense materials \u2014 illustrates how careful analysis of a specific work process can increase productivity.", "Today, his time and motion studies feel antiquated. Phone calls and memos have replaced shovels and picks for many workers. Yet despite its association with early factories, a modern version of the spirit of Taylorism is sorely needed. It\u2019s time to identify and optimize the specific psychologies that constitute the mental alchemy of productivity.", "Employers already offer wellness programs to help workers be fit or take their medications. The idea is that these programs will save money because they will decrease health costs and increase productivity.", "That makes sense. But employers also need to tackle the problem of self-control at work. If they do that successfully, we might have another revolution in productivity."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/technology/opposition-grows-in-europe-to-google-antitrust-proposal.html": ["BRUSSELS \u2014 Microsoft and the German publishing industry on Thursday stepped up pressure on the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief to make radical adjustments to a proposed antitrust settlement with Google, or effectively leave resolution of the case to his successor.", "At a news conference in Brussels, a senior lawyer for Microsoft said the company had gathered new evidence to show that the settlement with Google proposed by Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the antitrust chief, would be ineffective at restoring competition.", "\u201cThe current proposal does not put traffic diversion to an end,\u201d Jean-Yves Art, the top antitrust lawyer for Microsoft in Europe, said at the news conference.", "Microsoft, which has long faced antitrust problems of its own in Europe, has up to now kept a relatively low profile in the case against Google.", "The core of the deal between Google and Mr. Almunia, announced in February, is a system that would more prominently display rivals\u2019 search services \u2014 for finding hotels and shopping, among others \u2014 when people conduct Google searches.

How fast can Chinese e-commerce grow?", "Four in every five yuan spent on online shopping in China last year traveled across Alibaba\u2019s websites. So the company\u2019s growth depends on expanding the overall market. The omens are good. Less than half of China\u2019s population had access to the Internet last year; penetration in the United States is more than 80 percent. Alibaba signed up 24 million new active buyers in the three months to June, and the value of transactions was 45 percent higher than in the same period of 2013. Growth of 30 percent for the next two years is not a stretch.", "2. How much revenue can Alibaba generate?", "Alibaba\u2019s business model is to capture a small slice of the value of the transactions it processes, either from advertising or commissions. In the year to March, this \u201cmonetization rate\u201d was 2.55 percent. But almost a third of buying and selling in the most recent quarter took place via handheld devices, where the monetization rate is half the level for desktop transactions. Over time, the gap should close with the figure for desktop transactions \u2013 currently about 3 percent.", "3. Can Alibaba stay extremely profitable?", "Network effects are great for profitability. The more shoppers that Alibaba attracts, the more merchants want to display their goods, luring more buyers. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s asset-light model keeps overheads low. Alibaba\u2019s operating margin in the year to March was an astonishing 47 percent.", "But super-profitability invites competition. Alibaba may be forced to spend more on marketing and technology, or get directly into the business of storing and delivering goods. In the three months to June \u2013 the last set of financial data before the I.P.O. \u2013 product development costs rose by almost 70 percent, while sales and marketing expenses nearly doubled. Alibaba\u2019s operating margin fell to 43 percent, its lowest in almost two years. A still-high level of 40 percent may be a realistic forecast.", "4. How much should you pay for Alibaba\u2019s earnings?\n\nMost tech stocks trade on high price-to-earnings ratios because investors believe future potential exceeds current profitability. Alibaba\u2019s challenge is to grow while keeping its margins. Though stock market multiples are subjective, a market value of 30 times earnings for the year to March 2016 \u2013 the same as rival Tencent \u2013 seems a reasonable starting point.", "5. What about the other parts?", "Alibaba\u2019s ambitions extend far beyond e-commerce. Alipay, its online payment affiliate, is challenging banks with small business loans and money market funds. Though Alibaba has no ownership stake, it receives 37.5 percent of the unit\u2019s pretax profit and has a right to the same proportion of its equity value in an eventual I.P.O.", "Overseas expansion also has value. International sales accounted for less than a tenth of revenue in the most recent financial year. But a recent partnership with Singapore Post shows the company is seriously looking beyond China\u2019s borders. In addition, Alibaba and its affiliates have spent around $7.5 billion on acquisitions and investments so far this year as the company pushes into industries from media to mapping.\n\n6. What is the downside?", "Alibaba\u2019s exposure to its home country is one potential negative. The ruling Communist party could cut Alibaba down to size if it were deemed too powerful. Like other Chinese companies listed in the United States, Alibaba is exposed to continuing battles over accounting regulation and the semi-legal structures listed companies use to control their mainland operations.", "Then there is corporate governance. Its founder and chairman, Jack Ma, wants control of the company to remain with 27 executives, known as partners. Outside shareholders get little say. The likes of Google and Facebook also operate on the whims of their founders. But Mr. Ma has behaved unpredictably in the past, shifting the Alipay business from a listed unit to a private vehicle in 2011.", "Putting it all together", "Valuing future business lines is always tricky, as is putting a discount for shaky governance. The most elegant option is to assume the two cancel each other out.", "Now suppose transactions grow by 30 percent annually for the next two years, and that Alibaba\u2019s overall monetization rate reaches 3 percent. Assume its operating margin stabilizes at 40 percent, apply a historical 15 percent tax rate, and net income in the year to March 2016 would be about $5.25 billion. On a 30 times multiple, Alibaba\u2019s equity would be worth $158 billion.", "It\u2019s not hard to get a higher figure: Lift the annual growth rate to 40 percent and Alibaba\u2019s operating margin to 45 percent, and its market value rises above $200 billion.", "Analysts will have their own assumptions.

I like the definition that the Pluralism Project at Harvard offers on its website: \u201cpluralism is not diversity alone, but the energetic engagement with diversity\u201d because \u201cmere diversity without real encounter and relationship will yield increasing tensions in our societies.\u201d A society being \u201cpluralistic\u201d is a reality (see Syria and Iraq). A society with pluralism \u201cis an achievement\u201d (see America).", "Pluralism, it also notes, \u201cdoes not require us to leave our identities and our commitments behind. ... It means holding our deepest differences, even our religious differences, not in isolation, but in relationship to one another.\u201d And, it posits that real pluralism is built on \u201cdialogue\u201d and \u201cgive and take, criticism and self-criticism\u201d \u2014 and \u201cdialogue means both speaking and listening.\u201d", "That pluralism is more important than ever is easily divined by just looking at the Middle East. Iraq and Syria were pluralistic societies that lacked pluralism. Their diversity \u2014 Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Turkmen, Christians, Jews, Yazidis, Alawites \u2014 was something to be controlled from the top down by iron-fisted Ottomans, then the British and French and finally by local kings and colonels. Society was kept stable by a strongman.", "But the diffusion of communication technologies and globalization is making all forms of top-down, autocratic control weaker, obsolete or more expensive in blood, money or arrests. Either these countries develop an ethic of pluralism \u2014 so they can govern themselves horizontally through social contracts forged among equal citizens \u2014 or they\u2019ll stay in violent turmoil.", "It\u2019s no accident that the two democratizing Middle East entities doing best today are Tunisia and Kurdistan. Neither has fully mastered pluralism yet, but they\u2019ve mastered its necessary precursor for self-governance, which was the principle used in 1989 to settle the Lebanese civil war: \u201cNo victor, no vanquished\u201d among the major players. Everyone\u2019s interests have to be balanced. Iraq is now struggling to get there; Syria is not even close.", "Social networks and hyperglobalization are also increasing the economic returns from pluralism. After all, where does innovation come from? It comes from mashing up different perspectives, ideas and people. Google began as a mashup between Larry Page and Sergey Brin, a Russian immigrant. The more pluralism your society has, the more trust it has, and trust plus pluralism enables people to collaborate, spark new ideas and businesses, and to comfortably reach out anywhere in the globe for the best co-creators. Sure, melting pots can boil over, but, when fueled by a pluralistic ethic, the energy they provide is undeniable. The Economist reported in April 2013 that some \u201c40 percent of Fortune 500 firms were founded by immigrants or their children.\u201d", "Democratic Spain in the last decade has impressively absorbed more than four million immigrants \u2014 mostly from Ecuador, Romania and Morocco \u2014 or 10 percent of its population. They came during the economic boom and have triggered no anti-immigrant party (yet). No wonder Spain\u2019s national leaders today expressed relief at the no vote in Scotland. But the Catalan regional government insists it will proceed with its own nonbinding separatist referendum in November.", "That will meet headwinds. To manage its diversity, Spain already awards a lot of autonomy to its 17 regions \u2014 a process called \u201ccoffee for all\u201d \u2014 and many Spaniards \u201cdon\u2019t want\u201d to be pressed into a deeper breakup, explained Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, the head of the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cYou go to Barcelona and people are hanging the Catalan independence flag on their balcony. If you\u2019re not, it means you\u2019re not in favor of independence, but I don\u2019t want to fight you by hanging the Spanish flag.\u201d Many people here think you can be \u201ca good Spaniard, good Catalan and good European\u201d all at once.", "The other danger of all these separatist movements, added Torreblanca, is that they \u201cchange the axis\u201d of the political debate. \u201cPolitics should be about left and right \u2014 how to grow and how to redistribute.\u201d Historically in Europe, he said, right-wing parties come in and create growth and inequality and left-wing parties come in and redistribute \u2014 and back and forth. \u201cBut the net result is that you end up with societies that are both competitive and cohesive.\u201d All these separatist movements take you off that track, he said, and put you onto one of \u201cidentity politics,\u201d which is precisely why places like Syria and Iraq can\u2019t make progress.", "AMERICA has always been \u201ca country of citizens,\u201d which made its pluralism relatively easy, noted Torreblanca. \u201cThe Europe Union is a country of nation states,\u201d and it is trying to get more pluralistic by integrating those states ever more tightly into a super-state, called the European Union. But that is stalled now because the next level of integration requires not just giving up your currency but sovereignty, so there can be a truly common economic policy. In Syria and Iraq today, you have neither citizens nor states, but rather clans, sects and tribes, which now need to reorganize themselves into voluntary states, as opposed to those imposed by colonial powers, so they can be real citizens.", "This is why America has such an advantage with its pluralism, and why \u2014 if Scots are brave enough to preserve theirs, and Spaniards are struggling to keep theirs and Iraqis are groping to find theirs \u2014 we should have the wisdom to pass an immigration reform bill that enriches ours."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/fashion/at-soulcycle-tribeca-the-spinning-stops-panic-ensues.html": ["In an email last week, Monet Berger received some upsetting news. \u201cI nearly cried when I read it,\u201d Ms. Berger said. \u201cMy heart sank.\u201d", "The local press reaction was dramatic, as well. \u201cTotal Tribeca Meltdown Alert,\u201d the Tribeca Citizen warned.

Design was heralded as a creator of social change: Magazines like Good spread the word about its impact on humanity and politics; the Cooper Hewitt museum staged a show in 2007 called \u201cDesign for the Other 90%,\u201d and a popular T-shirt from the period read: \u201cDesign Will Save the World.\u201d Finally, a fourth moment: The advent of social media made clear that the masses not only responded to design; they cared about it enough to speak up. A new Gap logo was attacked by online mobs, and Tropicana scrapped a redesign of its orange-juice packaging after a public rebuke.", "These days, engineering-centric Silicon Valley sees design as something that no longer just adds value, but actually creates it. Last year, Nest Labs, maker of the sleekly styled smart thermostat, was purchased by Google for $3.2 billion. This was not just a staggering amount of money for a company that specializes in household objects; it was Google\u2019s second most expensive acquisition ever. The industrial designer Yves B\u00e9har, who is behind the elegant Jawbone Up fitness tracker, sometimes takes equity stakes in start-ups he works with rather than payment.

Created for a paralyzed artist, the product is a collaboration between technologists and designers, and relies on open-source software. It has no commercial ambitions. It\u2019s simply a sharp example of an expressive designed object.", "We\u2019re living in a time of \u201cacknowledged urgency,\u201d Antonelli says, and pragmatic fields from science to politics to business are looking to design for \u201cinspiration, alternative processes, metaphor and a bit of uplift.\u201d (\u201cDelight\u201d has become a buzzword in Silicon Valley.) As a result, design has become incredibly multifaceted in recent years, encompassing subfields such as interaction design, critical design, environmental design, social design, biodesign and service design, to name just a few. It\u2019s become a medium for expressing ideas, raising provocative questions and addressing social and individual anxieties.", "So is design a business builder or idea spreader? Both, often at the same time.", "In earlier moments, the democratization of design was about what we could buy. Now it\u2019s about what we can make and how we can sell. The online marketplace Etsy has redefined how small-scale makers can earn a living, or at least subsidize a creative hobby. Last year, the site hosted more than a million active shops. According to a 2012 survey, nearly a fifth of Etsy sellers considered running their creative businesses their full-time job. Crowdfunding services like Kickstarter also enable aspiring design entrepreneurs to find support for their projects. One breakaway success was an early-stage \u201csmart watch\u201d called Pebble, which could connect to smartphones, display emails and text messages and even run apps. Two years ago, without the backing of an established company \u2014 let alone venture capitalists \u2014 its founders raised more than half a million dollars in a matter of hours, eventually bringing in $10 million to develop the watch. As Maeda observed, today\u2019s design student may be less interested in building a portfolio than in simply crowdfunding an idea.", "Allan Chochinov, head of the Products of Design graduate program at the School of Visual Arts, talks about how design has moved \u201cfrom the aesthetic, to the strategic, to the participatory.\u201d In his thinking, the \u201copen source\u201d ideology we normally associate with certain corners of tech culture has made its way into design. Engineering and design are melding; code-y enterprises are making objects; and object makers are hardwiring all kinds of things with code. Young designers need to be conversant in tools like the Arduino platform (inexpensive hardware for programming interactive objects) and customizable Raspberry Pi computers (credit card-sized circuit boards that can plug into monitors and keyboards). Style, functionality and engineering are now one and the same, and even mundane objects are virtuously designed.", "What is certain is that all these combined elements \u2014 style, function, social impact, creativity and profit motive \u2014 have yielded an original vision of what design is and why it matters. Design has fundamentally changed the way we experience the world, from the way we interact with objects to our expectations about how organizations are structured.

Watching Milton\u2019s lovely, ancient face and her strangely graceful, ratcheting gait, you wince at the thought. Tony used wall putty to anchor our GoPro Hero to her back, after removing it from its waterproof case. We had tried and failed to program the CatCam, which is slightly smaller and less expensive ($49 as opposed to $200), but whose functions are less than intuitive. Even Tony was stymied. Mr. Keeney reported similar difficulties, though he was able, in the end, to make his work. (He used both the GoPro Hero and the CatCam, but there are myriad other options: If you Google \u201cpetcam,\u201d you\u2019ll see a range of devices at various price points.)", "Milton posed, as regal as an elephant, amid Mr. Jacobs\u2019s children\u2019s blocks, which were strewn on the floor of his bright, sparsely decorated house. We all watched, mesmerized, as she pivoted, yawned and stalked across the carpet to her box and a pile of lettuce, which she scarfed down in great gulps. The GoPro never wavered.", "\u201cThe thing that attracted me to tortoises when I was a kid was that they were so peaceful,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said finally. \u201cShe has been a great companion.\u201d", "Are there outsider, or self-taught, photographers? Certainly, Mr. Jacobs said, mentioning Vivian Maier, the French-born Chicago nanny and street photographer who died in 2009, leaving behind thousands of negatives. Milton\u2019s photographs, not surprisingly, were rather solemn: many iterations of plastic blocks, oak flooring and lettuce, her stately head at midframe.", "Earlier, we had met Mrs. Grima, a 4-year-old potbellied pig who belongs to James O.

The pig was named after a historic property in Mr. Coleman\u2019s hometown, the Hermann-Grima House, and she is definitely a creature of some gravitas, if lacking in obvious charm.", "\u201cShe\u2019s a terrible pet,\u201d Mr. Coleman said, \u201cfood-driven and self-centered.\u201d He nonetheless proudly walks her with his dogs most afternoons, drawing crowds along Bellevue Avenue near his apartment. Since pigs have no neck, she wore a kind of harness around her shoulders, and it was tricky to keep the GoPro aloft. (Tony used rubber bands and twist-ties, and his constant ministrations irritated Mrs. Grima, who head-butted him at regular intervals.)

With the GoPro dangling from his collar, Harvey took a burn around his front yard, and then we brought him to the beach and let him rip on his extendable leash.", "What sort of work did Ms. Oswald think he\u2019d produce? Photojournalism, definitely, she said, like a National Geographic contributor, \u201call his travels and where he explores.\u201d", "One thing you need to know about animal photography is that editing is a significant part of the endeavor. We programmed our cameras at 10-second intervals for Mrs. Grima and Harvey, and 30 seconds for Milton; our animals shot, on average, for about an hour. That means we had thousands of images to comb through. I say we, but it was Tony who put in the time, harvesting about 30 usable photos from each session. Mr. Keeney, for his part, said he spent weeks editing for his own book. \u201cAfter a while, I became kind of jaded and burned out,\u201d he admitted.", "But art, of course, may be more process than product. I asked James Danziger, a photography gallerist, to critique our project. As he pointed out, the animals didn\u2019t choose what images were taken; the cameras merely captured what they were focused on. \u201cTo be clear, we\u2019re not criticizing the animals\u2019 artistry so much as critiquing their eye,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, there\u2019s not a lot we can say about the first two, the tortoise and the pig.\u201d", "Mr. Danziger noted that Milton\u2019s interests seemed to be in interiors and food. He thought she might have a career shooting for shelter magazines. As for Mrs. Grima, Mr. Danziger thought he detected the influence of Lee Friedlander\u2019s shadow self-portraits. \u201cI also think her use of the top of her head against the various scenes shows a more sophisticated understanding of the history of photography,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she would benefit from going to art school to continue her interests.\u201d", "Harvey\u2019s work was in a class by itself. Marveling at his abstract and representational photos \u2014 the mesmerizing swoops of color; the archly composed images of his roommate, Rufus, or a yellow fire hydrant, with his own tongue and beard at the top of the frame \u2014 Tony wondered how he might use a GoPro to similar effect in his own practice.", "Mr. Danziger noted influences like Mark Cohen, a street photographer known for his truncated view of human bodies who came to prominence in the early 1970s and whose work Mr. Danziger showed recently. Furthermore, he said, \u201cHarvey\u2019s interest in blurry motion seems to refer to a number of photographs taken by Paul Fusco in his famous RFK funeral train series. Using motion to give a sense of the speed of the journey is something Harvey is definitely employing. He also has a sense of humor. I believe he\u2019s referring to Duchamp\u2019s urinal with his fire hydrant images. Harvey is gallery-ready. All he has to do is find the right one.\u201d", "It\u2019s definitely an emerging genre, Mr. Keeney said. Fred, his Chihuahua-terrier mix, now has his own Instagram account, thanks to Mr. Keeney\u2019s daughter. \u201cPetCam is going to be the phrase that describes it,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople are gaga about their pets. This activity will ultimately strengthen that bond, because ultimately it\u2019s a collaboration.\u201d", "\u2022", "And what of Tiger, my absent would-be collaborator?

In a recent study, aired last summer on the BBC Two Horizon show \u201cThe Secret Life of Cats,\u201d Dr. Wilson and his colleagues tracked 50 house cats in an English village by placing GPS tags and, in some cases, tiny cameras on their collars, to see where they went. The maps of the cats\u2019 activity were fascinating, with most cats ranging just over 100 yards from their homes, deftly skirting one another\u2019s rambles, though one cat had a range of two miles. In many cases, it turned out that cats were making a beeline for other cats\u2019 houses in the post-midnight hours, sneaking into their kitchens and eating their food.", "\u201cTiger might have found somewhere nicer to live,\u201d Dr. Wilson said. \u201cSomeplace with better cat food, nicer windowsills. There\u2019s an old saying, \u2018Cats own people, not the other way around.\u2019 As we saw in our studies, some cats have several owners. Cats return because the other situation has become less advantageous. Maybe the other household gets a dog, for example. Then they\u2019d come back to exploit you again. Don\u2019t give up hope. He\u2019s probably living somewhere else. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s better or worse, really, for you to hear.\u201d", "Tiger, however, is less opportunistic than the average feline, more dog than cat. He is not mysterious or inscrutable. He comes when you call him. He is extravagantly affectionate. A pleasure-seeker, to be sure, but his pleasures derive mostly from human contact. He purred so loudly during his first checkup, the vet couldn\u2019t hear his heartbeat.", "I think he might have made a fine photographer, surely one of Harvey\u2019s caliber. He is also a skilled assassin, an efficient, if disgusting, nose-to-tail consumer of rodents. Still, I fear he met his match in a coyote, packs of which have been stalking this seaside town for nearly a decade, and which have killed two of my neighbor\u2019s dogs in the last few months.", "If so, I hope he gave the coyote as good as he got.

No boxes, no tape, no weighing, no buying stamps, no standing in line.", "Are Shyp and similar tech start-ups for outsourcing chores the realization of the laziness economy?

Now, even waiting in line at Starbucks is considered inefficient and necessitates an app to pre-order a latte.", "How do we judge whether technology is making us more productive, or just lazy and impatient?", "Economists think about outsourcing chores in terms of opportunity costs. If you can work during the hour you would have spent mailing a package, it would probably be a better use of your time \u2014 as, perhaps, would taking a nap, going for a run or spending time with your child.", "\u201cPeople underestimate the value of time,\u201d said Susan Athey, an economics of technology professor at Stanford University\u2019s business school. Paying someone a few dollars to run an errand, she said, is worth it to someone who would otherwise have to take half a day off work to do errands, lose money by missing a deadline for an e-commerce return or pick up a child late from day care after getting stuck in line. It is not just an indulgence for the well-off, she said. The trade-off between time and money is particularly crucial for those with less of each.", "There is evidence that technology has already made household chores much less time-consuming. Parents together now spend 27.6 hours a week on chores, down from 36.3 in 1965, according to data from the American Time Use Survey and Pew Research Center.

Few people can afford a full-time personal assistant, but many more can pay a few dollars to outsource chores here and there. Shyp costs $5 to mail an unlimited number of boxes; you pay the postage.", "So perhaps the bigger problem for people using apps like Shyp is becoming too dependent on something that might not be around for long. The mortality rate for start-ups is sky high \u2014 and particularly for delivery start-ups. The implosions of Webvan and Kozmo during the dot-com bust taught web entrepreneurs some clear lessons: It\u2019s expensive to build warehouses, hold inventory and hire drivers to go to people\u2019s houses.", "Shyp, however, just a year old, is already earning money. That is because most of its revenue comes not from the $5 pickup fee, but from taking advantage of the deeply discounted bulk shipping fees for high-volume mailers. It charges its customers the retail price for the least expensive shipping method \u2014 the Postal Service, FedEx, U.P.S. or DHL \u2014 and keeps the difference.", "Whereas some of the on-demand businesses lose more money the more people that use them, Shyp makes more money when more people use it \u2014 the kind of business school basic that much of Silicon Valley seems to have forgotten. Some customers have actually moved from one home to another using Shyp, paying just $5 for messengers to retrieve their belongings and package them. Kevin Gibbon, Shyp\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said he welcomes that because Shyp makes a lot of money on the difference between the bulk shipping fees it pays and the retail fees customers pay to mail such heavy boxes.", "\u201cWith logistics companies, you need to prove out your business model very, very early,\u201d said Mr. Gibbon, who was an eBay \u201cpower seller\u201d before starting Shyp and who said that sellers on sites like eBay and Etsy are among its biggest users. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait for scale.\u201d", "Shyp keeps so-called satellite vans around the city, and when messengers retrieve a package, they tag it and drop it in the van.

Twenty years ago, when social media first emerged, India\u2019s government \u2014 like its counterparts in Beijing and Moscow \u2014 regarded it warily, as a force that could undermine state power. In the restive, majority-Muslim region of Kashmir, in particular, state authorities have been swift to block access to material they considered incendiary.", "However, as this week\u2019s rescue efforts suggest, \u201cthe government is now seeking to conduct its business through these media,\u201d said Samir Saran, a policy analyst who worked as telecommunications executive in the early 2000s. One driver of this change, he said, is the new prime minister, Narendra Modi, who regards social media as a central link to the public.

It was doing so well that at one point, it was opening about three stores a day.", "RadioShack entered the 1980s poised to be the center of the computer revolution. Indeed, in 1977, the company had introduced one of the first mass-produced computers, the TRS-80, and initially outsold Apple using the power of its retail channel and its thousands of locations.", "But from that perch, RadioShack went nowhere. RadioShack\u2019s computer business lost traction and was eventually made obsolete as companies like IBM and Dell delivered more powerful computers through different channels.", "Failures abounded. RadioShack phased out its computer business in 1993 along with its circuit board business. That year, too, the company sold its cellphone manufacturing business.", "Instead of concentrating on RadioShack and building up its offerings, the company  tried new concepts with new stores: Computer City to sell computers, Energy Express Plus to sell batteries, Famous Brand Electronics for refurbished electronics, McDuff and Video Concepts for  audio and video, and  the Incredible Universe, which became the company\u2019s Best Buy knockoff.", "None of these worked, and all were either closed or sold off by the late 1990s.", "Still, RadioShack had a terrific reputation as the place to go for gear. In the Internet bubble, the stock closed at a high of $78.50 a share.", "But the company had already lost its focus. The big box stores like Best Buy began to capture the bulk of the electronics business. RadioShack remained largely your local stop for electronics gear. The problem was that most of the equipment became cables and ancillary things to make the computers go.", "Looking yet again for a new business model, RadioShack seized on mobile. But this merely made RadioShack a pawn in the cellphone wars as it tried to profit from selling a commodity.", "RadioShack had some initial successes with sales in kiosks in Sam\u2019s Clubs, but when RadioShack became too successful, Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s owner, Walmart, took away the contract. And an attempt to sell phones at Target failed. The move to smartphones squeezed RadioShack\u2019s margins, as did cellphone companies\u2019 move to have their own stores.", "In short, mobile has not panned out.", "Now, RadioShack is trying again \u2014 it tried to rebrand itself in February with a slick $4 million Super Bowl commercial as not the store from the 1980s that you remember.

It may make money selling headphones or computer cables, but that business model seems unsustainable. After all, how many cable cords can you sell to sustain 4,000-plus stores?", "The company\u2019s cash is evaporating. A plan to close about 1,100 stores was halted by RadioShack\u2019s current lenders. And while RadioShack\u2019s biggest shareholder, the hedge fund Standard General, is rumored to be in talks to provide new financing, the question would then become whether RadioShack\u2019s latest attempt to leverage its name by adopting cleaner and brighter stores could be pulled off.", "That question remains unanswered, but you have to shake your head at the missed opportunities.", "RadioShack could have been Best Buy. It could have been Amazon. It could have become Dell. The paths that RadioShack could have taken are numerous. But instead of choosing one, it chose them all, walking away from its place as a hobbyist\u2019s dream.", "So what can we learn? RadioShack suffered from poor, often overpaid, leadership, which could not focus on a single plan and then was left grasping for a rescue strategy.", "We can see echoes of this in the current mad dash by the Silicon Valley giants to become conglomerates. Google, Facebook and others also fear that their original mission will become obsolete and so they are buying anything new for billions of dollars to avoid a fate like RadioShack\u2019s.", "But perhaps the tech giants are missing one thing from the RadioShack story. RadioShack tried many paths. But going in all directions without a full commitment is not enough, particularly when the core brand is not sustained. RadioShack has branded itself well but it led itself too far from its strengths.", "It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but true that retailers do not fare well in bankruptcy. Some bankruptcy experts have said the reason may be that the bankruptcy code forces the retailer to decide within nine months whether to confirm leases \u2014 too short a period to decide what will succeed or fail. But the problem with retailers is usually not that they have too much debt \u2014 something bankruptcy can solve \u2014 or even that they cannot decide on their locations.

Computers are prone to occasional glitches, are they not? One can imagine a latter-day Ralph Nader at some point taking on the modern auto industry with a jeremiad about the potential perils of microchipped cars, maybe in a book titled \u201cUnsafe at Any Click.\u201d", "If automotive experts are right, safety imperatives are leading inexorably, and rapidly, to the ultimate computer on wheels: a supersmart car that drives itself, with humans just along for the ride. The rush toward this future has Retro Report\u2019s attention, though in a manner consistent with its mission of first examining where we have been, the better to see where we may be headed. The heart of this week\u2019s video documentary is the long struggle over a car safety feature that everyone now takes for granted. That would be air bags. As the video shows, America\u2019s major automakers, for decades, heaped scorn on them and resisted making them standard equipment. In the past, dismissiveness tended to be Detroit\u2019s reflexive attitude toward many new ideas, whether for improving passenger safety or increasing fuel efficiency. Even recently, the board of directors at General Motors \u2014 the \u201cnew GM\u201d \u2014 was slow to react to revelations about safety failings that have led this year to the recall of nearly 30 million vehicles.", "A protagonist in this struggle is Mr. Nader, who irrevocably altered the national conversation about American-made vehicles with his 1965 book, \u201cUnsafe at Any Speed.\u201d General Motors, then the dominant car manufacturer, reacted to Mr. Nader\u2019s charges with the far-from-brilliant tactic of spying on him and trying to lure him into compromising positions. Mr. Nader prevailed, to the extent that his safety campaign helped lead to standardized seatbelts, including shoulder restraints.", "At the start, 40 years ago or so, most people could not be persuaded to buckle up; this was before states passed laws mandating seatbelt use. Soon enough, interest turned to the air bag, a \u201cpassive\u201d instrument that required no action by the driver and the passenger. If their car crashed, a balloonlike cushion would pop up on its own to protect them. Naturally, installing this device would make a car more expensive. In their fashion, the big auto companies balked, a stance that they maintained for many years, until their resistance finally wore out.", "Not that air bags were perfect. They were initially designed with 165-pound adults in mind. That made smaller people, especially children, vulnerable to injury from the explosive force of the air bag\u2019s opening. In the 1990s, 175 people died in this manner, more than 100 of them children, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Terrible as that toll was, it lay in the balance against nearly 6,400 lives said to have been saved by air bags in that decade. Later improvements corrected many of the one-size-doesn\u2019t-fit-all shortcomings, though problems remained. A New York Times investigation, its results published on Friday, found that exploding air bags produced by a Japanese supplier were linked to two deaths and dozens of injuries in vehicles from Honda and other automakers. Slowly across the past decade, millions of potentially troubled vehicles have been recalled.", "Retro Report takes the discussion to another level by studying the possibility, even the likelihood, that the old fuss over air bags will someday seem as quaint as safety concerns about blacksmith shops. Will future vehicles even need these gadgets? Cars are becoming marvels of artificial intelligence, able to avert accidents entirely with sensors that, for instance, can warn a motorist that he or she is veering perilously into someone else\u2019s lane or getting too close to the vehicle up ahead.", "The grail \u2014 it will be left to others to decide if it qualifies as holy \u2014 would be to remove the greatest threat of all to road safety: the driver. Human error is believed to be responsible for 90 percent of automobile crashes, making it the leading cause of the 33,000 motor vehicle deaths a year in the United States. (That toll is significantly down from an annual 50,000 or more in the late 1960s and early \u201870s, pre-air bags and mandatory seatbelts. Still, even these days, about as many Americans die on the road over a typical three-year period as were killed in all of the country\u2019s wars since World War II.)", "Google and some major auto manufacturers \u2014 not averse to change this time \u2014 are busily experimenting with autonomous cars, meaning driverless. Robots, the thinking goes, will sense lurking danger and take corrective action. A robot\u2019s judgment is not clouded the way a human\u2019s can be. It does not have one too many at a favorite bar. It does not nod off at the wheel. It does not succumb to road rage, at least not yet as best as anyone can tell.", "But will humans, notably of the American variety, happily yield control of their beloved cars to a robot? True, automated systems like cruise control have been around for decades. Nonetheless, doubts about computers are hard-wired into many people, a distrust enhanced by popular culture. Who could forget the villainous nature of the machines in films and books like \u201cI, Robot,\u201d the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and \u201cColossus: The Forbin Project\u201d?", "Setting aside the future potential of driverless cars, the immediate reality of artificial intelligence software at the wheel is hardly worry-free. If cars are effectively computers, could malicious hackers figure out how to seize control of them, even cause mass death? More prosaically, what if a computer on wheels freezes, as any computer is prone to do? Say it freezes for a mere three seconds. In three seconds, a car going 65 miles an hour will cover almost the length of a football field. Imagine traveling at that speed over that distance with no one \u2014 or no thing \u2014 effectively in control. Flaws that in the last few years forced companies like GM, Toyota and Honda to recall millions of vehicles are not likely to reassure the techno-wary.", "Then there are privacy issues. Cars today can collect, in some instances for the benefit of auto insurance companies, all manner of data, like how fast people drive, how hard they brake, where they have traveled. The automobile and the open road have long been symbols of American freedom. How free are you if your every move is tracked? And how much information about yourself are you willing to share with a machine? A BMW video mentioned in this Retro Report features a soft-voiced announcer saying, \u201cImagine your car could sense your desires.\u201d Is that, some humans may wonder, truly desirable?", "Then again, auto companies were not alone years ago in chafing at innovations like seatbelts and air bags. Many motorists also had to be convinced. In time, they were. So maybe they will get used to being shepherded by robots. That includes some who have been known to give their cars names.

After a few months, Dr. Welle came up with a 90-minute lecture targeted specifically at a skeptical, scientifically minded Google employee.", "The lecture begins with a dismal fact: Everyone is a little bit racist or sexist. If you think you\u2019re immune, take the Implicit Association Test, which empirically measures people\u2019s biases. Dr. Welle goes on to explain that some of the most damaging bias is unconscious; people do the worst stuff without meaning to, or even recognizing that they\u2019re being influenced by their preferences.", "The effect of bias is powerful, and it isn\u2019t softened by Silicon Valley\u2019s supposedly meritocratic culture. In the lecture, Dr. Welle shows a computer simulation of how a systematic 1 percent bias against women in performance evaluation scores can trickle up through the ranks, leading to a severe underrepresentation of women in management.", "Finally, Dr. Welle points to research showing that we aren\u2019t slaves to our hidden biases. The more we make ourselves aware of the role our unconscious plays in our decision-making, and the more we try to force others to confront their biases, the greater the chance we have of overcoming our hidden preferences.", "Google offered several anecdotes that seem to indicate a less biased culture as a result of the training.

Though he looks the part \u2014 he has a boyish face and favors casual, gamer-guy attire \u2014 he is, at 34, relatively old. And while the tech press is consumed by apps like Uber and Airbnb, companies that wear their regulation-smashing, world-changing zeal on their sleeves, Zenefits is unusual in that makes software designed to help small businesses comply with regulations rather than fight them.", "After a bout with testicular cancer a decade ago \u2014 from which he has recovered \u2014 Mr. Conrad became a self-taught expert on the byzantine particulars of the American health care market, and he is an ardent supporter of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s health reform law. Two years ago, after getting pushed out of his last job, Mr. Conrad realized that the new law was creating an opportunity for a start-up to remake the way small businesses buy health insurance. That process has been derided as needlessly complex, inefficient, opaque and antiquated. It is also extremely lucrative: The national health insurance brokerage market on which Mr. Conrad set his sights is worth, by one estimate, $18 billion.", "Zenefits didn\u2019t set out to become a health insurance broker. Instead, Mr. Conrad found that the health care market could make for a lucrative business model. Zenefits produces web-based software for small businesses to manage their human resources operations. It gives companies that software free, but if they decide to buy health insurance for their workers through Zenefits\u2019 software, Zenefits receives a substantial payment from insurance companies.", "Investors praise the model for simplifying the process of managing employee benefits, and the legal requirements that come with them.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate entrepreneur tool,\u201d said Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, which, with another venture capital firm, Institutional Venture Partners, invested $66.5 million in Zenefits this summer; that investment valued Zenefits at $500 million. \u201cHow do you deal with anything that is very complicated that you need to learn about to be in business?

Zenefits signed up 2,000 small businesses that employ a combined 50,000 workers in just its first year of operation, the company says.

Mr. Conrad expects that number to triple within a year.", "Jules Maltz, a partner at I.V.P., said this of the company: \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in 18 software-as-a-service companies, and these guys are in a different league. When you compare some of the largest cloud companies to where they were at this age, Zenefits is growing way faster.\u201d", "If Mr. Conrad harbors much confidence about his firm\u2019s prospects, he doesn\u2019t show it. In conversation, his self-effacing attitude may come off at first as false modesty. But soon you notice that the worry is real. And there are plenty of reasons to worry. Zenefits is betting on certain revenue streams, but the health insurance market is changing rapidly. And as is the case for many early-stage companies, getting the first customers is the easy part. Zenefits could prove to be a truly disruptive force, or it could collapse under the weight of its own ambitions. \u201cThe problems that other companies have a year to figure out, we have like eight weeks,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly scary. I feel like it takes years off my life.\u201d", "One-Stop Shopping", "If you work at a large company, you\u2019ve most likely used some kind of web-based human resources system to gain access to your benefits and to track your paychecks. Small-business owners and their workers, by contrast, have never been well served by software. When you\u2019re hired by a small company, your boss usually has to submit your personal information to a half dozen or more separate systems of record: payroll, health care, retirement, time-tracking, commuter benefits and on and on. When you marry, have a baby, get a promotion or leave the company, all of those systems have to be adjusted.", "Often, these transactions occur offline: Someone has to fill out a health insurance change-of-status form, fax it in and call later to make sure the changes went through.", "Mr. Conrad felt this pain firsthand. In 2007, he and a college classmate, Mike Sha, founded a portfolio management start-up that eventually was called SigFig. \u201cI ended up being the guy who had to deal with all this H.R. stuff at the company,\u201d Mr. Conrad said, \u201cand it was an amount of time that I deeply resented.\u201d", "In 2012, after a falling-out with Mr. Sha, Mr. Conrad was forced out from SigFig. He began looking for something to do, and H.R. software quickly emerged as the most obvious choice. His vision was simple and elegant: What small businesses needed was a single online tool to track all employee records. This software would connect to every benefits provider, so that when your boss wanted to give you a raise, she would type your new salary into the software, and it would handle the changes in all your information with every other service provider online. Mr. Conrad sought to turn a company\u2019s human resources busywork into the sort of one-step, paperless operation we\u2019ve come to expect from most other parts of our app-driven, on-demand world.", "Building such a system would be tricky, but not impossible. Mr. Conrad cajoled Laks Srini, a software engineer he knew from SigFig, into becoming his co-founder. Mr. Srini would be responsible for coding the new app. While that proved to be a devilishly complex tech problem, the more challenging task for Zenefits was to find a business model. The software that Mr. Conrad envisioned would be expensive to create and market. But small businesses don\u2019t generally have a lot of money to pay for fancy, all-in-one software, which is why few companies had gone after that market. So how would his idea make any money?", "Late in 2012, Mr. Conrad began meeting with people in Silicon Valley to figure out how to pay for his plan. One of them was Bob Kocher, an investor at the venture firm Venrock, who is also a medical doctor and a health care policy expert. In the first years of the Obama administration, Dr. Kocher served on the National Economic Council, where he helped draft the Affordable Care Act. Now, during a series of lunches, Mr. Conrad and Dr. Kocher began sketching out a plan to dig up an enormous pot of gold buried at the center of the health care industry. That pot of gold is known as the insurance brokerage market. It was worth billions and it was stuck in the past \u2014 ruled by handshakes, paper forms and an aversion to most technology built after 1985.", "When businesses buy health coverage for their workers, they often go through brokers, who play the role that travel agents once did for the airlines. They are middlemen who figure out the best fit between buyers and sellers of health care, then take a percentage of the sale. And the commissions can be quite hefty. After connecting a small business with a health care provider, a broker collects a monthly fee of about 4 to 8 percent of a company\u2019s health premiums.", "The commission rates are set by care providers and aren\u2019t usually disclosed to the small-business purchasers. But the fees amount to several hundred dollars or more per employee annually, and they generally continue for as long as a business keeps its health coverage. The broker collects the monthly fee from the care provider even if the business never talks to its broker again.", "\u201cI was thinking, wait a minute, that is a ton of money, and these guys don\u2019t do very much for it,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. This presented an obvious business model for Zenefits. It would become a broker itself. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, health insurance providers now publish set rates. This meant that Zenefits could offer brokerage online, letting small businesses buy health insurance pretty much the same way people shop for airline tickets.", "Becoming a broker was not a trivial process. Brokers need to be licensed by states and recognized as legitimate by large health plans. When Zenefits set up in California, its first market, early in 2013, Dr. Kocher called up the chief executives of some of the large health plans to speed up the process for Zenefits. By registering as a broker, Zenefits could collect the monthly commission that traditional brokers are now paid. In return for that fee, Zenefits would give small businesses some very good H.R. software.", "\u201cSo it\u2019s literally the case that in return for this fee that most small businesses didn\u2019t know they were paying to brokers anyway, they get thousands of dollars of software for free,\u201d said Dr. Kocher, who became one of Zenefits\u2019 earliest investors.", "This unusual model is threatening to traditional health brokerage firms. In slightly more than a year of operation in California, Zenefits became the No. 1 broker submitting new plans to Anthem Blue Cross, one of the state\u2019s largest providers, in the \u201csmall group\u201d market, which serves businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Zenefits has since expanded and is now licensed as a broker in 50 states and has customers in 41, according to the company.", "Customers describe the Zenefits sales pitch as irresistible. Justin Winter, co-founder of Diamond Candles, an online store based in Durham, N.C., signed up earlier this year after comparing Zenefits with a local broker. \u201cThe traditional brokers came here and we had a face-to-face meeting, and they were knowledgeable and very nice,\u201d Mr. Winter said. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting so many extra bonuses with Zenefits for the exact same price, we had to choose them.\u201d", "Like several other customers, he described the Zenefits software as a major inducement. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an H.R. person,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of having to have a full-time person dealing with benefits, we can have this nice, free solution that automates that work.\u201d", "Zenefits has hit the brokerage industry with such ferocity that, in four states, brokers have complained to insurance regulators that its free-software pitch constitutes unfair competition. Zenefits denies the accusation, and regulators in Texas and Washington have closed their investigations; in Utah and Wisconsin, they are pending.", "Brokers have also responded to Zenefits by trying to modernize their own operations. BenefitsConnect, a software company that is also a licensed brokerage firm, has had success selling its technology to other brokers. Troy R. Underwood, its chief executive, said he doubted whether the Zenefits model would have lasting appeal. Good brokers, he argues, do more than simply help a business shop for health insurance; they are also a source of quick, constant help in tackling the inevitable complexities of health coverage that arise over the years.", "Though Zenefits does offer its customers a personal representative, it also tries to automate many queries through software (the same way that Amazon, say, offers an online form for handling returns). Traditional brokers argue that a less personal touch might hinder Zenefits\u2019 service in the long run.", "\u201cSince they\u2019re based in San Francisco, they\u2019re going to have a hard time playing golf with a client in Atlanta or Houston,\u201d Mr. Underwood said. \u201cEight times out of 10, employers want to be able to look someone in the eye.\u201d", "Jonathan Gruber, a health care economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a different critique \u2014 involving a lack of transparency in broker fees themselves. In the long run, he\u2019d prefer that the health insurance brokerage market evolve into something like tax-preparation market: It\u2019s now possible to file your taxes electronically without help, though you may want to pay a tax preparer to spare you the headaches.", "\u201cOnce all these health exchanges are working well, we shouldn\u2019t need health brokers anymore for shopping,\u201d Mr. Gruber said.  \u201cMy hope would be that we\u2019d move to a world where you\u2019d pay explicitly for this service to help you make this hard decision.\u201d", "Its Own Guinea Pig", "Before Zenefits revolutionizes anything, it has to figure out its own trajectory. \u201cThe biggest challenge that we have is scaling,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. \u201cEven when we think things are going well, it always feels like the wheels are ready to come off the cart.\u201d Some of the company\u2019s problems are the routine worries that every start-up faces, only an order of magnitude larger.", "Growth problems pop up suddenly and require creative fixes. Early this summer, it became obvious that the way Zenefits was entering new customers into its database was too time-consuming. \u201cIt was a 5-pound-bag, 10-pounds-of-poop problem,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. \u201cEvery day, we were able to load six to eight companies, but we were signing up 16 to 18.\u201d Eventually, there was a backlog of more than a month and a half. \u201cIt was a company-ending thing.\u201d", "To fix the problem, Mr. Conrad assigned five engineers who worked day and night to rethink the company-loading work flow. They resolved the issue \u2014 only to find that as customers came pouring through the new Zenefits loading system, the employees whose job it was to manage all the customers became bogged down. \u201cEvery day, there\u2019s a roving bottleneck that you have to fix,\u201d Mr. Conrad said.", "This is the cloud now hanging over Zenefits. As the company grows, can it serve tens of thousands or more customers mainly through software, without adding lots of staff \u2014 the way, for instance, Google has managed to do? Or, like Groupon and other start-ups that grew too quickly, will it need to hire lots of expensive sales and customer service representatives, straining its bottom line?", "Moreover, the market is in flux. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty uncertain time for insurance sales right now,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is changing everything about how small businesses and individuals buy insurance, so I\u2019d say the future of this model isn\u2019t certain.\u201d", "The law requires businesses with more than 50 workers to provide insurance to their workers, a provision that could expand the Zenefits target market. On the other hand, the law\u2019s subsidies for individuals could reduce the number of workers receiving employer-sponsored coverage. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that by 2024, seven million fewer workers will receive coverage through their jobs. \u201cThis is not a growing gravy train,\u201d Mr. Levitt said.", "The Affordable Care Act also called for the creation of state-run insurance exchanges aimed at small businesses; those have been delayed, but eventually they, too, may streamline the way small businesses buy health care. But because the exchanges will allow firms to use brokers, the Zenefits business would still work under that model.", "In the long run, such efficiencies could help keep down the costs of health care. \u201cWhen you can see all the plans online, people tend to choose narrower-cost ones \u2014 and that has the effect of pushing doctors and hospitals to try to get into those lower-cost plans,\u201d Dr. Kocher said.", "But as traditional brokers get up to speed on the basics, Zenefits has begun adding more advanced features to its H.R. suite, which it either gives away or also sells on commission. The software now lets businesses manage their stock options and commuter benefits and track workers\u2019 hours.", "Part of Mr. Conrad\u2019s secret is that he runs Zenefits on Zenefits \u2014 so as the company grows and problems arise, he can identify new H.R. headaches to address.

Jobs.", "Of course, Mr. Cook lacks the track record, life story and the showman\u2019s flair of the Apple co-founder. But while leaders all leave the stage sooner or later, corporate values can endure. For decades, Apple has stood out in the business world for three things: taste, trust and utility. These are not words scribbled on a white board or printed in an annual report, but values that have guided Apple\u2019s product and design decisions. The Apple Watch reflects and interprets those values \u2014 how well it has done that will be its test of success or failure.", "Taste was a touchstone for Mr. Jobs. It was a term he used often. To him, taste was a value and a journey, acquired through curiosity, learning and life experience. Seek out the best that your culture has to offer, he would say, and your work will be enriched with taste, whether you are a software programmer or a sculptor.", "Years ago, in his Palo Alto home, Mr. Jobs pointed to the wooden chairs in his living room, made by George Nakashima, a Japanese-American woodworker. Mr. Jobs explained that Nakashima had a cross-cultural blend of experience, studying architecture, traveling on a free-spirited tour of the world, and working in different cultures. Nakashima\u2019s designs were original, Mr. Jobs said, because he had a distinctive sense of taste, shaped by his life experience.", "The pursuit of taste was a value Mr. Jobs instilled in the Apple corporate culture, including a \u201cThe Best Things\u201d course in the company\u2019s internal training program, the so-called Apple University.", "People possess taste, but products are designed and built by teams of such people. Jonathan Ive, who was made senior vice president for industrial design in 1997, shortly after Mr. Jobs returned to Apple, is the field marshal of the company\u2019s corps of designers. And under Mr. Cook, Apple has recruited top talent in design and fashion from companies including Burberry, Nike and Yves Saint Laurent.", "\u201cTim Cook has done an excellent job of retaining and recruiting critical people,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School.", "How well does the Apple Watch do on the taste test? The consensus is that it is a stylish piece of personal technology, given all that\u2019s in it. The critique among outside designers is that Apple has crammed too much in it. The watch, according to a former Apple designer, had its origin with a tiny iPod Nano Touch, introduced in 2010. People attached a strap to the minuscule media player, and wore it on their wrist, listening to music while jogging.", "The iPod heritage, however, gave way to a more iPhone-style concept. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very hard to make big things small,\u201d said the former Apple designer, who asked not to be named because he still has business contacts with the company. \u201cThis feels more like it was designed by committee.\u201d", "The Apple alumnus also said the relatively short battery life of the watch \u2014 company executives said they expected users to recharge daily \u2014 suggests the industrial design team has the upper hand over the hardware designers these days. Recharging a watch daily, he said, is a hardware-side compromise. In the past, the hardware group often prevailed in such trade-off decisions. For example, he said, the industrial designers wanted to have wireless headphones on the iPod. But that would have sapped power, requiring more frequent recharges, so that idea was shelved, he observed.", "Another former Apple designer, Paul Mercer, agreed that the Apple Watch is chock-full of digital offerings. \u201cThey went very wide in terms of the feature set,\u201d he said.", "But Mr. Mercer added that the \u201csystem experience,\u201d like turning the watch\u2019s crown to zoom in and out on the screen, and to scroll through lists, was innovative and \u201cvery fluid.\u201d Mr. Mercer, a software designer, said, \u201cIt has the hallmarks of a classic Apple product.\u201d", "On the trust front, the Apple Watch should benefit from a trailing wind of good will. People like Apple products, to say the least. Its offerings have a well-earned reputation for feeling intuitive and personalized. Apple products respect the individual. People trust Apple. They often give the company the benefit of the doubt that when there is a slip-up, such the recent incident when some risque celebrity photos were hacked from iCloud, things will be fixed and quickly.", "The Apple Watch, among other things, is a powerful health-monitoring device, which will harvest troves of personal data, if users so choose. That raises privacy concerns, and the matter of trust in a different context for Apple. In addressing that worry, Mr. Cook observed that Apple has a different business model from companies whose financial lifeblood is advertising, like Google and Facebook. If the product is free, as they say, you are the product. Not so for Apple. It owes its vast sales and immense corporate wealth to products people can hold in their hands, and that customers pay dearly for.", "But health data is particularly private, and how it is used will depend not only on Apple but on outside software developers who make health apps that run on Apple devices. The company\u2019s recently revised guidelines for health apps say developers cannot use the data for marketing purposes and that data cannot be shared with third parties without a user\u2019s consent. But how closely will Apple police outside developers, when more developers making more apps means more reasons for people to buy Apple products?", "\u201cI think Apple is certainly aware of the privacy issues with health data,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cBut whether it really enforces those guidelines to uphold its privacy commitments will be the real test.\u201d", "The value of utility, in the Apple context, has meant redefining whole product categories and how people use them. That has been the story of the media player (iPod), smartphone (iPhone) and tablet (iPad).", "The utility questions surrounding the Apple Watch come in a few dimensions. Will it feel too much like an iPhone on your wrist? Here, Apple is endangered by its past success. The communications and notification features on the Apple Watch look neat. So now people will be walking around staring at their wrists instead of their smartphones. Is that a big addition to utility?", "Then, there is a question of how many people will find utility from the device? Will the health-monitoring features, when combined with other offerings on the Apple Watch, for example, be enough to make large numbers of consumers buy it? Much of that audience, presumably, is already wearing a fitness wristband like Fitbit or Jawbone.", "And is Apple limiting the market for the Apple Watch with its strategy? Under the current plan, the Apple Watch works only with iPhones. But about 85 percent of smartphones worldwide run Google\u2019s Android operating system, according to IDC.", "There is a precedent here. The iPod took off as a hit product after Apple shifted course and decided to make it sync with computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows as well as Apple computers. The Apple Watch, said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management, will \u201conly be as big in share as iPhone allows it to be. A missed opportunity, I think.\u201d", "Mr. Cusumano and Mr. Yoffie are co-authors of a book to be published next spring, \u201cStrategy Rules: Five Timeless Lessons from Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Steve Jobs,\u201d based on their study of the three tech industry pioneers and the challenges of their successors. Their conclusion, Mr. Yoffie said, is that the successors were successful as stewards in maintaining and sometimes enlarging the existing businesses. \u201cBut they struggled to deliver the same kind of revolutionary change\u201d as their predecessors, Mr. Yoffie said. \u201cApple Watch appears to fit that model.\u201d", "We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s worth remembering that the iPod, iPhone and iPad, in turn, were greeted with initial skepticism. Apple Watch seeks to be the next in that lineage, routing the skeptics and delivering a massive payoff for Apple. How much of the Apple magic remains is uncertain. Like others, Mr. Mercer, the former Apple software designer, has questions about the Apple Watch and its fate. The answers that matter most will begin to come next year, when the Apple Watch goes on sale. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get mine,\u201d Mr. Mercer said."], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/alibaba-seeks-21-billion-in-highly-awaited-i-p-o/": ["Updated, 8:55 p.m. | It began as a small Internet upstart in China, but now the Alibaba Group is preparing for a splashy debutante party that will stretch from New York to Hong Kong and back again.", "The company, which runs two huge online marketplaces in China, plans to kick off a long-awaited roadshow for potential investors on Monday. It is the start of a formal effort to drum up interest in what could be the biggest stock market debut ever in the United States if Alibaba succeeds in raising its target goal of $21.1 billion.", "The whirlwind tour, which will encompass 100 meetings in 10 days, will begin not in Hong Kong but in New York, where shares of the company are expected to begin trading on Sept. 19. Two teams of senior executives, code-named red and orange, will travel with advisers across the United States and then to Europe, the Middle East and Asia.", "The sheer breadth of the trip highlights not only the outsize ambitions of Alibaba executives as they seek to establish their company as a global giant on par with Google and Amazon.com, but also the hunger of investors eager for a piece of the booming business. Even before Alibaba filed for an initial public offering in May, money managers cleared space in their portfolios for shares in the company.", "An amended prospectus on Friday revealed just how big Alibaba will be once it is traded publicly. At the midpoint of its expected price range of $60 to $66 in American depositary shares, the company would be valued at nearly $156 billion. That is not far behind Amazon.com and more than eBay, LinkedIn and Twitter combined.", "Should the company\u2019s initial public offering hit the top end of its price expectations, it will have surpassed the market debuts of Facebook, General Motors and Visa.", "While poised to become a new behemoth, Alibaba cast itself as a champion of small business in its roadshow materials. In an online video that featured animation and music, Joseph C. Tsai, the executive vice chairman of Alibaba, outlined the company\u2019s plans to make people \u201cmeet, work and live at Alibaba.\u201d And in a letter to investors on Friday, Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s chairman and co-founder, wrote, \u201cOur proposition is simple: We want to help small businesses grow by solving their problems through Internet technology.\u201d", "The price range filed on Friday gives investors an important hook for valuing Alibaba. At $66 a share, the company would be trading at around 40 times its earnings for the 12 months through the end of March. That ratio is high compared with the broader stock market. But 40 times is below that of other fast-growing technology companies. Facebook\u2019s shares, for instance, traded at over 80 times its earnings in the 12 months through June.", "Alibaba\u2019s profit margins are very strong; the company makes 43 cents of operating profit for every dollar of revenue that it earns. Its earnings are also growing rapidly. As a result, investors may be willing to pay considerably more than 40 times earnings for Alibaba\u2019s stock.", "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the largest e-commerce companies on the planet, and it\u2019s still growing faster than almost any other e-commerce company,\u201d said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Company.", "If demand seems strong before the offering, investment bankers can increase the price range, as was the case in the Facebook and Twitter offerings. But the bankers may want to underprice the shares somewhat to increase the chance that they may rise sharply on their first day of trading.", "One element that remains unclear, Mr. Sinha said, is whether investors will be wary of a corporate governance structure that concentrates power in the hands of the company\u2019s partnership, a select group of insiders like Mr. Ma. Already, the company has embarked on an acquisition spree that included an impromptu purchase of a stake in a major Chinese soccer team and a deal for a stake in a Hong Kong film studio that has since disclosed suspicious accounting practices.", "Still, the stock sale is expected to generate a bonanza for the small group of investors who are selling shares. The single biggest seller is Yahoo, which is contractually obligated to sell a portion of its holdings, and which would reap some $7.7 billion at the midpoint of the price range.", "Mr. Ma, who oversaw Alibaba\u2019s rise, will see his net worth skyrocket as well. He will sell only a small portion of his holdings, retaining a stake of nearly 8 percent. At the midpoint of the range, he could gain $803 million in the I.P.O., and his remaining shares would be valued at nearly $12.2 billion.", "His longtime lieutenant Mr. Tsai will also see a huge jump in his net worth as well, despite selling a small portion of his shares. His remaining holdings would be valued at roughly $5 billion.", "What is perhaps most striking is that other than Yahoo, few shareholders are selling many shares at all. That suggests a belief that Alibaba has significant room to grow, something that the company itself has emphasized. Potential investors and analysts have long said that the company, along with rivals like Tencent and the search engine Baidu, represent a coming-of-age of the Chinese Internet industry.", "The coming offering is the result of years of work, as Alibaba has reshaped its internal structure and hired advisers to help prepare for the stock sale. This year, Alibaba hired an unheard-of six lead underwriters \u2014 Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup \u2014 to help plan the undertaking.", "Each bank team, led by senior deal makers, focused on several major tasks. Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, for instance, worked on the prospectus and will supervise the \u201clockup\u201d period after which current investors can sell shares, while JPMorgan worked on the company\u2019s valuation and offering structure.", "Goldman was awarded the role of stabilization agent, meaning it is responsible for making sure that the early trading after the I.P.O. goes well.", "For the banks, the chief incentive driving them is the prestige of helping shepherd one of the biggest initial offerings in history, rather than profits. The banks are expected to share in an underwriting fee of about 1 percent, according to people with knowledge of the matter, or just over $200 million if the stock sale prices at the high end. All but one lead underwriter would reap about $31 million.", "The breadth and rigorousness of those preparations will be put to the test next week, when Alibaba finally begins its road show in Manhattan. Early on Monday, executives will brief salespeople from the main underwriters on how to best pitch the company to their clients, before decamping for the first of a dizzying series of meetings. Then executives will gather for what is expected to be a standing-room-only lunch at the Waldorf-Astoria in Midtown Manhattan.", "At various points, the executives will split into the orange and red teams, named after Alibaba\u2019s primary corporate colors, according to people with direct knowledge of the schedule. The orange team will be led by Mr. Tsai, the vice chairman, and Jonathan Lu, the chief executive; the red team will include Maggie Wu, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, and Daniel Zhang, its chief operating officer. Mr. Ma is expected to appear at a few meetings. In New York, executives will be meeting with money management giants like BlackRock and Oppenheimer.", "On Tuesday, they will head to Boston to see huge mutual fund managers like Fidelity and Wellington Management.

So I decided to see what it would do to mine.

Do?); \u201ccreativity\u201d led to gavels.", "Some of Yossarian\u2019s pictures have the slightly bizarre quality familiar to anyone who uses stock image sites a lot: A search for \u201ccoffee cup\u201d resulted in, among other hits, two radishes connected at the root as though in love, and the word \u201cbusiness\u201d spelled out in gold, businesslike letters.", "Still, some of the images did steer my mind toward new connections. My \u201ccoffee cup\u201d search brought up an image of a woman meditating on beach in a bikini, which made me think back to Johannah King-Slutzky\u2019s idea of the latte as a socially sanctioned break from a hectic schedule. Doing yoga on the beach seemed like the archetypal break for the busy modern woman \u2014 the latte, perhaps, of vacations. And all the rabbits that popped up in my \u201ccreativity\u201d search confused me until I remembered how good they are at creating more rabbits.", "To see if all this free association had made me more creative, I took the Guilford\u2019s test again after about 25 minutes of playing with Yossarian. This time I used a ballpoint pen. I came up with 44 ways to use it \u2014 five more than in the coffee cup test, which may not be a significant difference, especially because I sort of cheated and reused some of my coffee-cup ideas (either object, when you think about it, could be used as a form for shaping clay).", "I did notice, however, that while I got bored about four minutes into the coffee-cup round, I remained engaged throughout my 10 minutes of pen brainstorming. I was even a little annoyed when it was over; I was sure my best pen thoughts were ahead of me (a look at my last entry, \u201cjust the top part is pointy hat,\u201d suggests that they were not).", "Did Yossarian make me more excited about coming up with new ideas? I\u2019d probably have to devise a more controlled experiment to be sure. For instance, drinking the contents of the coffee cup between pre-test and post-test may have made me more alert and upbeat (although, per Cody C. Delistraty\u2019s examination of creativity research at The Atlantic, maybe I should\u2019ve chosen wine). And knowing I was supposed to be more creative in the second test may have motivated me to do well.", "That said, the whole experiment definitely led me down some paths that might, in Yossarian\u2019s framing, be called serendipitous. I took notes throughout my experiment, and when my search for \u201ccreativity\u201d prompted several images of delicious-looking food, I typed \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d But autocorrect \u2014 as Gideon Lewis-Kraus has noted, itself an agent of serendipity \u2014 changed the phrase to \u201cI\u2019m hunger,\u201d which sounds like the title of a poem.", "I can\u2019t give Yossarian all the credit here \u2014 after all, it didn\u2019t come up with my feeling or its slightly bent autocorrected rendition. If anything, this particular instance of unintentional wordplay seems like a vote for the creative powers of even uncreative-seeming technologies (the philosopher Evan Selinger has worried that the autocorrect of the future will make us too predictable) \u2014 and Google, for all Mr. Neeley\u2019s concerns, has certainly led many a user in unexpected directions.", "In his piece on creativity, Mr. Delistraty notes that one study has found a messy desk can make us more creative. He quotes the study\u2019s lead researcher, Kathleen D. Vohs: \u201cBeing creative is aided by breaking away from tradition, order, and convention and a disorderly environment seems to help people do just that.\u201d Maybe Yossarian and autocorrect are digital ways of messing up your desk a little bit, of introducing a little disorder.", "I tried plugging \u201cI\u2019m hunger\u201d back into Yossarian, but the search engine was down, preventing me from writing an image-based found poem based on the phrase.

He knew about Hood by Air two years before everyone else, even though it\u2019s not his style.\u201d", "It wasn\u2019t always this way. Growing up in Montreal, Mr. Macklovitch idolized Robert Palmer but dressed like a gangster rapper. \u201cI had baggy pants, I walked with a fake limp, I had Timberlands,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work. It wasn\u2019t very convincing.\u201d", "He blames his father for his late arrival to fashion, who he said attended the Lollapalooza music festival, at which Chromeo performed in August, with a cellphone affixed to his belt. \u201cHe dresses like Larry David,\u201d Mr. Macklovitch said. \u201cHe\u2019s the original normcore.\u201d", "The younger Mr. Macklovitch began opening himself up to more-varied influences when he and Mr. Gemayel, a childhood friend, started Chromeo in high school.

You can dress as them for Halloween. That\u2019s all you need.\u201d", "The mix of high and low culture has a place in Mr. Macklovitch\u2019s music and wardrobe (he wears a 1971 Steve McQueen Rolex with a collection of beaded elastic bracelets). He and Mr. Gemayel borrow from a cornucopia of cultural touchstones to create what Mr. Macklovitch calls \u201cour little Tumblr, with our references.\u201d He also likened it to Amazon\u2019s personalized recommendations. \u201cIf you like our album cover, \u2018White Women,\u2019 it\u2019s the Helmut Newton book,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might also like Helmut Newton.\u201d", "Mr. Macklovitch\u2019s references fly fast and furiously. He shifts topics easily, from Jeff Koons\u2019s Whitney show to St. Laurent\u2019s latest collection to Williamsburg\u2019s lovable ridiculousness. (\u201cYou can trip and fall on top of a yoga teacher, slide and fall inside a bowl of kale salad,\u201d he said.)", "At times, he feels like a professor of cool. In fact, he used to lecture at Barnard College (on French literature). \u201cYou\u2019ve got the ostentatious lecturers who put on the show and you\u2019ve got the lecturers who are a vessel: \u2018Come along with me, I\u2019m going to be an entertaining way for you to discover this,\u2019 \u201d he said.", "His own intellectual curiosity isn\u2019t limited to the canon.

Mr. Macklovitch pointed to Kanye West and his blog, KanyeUniverseCity, now defunct. \u201cKanye was an entertaining way for a lot of people to discover art, architecture, design, fashion, and it\u2019s so sad that people don\u2019t recognize that in him enough,\u201d he said.

Overwhelmingly, they tell pollsters that doing so is unacceptable and dangerous, and yet they do it anyway. They can\u2019t resist.

A chemical engineer who built a company that made motors and docking stations for NASA, Mr. Tibbitts, 57, spent the last five years coming up with a novel way to block incoming and outgoing texts and to prevent phone calls from reaching a driver.", "He wasn\u2019t some crazy inventor or relentless self-promoter acting on his own. To bolster his engineering solution, he struck a partnership with two heavyweights: American Family Insurance, which agreed to invest in the technology, and, even more important, with Sprint. It agreed to allow Mr. Tibbitts\u2019s company, Katasi, to use its network to stop texts. It was a kind of holy grail, safety advocates gushed, a first for an American phone carrier.", "The product was being completed in February for a summer start \u2014 \u201ca huge deal,\u201d as it was characterized by David Teater, senior director for transportation initiatives at the National Safety Council, which works to curb distracted driving. Sprint hailed it as a major step. It seemed to answer a call from people like Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, who had assailed the telecom and auto industries for keeping drivers connected all the time and urged them to find a \u201ctechnology\u201d solution.", "And then things started to go wrong.", "Shopping a Solution", "The story starts with tragedy. On May 8, 2008, Mr. Tibbitts, who lives and works in Boulder, Colo., drove to Denver for a business meeting. When he arrived, he discovered that the executive with whom he was supposed to meet had been killed that very morning in a car crash caused by a teenager, who, Mr. Tibbitts was told, was texting.", "At the time, Mr. Tibbitts was looking for a new venture, having sold his previous company, the Starsys Research Corporation, in January 2006. The death of the executive led Mr. Tibbitts to seize on distracted driving as his next entrepreneurial challenge. Adding incentive, he had two children who were about to reach driving age.", "He immediately identified an engineering hurdle: To shut down a driver\u2019s phone, you have to know that the person is driving. \u201cHow do we know the person is driving and not riding a horse or is a passenger on a bus?\u201d he said. \u201cHow the heck do we do that?\u201d", "At the point when Mr. Tibbitts was starting to tease out this puzzle, a handful of technological attacks on distracted driving were already emerging. But they weren\u2019t, and still mostly aren\u2019t, able to answer the question that he was asking. Generally, these systems work by using a phone\u2019s Global Positioning System capability to determine whether the phone is moving, say, more than 10 or 15 miles an hour. If the answer is yes, a screen pops up that allows the phone\u2019s user to override the service if he or she isn\u2019t the driver. (Of course, a driver can lie and thus bypass the system.) Another disadvantage of GPS systems is that they generally eat up a ton of battery life, experts said.", "In January, in a parking lot in Boulder, Colo., Mr. Tibbitts huddled in the back seat of a 2002 Mazda Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to show off his solution. The car belonged to his son, Ryan, 20, who sat in the driver\u2019s seat. Ryan reached to his left and pulled out a small square box that had been plugged into a port under the steering column. The port, called OBD 2, comes standard in cars built since 1996, and the black box plugged into it is part of a booming business called \u201ctelematics\u201d \u2014 so named because it combines telecommunications and mobility. Ernst & Youngpredicts that by 2025, some 88 percent of new cars will have telematics and thus become so-called connected cars.", "There are many reasons for connecting a car to the Internet. Cars that can send and receive information allow for remote diagnostics by technicians or for enhanced navigation services. Many of those applications are not yet developed, but insurance companies are now using telematics to measure driver behavior \u2014 do you speed or slam on the brakes? \u2014 and applying that information in setting insurance premiums.", "Telematics also help Mr. Tibbitts shut down the phone. The telematics box sends a wireless message that the car is moving. The phone sends its own message about its location. Both sets of information \u2014 from the car and phone \u2014 are sent to Katasi\u2019s servers. Then, an algorithm weighs the incoming data with other information, like the location of the phones belonging to all the people who drive the car and the starting point of the trip; if the trip starts at Junior\u2019s high school, and mom and dad\u2019s phones are at work, the driver has been identified \u2014 Junior is driving.", "So what happens when husband and wife share a car and Katasi\u2019s servers say that both are in the car at the same time with their phones? Which one is driving? At that point, Katasi generally doesn\u2019t block the messages on the assumption that the passenger will prevent the driver from texting. The system is capable of blocking calls, email and other data, but initially the plan was to block texts.", "In 2010, Mr. Tibbitts got a big break. American Family Insurance, which is based in Madison, Wis., where Mr. Tibbitts grew up, got wind of his project and was intrigued. The company eventually invested $1 million in Katasi.", "Curt Davies, head of the connected-car team at American Family, was enthusiastic: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to download an app. You start driving\u201d and the technology \u201cstops a text or call from getting to your phone.\u201d", "Mr. Tibbitts needed one more crucial ingredient: a telecommunications partner. Public safety advocates had dreamed about a so-called network solution to the distraction problem. The idea was that a phone carrier could shut down a driver\u2019s phone automatically, at the level of the network, without giving the driver that initial choice to opt in or out. (The Katasi system does let a driver opt out, but only if that driver takes the initiative; the default is to block texts.) Another big advantage of such a system is that it would become easy for the network to automatically send outgoing messages like, \u201cJunior can\u2019t see your message right now because he\u2019s driving.\u201d", "Mr. Tibbitts had initial conversations with AT&T and Verizon. Then, in the fall of 2012, he met with Sprint and got limited access to the company\u2019s network to test his software. The next March, he showed up at Sprint headquarters in Overland Park, Kan., and, from the parking lot, called a Sprint product manager named Mark Chan, who works on distracted-driving solutions and had cooperated with Katasi.", "\u201cI\u2019ve got something to show you,\u201d he told Mr. Chan, who came outside and saw firsthand how his phone could be shut down by the Katasi system.", "\u201cWithin 30 seconds, all texts to my phone stopped,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cI said, \u2018This is amazing.\u2019 \u201d", "A Changing Business Model", "Cellphone carriers like Sprint have become strong opponents of distracted driving. That was not always so. When cellphones first became mass-market products, drivers were the target market. Carriers sold talk-time by the minute, so the more people talked, the more money carriers made. And people spend a lot of time in cars.", "But business models have changed. Carriers now sell unlimited use, making it much less important to their bottom line that people talk or text behind the wheel.", "\u201cIt did become less of a business interest for carriers to push the freedom of use wherever an individual might be,\u201d said Ray Rothermel, internal counsel for Sprint, who works on government affairs.", "Moreover, carriers can now receive fees from insurance companies for carrying the wireless connections on their networks \u2014 up to $5 a month a car. That money can add up.", "Back in February, Mr. Rothermel described the partnership with Katasi as \u201ca good-sized weapon in the war against distracted driving.\u201d", "At the time, it looked as if the Katasi technology might be deployed by summer. There was already talk of a price, perhaps $8 a month and $5 for individual trucks in a fleet, a potentially big market. But some questions were still being worked out, such as how it would be marketed.", "Looming in the background was a more fundamental question: Would people use it? After all, the GPS solutions, limited though they might be, had been around for years and were getting only modest traction. Aegis Mobility, a company that is a leader in the field, has around 10,000 subscribers paying $5 a month for its GPS service that can selectively block texts, phone calls or email.", "Free GPS systems are more popular, at least at first blush. AT&T has a free app called DriveMode that it says has been activated more than 1.5 million times since its introduction in 2012. But the company won\u2019t say how many of these are regular users, nor will Sprint discuss how many people use its own free GPS app, called Drive First. Another service, offered by CellControl, uses software to pair a phone and a car \u2014 through Bluetooth \u2014 then blocks communications if the car is moving. It costs $129 and has \u201ctens of thousands of users,\u201d the company says.", "Still, relative to the number of drivers and the size of the problem, adoption rates of the GPS apps are \u201ca drop in the bucket,\u201d said Paul Zimmerman, the chief executive of Aegis, which is based in British Columbia. People aren\u2019t buying in, he said, because \u201cthe pressure to stay in touch is getting stronger, not weaker.\u201d Independent of Mr. Tibbitts, Aegis has built its own technology to work at the network level and was also in talks with Sprint, though those discussions have been delayed.", "As the Katasi technology developed, the question of who would buy the service took on added weight. To determine how much to invest, Sprint had to know how much the service would bring in. In particular, Sprint executives said, they needed to understand the scale of one important risk: legal liability. In a nutshell, company officials said they asked themselves what would happen if the technology let one text slip through, and someone reading the message became involved in a crash. That could be a financial liability for the company, and a tragedy.", "\u201cIf that one message does get through, and someone understood, \u2018I bought this and I\u2019ll be safe,\u2019 what does that mean for our brand and our business?\u201d said Wayne Ward, vice president for business and product development at Sprint.", "The challenges \u201ckept mushrooming,\u201d Mr. Ward said. For instance, was Sprint required to check every link in its network to make sure it could be counted on to block information? Did Sprint, Mr. Ward asked, need to build a second network, a redundant one, in case the first failed for some reason?", "The costs were mounting, the returns unclear. \u201cThe technology works; the technology is there,\u201d said Walter Fowler, a spokesman for Sprint. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of working out the legal issues. The legal uncertainty \u2014 that\u2019s the major issue.\u201d", "The project, they said, is stalled, maybe indefinitely.", "Mr. Ward said he appreciated what Mr. Tibbitts had done, having poured about $450,000 of his own money into the venture, along with about $2.5 million from investors. But Mr. Ward said he had the big picture to think about. \u201cI\u2019m protecting the brand of a $35 billion company,\u201d he said.", "\u2018This Is a Behavior Problem\u2019", "To some legal experts, Sprint\u2019s concerns about liability seem overblown. W. Kip Viscusi, a professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, and the founding editor of The Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, said that even if Sprint were sued and lost, a judge or jury would be unlikely to perceive its actions as reckless, a legal standard that can lead to big punitive awards.", "Some people involved in the negotiations, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said Sprint was worried more about how much money it would make. It wanted more from American Family for providing wireless service to the telematics boxes, these people said, and wanted to make sure that there would be enough customers demanding text blocking.", "Mr. Fowler of Sprint, however, said the company\u2019s position was \u201cnot about profit; it is about doing the right thing.\u201d", "Mr. Tibbitts conceded that consumer demand was a big challenge.", "\u201cThis is a behavior problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to make condoms cool.\u201d", "He has ideas for stoking consumer demand, like enticing teenagers to buy the service by giving rewards to users from companies like Chipotle and Starbucks. Chipotle management was excited about the idea, Mr. Tibbitts said. But it wasn\u2019t enough to convince Sprint.", "For now, Mr. Tibbitts and American Family Insurance have turned their energy to several other carriers. Mr. Tibbitts says the potential for a partnership gives renewed life to the technology. Time will tell.", "In the meantime, the outcome with Sprint raises a fundamental question: Is a technological solution, long thought crucial to ending distracted driving, enough?", "The efforts to stop drunken driving and to improve seatbelt use prove the value of two tactics: education campaigns combined with tough, enforced laws. Forty-five states now ban texting and driving, and education efforts have grown. Many surveys show that awareness of the problem is not an issue; a 2013 report from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that 94 percent of people surveyed considered sending or reading texts while driving \u201cunacceptable.\u201d And yet roughly a third of drivers admit to doing both.", "Mr. Teater, the executive with the National Safety Council, said he still thought that a \u201cnetwork level\u201d technology solution was essential. (He was an executive at Aegis but left in 2009 and is no longer involved with the company.) \u201cIf one of these players steps forward and aggressively promotes it,\u201d he said, speaking of a text-blocking service, \u201cI firmly believe demand will be there.\u201d When people start using it and \u201crealize their worlds aren\u2019t falling apart,\u201d he said, they will tell their friends and \u201cwe\u2019ll be off and running.\u201d", "But Paul Atchley, a psychologist at the University of Kansas who studies compulsive use of texting by drivers, said awareness wasn\u2019t enough. The lure of the device is too powerful, he said, to be overcome by awareness of the risks.", "He agreed that a network-level solution was important, but only when combined with tougher laws. Drunken-driving laws, he said, are clear and unequivocal, whereas laws around distracted driving are confusing, because they seem to allow some phone use \u2014 dialing the phone and calling up a song \u2014 but not texting. And they\u2019re tough to enforce. An appropriately tough law, he said, would be this: \u201cIf you\u2019re seen manipulating the phone, you will be pulled over. Period.\u201d Only then, he said, will behaviors and attitudes become aligned.", "It seems unlikely that all use of phones in cars will be outlawed. But if it\u2019s unthinkable to take the phone out of a driver\u2019s hands, maybe it\u2019s possible to remove the car.", "That\u2019s the thinking of Jeff Larason, the president of the Safe Roads Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group that works with state departments of motor vehicles to distribute safety information to drivers. Maybe, he said, this problem is so intractable \u2014 the lure of the phone so powerful \u2014 that the real technological solution will come from Google in the form of the self-driving car: \u201cMaybe the Google car is going to win, and it\u2019ll make these questions moot because you can do whatever you want in the car while the car drives for you.\u201d", "In the meantime, Mr. Tibbitts pushes ahead, pursuing other carriers and using crowdsourcing to help keep the lights on.", "\u201cIt\u2019s so hugely frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve put five years of my life into this; we\u2019ve put in millions.

Crowds gathered when she appeared in the streets of Paris. Newspapers reported her outfit changes. Royalty asked to meet her. Traditional beauty is rarely so exciting, but hers was unorthodox: She had a long neck, a big nose and skin so uncannily white that people argued over whether it was real or fake. Theories included that she covered her entire body with makeup or strategically dosed herself with arsenic. In an era of puffy, body-swallowing gowns, she wore snug dresses that showed off her curves; she put red makeup on the tips of her ears, just for extra drama. She was rumored to be sleeping with half the men in Paris. Every painter wanted to paint her, to be the great hero who fixed her image for a culture desperate to stare at it. But art \u2014 the translation of three-dimensional life into a flat, static illusion \u2014 was an act of magic with serious consequences. In a time before mass-produced cameras, an image was a heavy thing, laborious to make and hard to distribute. Instagram was Duragram. Am\u00e9lie always refused.", "Then came John Singer Sargent. Like Am\u00e9lie, Sargent was a displaced American eccentric whose reputation was soaring in France. (Am\u00e9lie\u2019s family was from New Orleans; Sargent\u2019s from New England.) During portrait sessions, he chain-smoked, chattered constantly, used pocketfuls of bread as erasers and \u2014 when he was particularly inspired \u2014 ran at the canvas screaming, \u201cDemons, demons, demons!\u201d Sargent courted Am\u00e9lie, and eventually he got her. Unfortunately she turned out to be a terrible subject. She fidgeted, complained, skipped appointments. She wanted to go to parties, not to stand frozen in a quiet room in front of a man she wasn\u2019t even sleeping with. Sargent sketched her over and over, obsessively, whenever she gave him the chance, month after frustrating month.", "The painting was unveiled at the Paris Salon of 1884. It was huge (nearly seven feet tall) and striking in a way that portraits rarely are. Sargent called it \u201cPortrait of Madame ***,\u201d but the asterisks were useless: Everyone recognized the nose, the curves, the skin. The image radiated erotic energy. Am\u00e9lie looked simultaneously haughty and casual, contorted and relaxed, implausible but real. She wore a snug black dress that looked as if it were about to come off, an effect Sargent exaggerated by painting her right shoulder strap slipping down. (It had fallen one day during a session, and Sargent asked Am\u00e9lie to leave it that way.) The portrait\u2019s background was muddy brown, and Am\u00e9lie\u2019s exotically fair skin popped against it with almost supernatural brightness. She looked bioluminescent.", "The portrait was an immediate scandal. French critics said that Madame X looked like a corpse, that her posture was absurd and tortured, that the painter and his subject were both obviously vulgar and shameless and desperate for attention. The papers published caricatures. Everyone in Paris went to the Salon to gawk. At 25, Am\u00e9lie Gautreau was suddenly infamous. Her mother accused Sargent of ruining her daughter. The painter\u2019s stock declined. When the salon ended, Sargent took \u201cPortrait of Madame ***\u201d back to his studio and repaired the fallen strap, painting it back up over Am\u00e9lie\u2019s shoulder. He called it the best painting he had ever done, but he did not try to sell it. For nearly 30 years, he kept the painting sequestered in his studio. He left France. New commissions were sparse. It took him a couple of years to get his career going again. Am\u00e9lie, meanwhile, spent the rest of her life in the shadow of the scandal. She posed for other portraits, hoping at first to redeem her image and later simply to recapture the early attention, but she never succeeded. She ended up a middle-aged recluse in a house with no mirrors. That is not a metaphor: Madame X had all the mirrors removed from her home, because she couldn\u2019t stand to see her own image.", "Madame X would be surprised at what has become of her image today. Over the last 130 years, Sargent\u2019s portrait has spread via postcards, posters, art books \u2014 everything Walter Benjamin once called \u201cmechanical reproduction.\u201d Her glamorous danger has been appropriated, again and again, by official culture. Google her, and you will find hundreds of thousands of images: celebrities posing as Madame X (Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman, Daisy Duck), a line of Madame X lingerie, a Madame X opera, a \u201cboudoir-themed bar\u201d in New York, a man with a tattoo of Madame X on his arm. There is a cost for so much reproduction, Benjamin wrote: the loss of the original artwork\u2019s \u201caura,\u201d its quasi-sacred essence \u2014 \u201cits presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.\u201d And it is true that on a screen (laptop, tablet, phone), in liquid crystal form, Madame X looks like nothing terribly special: a digital image of an old painting, devoid of topography, all the scandal rinsed away. This is a fate she shares with most classic works of art.", "In search of the actual aura of Madame X, I went to see the original portrait, which is now institutionalized in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In person, it is as scandalous as ever. It still radiates erotic energy. It has infinity aura. The painting is as big as 629 of my iPhone screens; although there are larger pictures in the room, Madame X dominates them. I stood in front of her for a long time, inhaling the aura, making notes.", "Toward the end of my session, three older women came into the gallery. They went straight to Madame X. One seemed to be a guide, and she gave the others a bullet-point history. Paris, skin, arsenic, affairs, strap, scandal, mirrors. The other two looked on.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s beautiful,\u201d one of the women finally said. \u201cLook at her nose. Do you think she\u2019s beautiful?\u201d", "The other did not think she was beautiful.", "The tour guide defended Am\u00e9lie\u2019s beauty, but only halfheartedly, I thought, and the women passed out of the room toward Gallery 760, with its epic portrait, the size of a billboard, of George Washington crossing the Delaware. Aura, it seems, is not a universal constant. It is variable and fragile. It may even be endangered. I could see it. Why couldn\u2019t they see it? They seemed to have been looking not at the actual \u201cPortrait of Madame ***\u201d but only at a famous painting, a flat celebrity on a wall. Madame X still stood there, in front of me, but she was in a million other places at the same time. Modernity had scattered her force. In the late 19th century, when she was painted, mechanical reproduction was a relative novelty. Today that reproduction has gone galactic. We have postmechanical reproduction, the digital proliferation of images, so disproportionately many of them that they have become a kind of antimatter; they have begun to cancel out the originals. We are living through an epidemic of auralessness.", "Had my iPhone \u2014 this weapon of mass abstraction \u2014 killed Madame X? Was I imagining things? If an aura wasn\u2019t safe in the great marble fortress of the Met, where would it ever be safe? Where could the old art go to reclaim its immediacy, its radical presence? I did the only rational thing and flew to Laguna Beach.", "Laguna Beach looks fake. Look at it. Walk down the sidewalks. You\u2019ll pass alien plants \u2014 flowers that look like sea creatures, bushes growing artichokes that are not actually artichokes, smooth twisted fairy-tale trees. You\u2019ll pass sudden implausible outbreaks of scenically craggy rock. You\u2019ll pass beach bungalows of eccentric design. Shingles, shingles. Way at the top of the hills, glass mansions cluster like barnacles, luxury barnacles, filtering ineffably expensive nutrients out of the air. It\u2019s all implausible, the entire town. The ocean at Laguna Beach doesn\u2019t even try to look realistic: It\u2019s 300 percent too beautiful \u2014 it looks like a screen saver, as if any second now, someone is going to hit a key or nudge the mouse, and the whole thing will disappear. Blatant fakery. Walk around. Look. The Hare Krishna temple has palm trees in front of it. The tide pools seem professionally stocked: crabs in every crevice. A beachfront bicycle cop writes up a ticket for a man sleeping on a bench (\u201cDo not get up: You\u2019ll go to jail. Date of birth?\u201d), while on the very next bench, a jogger lost in earbud music does focused triceps dips. I passed people so painfully tan they seemed to have been sewn together out of leather wallets. Two of the tide pool\u2019s small crabs were fighting over the severed claw of a larger crab. Pure fakery. Mass hallucination. In the winter you can watch the whales leap. And yet people go on living there as if it\u2019s all real.", "To get to Laguna Beach, you have to leave Orange County proper and pass through a long, wild, savage, beautiful canyon. The canyon is not plausible, not at all, not for a moment. Mountain lions and bobcats hunt among its looming otherworldly boulders. These boulders were sculpted in the Mannerist style, millions of years ago, by water and wind. They are a geological rebuke to the very notion of poured concrete. The wildness of the canyon is a minor miracle: Over the decades, Laguna Beach residents have fought hard to protect it from Orange County\u2019s creeping sprawl. (As Ireland is to rolling green hills, Orange County is to freeways.) The effect is stunning. Driving through it, after Orange County\u2019s flat, clogged superhighways, feels like passing through a tunnel, a portal, an existential filter, an alimentary canal. You can feel the canyon scraping the O.C. off you as you drive.", "At the very end of the canyon, just before it dumps you into the Pacific Ocean, you reach the headquarters of the Pageant of the Masters. This is the hub of Laguna Beach\u2019s fakery. The pageant is a bizarre annual spectacle that has existed for more than 80 years. During that time, it has come to serve as an unlikely bulwark against the dissipation of classical art: a place where the old masterpieces are literally brought to life. This is exactly what I flew out to see: the treasures of art history embodied by a bunch of modern Californians.", "The pageant takes place in an outdoor theater in the canyon itself: Bright red plastic seats face a stage, on which for six or so weeks every summer, reality and appearance struggle for dominance. It is an estuary of the real and the unreal; in the same way that water can be brackish, the Pageant of the Masters is real-ish.", "The pageant is hard to describe, because it is \u2014 in a strict sense \u2014 unique: There is nothing else in the world like it. It is a stage show in which actual living humans pose, in elaborate makeup and sets and costumes, as paintings and sculptures by the old masters: Vermeer, Rembrandt, Bruegel, Leonardo, Botticelli, Manet, Donatello, Michelangelo and everyone else in your basic Intro to Art textbook. The old-fashioned term for this kind of performance is tableaux vivants, or \u201cliving pictures.\u201d Victorians used to make them, on a much smaller scale, as a parlor game, but the practice died out with the rise of mass media and the decline of parlors. The very notion of a tableau seems to contain, fossilized, an alien relationship to culture.", "And yet the tradition survives, right here in the meat of the 21st century, in Laguna Beach. In fact, the tradition thrives there: The Pageant of the Masters sells out almost every night, more than 50 performances every summer, and this year took in close to $1 million after expenses. It draws visitors from around the world. It has a pool of more than 500 volunteers. It has become the defining institution of Laguna Beach. Every year the pageant holds a celebrity benefit, hosted by someone like Neil Patrick Harris or Mario Lopez or the cast of \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d Steve Martin is a huge fan. It has been parodied on \u201cArrested Development\u201d (the characters performed in something called \u201cLiving Classics\u201d) and \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d (\u201cThe Festival of Living Art\u201d).", "Three fundamental questions will occur, in rapid succession, to almost every spectator at the Pageant of the Masters.", "First: What am I looking at?", "Even if you know, technically, what you are looking at \u2014 humans posing as art \u2014 your brain will still force you to ask this question. The illusion of the pageant is astonishingly good and strange. You are trapped between perceptual worlds; everything is simultaneously 2-D and 3-D. It is uncanny. Your eyes are confused, your brain feels squeezed. Rembrandt is non-Rembrandt.", "The second question that will occur to you, there in the audience, with the metaphysical steam coming out of your ears, is: How do they do it?", "The answer is actually straightforward: With many thousands of hours of surprisingly old-fashioned stagecraft. The big trick at the Pageant of the Masters is that there are no real tricks: It\u2019s just a collection of humble, centuries-old, low-tech stage arts (carpentry, costuming, makeup, lighting) working together to simulate the most rarefied high art.", "The third question that the pageant will force you to ask is the biggest one of all: Why?", "Why is any of this happening?", "Why are these people doing this?", "Why am I here watching it?", "Why does the Pageant of the Masters exist?", "Here it\u2019s tempting to be cynical, to dismiss the pageant as horrible cheesy fakery \u2014 a shallow proxy for true art designed for people who\u2019ve never had contact with it. The name itself reads like a parody. It\u2019s hard to convince anyone otherwise until they\u2019ve seen the show firsthand. If you\u2019re tempted to be cynical from a distance, however, consider that the three fundamental questions the pageant forces its audience members to ask \u2014 What am I looking at? How did it get that way? Why is it happening at all? \u2014 are not trivial questions at all; they are in fact the same questions we are forced to ask by serious art itself.", "The Pageant had its origins in 1932 as part of a publicity stunt. Laguna Beach \u2014 this tiny idyllic art colony on the edge of civilization \u2014 was looking to brand itself to the outside world. The Olympics were being held that summer in Los Angeles, 50 miles north, and Laguna\u2019s artists were hoping to siphon a little of the money and the attention. So they invented a spectacle of their own: the Festival of Arts. Artists opened their studios and displayed their works. The first pageant, which they added the next summer, was amateur and old-fashioned even by the standards of the time. People dressed up as \u201cWhistler\u2019s Mother\u201d and \u201cMona Lisa\u201d and went marching down the street, leading visitors to the festival. The next summer they did it again, posing in a small wooden shack that reminded viewers of an outhouse. After a couple of years, a local entrepreneur decided that the pageant was an embarrassment. If it was going to continue, he said, it needed to be done right. He injected real rigor into the show. He scouted Laguna Beach for people whose faces actually bore a resemblance to the figures in famous works. His wife added music and narration. He found a dedicated spot for the performance. He set the groundwork for the spectacle the pageant is today.", "All of the pageant\u2019s works of art are played by volunteers. The time commitment is so intense that there are two full casts: Blue and Green. They work in shifts, like firefighters: seven days on, seven days off. The two casts have different personalities and traditions. The Green cast\u2019s \u201cLast Supper,\u201d for instance, has been together for decades \u2014 Jesus has been Jesus for 26 years \u2014 and they meet for dinner every week and make commemorative \u201cLast Supper\u201d T-shirts every year and in general take the job extremely seriously. The Blue cast\u2019s \u201cLast Supper,\u201d whose Jesus has been Jesus for only 15 years, is a little less unified, more casual.", "The first Madame X I met was from the Blue cast. We talked one night before the show as she got her makeup done. Her real name is Elise Landgraf, but her makeup artist, Karen McCauley, had nicknamed her Wiggle-Wiggle.", "\u201cShe won\u2019t sit still,\u201d Karen told me. \u201cShe likes to chat. She always turns when someone comes in the room.\u201d", "I told Karen about John Singer Sargent\u2019s frustration with the restlessness of the original Madame X.", "\u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThis is her.\u201d", "As she worked, Karen kept glancing at a gaudily painted disembodied foam head next to Elise\u2019s face. This was the makeup template for Madame X. All the characters in the pageant have these heads, each with just the right amount of garish color. The makeup room is full of them, rows and rows of heads, each labeled with the name of a work of art: \u201cNight Watch,\u201d \u201cWoman Drinking With Soldiers,\u201d \u201cLe D\u00e9jeuner sur L\u2019Herbe.\u201d Like beauty-pageant makeup, the makeup here is over the top \u2014 it\u2019s how you make someone look realistically fake. (There are entire closets filled with wet wipes, which the characters use to remove their makeup.) According to the official makeup sheet, Madame X\u2019s palette consists of porcelain, carnation pink, mauve, sky blue, contour brown, sandy rose, dusty rose, light pink, white, black and (on the lips) red.", "Elise told me that she grew up near Anaheim and that, as a teenager, she worked at Disneyland.", "\u201cShe was Snow White,\u201d Karen said.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t say that,\u201d Elise told her. \u201cI was a performer. I was a performer.\u201d (Apparently there is a Disney-character omert\u00e0.)", "Whatever role she played, it is hard to imagine someone with more of a Disney princess vibe than Elise. She struck me as wholesome, energetic, sweet, optimistic and essentially American \u2014 not exactly how I imagined Madame X. Elise first heard about the pageant from other Disneyland performers \u2014 there seems to be a decent amount of crossover between the two worlds. (The pageant\u2019s costume designer, Mary LaVenture, used to make Mickey and Goofy suits for Disneyland.) Today Elise works as a behavioral therapist for autistic children in Irvine.", "King Tut walked in to have his face painted gold. He was a teenager from Dana Point, the next beach town south. He said the casting director chose him because his face looked like the computer-model reconstruction of King Tut\u2019s face, which he later looked up online and \u2014 he had to say \u2014 he agreed with. There was a line drawn around his chin that night to mark the spot where the prosthetic beard would be attached once his makeup session was over. Karen said they have to be careful with King Tut\u2019s chin, because his skin tends to break out.", "Karen said that the night before, while Elise was subbing in a nude Manet painting, the woman who filled in as Madame X was excited because her ex-husband was in the audience with his 11th girlfriend \u2014 all while she was onstage, embodying a timeless sex symbol, under the bright lights, enjoying the attention of thousands. \u201cShe got a little revenge,\u201d one of the makeup women said.", "The next afternoon, I met the second Madame X, from the Green cast. We sat just outside the gift shop, where you could buy a copy of Deborah Davis\u2019s book \u201cStrapless\u201d (from which I first learned the story of Madame X) as well as a Sherlock Holmes doll or a tin of \u201cLast Supper\u201d breath mints. It was a temperate day in July, and vibraphone music poured from a stage nearby. This Madame X\u2019s real name was Laura Kirkland. She had a couple of hours before she had to go in for makeup, so she still looked like herself: tall, blond, slim and beachy, with large green eyes and perfect white teeth. She seemed like a picture of L.A. health. Laura was born and raised in Los Angeles, where she still works as a dental hygienist. She likes to hang out in Malibu. She rearranged her work schedule around the pageant, because Laguna Beach is an hour-and-a-half drive. She said it was a little surreal, going from sterile gloves and gown and dental mask to corset and makeup and bright lights in front of an audience.", "The vibraphone music escalated as we talked about the real Madame X. The hardest thing about playing her, she told me, is the pose, which is deceptively complex. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how unnatural it is,\u201d she said. Then she showed me. In the portrait, Madame X\u2019s right hand rests on a table that\u2019s too low to support her weight, and her arm is twisted to the brink of dislocation: The thumb points sideways, the elbow points backward. Her shoulders point directly forward, but her head turns sideways in profile. It\u2019s as if the entire human machine has been subtly miscalibrated. \u201cYou don\u2019t even think about those things until you try to do the pose,\u201d Laura told me. Even the face is hard. \u201cShe has such an attitude \u2014 and yet it looks like nothing, too. When you first try to create that look, you immediately want to put your chin up. But her chin is level.\u201d She said the pose is artificial every time. She\u2019d been doing it for weeks, and it wasn\u2019t getting any easier.", "I met Perseus one afternoon in a restaurant just off the beach. His real name is Bob Dewey. He is conspicuously healthy, fast-talking and surprisingly open. I asked Bob how he came to be Perseus, and it turned out to be an epic Orange County journey. All his life, Bob told me, he had been completely indifferent to art. He was an athlete and a real estate entrepreneur. After his divorce, someone told him that he needed to expand his horizons \u2014 that life wasn\u2019t all sports and business.", "So Bob decided to volunteer for his local arts institution. He lives in a condo in Laguna Beach, a short walk from the Pageant of the Masters, but he had never been to it before. Volunteering, he assumed, would mean taking tickets or parking cars. Instead, he was invited to a casting call, where he was photographed and measured alongside hundreds of other prospective volunteers.", "Weeks later, the casting director offered him the part of a statue \u2014 a \u201csculpt,\u201d in pageant lingo. This was in 2012. The part was a Michelangelo statue; it would mean posing almost fully nude, painted like marble. Bob accepted. He loved the whole experience. It made him start to think about art in a new way, to notice the galleries around Laguna Beach, occasionally even to go in and look. He also got to sub in that year\u2019s show as Rodin\u2019s \u201cThinker\u201d \u2014 another nude, this time with his body painted bronze.", "Bob joined the pageant\u2019s research committee, which meant he got a sneak peek at the art that would be featured in the following year\u2019s show. This is when he first saw Cellini\u2019s statue of Perseus.", "The age of reproduction has been less kind to statuary than it has been to painting. Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d was carved from a block of marble 17 feet high. It was singular, overwhelming, superhuman. When it was unveiled, in 1504, it was so powerful that it redefined the entire self-image of Florence. The statue had so much mass that special equipment had to be built to move it: the strongest possible nets built into a wooden frame on huge logs. The machine crawled across the city. It took four days to move it about a third of a mile. They installed \u201cDavid\u201d in the Piazza della Signoria, the city\u2019s most important public square, where its aura became a civic weapon. Google the \u201cDavid\u201d today, and you will find it weightless, 12,000 pounds of marble reduced to endless panels of thumbnails, images that you can move anywhere you like, instantly.", "The pageant seems to have given Bob a particular appreciation of the power of statues. As soon as he saw a photo, he knew he had to be Perseus. Cellini\u2019s statue, which joined Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cDavid\u201d in Florence\u2019s main public square in 1545, is a classic Renaissance depiction of human heroism. Perseus stands on top of Medusa\u2019s freshly decapitated body, his six-pack rippling, while blood spills decoratively out of her neck. In his right hand, Perseus holds a sword; in his left, up high, is Medusa\u2019s severed head. Veins bulge out of his biceps. Bob became excited: Surely this was the greatest possible fusion of athleticism and art.", "At 54, Bob was impressively fit, but he knew he wasn\u2019t in Perseus shape. So he went out and hired a personal trainer. The first thing he did was show her a picture of the statue. \u201cMake me look like that,\u201d he said. He started working out most days. Over three months, he got his body fat down into the single digits. He looked like an ancient hero, at least 15 years younger than he actually was. When audition time rolled round, his measurements were perfect. He got the part.", "For 28 shows this summer, Bob loomed over the stage, naked except for a minimalist loincloth, painted metallic green, standing on an ornate sculpted pedestal atop the foam body of Medusa, gripping her foam head, with the total ripped confidence of a Greek demigod. His only fear, Bob told me, was a bizarro variant of Perseus\u2019s fear when he went to kill Medusa: Bob worried that he would look out into the audience (pageant cast members are advised to fix their eyes on a random point in the crowd), accidentally see a beautiful woman and, in the course of his 90 seconds onstage, get an erection.", "On my last night at the Pageant of the Masters, during the performance, I stood backstage, just outside the audience\u2019s view. This put me in a perfect spot: right on the threshold where the volunteers turned from regular Californians into art \u2014 as close to the moment of transference as it is humanly possible to get. I saw King Tut climb into his sarcophagus, his phallic beard bobbing wildly off the end of his chin. (He holds his breath onstage, he told me, to try to keep it from moving.) I listened to two children dressed as ancient Greeks, wearing togas and long beards, talk about web videos. I watched Jesus and the Twelve Apostles climb into the \u201cLast Supper\u201d set, palms held in front of them, like surgeons after scrubbing, so they wouldn\u2019t ruin their makeup. A stagehand held up a small electric fan, swinging it slowly back and forth, to cool the holy party as it waited to be rolled in front of the audience.", "Backstage was surprisingly small for such a big operation \u2014 \u201ca tuna can,\u201d Richard Hill, the pageant\u2019s technical director, called it \u2014 but all the action was precisely choreographed. The workers had that guild memory, the memory of generations. Roll a set in, load it with people, pose them, roll it to center stage, roll it out, unload. From the audience, the paintings seemed to glide: The whole spectacle was serene and still, sacred magic, like a dream. But backstage, stagehands were running around, laughing, talking in full voices, inspecting sets with flashlights, setting up the next illusion, all just a few feet from where the current illusion was happening. Downstairs, where cast members washed off their makeup, hot-water pipes thrummed and clanked. While the audience was admiring \u201cJekyll and Hyde\u201d and listening to narration about \u201cthe schism at the heart of Victorian society,\u201d a stagehand sat down right on the back of the set, chewing gum, blowing large pink bubbles.", "Toward the end of Act One, an empty golden frame was rolled up directly next to me. This was for Madame X: an approximate copy of the ornate frame that John Singer Sargent chose for the original. (A note on Richard\u2019s command station pointed out that one side of the frame was slightly damaged and needed repair.) Inside that frame was the painting\u2019s background, waiting: the muddy brown atmosphere with the low side table. Madame X arrived a few minutes later. It was a Green cast night, which meant that this was Laura. (Laura, l\u2019aura, the aura.)", "Outside her frame, it must be said, Madame X was not looking elegant or languorous or commanding. She would not have dominated Paris with the force of her strange beauty. Laura walked slowly, awkwardly, arms held out to protect the makeup all over her body. Her hair was covered with a painted canvas headpiece meant to look like Madame X\u2019s hair. She wore a white apron to keep the makeup off her famous black dress. She looked like a hospital patient on her first walk after major surgery.", "The stagehands rolled over an industrial metal stepladder and locked it into place at the base of the frame. Laura climbed gingerly up and in. They attached a metal clip on the back of her dress to a metal clip on the set \u2014 a standard safety precaution. A stage director came over to run her, one last time, through the pose: Laura struck it and then relaxed. She made small talk with the stagehand. A few weeks ago, she started to tell us, there had been a great white shark attack in Malibu \u2014 but she was still in midsentence when a knock rapped against her frame.", "She went suddenly silent, and the frame rolled sideways, from stage right; then the lights blasted on to reveal Madame X, present and frozen in front of the crowd: arm twisted, shoulders forward, chin to the side and that one red ear, pointed at the crowd."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/upshot/tech-firms-and-lobbyists-now-intertwined-but-not-eager-to-reveal-it.html": ["Silicon Valley\u2019s relationship with Washington is becoming much cozier, at least as far as political contributions are concerned.

Facebook, for instance, added a page with this information three weeks ago, which increased its score in the index from zero to 50.", "To a large extent, the index represents a political maturity list. The top ranks are occupied by companies that have extensive contacts with the political world, usually through lobbying and campaign contributions, and who understand the public relations benefits of disclosing such information.", "From that perspective, the index also illustrates the tech industry\u2019s relative lack of political savvy. \u201cTech is really bad at figuring out how to contribute to political causes and issues,\u201d said Josh Mendelsohn, a tech investor and co-founder of Engine, which does policy research and advocacy to help link Silicon Valley to Washington. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything pernicious, but it\u2019s us not being really sophisticated.\u201d", "Up until a decade ago, the tech industry wanted little to do with Washington, mostly because it seemed to epitomize the old-fashioned way of getting things done. Regulators don\u2019t understand technology, tech executives often said. Washington moves too slowly to keep up with fast-changing technology, and technology can solve problems more efficiently than the public sector, many of them believed.", "Yet Silicon Valley\u2019s attitude has recently evolved from dismissive to grudgingly cooperative. It has realized it has no choice but to develop a relationship with Washington. Its companies are getting so big and powerful that they are attracting the attention of regulators and surveillance agencies. The industry has realized that Washington is the route to address issues it cares about, like net neutrality and the push for more visas for highly educated immigrants.

Because online advertising can cost much less than other forms, such efforts can be more efficient with a campaign\u2019s money, too.", "The \u201cCustom Managed Audiences\u201d tool works like this: A campaign or group uses its own list of potential voters (or buys one from a state authority or private vendor) and uploads it to Facebook. The company then matches the names to its user base through databases managed by companies, such as Acxiom, that specialize in collecting information about individuals.

The process anonymizes the users\u2019 personal identifiers but retains enough information to enable campaigns to target well-defined groups.", "While it targets advertising more precisely, the campaigns can also use it to raise money. For Facebook users, this new tool most likely means more political advertisements, but those ads could be directed to very specific interests or concerns.", "In Mr. Cornyn\u2019s primary race against Steve Stockman, a congressman, and two other opponents, the campaign used its voter list and Facebook information to identify more than 200,000 Texas Republicans on Facebook and place them into groups based on issues and behavior, said Josh Eboch, political director for the campaign. Members of those groups got targeted messages about issues such as gun rights and immigration.", "\u201cWe know which universe is which; each was a custom audience,\u201d Mr. Eboch said. \u201cWe can create ads just to those groups of people. Right away, we saw our costs went dramatically down.\u201d Mr. Cornyn won the primary with 59 percent of the vote, and is an overwhelming favorite to win a third term in November.", "Federal Election Commission records show that Mr. Cornyn\u2019s campaign has directly paid Facebook more than $77,000 since last year. But that represents a fraction of the money spent on Facebook and other online ads, Mr. Eboch said, since other advertising purchases were done through an outside vendor. Still, the amount of direct Facebook spending by the campaign is more than that of any House candidate in this cycle. Mr. Eboch said there were some months when the campaign\u2019s online media spending made up more than 25 percent of all advertising.", "Even a small increase in digital advertising means new revenue for Facebook. The company does not break out details of its revenue.

This is similar to the voter modeling that campaigns use to find out which candidates voters they have not contacted are likely to support. Although Facebook advertisers have been able to build \u201clook-alike\u201d groups based on Facebook\u2019s own data since last year, now they can create them from their custom files.", "Although campaigns have been able to send specific messages to individual voters or households via television, email and direct mail, social networks have been somewhat harder to crack because of the difficulty of knowing whether the Twitter or Facebook user really was an actual voter. Facebook, unlike Twitter and Google, has always insisted on its users identifying themselves. Social networks have also tried to control their users\u2019 information.", "Campaign managers have been wanting to reach potential supporters through social networks. When Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s campaign conducted focus groups with voters before his election, \u201cwe heard over and over that they got the majority of their political information from Facebook,\u201d said Alex Kellner, the campaign\u2019s digital director and now a director at Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy.", "\u201cWith TV ads, inherently there\u2019s waste,\u201d Mr. Kellner said. \u201cOnline you can drastically reduce that waste, and the scale and number of options you can do online exceeds mail.\u201d Using Facebook and other online platforms, the online campaign spurred about 90,000 people in the final days before the election to visit a website where they could find their polling places.", "During the 2012 presidential race, both the Obama and Romney campaigns tried to leverage their Facebook supporters into votes at the ballot box. The Obama campaign in particular would gather details on the Facebook friends of its supporters in order to encourage voters in key states to register and get to the polls. Those efforts were based on matching Facebook users to individuals in a voter file; Facebook itself did not have a tool to match its users to campaign-supplied lists until two months before the election. The Obama campaign developed its own \u201cTargeted Sharing\u201d application to enable users to send messages to friends in battleground states.", "\u201cCampaigns are working to fashion their supporters into conduits of strategic communications such as appeals to register to vote and turn out on Election Day,\u201d said Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\u2019s School of Journalism and Mass Communication who has written a book about the impact of new technologies on electoral politics. \u201cThere is a lot of work going on right now to match Facebook IDs to extant voter files for precisely this purpose.\u201d", "Other social networks, like Twitter, offer similar services (Twitter published its own case study of how the McAuliffe campaign matched voters to Twitter accounts), and services like NationBuilder offer campaigns the ability to match email lists to various social services.", "Changes to the contents of users\u2019 news feeds are usually greeted with skepticism if not outright hostility, but eventually users will become accustomed to these targeted messages, said Lindsay Hoffman, an associate professor of communication at the University of Delaware and coordinator for research and technology at the university\u2019s Center for Political Communication.", "\u201cAs long as campaigns are doing it just enough and not too much, I think it\u2019s just going to become very natural and people are going to become very used to it,\u201d Ms. Hoffman said. \u201cThis is sort of the next step in advertising.

Although youngsters are experts at texting, posting photographs on Instagram and upgrading to the newest social media app while their parents are trying to decipher Facebook, children are still not adept at using the Web to find reliable information.", "The study, which focused on seventh-grade students from two middle schools in Connecticut, compared reading test scores from state standardized tests as well as results of assessments that required students to perform tasks such as researching the question \u201care energy drinks heart healthy?\u201d using multiple web resources. The students were evaluated on such things as whether they could use keywords effectively in search engines, determine the credibility of a website, discern the bias of an Internet author and communicate their findings through email.", "Students from a school in a community where the median family income was more than $100,000 demonstrated slightly more than one extra school year\u2019s worth of online reading ability compared with students from a community where the median family income was close to $60,000.", "\u201cThis is more likely a comparison between a wealthier district and a middle-class district,\u201d said Mr. Leu, who said the researchers did not receive permission to study schools in the poorest communities in the state. \u201cSo the gap that we found, we would expect it to be greater if the economic differences were greater.\u201d", "Because an increasing number of life tasks and jobs depend on the ability to sift through boundless online information presented in various formats \u2014 text, videos, graphics and social media \u2014 the ability of a student to accurately search for and evaluate information on the web is becoming crucial to success.", "Yet few teachers are incorporating digital literacy into their curriculum. Because so many people use the Internet during leisure time, they might not realize how useful it could be as an educational tool, some experts say. They also may not realize how much their students need assistance.", "\u201cTeachers have to expect and recognize that they can\u2019t just say \u2018Google something,\u2019 because some of our students still don\u2019t know what that means, believe it or not,\u201d said Susan B. Neuman, a professor of early childhood and literacy education at New York University who is a co-editor of Reading Research Quarterly. In the study, the researchers polled the students about whether they used the Internet for schoolwork. They found that three quarters of the students in the lower-income school had been required to use the web for school assignments, compared with 97 percent in the more affluent school.", "\u201cIn schools that tend to be high need, high poverty, and low scoring, curriculum focuses intensely on those skills that are tested,\u201d said Sara Kajder, an assistant professor of English education at the University of Georgia who was not involved in the study. \u201cWe don\u2019t test on media literacy even though those might be the most important skills that we can give kids right now.\u201d", "Despite the higher rates of academic Internet use among the more affluent students in the study, a little more than a quarter of them performed well on tasks where they were required to discern the reliability of facts on a particular web page. Only 16 percent of the lower-income students performed well on those tasks.", "\u201cIt was a little bit startling,\u201d Mr. Leu said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the scores to be so low.\u201d", "Some schools and teachers are working with students to develop their research abilities online, but with many states and districts scrambling to put in place new, more rigorous academic standards known as the Common Core, many educators are focusing on traditional texts and reading comprehension skills.", "The Common Core standards do contain references to digital literacy, however. \u201cWhether you\u2019re dealing with the reading, writing or listening standards, there\u2019s a notion of students getting information both from print and digital sources and looking at credibility and accuracy of the sources,\u201d said Susan Pimentel, a lead writer of the Common Core standards.", "James Damico, an associate professor of literacy, culture and language education at Indiana University, said teachers often assumed that because adolescents seemed so comfortable with technology that they actually knew how to use it in an academic context. Teachers have the \u201cperception that the students are already tech savvy and can navigate and move around more quickly than the teachers,\u201d Mr. Damico said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t confuse that kind of savviness with critical evaluative skills.\u201d"], "https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/today-in-small-business-why-jewelry-stores-hide-the-price-tags/": ["What\u2019s affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners today.", "The Economy", "Social Media", "Marketing", "", "Strategies", "Finance", "Taxes", "Online", "Entrepreneurship", "Around the Country", "Washington", "Health Care", "Opportunities", "Ideas", "Technology", "Gene Marks owns the Marks Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm that helps clients with customer relationship management.

So maybe we should be looking for the source of a preferred rotation instead of a preferred reflection axis.", "Peter Melzer #3 hit on what I believe is the heart of the issue, when he invited us to stand on our head in front of the mirror. As a matter of personal comfort (always important in thought experiments!), I\u2019d rather save myself a headache and have my observer stand on their head. In that case, my mirror image will be flipped vertically as compared to the observer\u2019s view. And more generally, if the observer is oriented at an angle \u03b8 from my vertical, then as compared to my mirror image, what they see will be flipped about an axis that is rotated \u03b8/2 from the vertical. Of course, we could save our observer a headache by taking photos and rotating them instead of him or her.", "The point here is that when I claim that my mirror image is flipped, I am implicitly comparing it to some other image, and my seemingly automatic choice for that other image is the view of an observer standing upright and facing me. (Or if, as polymath #10 suggests, I lie on my side and look at the mirror, my automatic choice is an observer lying on their side, head-to-head and toe-to-toe with me.)", "In the end, it is my subconscious choice of the orientation (rotation) of my hypothetical observer that dictates my perceived axis of reflection.

Moreover, the government told the Foleys that it was a crime for private citizens to pay off terrorists.", "More important, in retrospect, was what the F.B.I. did not tell the family: Mr. Foley was being held alongside a dozen Europeans, whose countries have a history of paying ransoms.", "Mostly, the government offered sympathy but little active support, the family and their advisers said, leaving them overwhelmed and unsure of what to do.", "Guided by its strict no-ransom policy, the United States government\u2019s hands-off approach was vastly different from the tack taken by European countries, which quickly negotiated the release of their citizens in exchange for cash.", "This greatly frustrated the family of Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist, and the other American hostages, who were desperate for Washington to take stronger action, according to interviews with two dozen people, including members of Mr. Foley\u2019s family, witnesses to his time in captivity, his colleagues and a network of consultants who tried to win his release.", "\u201cThe F.B.I. didn\u2019t help us much \u2014 let\u2019s face it,\u201d Diane Foley said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur government was very clear that no ransom was going to be paid, or should be paid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was horrible \u2014 and continues to be horrible.

By contrast, European countries have repeatedly paid to free their citizens, despite signing numerous declarations vowing not to, prompting condemnation from former American officials and analysts.", "\u201cWhat is hard to prove is how many Americans have not been kidnapped as a result of the fact that the enemy knows they will not get a penny from us,\u201d said Gen. John R. Allen, who recently retired as the top commander in Afghanistan. \u201cIn the aftermath of this horrific event it makes it hard to explain this policy. But the fact that there are Americans in the region who were never taken because they knew there was no advantage to doing so needs to be factored in.\u201d", "The willingness to pay ransoms for kidnapped victims is a source of debate and mounting tension between the United States and Britain on one side and their European allies on the other. From the families\u2019 perspective, there is another dividing line between the two approaches: Many European nations take charge of the situation from the moment their citizens are captured and aggressively begin a negotiation. By contrast, relatives in the United States said they were left to puzzle through the crisis largely on their own.", "While the F.B.I. declined to comment on its handling of the hostage crisis, a senior law enforcement official said that the bureau used every tool at its disposal. He conceded, however, that the bureau is bound by American law and cannot engage in a discussion over a potential ransom. \u201cThose are the lanes in the road we are left to work with,\u201d the official said.", "From the perspective of the families, however, the policy of not bargaining with terrorists is itself controversial. They argue that the death of even one person seems a high price to pay for the broader goal of not encouraging further kidnappings.", "A Broad Gulf", "Unbeknown to the Foleys, the email they received last November was part of a blitz sent by ISIS over a four-month period to the relatives of the 23 Western hostages they would eventually hold in the same jail, including three other Americans.", "There was immediately a gulf between how American and European officials responded.", "A crisis cell was activated inside the Foreign Ministries of France, Spain, Switzerland and Italy, staffed around the clock with people working in shifts, said a European counterterrorism official who has worked on numerous hostage cases and was briefed on the negotiations with ISIS.", "They waited for the kidnappers to reach out, and when they did, the intelligence services of at least one country took over the email accounts of family members, responding directly to the terrorist group, according to a person with direct knowledge of how the negotiations unfolded.", "As early as February of this year, the Europeans proceeded from requesting proof of life to making a ransom counteroffer, according to a person closely involved in the crisis who said the average sum negotiated per person was around \u20ac2 million.", "The Foleys and the other American families were left to answer the emails themselves and kept largely in the dark. They were not introduced to one another and had to find the other families on their own, Ms. Foley said. While high-level officials met with them, they shared little information.", "\u201cThey were always very cordial,\u201d Ms. Foley said. \u201cThe problem was we never got any information about what the government was doing \u2014 if anything \u2014 on our behalf. Every bit of information we got was on our own.\u201d", "The families said they had little evidence that the kidnappings had become a major concern for the Obama administration, though they acknowledge that they were not necessarily aware of all of the government\u2019s efforts.

It was a kind of extrapolation from what we had learned from the Western hostages that had been released.\u201d", "Although American officials initially advised the family that they could be prosecuted for paying a ransom, the bureau later privately told the Foleys that it was unlikely they would face charges and they could pursue their own course of action, independently of what the United States was attempting, a senior American official said. Once the family made it clear they wanted to pay, the bureau instructed them to stall, according to a consultant working on the hostage crisis.", "\u201cWhat the F.B.I. said is that their experience had shown that you want to draw out the process,\u201d said the consultant, who requested anonymity because he did not want to be seen as being critical of the United States. \u201cYou want to have lots of back and forth. You want further proof of life. You want to ask if you can speak to your son by phone \u2014 anything that elongates the process.", "\u201cI asked, \u2018Why do we want to do that?\u2019 What they said is, \u2018This is how you get the numbers down to a realistic figure,\u2019 \u201d the consultant said. \u201cAt one point, I said: \u2018Are you sure? I think we are just making them angry.\u2019 \u201d", "Cash was not the only thing Mr. Foley\u2019s captors wanted. In one of the early emails to the family, they had demanded the release of unspecified Muslim prisoners, Mr. Balboni said. In subsequent messages to the families of the other Americans, the captors proposed a swap for a Pakistani neuroscientist, Aafia Siddiqui, whose incarceration in a Texas prison on charges of trying to kill Americans in Afghanistan has become a rallying cry for jihadists.", "Such a swap was off the table, they were told, because of the no-concessions policy.", "Yet on May 31, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was released by the Taliban after being traded for five Taliban detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.", "This was a significant shift in how the United States had handled such situations. Dane Egli, who was a hostage rescue adviser for the National Security Council during the Bush administration, said Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s release \u201cintroduced a huge inconsistency in our policy.\u201d", "The families of the ISIS hostages were aghast. They angrily called their advisers and one another, feeling more than ever that they were on their own, said a person who worked alongside several of them.", "A Confusing Rationale", "The Obama administration argued that the Bergdahl case did not constitute an exception because he was considered a prisoner of war.", "By contrast, the families were advised that Ms. Siddiqui\u2019s release was impossible because she had been convicted in an American court, a different situation from that of the Guant\u00e1namo detainees, who have never been charged, according to one adviser.", "If this rationale was confusing for the families, it was especially hard to explain to their sons\u2019 captors.", "By the summer, President Obama authorized a rescue operation after a group of French journalists were released. In April and May, one of the released hostages sat down with the F.B.I. in Paris to describe the oil facility on the outskirts of Raqqa, Syria, where the 23 foreigners had been held. He pinpointed the location on a Google Earth map, showing a building opposite three silo-like formations.", "The unsuccessful rescue attempt took two more months to mount, as the authorities worked to corroborate the information from the former hostage, a senior official said.", "Advisers to the families say this delay shows the administration was not carrying out surveillance of the town in Syria where the four Americans were held, and had to scramble to position a surveillance aircraft over the area in order to establish a baseline of human activity. (Officials refused to confirm or deny, saying the information is classified.)", "Unaware of the July 3 rescue operation, the Foleys were working at full tilt on the only avenue open to them: trying to raise money. It was a humiliating endeavor. To save their son\u2019s life, they were essentially passing a hat, asking donors to provide money that would go to a terrorist group deemed so extreme it had been expelled from Al Qaeda.", "The family was particularly worried because they had not received a reply from ISIS since December. They were advised by the F.B.I. that the captors\u2019 demands were not serious because they had asked for such a high initial figure.", "Looking back, Ms. Foley said, she was \u201cappalled\u201d that the United States did not do more, and wondered if the government\u2019s approach did not cause their son\u2019s captors to single him out for retribution.", "\u201cJim was in the hands of a very hateful, brutal group of people \u2014 only God knows,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was clear that they wanted to negotiate. That angered them more than anything \u2014 they would send nasty messages aimed at the government, and the family had to get back to them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would read it over, and tweak it and suggest changes, but it was obvious they wanted to engage with the government, and I don\u2019t understand how it is that we were not willing to engage at some level. This made them more and more angry.\u201d", "On Aug. 8, Mr. Obama authorized airstrikes on ISIS positions in Iraq.", "On Aug. 12, the Foleys received the last email from their son\u2019s abductors.

Who ever heard of an Atkins bedroom or an Atkins medicine cabinet?", "But among the Paleo crowd, limiting one\u2019s enthusiasm for Paleo to food is almost a rookie maneuver.", "\u201cMost people come to the Paleo diet thinking, \u2018Hey, I can lose some weight,\u2019 \u201d said Cain Credicott, the editor and publisher of Paleo Magazine, which sells at the checkout counter at Barnes & Noble, next to Bon App\u00e9tit.", "\u201cEverybody recognizes now that if you eat a squeaky clean diet but are still going to bed at 1 a.m. after watching TV, waking up at 6 a.m. with an alarm clock and slathering yourself with sunscreen, it doesn\u2019t matter how good your diet is, you\u2019re not going to be healthy,\u201d Mr. Credicott said.", "The basic theory of the so-called cave-man diet (which, at this point, you would virtually have to live in a cave to be unaware of) is that the modern diet, with its reliance on grains, starches, dairy and processed sugar, is not what the human body evolved to thrive on, and has contributed to widespread \u201cdiseases of civilization\u201d like diabetes and heart disease.", "That is why leaders of the movement like Loren Cordain and Robb Wolf advocate a \u201cwild\u201d diet that falls roughly in line with that of those Paleolithic forager ancestors who had not yet learned to cultivate and eat grain, much less pry the lid off a Pringles can.", "Paleo is not without its critics. The science has been endlessly debated: Some nutritionists counter that verboten foods like grains, dairy and beans contain valuable nutrients, such as calcium, vitamins B and D, antioxidants and fiber. Elizabeth Kolbert, in a recent New Yorker road test of the diet, also pointed out that a meat-heavy diet has dire environmental implications. Still, proselytes often find that being Paleo quickly becomes a round-the-clock duty.", "That was the experience of Michelle Tam, a former pharmacist in Palo Alto, Calif., who has adopted a primal sleep regimen.", "It all started four years ago, when Ms. Tam, now 40, tried the Paleo diet to combat sluggishness and a stubborn muffin-top. But it didn\u2019t end when she shed the extra pounds, as she sought to reorder the rest of her life along those ancestral principles. She quit her hospital job and transformed herself into something of a Martha Stewart of Paleo. Her recipe blog, Nom Nom Paleo, draws more than 100,000 page views daily. And she has a best-selling cookbook, a cooking app and action figure (though, oddly, it\u2019s made of vinyl, not stone).", "Ms. Tam also found herself altering her sleep to become more Paleo. As Mark Sisson put it in his seminal 2009 book, \u201cThe Primal Blueprint,\u201d \u201cour ancestors\u2019 activity and sleep patterns were shaped by sunrise and sunset.\u201d In the primal mind, the modern sleep ritual, interrupted by iPads and Jimmy Fallon, seems as unhealthy as a dinner of Fiddle Faddle with a Mountain Dew chaser.", "That\u2019s why Ms. Tam, a confessed television addict, decided to cut out all electronic devices after 8 p.m. If she has to check her iPhone, she wears amber goggles to block the blue-spectrum light that she believes interferes with her circadian rhythms. Next, she turned her bedroom into the equivalent of a Lascaux cave, removing all clocks (her two young sons serve as her morning alarm, she said) and installing blackout window inserts.", "The move paid dividends. \u201cI used to envy how my young two boys would fall asleep almost immediately after their heads hit the pillow,\u201d Ms. Tam said. \u201cAt dawn, they\u2019d bound out of bed, eager to tell us about the previous night\u2019s dreams. Now, I sleep like them.\u201d", "She is not the only beneficiary. As Bloomberg Businessweek reported last fall, Indow Windows, the Portland, Ore.-based manufacturer of her window inserts, said traffic to its site tripled after Ms. Tam tweeted that she was \u201cthe happiest zombie on the planet\u201d thanks to the company\u2019s product.", "But the lifestyle does not end when you roll out of bed. For many, the quest to rid one\u2019s daily regimen of \u201cpoisonous things,\u201d to use Mr. Sisson\u2019s phrase, includes the morning beauty routine. Vita Pedrazzi, a former fashion manager at Harrods in London who now lives in the Canary Islands, said she used to be the sort of beauty obsessive who would slap on makeup to take out the trash, in part because of her sheepishness over her acne. But when the primal path inspired her to rid her bathroom of any product containing creepy-sounding chemicals, she adopted a zero-tolerance policy to any store-bought beauty product or cleanser \u2014 even soap.", "As she proudly related on her blog, Vita Lives Free, Ms. Pedrazzi, 30, now makes her own beauty products, including a \u201cno-poo\u201d shampoo method (baking soda and apple cider vinegar, with a few drops of jojoba oil for the tips as a leave-in conditioner), body scrub made from olive oil and brown sugar, and toothpaste made with coconut oil and baking soda, with activated charcoal tablets for whitening. Although houseguests are shocked to find not so much as a canister of Ajax in her house \u2014 her horrified father-in-law recently raced out to the drugstore to buy toilet cleaner, instead of her white vinegar solution \u2014 she feels transformed.", "\u201cThe new natural beauty routine totally transformed my skin, and I finally defeated my acne,\u201d she said. \u201cI was finally free.\u201d", "As the Paleo day continues, many find a way to keep at least a toe in the primal world at the office. A writer for Paleo Lifestyle Magazine recommends keeping a jar of virgin coconut oil in a desk drawer. (\u201cIf I end up getting an afternoon sugar craving, or just feel like I\u2019m in need of a quick snack, I just take out my spoon and eat a glob.\u201d)", "That may be one reason so many are looking to blow off some primal steam at the gym after work.", "The preferred form of exercise for the Paleo tribe is CrossFit, a high-intensity workout that stresses Cybex-equipment-free motions like lunges and burpees, and the high-protein, low-carb diet of neo-cave men. As John Durant, a founder of Paleo NYC and Barefoot Runners NYC, put it in his 2013 book, \u201cThe Paleo Manifesto: Ancient Wisdom for Lifelong Health,\u201d \u201cother animals don\u2019t \u2018exercise\u2019 so much as they either play or just do what is required to survive.

And never for unnaturally long stretches.", "\u201cEvolutionary fitness\u201d die-hards can also partake in back-to-nature workout retreats like MoveNat started by a French exercise guru named Erwan Le Corre, where participants crawl up hillsides on all fours, play catch with rocks and balance on logs over creeks.", "For those who spend their day rearing children, the primal impulse has made major inroads into parenting, too. Websites like The Primal Parent extol corn-syrup-free trick-or-treating, baby slings for \u201cattachment parenting\u201d and placenta-eating for new mothers.", "Unstructured play, in particular, has become a cherished concept among Paleo-minded parents like Ms. Phelps, the Oregon devotee, who argued that \u201cplay is the method by which all mammals learn.\u201d", "Primal parents are the polar opposite of the hyper-achievement-oriented \u201cTiger Mom\u201d model. Instead of overscheduling her 5-year-old daughter with cello lessons and science fairs, Ms. Phelps prefers to spend hours with her after school playing in a muddy creek near their house. \u201cShe loves bugs,\u201d Ms. Phelps said. \u201cShe loves dirt. I think she\u2019s going to be an entomologist.\u201d", "Mud. Rocks. Olive oil showers. From the outside, it may be easy to conclude that the Paleo lifestyle is all about hair shirts and self-denial. But Paleos, too, know how to rage after the workday is done, even though liquor, logically speaking, should be off limits. (It\u2019s not as if hunter-gatherers were slugging back highballs). Dr. Cordain\u2019s 85/15 rule of compliance allows for wiggle room, after all.", "For those looking to raise a glass, anything grain-forward, like beer, is typically out. But Paleos tend to look the other way on vodka (particularly potato vodka, which is free from all associations with gluten) and 100 percent agave tequila (hey, it\u2019s cactus).", "Pinterest, in fact, is brimming with Paleo cocktail recipes, like the Paleo Strawberry Daiquiri, courtesy of Paleo Girl\u2019s Kitchen.

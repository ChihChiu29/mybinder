The Nets have the inanimate Team Hype. But every team in sports with any semblance of a marketing department has its own version of the Fan Patrol or Fun Police. This unnaturally peppy collective represents a cross between a cheerleading squad and the \u201cmotivators\u201d at a bar mitzvah party. Their demeanor and high energy often totally at odds with the tenor of the game, they attempt to energize the crowd by cavorting with the mascot and dancing with kids on the Jumbotron and hosting the fan contest during breaks in the game. But the highlight of their shift comes when they launch T-shirts into the crowd.", "It\u2019s become a sports-event ritual as sacrosanct as the seventh-inning stretch or the singing of the national anthem. After making the obligatory I-can\u2019t-heeeeear-you hand gestures, the Pinstripe Police and their cognates start catapulting rolled-up shirts in the general direction of fans. Often the squads are equipped with air cannons. Others go old-school and use slingshots made of surgical tubing. The Phillie Phanatic, never one to be outdone, shoots off free hot dogs using a four-foot pneumatic gun.", "Reliably, the crowd goes wild. Fans fall over themselves trying to snag a prize. Literally, as David Babusiak of St. John, Ind., can attest. In 2007, Babusiak attended a White Sox game at Chicago\u2019s U.S. Cellular Field. Between innings, the Chevrolet Pride Team fired a shirt into the section where Babusiak was sitting. He made his move for the shirt. So did a gaggle of his fellow fans. In the scrum, Babusiak later claimed, he was shoved to the ground and suffered a permanent back injury. He filed a civil suit against U.S. Cellular Field and the Pride Team, seeking more than $75,000 in damages. The defendants, he alleged, were liable because they were \u201cengaging in an abnormally dangerous activity, namely, shooting free T-shirts as projectiles into an unsupervised crowd of spectators, some of whom may not have been sober.\u201d (Records from the United States District Court in Northern Indiana indicate that \u201cclaims between the parties have been amicably resolved.\u201d)", "From the perspective of the teams, it\u2019s easy to understand the T-shirt-cannon phenomenon. It\u2019s a cheap and easy way to keep fans happy, especially in the midst of a dreary season. Give them something to look forward to, even during another blowout or uninspired performance, and they might stick around longer and spend more money on concessions \u2014 not to mention keep coming back for more games, perhaps against their better judgment.", "But from the fans\u2019 perspective, the phenomenon mystifies: Why do spectators all over the world go to such lengths, risking even paralysis, for an inexpensive prize? These shirts, after all, aren\u2019t particularly special or high-quality. They\u2019re of arbitrary size and often emblazoned with the logo of a team sponsor. (A Knicks shirt is arguably cool; much less so when it says \u201cModell\u2019s Sporting Goods\u201d on the back.) So what\u2019s the big deal?", "That the product is scarce adds some appeal: Not everyone gets a shirt, so those who do feel special. It\u2019s the same reason a sales promotion is billed as a limited-time offer, or a collectible is called \u201cspecial edition\u201d and has its own serial number. That the \u201clucky\u201d fan has to catch a flying polyester projectile also adds a certain cachet that wouldn\u2019t exist if the shirt were simply handed out at the turnstiles.", "But the real appeal seems to be simply this: The shirts are free.", "You\u2019ve no doubt heard the expression \u201cIf it\u2019s free, it\u2019s for me.\u201d That\u2019s not just a throwaway line. Free is catnip for humans, an enticement so strong that it sometimes causes us to behave ridiculously \u2014 or at least in ways at odds with common sense and our best interests.", "One famous series of studies \u2014 repeated, modified and critiqued in equal measure \u2014 has been dubbed \u201cthe Hershey\u2019s Kiss experiments.\u201d Dan Ariely, a professor at the Duke Fuqua School of Business and a nimble behavioral economist, gave subjects a choice of two chocolates. They could buy premium Lindt truffles (which usually cost around 50 cents apiece) for 26 cents each, or they could buy the beloved but mundane Hershey\u2019s Kiss for a penny. In the outcome of this study, participants were equally split between the two chocolates. Fair enough.", "Then Ariely reduced the price of each chocolate by one cent. The Lindt was now 25 cents; the Hershey\u2019s Kiss was free. What happened? Tastes changed dramatically. A full 90 percent of respondents opted for the Hershey\u2019s. At first blush this makes no sense. The price differential was the same \u2014 still 25 cents more for the Lindt. Why would demand change so drastically? As Ariely later put it, the power that zero \u201cexercises over people\u2019s choice in chocolate nicely demonstrates the irrational draw of free things.\u201d", "Not that it\u2019s only free chocolate that causes us to act questionably. Ariely is quick to include himself among those seduced by the power of \u201cfree.\u201d Several years ago, he was in the market for a practical minivan. Instead he drove home a sleek Audi. Why? One big reason was that the Audi came with the promise of free oil changes for three years. \u201cIn fact, those services were worth only about $200, but the promise of \u2018free\u2019 anything was very appealing,\u201d Ariely explains. \u201cThey could have offered me a $2,000 discount on the minivan, and I still would have bought the wrong car because the free oil-change offer was so tempting in the heat of the moment.\u201d", "Who among us can\u2019t relate? We have zero interest in taking part in your telephone survey, but promise us free movie passes and we\u2019ll stay on the line for half an hour answering tedious questions about how many times a week we use soap powder. We opt for \u201cfree\u201d credit cards with exorbitant interest rates over cards with a modest annual fee but much lower interest, even though we know we\u2019re going to carry a balance each month. And how many of us go to Trader Joe\u2019s or Costco with no interest in buying, say, jalape\u00f1o kale chips but gladly stand in line and have a bite when we can try them free? (Empirical analysis of in-store sampling promotions shows that they work: Shoppers spend more money at a store after getting a free sample, as if they feel obligated to return the favor. As Ariely has noted: \u201cReciprocity is a very, very strong instinct. If somebody does something for you, you really feel a rather surprisingly strong obligation to do something back for them.\u201d)", "We\u2019ll even make long-lasting bad decisions due to the allure of \u201cfree.\u201d Ariely writes about a Dutch movie theater that offered patrons, in conjunction with the release of \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d the opportunity to see unlimited free movies for an entire year if they got a tattoo of the theater\u2019s logo: a doglike creature flying under a film reel. More than a dozen moviegoers were up for it.", "Irrationality like this can accelerate when consumers have already paid an exorbitant sum for something. Spending hundreds of dollars on floor seats to watch a crappy basketball team (not to mention $50 for parking and $12 per beer) leaves us feeling entitled to something in return. \u201cEntitled consumers often believe that their every whim should be catered to,\u201d explains Mike Norton, Ariely\u2019s collaborator and a co-author of \u201cHappy Money,\u201d a book on the science of spending. \u201cSports fans in this state of mind likely do more than experience the allure of giveaways,\u201d he told us. \u201cThey can more or less demand them, as though the $500 they shelled out for a ticket gives them a God-given right to one of those flying T-shirts.\u201d", "Fans aren\u2019t the only ones swayed by the power of free stuff. For years, teams\u2019 radio broadcasters struggled to cajole players and coaches to appear on postgame shows. Then they got smart and started offering guests free watches or steakhouse gift certificates in exchange for their time. Rationally this shouldn\u2019t have affected the players\u2019 behavior. For the most part, these are multimillionaire athletes, often making thousands of dollars per hour. Yet the siren song of a free Timex or Morton\u2019s voucher was too seductive to resist.", "Or consider a story recounted by a former tennis star in her autobiography. At the height of her popularity, tournaments offered her large appearance fees simply to show up. Despite her initial misgivings, she committed to one such tournament in Japan. \u201cIt was just too far from home, and I was tired from the travel grind,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey kept offering me more and more money for an appearance fee \u2014 well over $100,000 \u2014 but I said no. Finally, they offered to fly my whole family over (for free). That did it. We went, and I won easily.\u201d", "In his review of the book, the writer David Foster Wallace was struck by this anecdote and by the player\u2019s \u201codd financial sense.\u201d Wrote Wallace: \u201cShe won\u2019t come for $100,000+, but will come if they add a couple thousand in airfare?\u201d But such is the powerful inducement of \u201cfree.\u201d Had she (or, more likely, her agent) negotiated a bump in fee from, say, $100K to $105K, it would not have changed her mind. But, by accident or design, when the tournament promoter dangled the prospect of something \u201cfree,\u201d it got the job done.", "One more example: In the early 2000s, the Portland Trail Blazers hired a crew of workers to wash and wax players\u2019 vehicles during practices. Rationally speaking, this was silly: These millionaire athletes were singularly well suited to pay for their own buffing and polishing. Cynical journalists held this out as another example of athletes being pampered and cosseted. But perhaps a shrewd member of the Portland brass realized that the value would outstrip the cost \u2014 that in exchange for the free services, the athletes might do things they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t. Such as play defense. Or hustle for loose balls. Or respect the United States penal code (this was, after all, the height of the Jail Blazers era). It was the N.B.A. version of Google providing its employees on \u201ccampus\u201d with free gourmet food and dry cleaning, all in the effort to boost worker morale and performance.", "All of which is to say: When we get something for nothing, we feel as if we\u2019re putting one over on the world.

You and I don\u2019t need to. We\u2019ve seen three of the six episodes, and people want the truth first: Are they any good?", "Not at first, not at all. The first episode is called \u201cMy Struggle,\u201d which aptly describes the experience of sitting through it. It lumbers. It plods. The actors chew sawdusty mouthfuls of expository dialogue. It introduces an Alex-Jones-like conspiracy-talk-show host (Joel McHale), who\u2019s meant to be played straight but comes off like parody. Above all, it\u2019s handicapped by the fact that it has to tear down much of the show\u2019s mythology and construct a new one in an hour. It\u2019s like rebuilding a sports car just to back it down the driveway.", "Thankfully, the second episode shakes the dourness and gives Mulder and Scully more room to breathe. But it\u2019s the third \u2014 a comic palate-cleanser in the \u201cmonster of the week\u201d vein \u2014 that finally recreates the show\u2019s oddball delights. As Scully says, in one of the script\u2019s many meta comments, \u201cI forgot how much fun these cases could be.\u201d She\u2019s right. Still, while \u201cThe X-Files\u201d has a great legacy \u2014 on serial TV, on sci-fi and, thematically, on television at large \u2014 I wonder if its time has passed. Has the show changed, or have we?", "Mike Hale Man, that first episode is a dud. You can understand the need to recapitulate, but not in such a flat-footed way. It\u2019s like a greatest-hits reel \u2014 the phone call from Skinner, the shadowy warehouse, the abductee living in fear on a lonely road \u2014 with all the tension and excitement edited out.", "To your question: \u201cThe X-Files\u201d was a show about a certain mode of fear and style of conspiracy, and in the 14 years since it ended our culture has been overtaken by a new, more grim, more literal sense of fear. (The last season started on Nov. 11, 2001.) In the opening episode, the extended U.F.O. history lesson feels like a wrongheaded attempt to explain what all the excitement used to be about. In the exponentially better second and third episodes, the writers mostly ignore the time lapse, except to poke fun at Mulder\u2019s incompetence with personal electronics. They\u2019re confident that the show\u2019s structure still stands up.", "And about those writers. The show\u2019s creator, Chris Carter, took on the challenge of the introductory episode, and you have to cut him some slack for that. But his record since 2002 consists of an O.K. film (\u201cThe X-Files: I Want to Believe\u201d) and a terrible Amazon pilot (\u201cThe After\u201d). Episode 2 was written and directed by James Wong, who co-wrote the original series\u2019s first \u201cmonster of the week\u201d episode, the extra creepy \u201cSqueeze.\u201d Episode 3 is by Darin Morgan, whose four scripts for the original show included two of the greats, \u201cClyde Bruckman\u2019s Final Repose\u201d and \u201cJose Chung\u2019s \u2018From Outer Space.\u2019\u201d So maybe the improvement is no surprise. Looking ahead, we get Glen Morgan, Mr. Wong\u2019s old writing partner, for the fourth episode, but then two Carter scripts to close out the mini-series. So, fingers crossed.", "As a fan I loved the self-referentiality of the third episode \u2014 my favorite line was probably Mulder\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m just looking for some internal logic\u201d \u2014 but as a critic I wondered how interesting the episode would be for someone who hadn\u2019t watched the show before. It was really heavy on the in-jokes. Did that bother you at all? Does it matter?", "Poniewozik From my perspective \u2014 I was obsessed back in the day, but have forgotten a ton since \u2014 the shout-outs are nice, but not essential. They get a bit much; after each \u201cThe truth is out there\u201d and \u201cThe truth is in here\u201d and \u201cI want to believe\u201d I half-expected the actors to hold for applause. This is definitely a project for the devout, which raises the question of who those folks are. There are original X-philes, of course, but the show also seems anecdotally to have had a strong afterlife on Netflix.", "Which is interesting, because there\u2019s something very prebinge about its structure \u2014 a ratio of a couple of stand-alone episodes for every mythology episode. That\u2019s very much an artifact of the TV business of the \u201990s. Before Netflix, before \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d before \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d (from Vince Gilligan of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d), complicated serial TV was considered a risk. (\u201cTwin Peaks\u201d was an exception, but also a cautionary tale.) Before DVRs and streaming made catching up easier, you might permanently lose viewers every time they missed an episode, so older TV was aimed at making every installment accessible to a brand-new audience. \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d appropriately, was a DNA-engineered hybrid. Part of the time it was a complex sci-fi saga. Other times, it was an anthology \u2014 part \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d part buddy-cop show. It contributed to the show\u2019s surreal atmosphere, but I wonder if Mr. Carter would make the same show starting today \u2014 if an \u201cX-Files\u201d of 2016 would be \u201cLost\u201d or \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d", "Hale As long as you\u2019re raising the mythology versus stand-alone debate, I\u2019ll cast my vote for the stand-alones, though it\u2019s not necessarily a fair fight. When you look back at the show across this many years, it makes sense that the well-made, self-contained stories with distinctive characters or unusual approaches would be the ones to adhere in the memory. I\u2019m pleased that within the tight compass of this six-episode season they found room for at least one true monster-of-the-week episode.", "Another thing I appreciated about that third episode (titled \u201cMulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster\u201d) was that it allowed Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson to be a little silly. Humor, and those actors\u2019 comic talents, were an important ingredient in the mix of the original series that gets overlooked. Mr. Duchovny, especially, is a natural comedian with a genius for self-deprecation. He still gives just the right note of innocent vanity to a line like: \u201cI\u2019m a middle-aged man, Scully. No, I am.\u201d Like you, I\u2019ve forgotten a lot, but it\u2019s my sense that in general, mythology worked against humor \u2014 the serialized episodes had a severity to them, a \u201cwe\u2019re being serious now\u201d tone.", "Poniewozik If there are two kinds of \u201cX-Files\u201d fans, I am a committed Mythologist, though the new episodes do have me wondering if the Monsterists were right. With a few exceptions \u2014 the milestone \u201cPaper Clip\u201d in Season 3 \u2014 the serial episodes aren\u2019t the show\u2019s greatest, individually. But they made it special, and influential: The yarn on every Carrie Mathison conspiracy-bulletin-board-of-crazy leads back to them. It\u2019s hard to recreate that 1990s paranoid magic now simply by grafting on a few Edward Snowden references.", "When the new episodes work, it\u2019s because Mulder and Scully work. One thing I like about the new stand-alone episodes is that they\u2019re not entirely static; they carry the weight of history between these characters. (Oh yeah, remember that they had a kid together?) Even the lighter third episode reminds us how experience has changed their perspectives. Mulder has been burned enough to be dubious, while Scully has seen enough to be open to the impossible.", "It\u2019s especially good to see Ms. Anderson, such a beacon of intensity in \u201cThe Fall,\u201d get to flex her dry humor again. When she pulls an obscure fact out of thin air, as Scully is wont to do, she shrugs it off in a way that both acknowledges how much time has passed and tells us the important things haven\u2019t changed. \u201cI\u2019m old school, Mulder,\u201d she says. \u201cPre-Google.\u201d", "HaleIt all comes back to Mulder and Scully, which is to say Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson. It\u2019s the main reason the mostly Mulder-less final seasons were so flavorless, even though the writing was often at the same level.", "Many shows have tried to follow the \u201cX-Files\u201d template to one degree or another, but they\u2019re always missing that Mulder-Scully umami. \u201cFringe\u201d tried to reconstitute it with Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson as an F.B.I. agent and a skeptical civilian. \u201cSupernatural\u201d cut women out of the equation and made the show\u2019s demon hunters two brothers whose devotion was to each other.", "Chris Carter was reviving a television tradition of science-fiction-inflected horror (or horror-inflected science fiction) that ran from \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d to \u201cNight Gallery\u201d to \u201cKolchak: The Night Stalker,\u201d but his and his writers\u2019 great contribution was the addition of flirtatiousness and genuine adult emotion to the mix. The legacy of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d may be that it made TV hospitable again to a range of genre shows after the sitcom domination of the 1980s, helping pave the way for future fantasists like J. J. Abrams and Joss Whedon.

He was one of a handful of developers around the world dedicated to maintaining the basic software that governs both the creation of new Bitcoins and the network on which the financial transactions take place.", "But a nasty fight has torn apart the small brotherhood of Bitcoin developers and raised questions about the survival of the virtual currency. Mr. Hearn, until recently one of the most prominent leaders of the Bitcoin project, became so disillusioned that in December he sold the few hundred Bitcoins he had left and quietly took a job at a new start-up.", "The impassioned blog post he was working on last week was an announcement that he was leaving Bitcoin behind entirely: \u201cBitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners.\u201d", "The dispute \u2014 which grew out of a question about the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle \u2014 may sound like something of interest only to the most die-hard techies. But it has exposed fundamental differences about the basic aims of the Bitcoin project, and how online communities should be governed. The two camps have broadly painted each other as, on one side, populists who are focused on expanding Bitcoin\u2019s commercial potential and, on the other side, elitists who are more concerned with protecting its status as a radical challenger to existing currencies.", "The divide has led over the last six months to death threats against Bitcoin developers and hacking attacks that have taken down Internet providers. The sense of betrayal is strong on both sides. One of Mr. Hearn\u2019s primary antagonists, a bearded California-based programmer named Gregory Maxwell, also appears to have pulled back from his work on Bitcoin after receiving anonymous death threats.", "These internal struggles have surfaced at the same time that the Bitcoin technology is gaining credibility on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Throughout the various controversies that have plagued the virtual currency \u2014 including many instances of theft and fraud \u2014 the basic software has continued working as expected. That consistency has pushed the value of all outstanding Bitcoins above $6 billion and led many venture capitalists to imagine the technology as the future of finance, a cheaper and faster way to carry out financial transactions of all sorts.", "Part of the basic appeal of Bitcoin has been its promise to provide a more reliable and trustworthy alternative to existing currencies and financial networks. Unlike the Federal Reserve and Wall Street, institutions that are managed by humans, Bitcoin was supposed to rest on the infallible logic of math and computer code. In this system, programmers like Mr. Hearn, who often volunteered their expertise and effort, were viewed as neutral technicians.", "The current dispute, though, is a reminder that the Bitcoin software \u2014 like all computer code \u2014 is an evolving product of the human mind, and its deployment is vulnerable to human frailties and divergent ideals.", "There may yet be a middle ground on the question that began the fight, but for the moment the sides are deadlocked, and that has left the Bitcoin software \u2014 and the virtual currency itself \u2014 in a state of limbo. Mr. Hearn is convinced that the stalemate will soon make it hard to complete even simple transactions and will eventually drive away users and lead to a price collapse. Mr. Hearn\u2019s concerns about this impasse have been echoed, often in less strident tones, by a growing number of other developers, as well as by start-ups that buy, sell and hold Bitcoins.", "Gavin Andresen, a close collaborator of Mr. Hearn\u2019s and one of the longest-standing contributors to the Bitcoin software, said the dispute was likely to cause disruptions in the short term, but he disagrees with the notion that it will damage Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects. Other Bitcoin leaders have expressed a similar sentiment, and investors have been inclined to believe them: The price of a Bitcoin has actually risen in recent months, to about $430 this week.", "Some of Mr. Hearn\u2019s allies in the battle are hoping the deadlock can be broken if the largest Bitcoin companies get behind something like Bitcoin Classic, a new version of the basic Bitcoin software that was announced this week, and that aims to expand the network\u2019s capacity while also introducing new standards of governance.", "But Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place.", "\u201cIt never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,\u201d Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s really shaken my faith in humanity.\u201d", "Mr. Hearn, 31, grew up in Manchester, England, where he played music and went rock climbing in his free time. He was one of the first serious programmers to take an interest in Bitcoin, back in April 2009, just a few months after its mysterious founder, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, let it loose in the world.", "At the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he\u2019d had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known.", "\u201cSo many questions,\u201d Mr. Hearn wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s rare that I encounter truly revolutionary ideas.\u201d", "Like many of the programmers who took an early interest, Mr. Hearn admired the rule-bound nature of the system. Only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. And the distribution of new Bitcoins was clearly laid out, relying on mathematical algorithms that left no room for human meddling.", "Satoshi had written the software containing these rules, but after it was released, anyone could see the code and make changes. The people downloading this open-source software essentially voted on which changes to accept based on which version of the software they chose to use. If Satoshi proposed changes that they didn\u2019t like, they didn\u2019t have to download and run it, and anyone could offer an alternative. Bitcoin, like many other open-source projects, was a sort of leaderless democracy \u2014 a new way of governing human behavior online. One computer, one vote, with anyone able to propose new laws.", "It took a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but by late 2010, when Mr. Hearn started contributing to the code, the currency had begun developing a passionate following. The apparently leaderless structure and seamless functioning of the software won Bitcoin renown among libertarians and anarchists, and soon enough, among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, drawn to the transparent, mathematical foundations of the project.", "Mr. Hearn joined a small but growing group of volunteers who worked on the basic Bitcoin software from various corners of the globe \u2014 the most committed of whom became known as the core developers. They met in person only a handful of times, but they would chat constantly online and send emails discussing potential changes. The leader of this effort, after Satoshi bowed out in 2011 (without ever revealing a real identity), was Mr. Andresen, a genial father of two from central Massachusetts who kept everyone on the same page.", "Mr. Hearn was always a bit different from the rest of the core developers. Whereas most of them were classic techies, with patchy facial hair and ill-fitting clothes, the clean-cut Mr. Hearn had a taste for fashionable jeans and skateboard shoes \u2014 as well as an easy sociability. Within Google, Mr. Hearn became an informal spokesman for Bitcoin, answering queries from the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and leading an in-house email list discussion group that had attracted 400 employees by the time Mr. Hearn left.", "Mr. Hearn was also, along with Mr. Andresen, of a practical mind-set, most interested in improving the basic experience of holding and using Bitcoins. He was not given to making the big pronouncements common to the more ideological members of the community, about the currency displacing the dollar or euro. He was more focused on the immediate challenges that could trip it up.", "When tension cropped up among the developers, Mr. Andresen kept the peace by brokering compromises.", "The bonhomie began to fall apart last year because of what appeared to be a positive development: the continuing growth in the number of Bitcoin users and transactions.", "The problem was that, early on, Satoshi established a limit on the number of transactions that could be processed by the network every 10 minutes. The cap was meant to ensure that the computers supporting the network, and processing the transactions, would not be overwhelmed by an enormous quantity of data. But Satoshi had suggested that the limit should be temporary, and as the number of transactions coursing through the network inched closer to the cap, delays started to occur and transactions were not going through.", "When Mr. Hearn began pushing for changes to the core Bitcoin software to allow for larger blocks of transaction data, he faced immediate resistance. Gregory Maxwell, a largely self-taught programmer who had worked on Wikipedia and the Mozilla web browser, both open-source projects, said that larger blocks of transaction data would be harder for ordinary computers to process. The result, Mr. Maxwell warned, would be to hand control over the network to big companies that could afford powerful computers.", "For Mr. Maxwell, slower transactions seemed to be a secondary issue to protecting Bitcoin from centralized sources of authority.", "\u201cIt\u2019s far from clear to me that the world will get a second shot at this in the next several decades if Bitcoin lapses into the same-old, same-old,\u201d he wrote to other developers.", "Mr. Hearn retorted that the technical issue wasn\u2019t such a big deal; ordinary computers could mostly process the larger blocks of transaction data. More important, he argued, was that Bitcoin needed to succeed first as a cheaper, faster payment network, like PayPal or Visa. If Bitcoin wanted to ever compete with mainstream payment systems, which could process tens of thousands of transactions a second, it would have to do away with Bitcoin\u2019s existing limit of fewer than seven transactions a second.", "The debate was complicated by the financial interests of the people involved. Mr. Maxwell and several of his supporters were then working for a Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream, with $21 million in funding from venture capitalists. Mr. Maxwell\u2019s start-up was trying to make it possible to break off some transactions from the Bitcoin network, making the number of transactions the network could handle less important.", "After leaving Google, Mr. Hearn had begun taking a salary for his Bitcoin work from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent supporters of Bitcoin start-ups in Silicon Valley.", "As the debate grew increasingly fractious, friendships among the core developers fell apart.", "In the past, the leader of the Bitcoin software project, Mr. Andresen (no relation to Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz), would have stepped in to mediate. Mr. Andresen says that as \u201clead maintainer\u201d he always sought consensus, but on the few occasions when there was irresolvable disagreement, he made the final call, acting as a sort of \u201cbenevolent dictator.\u201d But Mr. Andresen stepped back from his day-to-day role in 2014 and gave the job of lead maintainer to another volunteer on the project, Wladimir J. van der Laan, a Dutch programmer, who said he did not intend to follow Mr. Andresen\u2019s lead.", "\u201cI cannot be the decider for network-level issues,\u201d Mr. van der Laan said via email this week. \u201cNo one \u2018owns\u2019 Bitcoin. No one can decide over Bitcoin as if it\u2019s some kind of company.\u201d", "Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen ultimately decided late in the summer that the only way forward was to give the vote to the people actually using the Bitcoin software. They put together their own version of the core software \u2014 largely the same as the current software, but with an allowance for more transactions \u2014 which they called Bitcoin XT. If a clear majority of the system\u2019s users downloaded the software, it would become the new law of the land \u2014 what is known in open-source terminology as a fork.", "Forks are part of the open-source process and had been used to make small, agreed-upon fixes to Bitcoin. But no one had tried the sort of divisive fork that Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen devised, largely because of the risk that it could result in two incompatible Bitcoin networks and create questions about the legitimacy and value of existing Bitcoins.", "\u201cSo this is it. Here we are. The community is divided, and Bitcoin is forking,\u201d Mr. Hearn wrote on Aug. 15, announcing the new software.", "The release of Bitcoin XT was viewed by Mr. van der Laan and Mr. Maxwell as an act of betrayal. Yes, it was democratic, but they said that decisions about the core software should be made by technical experts \u2014 not by populist campaigns.", "In an interview with Vice a few days after the announcement, Mr. Maxwell compared the Bitcoin XT team to a \u201cguy standing on the sidelines with a beer cup hat.\u201d One of Mr. Maxwell\u2019s confidants likened it to an attempted coup. Their supporters blocked Mr. Hearn\u2019s announcement of Bitcoin XT \u2014 and any discussion of it \u2014 from the Bitcoin.org website and several other online forums where Bitcoin members met to discuss the project.", "The fight took on a new dimension when a powerful hacker distributed Bitkiller, malicious software that sought out computers that downloaded the Bitcoin XT software and overwhelmed them with traffic. One Internet provider on Long Island said the Bitkiller attacks brought down service for part of southern Long Island for several hours. The biggest American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, was taken entirely off-line for brief periods after declaring support for XT. Not surprisingly, this scared away many Bitcoin users from downloading the new software or even declaring support for it.", "The hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone \u201cpayed me for killing XT\u201d \u2014 though he declined to say who was responsible.", "In the late fall, Mr. Maxwell and his supporters tried to engineer a compromise. They organized meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong where the leading developers met to discuss alternative ways to scale the Bitcoin system. Mr. Andresen went to the first of these, where Mr. Maxwell\u2019s allies announced their own, more gradual plan for increasing the network\u2019s capacity. But Mr. Andresen and Mr. Hearn both felt that the recommendations didn\u2019t go far enough. Mr. Andresen, who is not normally given to sniping, began to harden his position.", "\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the current developers will get fired, and some other team will replace them because they are not listening to their customers,\u201d he said in an interview last week.", "Mr. Maxwell was equally dismissive of Mr. Hearn\u2019s camp \u2014 saying that they had politicized what should have been a technical decision. Then he suddenly dropped out of the conversation in mid-December. He has not explained his absence, but colleagues say he was tired of the rancor.", "Mr. Andresen said a number of large Bitcoin companies had been asking him to come back in and lead a new version of the Bitcoin software. But if he did return to his old role, he said, he would insist on clear rules about decision-making.", "Mr. Hearn says he thinks that getting the opposing camps together will now be very difficult. He believes that the dangers of the current impasse have not been reflected in the price of Bitcoin because the full debate has been censored in many of the online forums where Bitcoin is discussed.", "Despite the discord, Mr. Hearn has not lost faith in all of the ideas behind Bitcoin. The start-up in New York where he has taken a job, R3, is developing Bitcoin-like networks for banks to enable cheaper and faster ways to trade assets of all sorts. The start-up aims to take advantage of the less-centralized record-keeping methods of Bitcoin, but still allow for someone to be in charge, to handle the software and to manage access to the system.", "This work lacks the purity of Bitcoin, but after months of sleepless nights, fretting about betrayed promises, he said, \u201cI want to be in a professional environment again where people are grounded in some sort of business reality.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/us/politics/how-to-watch-democratic-debate.html": ["We provided real-time analysis of the fourth Democratic debate and live fact checks.", "Democrats are gathering in South Carolina for their fourth presidential debate, and while the previous events had few fireworks, Sunday night\u2019s promises to be a feistier affair.

Those three things came together, and there they were, perfectly poised to grow and take advantage of the change.\u201d", "Mr. Parker notes the Big Five\u2019s power does not necessarily prevent newer tech companies from becoming huge. Uber might upend the transportation industry, Airbnb could rule hospitality and, as I argued last week, Netflix is bent on consuming the entertainment business. But if such new giants do come along, they\u2019re likely to stand alongside today\u2019s Big Five, not replace them.", "Indeed, the Frightful Five are so well protected against start-ups that in most situations, the rise of new companies only solidifies their lead.", "Consider that Netflix hosts its movies on Amazon\u2019s cloud, and Google\u2019s venture capital arm has a huge investment in Uber. Or consider all the in-app payments that Apple and Google get from their app stores, and all the marketing dollars that Google and Facebook reap from start-ups looking to get you to download their stuff.", "This gets to the core of the Frightful Five\u2019s indomitability.

Why do you chat using Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, also owned by Facebook?

Look how Apple\u2019s late-to-market subscription streaming music service managed to attract 10 million subscribers in its first six months of operation, or how Facebook leveraged the popularity of its main app to push users to download its stand-alone Messenger app.", "Then there\u2019s the data buried in the platforms, also a rich source for new business. This can happen directly \u2014 for instance, Google can tap everything it learns about how we use our phones to create an artificial intelligence engine that improves our phones \u2014 and in more circuitous ways. By watching what\u2019s popular in its app store, Apple can get insight into what features to add to the iPhone.", "\u201cIn a way, a lot of the research and development costs are being borne by companies out of their four walls, which allows them to do better product development,\u201d Mr. Parker said.", "This explains why these companies\u2019 visions are so expansive.

Because their platforms \u2014 the users, the data and all the money they generate \u2014 make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.", "Which isn\u2019t to say these companies can\u2019t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they\u2019re all still large companies, but they\u2019re far less influential than they once were.", "And a skeptic might come up with significant threats to the five giants. One possibility might be growing competition from abroad, especially Chinese hardware and software companies that are amassing equally important platforms. Then there\u2019s the threat of regulation or other forms of government intervention. European regulators are already pursuing several of the Frightful Five on antitrust and privacy grounds.", "Even with these difficulties, it\u2019s unclear if the larger dynamic may change much.

Based on their stock prices this month, the giants are among the top 10 most valuable American companies of any kind.

In fact, neighborhoods in and around the Beltway get richer and richer all the time while our manufacturing towns are disappearing. Still Republicans from Reagan to Bush have bowed to shrink the size of government, but it never works.", "Is this Presidency, and presidency, simply too small a David to slay the Goliath of government?", "HUCKABEE: No, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s impossible, but we\u2019re not going to do it by doing the same things we\u2019ve been doing for all these many years.

He still has never found an employment that got anywhere near the job that he had.", "Let me ask you, how many people do you think living around the Beltway know a guy like that? Care about a guy like that? Not many. And, that\u2019s because they\u2019re six of the ten richest counties in America that surround Washington D.C.

That a president could become president who never met people who have to struggle to make a living and put food on the table.", "(APPLAUSE)", "MACCALLUM: Alright, Carly Fiorina, you\u2019ve said that you can get the tax code down to three short simple pages.", "MACCALLUM: But, when lobbyists who have twisted the arms of members of Congress come sit with you in the Oval Office and say, \u201cMadam President, sorry, I cannot be with you on this one,\u201d you may understand what previous presidents have gone through. No?", "FIORINA: You know, we have a professional, political class of both parties. We have been talking about the same issues for election cycle after election cycle. Yeah, government is big and out of control, and the only way to get it under control is to control the money.", "And the only way to control the money is to ask the federal government to budget the way you do, to examine every dollar, to cut any dollar to spend \u2014 to move any dollar.", "The fancy word for that is zero-base budgeting. I call it common sense. That three-page tax code I talk about all the time here in Iowa? It\u2019s been around for 20 years.

If it did not work at H.P., why would it work at the federal government?", "FIORINA: Well, first of all, I haven\u2019t said that. What I have said is that in the process of examining every dollar, cutting any dollar and moving any dollar, we happen to know that in this vast federal bureaucracy we have about 260,000 federal government employees who are going to retire, and we shouldn\u2019t replace them.", "Secondly, at Hewlett Packard, as you know \u2014 the people of Iowa know this \u2014 we went through a tough time. The worst technology recession in 25 years \u2014 a great company called Gateway used to do be right here in Iowa.

So what would you look her in the eye and say?", "SANTORUM: What I would say is that we have to create jobs that give people wages and benefits that can help them provide for themselves and their families. And that\u2019s why I announced from a factory floor in western Pennsylvania, I pledge to make America the number one manufacturing nation, again, in the world. And we can do it.

We have not only this international guerrilla war but also these challenges from these other countries as well.", "But, Martha, I want to say one more thing to you and Bill.

And when I was governor of Virginia, I tried to move more of those resources into the community, which will give us the facilities and the abilities to begin to identify people who actually might be dangerous and who abuse Second Amendment rights.", "But I do believe this is one of the really principle issues in this campaign.

I am a board member of the National Rifle Association.", "GILMORE: The reason I\u2019m a board member is because I believe that individuals in this country can be trusted to exercise their rights under the Second Amendment and under the Bill of Rights.

A tax and spend approach, or shrinking government?", "HUCKABEE: Well, I didn\u2019t have a tax and spend approach. You got to understand where the Club for Growth comes from, a bunch of rich guys sitting around writing checks to go after people they don\u2019t like.

But, if he works 16 hours, he doesn\u2019t get a double paycheck because he\u2019s going to be bumped up into a new tax bracket, and the government will get more of his second shift than he will.

Here are the facts. Planned Parenthood engages in partial birth abortion, in late-term abortion. They alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts. They have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.", "The reality is, most Americans find this practice horrific. Most Americans find horrific that Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on this is it\u2019s not a life until it\u2019s born.

The Selzer poll differs from most other public surveys sponsored by mainstream media organizations in two respects. First, she conducts the poll by calling voters from the state\u2019s voter registration file, a common practice in campaign polling but rare among news media pollsters. She also uses an extremely simple way to determine who is likely to vote.", "Ms. Selzer says she places more stock in the way she screens for likely voters. But how her methods differ highlight some of the biggest debates among campaign pollsters, and offer clues for why some polls are so wrong \u2014 or so right.", "Most polls conducted by mainstream media organizations call random telephone numbers, which yields a sample of American adults \u2014 whether they\u2019re registered to vote or not. Pollsters need to screen out people who say they\u2019re not registered to vote, and they take a caller\u2019s word on that.", "The Selzer poll \u2014 and campaign pollsters \u2014 take a different approach. They call telephone numbers from voter registration files, a data set of all of the registered voters in a state. Many voters provide their telephone numbers on their voter registration forms when they register, but it\u2019s not hard to fill in the missing ones from other sources.", "As we said, Ms. Selzer doesn\u2019t attribute most of her success to the use of the voter file.", "But it is worth mentioning her use of this data because the polls are sharply divided on exactly this matter, especially on the Democratic side. So far this year, Mr. Sanders leads in every poll conducted by random dialing, except those from NBC News/Marist, where Mrs. Clinton holds a narrow lead. Yet Mr. Sanders has never led a survey that used the voter file \u2014 including The Des Moines Register poll tonight, and all those before it.", "Relying on the voter file has risks in the Iowa caucuses because people can register on caucus night. (In 2008, about 4 percent of the Democratic caucus electorate did so).", "But it has potential advantages. The simple step of screening out self-identified unregistered voters can introduce errors and bias, if the people who identify as being registered and with a certain party are unrepresentative. A poll using the voter file is all but assured to include the right proportion of registered partisans and independents, men and women, young and old. It would include the right proportion of people who voted in 2012, past primary voters or whatever other information is on the file \u2014 and there is a considerable amount.", "If a random-digit-dialing poll\u2019s sample of adult men is unusually Democratic, for instance, then the group of Democrats would end up too male \u2014 since the poll will simply filter the electorate to those people who call themselves Democrats. A CNN poll this month showed men as a majority of likely Democrats, which seems unlikely; 57 percent of registered Democrats in Iowa are women, according to data from L2, a nonpartisan voter file vendor.", "To take another example: What if the people who respond to telephone surveys are particularly politically engaged? Might the young voters who respond be more likely to be registered than young people in general \u2014 resulting in a sample of registered voters who are younger than in reality? It\u2019s possible.", "Voters could even misreport whether they\u2019re actually registered to vote.", "Even if a poll perfectly captures the opinion of registered voters, it might still miss the results if it makes an inaccurate forecast about who will vote and who will not.", "Many mainstream media pollsters determine who is likely to vote with a slew of questions, like whether the respondents have voted before, whether they know where their precinct is or whether they\u2019re enthusiastic. Some of these questions are of uncertain value. The Obama campaign pollsters, for instance, criticized the notion that people need to know where their precinct is to be considered likely voters. You can easily search for it on Google at the last minute.", "Most pollsters then narrow the sample in proportion to the expected turnout: If the pollster believes 50 percent of adults will vote, then they might include the 50 percent of voters \u2014 the so-called cutoff \u2014 deemed likeliest to vote based on those questions. Often they choose a slightly higher cutoff than the expected turnout, on the assumption that poll respondents are likelier than nonrespondents to vote \u2014 but exactly how much likelier is somewhat unscientific.", "The Selzer likely-voter screen is different and simple. The poll asks voters one question: whether they will vote. If they say they will \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d vote, they\u2019re a likely voter in the caucus. That\u2019s it. Ms. Selzer makes no assumptions about the size of the electorate.", "The advantage is that Ms. Selzer doesn\u2019t need to make any judgments about turnout, which is notoriously hard to predict \u2014 especially in a caucus. While the range of plausible turnout in a general election is fairly narrow (say 54 percent of adults in 2000 to 62 percent in 2008), it is wide in the Iowa caucuses. In 2008, the Democratic turnout nearly doubled over 2004.", "Even if a pollster does have a pretty decent guess about turnout, the often unacknowledged truth is that cutoffs are often dubiously arbitrary and extremely sensitive. Moving the cutoff by a few percentage points can swing the results by a lot more than you might expect \u2014 enough to flip the results of a survey.", "Worse still, it\u2019s a great opportunity for pollsters to tweak their results to get what they consider to be a more reasonable finding.", "But Ms. Selzer\u2019s question isn\u2019t perfect either. A growing body of evidence shows that self-reported vote intention is not especially accurate. Voters are prone to overestimate their likelihood of voting, and there are even people who say they won\u2019t vote but ultimately do.", "The risks were in sharp relief in a recent Pew Research report on likely voters. Pew found that just 77 percent of the people who said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote in September 2014 actually voted in the midterms, and only 36 percent of those who would \u201cprobably\u201d vote turned out.", "The people who ultimately turned out were also far likelier to be Republicans, who led by three points among the voters who were verified to vote in a postelection analysis. Democrats led by two points among people who said they would definitely vote, according to the Pew data, and four points among those who said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d vote. (It should be noted that Ms. Selzer, in the midterms, used only those who said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d vote).", "This might well be better than the more complex and arbitrary turnout methods built by other media pollsters. But it is not magic or a \u201csecret sauce.\u201d It\u2019s a well-studied, well-known measure. And it\u2019s not perfect.", "Ms. Selzer is sticking with simplicity, however. \u201cOur method has worked so far, so it\u2019s very difficult to convince anyone that we should change our method,\u201d she said. So far, she says, those who say they will vote but don\u2019t and those who say they won\u2019t vote but do cancel each other out.", "Of course, even if Ms. Selzer\u2019s methodology was perfect, there\u2019s no reason to expect her results will be. It\u2019s the nature of the game; even a perfectly conducted poll will occasionally yield imperfect results, and sometimes terrible ones.", "You wouldn\u2019t know it from some of the coverage, but Ms. Selzer has missed before. Her final Iowa poll in 2004 showed John Kerry defeating George W. Bush by three points \u2014 Mr. Bush won by 1. The final poll in the 2012 Republican Iowa caucus gave Mitt Romney a nine-point lead over Rick Santorum \u2014 Mr. Santorum ultimately won. There was even a poll in June 2012 showing Mr. Obama leading Mr. Romney by an implausible 13 points nationwide.", "This year, the causes for concern are as great as ever. Mr. Trump skipped the final debate right in the middle of the survey. Late-breaking advertisements have gone on the air. The sheer number of candidates might bring even more late volatility than usual, since voters supporting less viable candidates might choose to make their vote count.", "\u201cAll I can say is that we\u2019re going to take our best shot and worry \u2014 worry a lot.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/travel/flight-booking-plane-tickets.html": ["Do you know what a Q fare is?

The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don\u2019t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything \u2014 a product, a service, a corporate acquisition \u2014 that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.", "Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google\u2019s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.", "This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.", "So what is going on now? There are countless economic journal articles laying out theories about why corporations have shifted from borrowing to saving. Some of the reasons are prosaic. Just like people, companies might want to have money for emergencies or for lousy economic times, and the past decade has been a period of increasing risk. Also, corporations have become far more focused on something they call \u2018\u2018tax efficiency,\u2019\u2019 which the rest of us call \u2018\u2018tax avoidance\u2019\u2019: For various reasons, holding on to cash and carefully shifting it among subsidiaries, especially foreign ones, is a great tool to shrink your tax bill.", "Another reason to hold on to cash is a byproduct of the increasingly intense competition for talent and acquisitions, especially in technology and pharmaceuticals. When Apple or Google enter negotiations to buy a smaller company, any other firm considering a competing offer may be scared off by their nearly infinite resources. Oddly enough, then, holding on to all that cash might be saving these companies even more money, by allowing them to pay less for the firms they acquire. (Google buys about one company a week, on average; Apple\u2019s acquisitions are more sporadic, but not far behind.)", "But even if you accept all these reasons, we are still left with an enormous puzzle. Companies like Google and GM are holding on to far more cash \u2014 many times more \u2014 than could possibly be explained by emergency funds and tax efficiencies and M.&A. intimidation put together. Lee Pinkowitz, a professor at Georgetown, told me that finance economists agree that there is a puzzle here but break into two distinct camps over the cause. One camp believes that a large cash hoard is a sign of an unhealthy company. Maybe its whole industry is doing so poorly that there is nothing worth investing in; maybe it\u2019s because executives are up to something shady, stockpiling cash as a personal war chest to mask poor decision-making and protect their jobs (cash in the bank, suddenly deployed, can make a firm seem more profitable than it actually is). The other camp doubts that the free market could be allowing executives to hold all that cash if it were purely for their own benefit.", "Along with his colleague Rohan Williamson, Pinkowitz built a valuation model that analyzed how investors react to different levels of cash holding. He ran 50 years of data (originally from 1965 to 2004, but then he kindly updated his findings for me, through 2014) for 12,888 different publicly traded companies. The model shows how investors value a dollar of savings when it\u2019s held by different sorts of companies, divided into 43 industry types.", "His findings show that both theories have some truth to them. For several industries, hoarding cash is clearly correlated with negative results. When publishing and entertainment companies or aircraft manufacturers hold on to extra cash, investors perceive that money to be worth less than it should, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 cents on the dollar (the authors make a specific estimate for each industry but also provide a range to account for error). The defense and coal industries are considerably worse, with a dollar in savings valued negatively. This might suggest protective behavior by chief executives in those industries, because the market is clearly not valuing their decision to save.", "For other industries, though, a dollar of savings is worth a lot more than itself. For pharmaceutical companies, a dollar in savings is worth $1.50. For software firms, it\u2019s even higher: more than $2. This means that investors are behaving as if they trust the executives in these industries, like Larry Page of Alphabet, to be smarter about using that money than the investors themselves could be. And a cursory scan of the industries in this second group \u2014 which also includes automakers, medical-equipment makers and others \u2014 correlates well with the ones hoarding the most cash. Corporations, it seems, may have amassed at least a good chunk of that $1.9 trillion in mysterious savings because the stock market is rewarding them for it.", "Which leaves one last question: Why? The answer, perhaps, is that both the executives and the investors in these industries believe that something big is coming, but \u2014 this is crucial \u2014 they\u2019re not sure what it will be. Through the 20th century, as we shifted from a horse-and-sun-powered agrarian economy to an electricity-and-motor-powered industrial economy to a silicon-based information economy, it was clear that every company had to invest in the new thing that was coming. These were big, expensive investments in buildings and machinery and computer technology. Today, though, value is created far more through new ideas and new ways of interaction. Ideas appear and spread much more quickly, and their worth is much harder to estimate. (Indeed, the impossibility of valuing the Internet is essentially what created the 2000 stock bubble.)", "Surely the most important economic question of our time is a fairly simple one: Are the good times over? Will wages continue to fall for many, while rising high for a few? In the cash conundrum, we might find a modest reason for optimism. If corporate leaders and their investors truly believed that the future were bleak, that innovation and economic growth were irreparably slowing, there would be little reason to hold on to all that cash. Their hoarding of it hints that they think the next transformative innovation could be just around the corner. If in fact they do \u2014 and if they\u2019re right \u2014 it\u2019s good news for all of us."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/world/asia/boys-response-to-blasphemy-charge-unnerves-many-in-pakistan.html": ["LAHORE, Pakistan \u2014 Late one night, the imam Shabir Ahmad looked up from prayers at his mosque to see a 15-year-old boy approaching with a plate in his outstretched left hand.

We haven\u2019t hit any kind of ceiling yet on performance,\u201d he said.", "The Alphabet approach relies on the newest so-called deep learning approach combined with a more traditional type of algorithm known as a Monte Carlo, which is designed to exhaustively explore large numbers of possible combinations of moves.

At the same time, Facebook issued blog posts from Yann LeCun, one of its artificial intelligence researchers, and one from the company\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.", "The statement by Mr. Zuckerberg resulted in a swift response from one Facebook user that may express a deeper human concern than the narrow results of the research: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave that ancient game alone and let it be without any artificial players? Do we really need an A.I. in everything?\u201d wrote Konstantinos Karakasidis.", "Those concerns are not likely to be heeded. In a blog post Wednesday morning, Alphabet stated that, in an effort to reprise the winning IBM Deep Blue chess playing program that defeated the chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996, Alphabet will match its AlphaGo program against Lee Sedol, the current Go champion, for a five-game match in March.", "There will be a $1 million prize for the winner, and Mr. Hassabis said that Alphabet would donate the prize to charity if AlphaGo won. The match will be streamed live on YouTube.", "Mr. Hassabis, who is a skilled chess player and has been a professional gamer as well, said that Go was a beautiful game, but that \u201cbuilding an A.I. is also a human endeavor and a kind of ingenious one, too.

By breaking Google into Alphabet, Mr. Page is hoping to make it a more welcoming home for employees to build new businesses, as well as for potential acquisition targets.", "It will also rid his office of the kind of dull-but-necessary annoyances of running a major corporation.

Technology companies like Yelp have accused the company of acting like a brutal monopolist that is using the dominance of its search engine to steer consumers toward Google services, even if that means giving the customers inferior information.", "Financially speaking, Mr. Page is leaving his chief executive job at Google at a time when things could not be better.

Let\u2019s have a great debate.", "We\u2019ll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.", "CLINTON: Well, good evening. And I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and the people of Charleston for hosting us here on the eve of Martin Luther King Day tomorrow.", "You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King. I was a teenager. And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service. I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.", "And that is our fight still. We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind. We have to keep our communities and our country safe. We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.", "I understand that this is the hardest job in the world. I\u2019m prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: Thank you. Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.", "SANDERS: Thank you. As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it\u2019s important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country. As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that\u2019s rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.SANDERS: And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.", "This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.", "HOLT: Senator, thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And Governor O\u2019Malley, your opening statement, sir.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. My name is Martin O\u2019Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech.", "And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.", "You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King\u2019s teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.", "Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Our country\u2019s doing better, we\u2019re creating jobs again.", "But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we\u2019ve heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.", "We need new leadership. We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. I need your help, I ask for your vote, and I look forward to moving our country forward once again.", "Thank you.", "HOLT: All right. And Governor, thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: All right, to our first question, now. The first question, I\u2019ll be addressing to all of the candidates.", "President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform. Voters want to know how you would define your presidency? How would you think big? So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be \u2014 fill in the blank.", "Senator Sanders.", "SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s what our campaign is about. It is thinking big. It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.", "So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.", "CLINTON: I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women\u2019s work.", "I would also...", "(APPLAUSE)", "I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn\u2019t take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.", "And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together. We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness. There\u2019s a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, same question.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you. First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down. Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.", "Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change. And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: Thank you. You\u2019ve all...", "O\u2019MALLEY: Finally \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, that was second, Lester.O\u2019MALLEY: And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America\u2019s cities. We have not had a new agenda for America\u2019s cities since Jimmy Carter. We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.", "HOLT: All right governor thank you.", "We\u2019ve all laid out large visions and we\u2019re going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening. The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race. Let\u2019s start with one of them, the issue of guns.", "Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, \u201ca pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby.\u201d Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?", "SANDERS: Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.", "I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns. And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable. I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant (ph).", "We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people. This should not be a political issue. What we should be doing is working together.", "And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...", "HOLT: Senator, but you didn\u2019t answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers. So can you...", "SANDERS: What I have said, is that gun manufacturer\u2019s liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we\u2019ve prohibited ammunition that would\u2019ve killed cops who had protection on. We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation. And what we also said, \u201cis a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.\u201d", "So what I said is, \u201c I would re-look at it.\u201d We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.", "HOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.", "CLINTON: Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders\u2019 own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole. He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, \u201cwas the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. \u201c", "He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks. He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives. Let\u2019s not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country. That\u2019s 33,000 people a year.", "One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered. Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation. There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.", "HOLT: All right, Governor O\u2019Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns. This conversation might be worrying many of them. They may be hearing, \u201cyou want to take my guns. What would you say to them?", "O\u2019MALLEY: This is what I would say Lester, look see, I\u2019ve listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them. They\u2019ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.O\u2019MALLEY: I\u2019m the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation. This is very personal to me being from Baltimore. I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns\u2019 Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy\u2019s head was pierced with a bullet. And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.", "And, I remember visiting him, it did not kill him. I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital. In his diapers (ph) with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.", "So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together. We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation. It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what? We did not interrupt a single person\u2019s hunting season.", "I\u2019ve never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer. And, so...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... we\u2019re able to actually do these things.", "HOLT: Alright, Governor, thank you.", "Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year. Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings. We won\u2019t forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.", "We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?", "CLINTON: Well, sadly it\u2019s reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers. Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.", "And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.", "One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison. That\u2019s the statistic. I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...", "(APPLAUSE)", "...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.", "So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.", "HOLT: You time is up.", "Senator Sanders, my next question is...", "SANDERS: ...Well, I \u2014 look...", "HOLT: ... It\u2019s actually \u2014 actually my next question is to you...", "SANDERS: ... Let me respond to what the secretary said. We have a criminal justice system which is broken. Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China? Disproportionately African American, and Latino. Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed? Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO\u2019s of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: Senator Sanders...", "SANDERS: ... We need to take a very hard look at our...", "HOLT: Senator. Senator Sanders...", "SANDERS: ... criminal justice system, investing in jobs, and education not in jails and incarceration .", "HOLT: ... Just over a week ago the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed Secretary Clinton, not you. He said that choosing her over you was not a hard decision. In fact, our polling shows she\u2019s beating you more than two to one among minority voters. How can you be the nominee if you don\u2019t have that support?", "SANDERS: Well, let me talk about polling.", "(LAUGHTER) SANDERS: As Secretary Clinton well knows, when this campaign began she was 50 points ahead of me. We were all of three percentage points. Guess what?", "In Iowa, New Hampshire, the race is very, very close. Maybe we\u2019re ahead New Hampshire.", "(CHEERING)", "SANDERS: In terms of polling, guess what? We are running ahead of Secretary Clinton. In terms of taking on my taking on my good friend, Donald Trump, beating him by 19 points in New Hampshire, 13 points in the last national poll that we saw.", "To answer your question. When the African American community becomes familiar with my Congressional record and with our agenda, and with our views on the economy, and criminal justice \u2014 just as the general population has become more supportive, so will the African American community, so will the Latino community. We have the momentum, we\u2019re on a path to a victory.", "(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)", "O\u2019MALLEY: Lester, I (inaudible)", "HOLT: Governor, I\u2019m going to come to you in a second.", "Google searches for the words, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d surpassed, \u201ccivil rights movement\u201d. And, here in South Carolina, \u201cblack lives matter\u201d was the number one trending political issue.HOLT: Governor O\u2019Malley, you\u2019ve campaigned on your record as governor of Maryland, and before that, the mayor of Baltimore. Last year, of course, Baltimore was rocked by violent unrest in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray.", "And right from the start of your campaign, you\u2019ve been dogged by those who blame your tough-on-crime, so-called zero tolerance policies as mayor for contributing to that unrest. What responsibility do you bear?", "O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, let\u2019s talk about this. When I ran for mayor in 1999, Lester, it was not because our city was doing well. It was because we were burying over 300 young, poor black men every single year.", "And that\u2019s why I ran, because, yes, black lives matter. And we did a number of things. We weren\u2019t able to make our city immune from setbacks as the Freddie Gray unrest and tragic death showed.", "But we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations. The truth of the matter is, we created a civilian review board. And many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that I\u2019ve put forward.", "We created a civilian review board, gave them their own detectives. We required the reporting of discourtesy, use of excessive force, lethal force. I repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state.", "I drove our incarceration rate down to 20-year lows, and drove violent crime down to 30-year lows, and became the first governor south of the Mason-Dixon line to repeal the death penalty.", "I feel a responsibility every day to find things that work...", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: All right. Let\u2019s talk...", "O\u2019MALLEY: ... and to do more of them to reform our criminal justice system.", "HOLT: Let\u2019s talk more about policing and the criminal justice system. Senator Sanders, a few times tonight we\u2019re going to hear from some of the most prominent voices on YouTube, starting with Franchesca Ramsey, who tackles racial stereotypes through her videos. Let\u2019s watch.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "FRANCHESCA RAMSEY: Hey, I\u2019m Franchesca Ramsey. I believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their own communities.", "For example, last month, the officers involved in the case of 12- year-old Tamir Rice weren\u2019t indicted. How would your presidency ensure that incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "HOLT: Senator Sanders.", "SANDERS: I apologize for not hearing all of that question.", "HOLT: Would you like me to read it back to you?", "SANDERS: Yes.", "HOLT: Prosecutors \u2014 \u201cI believe there\u2019s a huge conflict of interest when local prosecutors investigate cases of police violence within their communities. Most recently, we saw this with a non- indictment of the officers involved in the case of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. How would you presidency ensure incidents of police violence are investigated and prosecuted fairly?\u201d", "SANDERS: Absolutely. This is a responsibility for the U.S. Justice Department to get involved. Whenever anybody in this country is killed while in police custody, it should automatically trigger a U.S. attorney general\u2019s investigation.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Second of all, and I speak as a mayor who worked very closely and well with police officers, the vast majority of whom are honest, hard- working people trying to do a difficult job, but let us be clear.", "If a police officer breaks the law, like any public official, that officer must be held accountable.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And thirdly, we have got to de-militarize our police departments so they don\u2019t look like occupying armies. We\u2019ve got to move toward community policing.", "And fourthly, we have got to make our police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: Secretary Clinton, this question is for you. Tonight parts of America are in the grip of a deadly heroin epidemic, spanning race and class, hitting small towns and cities alike. It has become a major issue in this race.", "In a lot of places where you\u2019ve been campaigning, despite an estimated trillion dollars spent, many say the war on drugs has failed. So what would you do?", "CLINTON: Well, Lester, you\u2019re right. Everywhere I go to campaign, I\u2019m meeting families who are affected by the drug problem that mostly is opioids and heroin now, and lives are being lost and children are being orphaned. And I\u2019ve met a lot of grandparents who are now taking care of grandchildren.", "So I have tried to come out with a comprehensive approach that, number one, does tell the states that we will work with you from the federal government putting more money, about a billion dollars a year, to help states have a different approach to dealing with this epidemic.", "The policing needs to change. Police officers must be equipped with the antidote to a heroin overdose or an opioid overdose, known as Narcan. They should be able to administer it. So should firefighters and others.", "We have to move away from treating the use of drugs as a crime and instead, move it to where it belongs, as a health issue. And we need to divert more people from the criminal justice system into drug courts, into treatment, and recovery.", "HOLT: And that\u2019s time. CLINTON: So this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now...", "HOLT: Senator...", "CLINTON: ... a growing epidemic.", "HOLT: Senator Sanders, would you like to respond?", "SANDERS: Sure. I agree...", "(APPLAUSE)", "I agree with everything the Secretary said, but let me just add this, there is a responsibility on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and the drug companies who are producing all of these drugs and not looking at the consequence of it.", "And second of all, when we talk about addiction being a disease, the Secretary is right, what that means is we need a revolution in this country in terms of mental health treatment. People should be able to get the treatment that they need when they need it, not two months from now, which is why I believe in universal...", "HOLT: That\u2019s...", "SANDERS: ... healthcare with mental health...", "HOLT: ... time.", "SANDERS: ... a part of that.", "HOLT: We\u2019re going to get into all that coming up.", "O\u2019MALLEY (?): Lester, just ten seconds.", "HOLT: But we\u2019re going to take a break and we need to take a break...", "O\u2019MALLEY (?): Just 10 seconds. All of the things...", "HOLT: ... and when we come back, the anger brewing in America.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "HOLT: Welcome back to Charleston. Let\u2019s turn to another area where there has been fierce disagreement \u2014 that would be health care.", "Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton, you both mentioned it in your 100-day priorities.", "Let\u2019s turn to my colleague, Andrea Mitchell now to lead that questioning.", "MITCHELL: Thank you, Lester.", "Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders favors what he calls \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Now, you said that what he is proposing would tear up Obamacare and replace it.", "Secretary Clinton, is it fair to say to say that Bernie Sanders wants to kill Obamacare?", "CLINTON: Well, Andrea, I am absolutely committed to universal health care. I have worked on this for a long time, people may remember that I took on the health insurance industry back in the \u201990s, and I didn\u2019t quit until we got the children\u2019s health insurance program that ensures eight million kids.", "And I certainly respect Senator Sanders\u2019 intentions, but when you\u2019re talking about health care, the details really matter. And therefore, we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people\u2019s health care?", "He didn\u2019t like that, his campaign didn\u2019t like it either. And tonight, he\u2019s come out with a new health care plan. And again, we need to get into the details. But here\u2019s what I believe, the Democratic Party and the United States worked since Harry Truman to get the Affordable Care Act passed.", "We finally have a path to universal health care. We have accomplished so much already. I do not to want see the Republicans repeal it, and I don\u2019t to want see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.", "(APPLAUSE)", "SANDERS: OK.", "MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?", "SANDERS: Secretary \u2014 Secretary Clinton didn\u2019t answer your question.", "(LAUGHTER)", "Because what her campaign was saying \u2014 Bernie Sanders, who has fought for universal health care for my entire life, he wants to end Medicare, end Medicaid, end the children\u2019s health insurance program. That is nonsense.", "What a Medicare-for-all program does is finally provide in this country health care for every man, woman and child as a right. Now, the truth is, that Frank Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, do you know what they believed in? They believed that health care should be available to all of our people.", "I\u2019m on the committee that wrote the Affordable Care Act. I made the Affordable Care Act along with Jim Clyburn a better piece of legislation. I voted for it, but right now, what we have to deal with is the fact that 29 million people still have no health insurance. We are paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, getting ripped off.", "And here\u2019s the important point, we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country. My proposal, provide health care to all people, get private insurance out of health insurance, lower the cost of health care for middle class families by 5,000 bucks.", "That\u2019s the vision we need to take.", "(APPLAUSE)", "CLINTON: But \u2014 Senator Sanders, if I can...", "(APPLAUSE)", "CLINTON: You know, I have to say I\u2019m not sure whether we\u2019re talking about the plan you just introduced tonight, or we\u2019re talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress. But the fact is, we have the Affordable Care Act. That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance. We have seen the end of pre-existing conditions keeping people from getting insurance.", "(APPLAUSE)", "We have seen women no longer paying more for our insurance than men. And we have seen young people, up to the age of 26, being able to stay on their parent\u2019s policy.", "SANDERS: But \u2014 what if we have...", "CLINTON: Now, there are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction.", "SANDERS: It is \u2014 it is absolutely inaccurate.", "O\u2019MALLEY: I have to talk about something that\u2019s actually working in our state.", "MITCHELL: Governor \u2014 Governor Sanders...", "SANDERS: No one is tearing this up, we\u2019re going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge copayments and deductibles.", "Tell me why we are spending almost three times more than the British, who guarantee health care to all of their people? Fifty percent more than the French, more than the Canadians. The vision from FDR and Harry Truman was health care for all people as a right in a cost-effective way.", "We\u2019re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it. But we are going to move on top of that to a Medicaid-for- all system.O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea.", "(CROSSTALK)", "(APPLAUSE)", "O\u2019MALLEY: Instead of \u2014 Andrea, I think, instead of attacking one another on health care, we should be talking about the things that are actually working.", "In our state, we have moved to an all-payer system. With the Affordable Care Act, we now have moved all of our acute care hospitals, that driver of cost at the center, away from fee-for- service.", "And actually to pay, we pay them based on how well they keep patients out of the hospital. How well they keep their patients. That\u2019s the future. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act, do the things that work, and reduce costs and increase access.", "(CROSSTALK)", "CLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what we are able to do based on the foundation of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 what Governor O\u2019Malley just said is one of the models that we will be looking at to make sure we do get costs down, we do limit a lot of the unnecessary costs that we still have in the system.", "But, with all due respect, to start over again with a whole new debate is something that I think would set us back. The Republicans just voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness, President Obama vetoed it and saved Obamacare for the American people.", "(APPLAUSE)", "MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, let me ask you this, though...", "SANDERS: Yeah.", "MITCHELL: ... you\u2019ve talked about Medicare for all...", "SANDERS: Yes.", "MITCHELL: .. and tonight you\u2019ve released a very detailed plan, just two... SANDERS: Not all that detailed.", "MITCHELL: ... well, two hours before the debate, you did.", "SANDERS: Well.", "MITCHELL: But let me ask you about Vermont. Because in Vermont \u2014 you tried in the state of Vermont, and Vermont walked away from this kind of idea, of \u2014 of Medicare for all, single-payer, because they concluded it would require major tax increases...", "SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 you might want to ask...", "MITCHELL: ... and by some estimates, it would double the budget. If you couldn\u2019t sell it in Vermont, Senator...", "SANDERS: Andrea, let me just say this.", "MITCHELL: ... how can you sell it to the country?", "SANDERS: Let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of Vermont why he could not do it. I\u2019m not the governor. I\u2019m the senator from the state of Vermont.", "(LAUGHTER)", "But second of all \u2014 second of all...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... here is what the real point is, in terms of all of the issues you\u2019ve raised \u2014 the good questions you\u2019ve raised. You know what it all comes down to?", "Do you know why we can\u2019t do what every other country \u2014 major country on Earth is doing? It\u2019s because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt, we have super PACs, we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying, and the private insurance companies as well.", "What this is really about is not the rational way to go forward \u2014 it\u2019s Medicare for all \u2014 it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money, and the pharmaceutical industry. That\u2019s what this debate should be about.", "(APPLAUSE)", "CLINTON: Well, as someone who \u2014 as someone who has a little bit of experience standing up to the health insurance industry, that spent, you know...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... many, many millions of dollars attacking me, and probably will so again, because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act, I think it\u2019s important to point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today.", "I know how much money influences the political decision-making. That\u2019s why I\u2019m for huge campaign finance reform. However, we started a system that had private health insurance.", "And even during the Affordable Care Act debate, there was an opportunity to vote for what was called the public option. In other words, people could buy in to Medicare, and even when the Democrats were in charge of the Congress, we couldn\u2019t get the votes for that.", "So, what I\u2019m saying is really simple. This has been the fight of the Democratic Party for decades. We have the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s make it work.", "Let\u2019s take the models that states are doing. We now have driven costs down to the lowest they\u2019ve been in 50 years. Now we\u2019ve got to get individual costs down.

We\u2019re gonna take a turn now.", "Secretary Clinton, in his final State of the Union address, President Obama said his biggest regret was his inability to bring the country together. If President Obama couldn\u2019t do it, how will you?", "O\u2019MALLEY: Great question.", "CLINTON: Well, I think it\u2019s an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here\u2019s what I would say. I will go anywhere, to meet with anyone, at any time to find common ground.", "That\u2019s what I did as a first lady, when I worked with both Democrats and Republicans to get the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, when I worked with Tom DeLay, one of the most partisan of Republicans, to reform the adoption and foster care system.", "What I did, working in the Senate, where I crossed the aisle often, working even with the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, to get Tricare for national guardsmen and women.", "And it\u2019s what I did as Secretary of State, on numerous occasions, and most particularly, rounding up two-thirds votes in order to pass a treaty that lowered the nuclear weapons in both Russia and the United States. CLINTON: So I know it\u2019s hard, but I also know you\u2019ve got to work at it every single day. I look out here, I see a lot of my friends from the Congress. And I know that they work at it every single day.", "Because maybe you can\u2019t only find a little sliver of common ground to cooperate with somebody from the other party, but who knows.

In all do respect, you\u2019re missing the main point. And the main point in the Congress, it\u2019s not the Republicans and Democrats hate each other.", "That\u2019s a mythology from the media. The real issue is that Congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the American people want them to do.", "(APPLAUSE)", "SANDERS: The real issue is that in area after area, raising the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. The American people want it. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, creating 13 million jobs, the American people want it. The pay equity for women, the American people want it. Demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. The American people want it.", "HOLT: That\u2019s time.

This is the biggest challenge we face as a people.", "All my life, I brought people together over deep divides and very old wounds, and that\u2019s what we need now in a new leader.

Look, this election is mostly about the future and therefore it is of greatest urgency for young people.", "I\u2019ve laid out my ideas about what we can do to make college affordable; how we can help people pay off their student debts and save thousands of dollars, how we can create more good jobs because a lot of the young people that I talk with are pretty disappointed the economic prospects they feel their facing.

Let\u2019s turn now to the economy.", "Senator Sanders, you released a tough new ad last week in which without mentioning Secretary Clinton by name, you talk about two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. \u201cOne says it\u2019s OK to take millions from big banks and tell them what to do. My plan, break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes and make them pay their fair share.\u201d", "What do you see as the difference between what you would do about the banks and what Secretary Clinton would do?", "SANDERS: Well, the first difference is I don\u2019t take money from big banks. I don\u2019t get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. What I would do...", "(APPLAUSE)", "What I would do is understand that when you have three out of the four largest banks today, bigger than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have the six largest financial institutions having assets of 60 percent of the GDP of America, it is very clear to me what you have to do.", "You\u2019ve got to bring back the 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation and you\u2019ve got to break up these huge financial institutions. They have too much economic power and they have too much financial power over our entire economy. If Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, the old Republican trust buster, what he would say is these guys are too powerful. Break them up. I believe that\u2019s what the American people to want see. That\u2019s my view.", "HOLT: Secretary Clinton, help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you here.", "CLINTON: Well, there\u2019s no daylight on the basic premise that there should be no bank too big to fail and no individual too powerful to jail. We agree on that. But where we disagree is the comments that Senator Sanders has made that don\u2019t just affect me, I can take that, but he\u2019s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing. He even, in 2011, publicly sought someone to run in a primary against President Obama. Now, I personally believe that President Obama\u2019s work to push through the Dodd-Frank...", "(LAUGHTER)", "The Dodd-Frank bill and then to sign it was one of the most important regulatory schemes we\u2019ve had since the 1930s.

First of all...", "HOLT: Senator Sanders, your response.", "SANDERS: Set the record right. In 2006 when I ran for the Senate, Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me, 2008, I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012, I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected. He and I are friends. We\u2019ve worked together on many issues. We have some differences of opinion.", "But here is the issue, Secretary touched on it, can you really reform Wall Street when they are spending millions and millions of dollars on campaign contributions and when they are providing speaker fees to individuals? So it\u2019s easy to say, well, I\u2019m going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.

I have put forward a plan that was heralded as very comprehensive and realistic.", "Look, if a bank robber robs a bank and all you do is slap him on the wrist, he\u2019s just going to keep robbing banks again. The same thing is true with people in suits.", "Secretary Clinton, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but for you to say there\u2019s no daylight on this between the three of us is also not true. I support reinstituting a modern version of Glass- Steagall that would include going after the shadow banks, requiring capital requirements that would force them to no longer put us on the hook for these sorts of things.", "In prior debates I\u2019ve heard you even bring up \u2014 I mean, now you bring up President Obama here in South Carolina in defense of the fact of your cozy relationship with Wall Street.", "In an earlier debate, I heard you bring up even the 9/11 victims to defend it. The truth of the matter is, Secretary Clinton, you do not go as far as reining in Wall Street as I would.", "And the fact of the matter is, the people of America deserve to have a president that\u2019s on their side, protecting the main street economy from excesses on Wall Street. And we\u2019re just as vulnerable today.", "HOLT: Secretary Clinton, 30-second response.", "(APPLAUSE)", "CLINTON: Yes, well, first of all \u2014 first of all, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, others have all endorsed my plan. Secondly, we have Dodd-Frank. It gives us the authority already to break up big banks that pose...", "O\u2019MALLEY: And we have never used it.", "CLINTON: That pose a risk to the financial sector. I want to go further and add to that.", "And, you know, Governor, you have raised money on Wall Street. You raised a lot of money on Wall Street when you were the head of the Democratic Governor\u2019s Association...", "O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but I haven\u2019t gotten a penny this year...

They\u2019re not giving me \u2014 zero.", "CLINTON: Yes, well, the point is that if we\u2019re going to be serious about this and not just try to score political points, we should know what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank, and what\u2019s in Dodd-Frank already gives the president the authority...", "(CROSSTALK)", "CLINTON: ... with his regulators to make those decisions.", "SANDERS: Let me give you an example of how corrupt \u2014 how corrupt this system is. Goldman Sachs recently fined $5 billion. Goldman Sachs has given this country two secretaries of treasury, one on the Republicans, one under Democrats.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Say it.", "SANDERS: The leader of Goldman Sachs is a billionaire who comes to Congress and tells us we should cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.", "Secretary Clinton \u2014 and you\u2019re not the only one, so I don\u2019t mean to just point the finger at you, you\u2019ve received over $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year.", "I find it very strange that a major financial institution that pays $5 billion in fines for breaking the law, not one of their executives is prosecuted, while kids who smoke marijuana get a jail sentence.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: That\u2019s time.", "Andrea.", "CLINTON: Well, the last point on this is, Senator Sanders, you\u2019re the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000, to take the cops off the street, to use Governor O\u2019Malley\u2019s phrase, to make the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main cause of the collapse in \u201908.", "So there\u2019s plenty...", "SANDERS: If you want to...CLINTON: There\u2019s plenty of problems that we all have to face together.", "And the final thing I would say, we\u2019re at least having a vigorous debate about reining in Wall Street...", "HOLT: ... Senator...", "CLINTON: ... The Republicans want to give them more power, and repeal Dodd-Frank. That\u2019s what we need to stop...", "(APPLAUSE)", "SANDERS: Anyone who wants to check my record in taking on Wall Street, in fighting against the deregulation of Wall Street when Wall Street put billions of dollars in lobbying, in campaign contributions to get the government off their backs.

You want free education for everyone, you want the Federal Minimum Wage raised to $15 an hour. You want to expand Social Security...", "SANDERS: ... Yeah...", "MITCHELL: ... benefits. You\u2019ve been specific about what you want, but let\u2019s talk about how to pay for all this. You now said that you would raise taxes today, two hours or so ago, you said you would raise taxes to pay for your health care plan. You haven\u2019t been specific about how to pay for the other things...", "SANDERS: ... That\u2019s true.", "MITCHELL: ... Will you tell us tonight?", "SANDERS: Good. You\u2019re right. I want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create 13 million jobs. We do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the Cayman (ph) Islands, and not in some years, pay a nickel in taxes. Yes, I do. I plead guilty. I want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college, or university, tuition free. And, by the way, I want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well.", "How do I pay for it?", "(APPLAUSE)", "I pay for it through a tax on Wall Street speculation.

OK...", "O\u2019MALLEY: ... The only person on this stage who has...", "MITCHELL: ... Secretary Clinton, you mentioned earlier \u2014 Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?", "CLINTON: Well, I have actually documented every way that I\u2019m going to pay for what I\u2019m doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And, you can go to my website and actually see that.", "But, there are serious questions about how we\u2019re going to pay for what we want to see our country do. And, I\u2019m the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class. I want to raise incomes, not taxes, and I\u2019m going to do everything I can to make sure that the wealthy pay for debt free tuition, for child care, for paid family leave. To help us bring down student debt we\u2019re going to refinance that student debt, saving kids thousands of dollars.", "Yeah, and that will also come out of the \u2014 some of the pockets of people in the financial services industry...", "MITCHELL: OK, we\u2019re out of time. Senator Sanders,", "CLINTON: But I will tell you exactly how I pay for everything I\u2019ve proposed...", "(CROSSTALK)", "MITCHELL: Senator Sanders...", "SANDERS: ... Here is the main two points...", "MITCHELL: ... Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question about taxes. SANDERS: Yeah.", "MITCHELL: The most googled political issue...", "SANDERS: ... I got it.", "MITCHELL: In the last month was taxes. Now, in your healthcare plan, the plan you released tonight, you would not only raise taxes on the wealthy, but the details you released indicate you would raise taxes on the middle class also. Is that correct?", "SANDERS: What is correct, and I\u2019m disappointed that Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign has made this criticism. It\u2019s a Republican criticism. Secretary Clinton does know a lot about healthcare, and she understands, I believe, that a medicare for all, single payer program will substantially lower the cost of healthcare for middle class families. So, what we have got to acknowledge, and I hope the Secretary does, is we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.", "So, instead of paying $10,000 dollars to Blue Cross, or Blue Shield, yes, some middle class families would be paying slightly more in taxes, but the result would be that that middle class family would be saving some $5,000 dollars in healthcare costs. A little bit more in taxes, do away with private health insurance premiums. It\u2019s a pretty good deal.", "(APPLAUSE)", "MITCHELL: Senator \u2014 Senator, let me just follow up on that.", "SANDERS: Yeah.", "MITCHELL: On Meet the Press on December 20th, you said that you would only raise taxes on the middle class to pay for family leave. And, having said that, now you say you\u2019re going to raise middle class taxes to pay for healthcare as well. Is that breaking your word?", "SANDERS: No, it is not breaking my word. When you are \u2014 it\u2019s one thing to say I\u2019m raising taxes, it\u2019s another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.SANDERS: So, if I save you $10,000 in private health insurance, and you pay a little bit more in taxes in total, there are huge savings in what your family is spending.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Senator, I\u2019m the only person on this stage that\u2019s actually balanced a budget every year for 15 years.", "SANDERS: I was mayor for eight years, I did that as well.", "(LAUGHTER)", "O\u2019MALLEY: OK. So, that was eight years. Yes. And Senator, but I actually did it during a budget down time \u2014 I mean, during a recession.", "And Andrea, the \u2014 I had to make more cuts than any governor in the history of Maryland, but we invested more in infrastructure, more in transportation. We made our public schools more in America more than five years in a row, and went four years in a row without a penny\u2019s increase to college tuition.", "The things that we need to do in our country, like debt-free college in the next five years, like making universal \u2014 like making national service a universal option in order to cut youth unemployment in half in the next three years, all these things can be done if we eliminate one entitlement we can no longer afford as a nation.", "And that is the wealthy among us, those making more than a million dollars, feel that they are entitled to paying a much lower marginal tax rate than was usual for the better part of these 80 years.", "And if we tax earnings from investments on money \u2014 namely capital gains \u2014 at the same rate as we tax sweat and hard work and toil, we can make the investments we need to make to make our country better.", "HOLT: We have got a lot to ground to cover here.", "Many Democratic voters are passionate about the need to do something to combat the threat of climate change, including the team of scientists from Youtube\u2019s MinuteEarth channel.", "Here\u2019s their take.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: Hello from MinuteEarth.

But on health care and on Wall Street reform, it was Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and was a very aggressive Bernie Sanders.", "One thing of note here: Bernie Sanders very much being the sort of revolutionary candidate, major change, and you\u2019ve heard a lot of Hillary Clinton saying things like she wants to build on the things that President Obama did, wrapping herself in President Obama.", "Let\u2019s go back downstairs and check in with our moderators, Lester and Andrea. So what\u2019s coming up next, guys?", "HOLT: Well, we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already, but we\u2019re gonna be talking about ISIS. A threat to America, it\u2019s \u2014 always polls as one of the top concerns of Americans. And also some more late-breaking news.", "MITCHELL: We have all the news that has happened from Iran and the president\u2019s comments today, as well as what this means going forward for the War on Terror. What do we expect from Iran, and also what\u2019s happening in Syria? So a lot of foreign policy coming up.", "HOLT: A lot of debate to come. We\u2019ll be back in Charleston after this.", "TODD: You\u2019ve got it. Well, it\u2019s the commander-in-chief test \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s next. Stay with us \u2014 the debate resumes right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "HOLT: Charleston, Andrea Mitchell has questions now starting with Iran.", "MITCHELL: Thank you Lester.", "Senator Sanders, the nuclear deal is now enforced. Iran is getting it\u2019s billions of dollars, several Americans who have been held are now going to be heading home. The president said today, \u201cit\u2019s a good day. It\u2019s a good day for diplomacy. It\u2019s a time now to restore diplomatic relations for the first time since 1979 and actually re- opened a U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\u201d", "SANDERS: I think what we\u2019ve got to do is move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Understanding that Iran\u2019s behavior in so many ways is something that we disagree with; their support terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we\u2019re hearing from of their leadership is something that is not acceptable.", "On the other hand, the fact that we\u2019ve managed to reach an agreement, something that I\u2019ve very strongly supported that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and we did that without going to war. And that I believe we\u2019re seeing a fall in our relationships with Iran is a very positive step. So if your question is, do I want to see that relationship become more positive in the future? Yes.", "Can I tell that we should open an embassy in Tehran tomorrow? No, I don\u2019t think we should. But I think the goal has go to be as we\u2019ve done with Cuba, to move in warm relations with a very powerful and important country in this world.", "MITCHELL: Your response Secretary Clinton?", "CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m very proud of the Iran Nuclear Agreement. I was very pleased to be part of what the president put into action when he took office. I was responsible for getting those sanctions imposed which put the pressure on Iran. It brought them to the negotiating table which resulted in this agreement.", "And so, they have been so far, following their requirements under the agreement. But I think we still have to carefully watch them. We\u2019ve had one good day over 36 year and I think we need more good days before we move more rapidly toward any kind of normalization. And we have to be sure that they are truly going to implement the agreement. And then, we have to go after them on a lot of their other bad behavior in the region which is causing enormous problems in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and elsewhere.", "MITCHELL: You mentioned Syria. Let me ask you about Syria, all of you. Let\u2019s turn to Syria and the civil war that has been raging there. Are there any circumstances in which you could see deploying significant numbers of ground forces in Syria, not just specials forces but significant ground forces to combat ISIS in a direct combat role?", "Let me start with you Secretary Clinton.", "CLINTON: Absolutely not.", "I have a three point plan that does not include American Ground forces. It includes the United States leading an air coalition which is what we\u2019re doing, supporting fighters on the ground; the Iraqi Army which is beginning to show more ability, the Sunni fighters that we are now helping to reconstitute and Kurdish on both sides of the border.", "I think we also have try to disrupt their supply chain of foreign fighters and foreign money and we do have to contest them in online space. So I\u2019m very committed to both going after ISIS but also supporting what Secretary Kerry is doing to try to move on a political diplomatic to try to begin to slow down and hopefully end the carnage in Syria which is the root of so many of the problems that we seen in the region and beyond.", "MITCHELL: Senator Sanders, ground forces yes or no? SANDERS: As everybody you know, this is incredibly complicated and difficult issue and I applaud. I know President Obama\u2019s been getting a lot of criticism on this. I think he is doing the right thing.", "What the nightmare is, which many of my Republican colleagues appear to want is to not have learned the lesson of Iraq. To get American young men and women involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of Syria and the Middle East would be an unmitigated disaster that as president, I will do everything in my power to avoid.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea...", "MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley?", "SANDERS: We should \u2014 we should learn \u2014 we should learn from King Abdullah of Jordan, one of the few heroes in a very unheroic place. And what Abdullah said is this is a war with a soul of Islam and that Muslim troops should be on the ground with our support and the support of other major countries. That is how we destroy ISIS, not with American troops in perpetual warfare.", "MITCHELL: Governor O\u2019Malley.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Andrea, governors have led us to victory in two world wars by doing what America does best, and that is by joining forces with others by acting in coalition. And I believe that President Obama is doing the right thing in this case.", "We need to learn the lessons from the past. We do need to provide the special \u2014 special ops advisers, we need \u2014 do need to provide the technical support, but over the long-term, we need to develop new alliances. We need a much more proactive national security strategy that reduces these threats before they rise to a level where it feels like we need to pull for a division of marines.", "And I also want to add one other thing here. I appreciate the fact that in our debate, we don\u2019t use the term you hear Republicans throwing around trying to look all vibrato (ph) and macho sending other kids \u2014 kids into combat, they keep using the term boots on the ground. A woman in Burlington, Iowa said to me, \u201cGovernor, when you\u2019re with your colleagues, please don\u2019t refer to my son who has served two tours of duty in Iraq as a pair of boots on the ground.\u201d Now, we need to be mindful of learning the lessons of the past.", "(APPLAUSE)", "MITCHELL: I have a question. I have a question for Senator Sanders. Did the policies of the Obama administration, in which Secretary Clinton of course was a part, create a vacuum in Iraq and Syria that helped ISIS grow?", "SANDERS: No. I think the vacuum was created by the disastrous war in Iraq, which I vigorously opposed. Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition. And what happened there is yes, it\u2019s easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn\u2019t the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs. And who rises up? Groups like ISIS.", "So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I\u2019m going to do my best to bring American troops home. And I supported what he did. Our job is to train and provide military support for Muslim countries in the area who are prepared to take on ISIS.", "And one point I want to make here that is not made very often, you have incredibly wealthy countries in that region, countries like Saudi Arabia, countries like Qatar. Qatar happens to be the largest \u2014 wealthiest country per capita in the world. They have got to start putting in some skin in the game and not just ask the United States to do it.", "(APPLAUSE)", "MITCHELL: Secretary Clinton, I want to talk to you about red lines, because former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a recent interview that President Obama\u2019s decision to stand down on planned missile strikes against Damascus after Assad had used chemical weapons hurt the president\u2019s credibility. Should the president have stuck to his red line once he drew it?", "CLINTON: Look, I think that the president\u2019s decision to go after the chemical weapons once there was a potential opportunity to build on when the Russians opened that door resulted in a very positive outcome. We were able to get the chemical weapons out.", "I know from my own experience as secretary of State that we were deeply worried about Assad\u2019s forces using chemical weapons because it would have had not only a horrific affect on people in Syria, but it could very well have affected the surrounding states, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey. So getting those chemical weapons out was a big deal, but...", "MITCHELL: But should he \u2014 should he have stuck to his...", "CLINTON: Well \u2014 but \u2014 but...", "MITCHELL: ... line? Did it hurt U.S. credibility? CLINTON: I think, as commander in chief, you\u2019ve got to constantly be evaluating the decisions you have to make. I know a little bit about this, having spent many hours in the situation room, advising President Obama.", "And I want to just add to something that Senator Sanders said, the United States had a very big interest in trying to help stabilize the region. If there is any blame to be spread around, it starts with the prime minister of Iraq, who sectarianized his military, setting Shia against Sunni.", "It is amplified by Assad, who has waged one of the bloodiest, most terrible attacks on his own people: 250,000-plus dead, millions fleeing. Causing this vacuum that has been filled unfortunately, by terrorist groups, including ISIS.", "So, I think we are in the midst of great turmoil in this region. We have a proxy conflict going on between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, one of the criticisms I\u2019ve had of Senator Sanders is his suggestion that, you know, Iranian troops be used to try to end the war in Syria...", "MITCHELL: Your time is up.", "CLINTON: ... and go after ISIS, which I don\u2019t think would be a good idea.", "SANDERS: Let me just...", "MITCHELL: Senator....", "CLINTON: But overall, a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence, but we can...", "MITCHELL: You\u2019re out of time.", "SANDERS: OK. Let me suggest...", "(CROSSTALK)", "MITCHELL: Senator Sanders.", "SANDERS: Where Secretary Clinton and I think, I agree with most of what she said. But where I think we do have an honest disagreement, is that in the incredible quagmire of Syria, where it\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s fighting who and if you give arms to this guy, it may end up in ISIS\u2019 hand the next day. We all know that.", "And we all know, no argument, the secretary is absolutely right, Assad is a butcher of his own people, man using chemical weapons against his own people. This is beyond disgusting.", "But I think in terms of our priorities in the region, our first priority must be the destruction of ISIS. Our second priority must be getting rid of Assad, through some political settlement, working with Iran, working with Russia.", "But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.", "O\u2019MALLEY: But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we\u2019re leaving out something very important here. And that is that we still don\u2019t have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.", "We are walking through this region, Andrea, without the human intelligence that we need. And we need to make a renewed investment as a country in bringing up a new generation of foreign service officers, and bringing up a new generation of business people and actually understanding and having relationships in these places.", "So we have a better sense of what the heck happens after a dictator topples and can take action to prevent another safe haven and another iteration of terror.", "MITCHELL: Your time is us. Lester.", "HOLT: Senator Sanders mentioned Russia a moment ago. Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia\u2019s foreign minister a reset button in 2009. Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?", "CLINTON: Well, it would depend on what I got for it and I can tell you what we got in the first term, we got a new start treaty to reduce nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia. We got permission to resupply our troops in Afghanistan by traveling across Russia.", "We got Russia to sign on to our sanctions against Iran and other very important commitments. So look, in diplomacy, you are always trying to see how you can figure out the interest of the other to see if there isn\u2019t some way you can advance your security and your values.", "When Putin came back in the fall of 2011, it was very clear he came back with a mission. And I began speaking out as soon as that happened because there were some fraudulent elections held, and Russians poured out into the streets to demand their freedom, and he cracked down. And in fact, accused me of fomenting it. So we now know that he has a mixed record to say the least and we have to figure out how to deal with him.", "HOLT: What\u2019s your relationship with him?CLINTON: Well, my relationship with him, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s interesting.", "(LAUGHTER)", "It\u2019s one, I think, of respect. We\u2019ve had some very tough dealings with one another. And I know that he\u2019s someone that you have to continuingly stand up to because, like many bullies, he is somebody who will take as much as he possibly can unless you do.", "And we need to get the Europeans to be more willing to stand up, I was pleased they put sanctions on after Crimea and eastern Ukraine and the downing of the airliner, but we\u2019ve got to be more united in preventing Putin from taking a more aggressive stance in Europe and the Middle East.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: We to want turn right now to the issue of balancing national security concerns with the privacy rights of Americans. That brings us to YouTube and this question.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "BROWNLEE: Hi, my name Marques Brownlee, and I\u2019ve been making YouTube videos about electronics and gadgets for the past seven years.", "I think America\u2019s future success is tied to getting all kinds of tech right. Tech companies are responsible for the encryption technology to protect personal data, but the government wants a back door into that information.", "So do you think it\u2019s possible to find common ground? And where do you stand on privacy versus security?", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "HOLT: So, Governor O\u2019Malley.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Thank you.", "I believe whether it\u2019s a back door or a front door that the American principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant, whether they want to come through the back door or your front door.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And I also agree, Lester, with Benjamin Franklin, who said, no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security.", "So we\u2019re a collaborative people. We need collaborative leadership here with Silicon Valley and other bright people in my own state of Maryland and around the NSA that can actually figure this out.", "But there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms. And one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes, and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant.", "I also want to the say that while we\u2019ve made some progress on the Patriot Act, I do believe that we need an adversarial court system there. We need a public advocate. We need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of Americans in the information and digital age.", "HOLT: That\u2019s time.", "You have all talked about what you would do fighting ISIS over there, but we\u2019ve been hit in this country by home-grown terrorists, from Chattanooga to San Bernardino, the recent shooting of a police officer in Philadelphia. How are you going to fight the lone wolves here, Senator Sanders?", "O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, Lester, year in and year out I was the leader of the U.S. ...", "HOLT: That\u2019s a question to Senator Sanders. I wasn\u2019t clear, I apologize.", "SANDERS: OK. I just wanted to add, in the previous question, I voted against the USA Patriot Act for many of the reasons that Governor O\u2019Malley mentioned. But it is not only the government that we have to worry about, it is private corporations.", "You would all be amazed, or maybe not, about the amount of information private companies and the government has in terms of the Web sites that you access, the products that you buy, where you are this very moment.", "And it is very clear to me that public policy has not caught up with the explosion of technology. So yes, we have to work with Silicon Valley to make sure that we do not allow ISIS to transmit information...", "HOLT: But in terms of lone wolves, the threat, how would you do it?", "SANDERS: Right. What we have got to do there is, among other things, as I was just saying, have Silicon Valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the Internet or in other ways by ISIS is, in fact, discovered.", "But I do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the American people.", "(CROSSTALK)", "HOLT: We have to go to a \u2014 we have to go to a break, and when we come back, we\u2019re going to get to some of the burning questions these candidates have yet to answer and are totally eager to talk about.", "CLINTON: Oh, we\u2019re breaking? OK.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "HOLT: And welcome back to Charleston.", "As we were going to a break, Secretary Clinton, I cut you off. I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to respond on the issue of lone wolves.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Can I get 30 seconds, too?", "(LAUGHTER)", "SANDERS: Can I get 50 seconds?", "HOLT: Secretary Clinton.", "CLINTON: Well, I wanted to say, and I\u2019ll do it quickly, I was very pleased that leaders of President Obama\u2019s administration went out to Silicon Valley last week and began exactly this conversation about what we can do, consistent with privacy and security.", "We need better intelligence cooperation, we need to be sure that we are getting the best intelligence that we can from friends and allies around the world. And then, we\u2019ve got to recognize our first line of defense against lone wolf attacks is among Muslim Americans.", "And it is not only shameful, it is dangerous for the kinds of comments you\u2019re hearing from the Republican side.", "We need to be reaching out and unifying our country against terrorist attacks and lone wolves, and working with Muslim Americans.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: And Andrea has a follow-up.", "O\u2019MALLEY: And Andrea \u2014 Andrea \u2014 Andrea...", "MITCHELL: Just a \u2014 just a quick follow-up, though, Secretary Clinton. Just a moment, Governor.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, when can I get my 30 seconds?", "MITCHELL: But \u2014 but \u2014 Secretary Clinton, you said that the leaders from the intelligence community went to Silicon Valley, they were flatly turned down. They got nowhere.", "CLINTON: That is not what I\u2019ve heard. Let me leave it at that.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Andrea, I need to talk about homeland security and preparedness.", "Ever since the attacks of September 11th \u2014 30 seconds.", "(LAUGHTER)", "Ever since the attacks of September 11th, my colleagues, Democratic and Republican mayors, Democratic and Republican governors, made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness.O\u2019MALLEY: Here in the homeland, unlike combating ISIL abroad, we\u2019re almost like it\u2019s \u2014 your body\u2019s immune system. It\u2019s able to protect your body against bad bugs, not necessarily because it outnumbers them, but it\u2019s better connected \u2014 the fusion centers, the biosurveillance systems, better prepared first responders.", "But there\u2019s another front in this battle, and it is this. That\u2019s the political front, and if Donald Trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith, he can start with me, and I will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify American Muslims. That can do more damage to our democracy than any...", "(CROSSTALK)", "HOLT: All right, that\u2019s time, and \u2014 and we do...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... we do have to move on.", "Secretary Clinton, this is the first time...", "SANDERS: Can I get a \u2014 can I just get a very brief response? Very brief.", "HOLT: Thirty \u2014 30 \u2014 30 seconds, Senator.", "SANDERS: OK. One \u2014 and I agree with what the secretary said, and what Governor O\u2019Malley said. But here\u2019s an issue that we also should talk about. We have a $600 billion military budget. It is a budget larger than the next eight countries\u2019.", "Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union. Very little of that budget \u2014 less than 10 percent \u2014 actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism. We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.", "HOLT: All right. Secretary Clinton...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president. You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can. Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?", "CLINTON: Well, it\u2019ll start at the kitchen table, we\u2019ll see how it goes from there. And I...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... I\u2019m going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband\u2019s leadership and the \u201990s \u2014 especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history \u2014 you bet.", "I\u2019m going to ask for his ideas, I\u2019m going ask for his advice, and I\u2019m going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we\u2019ve got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that\u2019s wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.", "We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.", "HOLT: Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.", "(APPLAUSE)", "SANDERS: Great ideas, Governor O\u2019Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here\u2019s the truth. If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain\u2019t going to accomplish very much.", "So here\u2019s a promise that I make \u2014 and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is \u2014 Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.", "Here\u2019s a promise. If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have \u2014 bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.", "(APPLAUSE)", "MILLER: Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question. You called Bill Clinton\u2019s past transgressions, quote, \u201ctotally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.\u201d Senator, do you regret saying that?", "SANDERS: I was asked a question. You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I \u2014 that question annoys me. I cannot walk down the street \u2014 Secretary Clinton knows this \u2014 without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I\u2019d make some vicious attack.", "I have avoided doing that. Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.", "(APPLAUSE)", "SANDERS: I was asked a question.", "MILLER: You didn\u2019t have to answer it that way, though. Why did you?", "SANDERS: Well \u2014 then if I don\u2019t answer it, then there\u2019s another front page, so it\u2019s yes (ph).", "(LAUGHTER)", "And I mean this seriously. You know that. We\u2019ve been through this. Yes, his behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No, I have not. I\u2019m going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O\u2019Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton\u2019s personal behavior.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: We will take a break. We\u2019ll continue from Charleston right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLT: Welcome back everybody. Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you. We believe we\u2019ve learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to say.", "And, we\u2019ll start with Governor O\u2019Malley.", "(LAUGHTER)", "HOLT: Didn\u2019t see that coming, did you?", "O\u2019MALLEY: Yes, but we\u2019re going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.", "(LAUGHTER)", "MITCHELL: ...too long (ph).", "O\u2019MALLEY: I believe there are many issues. I have 60 seconds for this?", "HOLT: Sixty seconds, we\u2019d appreciate it.", "O\u2019MALLEY: There are so many issues that we haven\u2019t been able to discuss here. We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation\u2019s now maintaining. We haven\u2019t discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.(APPLAUSE)", "O\u2019MALLEY: We haven\u2019t discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.", "I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us. Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good. There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.", "We\u2019re on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.", "HOLT: And that\u2019s time.", "O\u2019MALLEY: Thanks a lot.", "HOLT: Secretary Clinton?", "CLINTON: Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what\u2019s happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged. We\u2019ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn\u2019t really care.", "He had request for help and he had basically stone walled. I\u2019ll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would\u2019ve been action.", "So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help. I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V. show and I said, \u201cit was outrageous that the governor hadn\u2019t acted and within two hours he had.\u201d", "HOLT: And that\u2019s time.", "CLINTON: I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HOLT: Thank you.", "Senator Sanders?", "SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.", "Now, we are a great nation \u2014 and we\u2019ve heard a lot of great ideas here tonight. Let\u2019s be honest and let\u2019s be truthful. Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.", "We\u2019ve got to get rid of Super PACs, we\u2019ve got to get rid of Citizens\u2019 United and what we\u2019ve got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process. To say loudly and clearly,\u201d that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.\u201d", "HOLT: All right. Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.", "I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell. This has been great. It\u2019s been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.", "Let me turn it over to my friend Chuck Todd now. Chuck?", "TODD: Lester thank you and a terrific job moderating this debate tonight, Andrea as well. What a lively substantive debate. We thought there were going to be fireworks, there certainly were.", "You heard sort of the sharp disagreements when it comes to guns, when it comes to Wall Street Reform, when it comes to health care and even a few things on foreign policy.

Experience can edit identity.\u2019\u2019", "The goal of the \u2018\u2018CoZE\u2019\u2019 exercise, Smith explained, was to \u2018\u2018peek over the fence\u2019\u2019 to a new self; by doing something that makes you uncomfortable and then observing the result. There was an anticipatory hush, and then the room erupted. One person gave a toast. A product manager at Dropbox broke into song. In a corner, a programmer named Brent took off his shirt, revealing a milky chest and back, then sat with his head bowed. (He would later walk around wearing a handwritten sign that read, \u2018\u2018Please touch me.\u2019\u2019)", "The exercise went on for an hour, and afterward, participants giddily shared their stories. One person described going onto the patio and watching everyone else through the window, in order to experience a feeling of exclusion. Another submerged his hand in a pan of leftover chicken curry, to challenge his natural fastidiousness. Unexpectedly, he enjoyed the experience. \u2018\u2018It felt playful,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "At the end, Smith led everyone in a group cheer. The CoZE exercise was part of a four-day workshop offered by the Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR) in Berkeley, and each of the workshop\u2019s sessions invariably finished with participants chanting, \u2018\u20183-2-1 Victory!\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a ritual I assumed would quickly turn halfhearted. Instead, as the weekend progressed, it was performed with increasing enthusiasm. By the time CoZE rolled around, late on the second day, the group was nearly vibrating. When Smith gave the cue, everyone cheered wildly, some ecstatically thrusting both fists in the air.", "As self-help workshops go, Applied Rationality\u2019s is not especially accessible. The center\u2019s three founders \u2014 Julia Galef, Anna Salamon and Smith \u2014 all have backgrounds in science or math or both, and their curriculum draws heavily from behavioral economics. Over the course of the weekend, I heard instructors invoke both hyperbolic discounting (a mathematical model of how people undervalue long-term rewards) and prospect theory (developed by the behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky to capture how people inaccurately weigh risky probabilities). But the premise of the workshop is simple: Our minds, cobbled together over millenniums by that lazy craftsman, evolution, are riddled with bad mental habits. We routinely procrastinate, make poor investments, waste time, fumble important decisions, avoid problems and rationalize our unproductive behaviors, like checking Facebook instead of working. These \u2018\u2018cognitive errors\u2019\u2019 ripple through our lives, CFAR argues, and underpin much of our modern malaise: Because we waste time on Facebook, we end up feeling harried; when we want to eat better or get to the gym more, we don\u2019t, but then feel frustrated and guilty.", "Some of these problems are byproducts of our brain\u2019s reward system. We cash checks quickly but drag our feet paying credit-card bills, no matter the financial cost, because cashing a check generates a surge of dopamine but paying a bill makes us stressed. Other mistakes are glitchier. A person who owes back taxes might avoid talking to the I.R.S. because of a lingering monkey-brain belief that avoiding bad news keeps it from being true. While such logical errors may be easy to spot in others, the group says, they\u2019re often harder to see in ourselves. The workshop promised to give participants the tools to address these flaws, which, it hinted, are almost certainly worse than we realize. As the center\u2019s website warns, \u2018\u2018Careful thinking just isn\u2019t enough to understand our minds\u2019 hidden failures.\u2019\u2019", "Most self-help appeals to us because it promises real change without much real effort, a sort of fad diet for the psyche. (\u2018\u2018The Four-Hour Workweek,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.\u2019\u2019) By the magical-thinking standards of the industry, then, CFAR\u2019s focus on science and on tiresome levels of practice can seem almost radical. It has also generated a rare level of interest among data-driven tech people and entrepreneurs who see personal development as just another optimization problem, if a uniquely central one. Yet, while CFAR\u2019s methods are unusual, its aspirational promise \u2014 that a better version of ourselves is within reach \u2014 is distinctly familiar. The center may emphasize the benefits that will come to those who master the techniques of rational thought, like improved motivation and a more organized inbox, but it also suggests that the real reward will be far greater, enabling users to be more intellectually dynamic and nimble. Or as Smith put it, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re trying to invent parkour for the mind.\u2019\u2019", "CFAR has been offering workshops since 2012, but it doesn\u2019t typically advertise its classes. People tend to hear about the group from co-workers (usually at tech companies) or through a blog called LessWrong, associated with the artificial-intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is also the author of the popular fan-fiction novel \u2018\u2018Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.\u2019\u2019 (Yudkowsky founded the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), which provided the original funding for CFAR; the two groups share an office space in Berkeley.) Yudkowsky is a controversial figure. Mostly self-taught \u2014 he left school after eighth grade \u2014 he has written openly about polyamory and blogged at length about the threat of a civilization-ending A.I. Despite this, CFAR\u2019s sessions have become popular. According to Galef, Facebook hired the group to teach a workshop, and the Thiel Fellowship invited CFAR to teach several classes at its annual meeting. Jaan Tallinn, who helped create Skype, recently began paying for math and science students to attend CFAR meetings.", "This is all the more surprising given that the workshops, which cost $3,900 per person, are run like a college-dorm cram session. Participants stay on-site for the entire time (typically four days and nights), often in bargain-basement conditions. In San Leandro, the organizers packed 48 people (36 participants, plus six staff members and six volunteers) into a single house, using twin mattresses scattered on the floor as extra beds. In the kitchen, I asked Matt O\u2019Brien, a 30-year-old product manager who develops brain-training software for Lumosity, whether he minded the close quarters. He looked briefly puzzled, then explained that he already lives with 20 housemates in a shared house in San Francisco. Looking around the chaotic kitchen, he shrugged and said, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not really all that different.\u2019\u2019", "Those constraints produced a peculiar homogeneity. Nearly all the participants were in their early- to mid-20s, with quirky bios of the Bay Area variety. (\u2018\u2018Asher is a singing, freestyle rapping, former international Quidditch All-American turned software engineer.\u2019\u2019) Communication styles tended toward the formal. When I excused myself from one conversation, my interlocutor said, \u2018\u2018I will allow you to disengage,\u2019\u2019 then gave a courtly bow. The only older attendee, a man in his 50s who described himself as polyamorous and \u2018\u2018part Vulcan,\u2019\u2019 ghosted through the workshop, padding silently around the house in shorts and a polo shirt.", "If the demographics of the workshop were alarmingly narrow, there was no disputing the group\u2019s studiousness. Over the course of four days, I heard not a single scrap of chatter about anything unrelated to rationality. Nor, so far as I could discern, did anybody ever leave the house. Not for a quick trip to the Starbucks a mile down the road. Not for a walk in the sprawling park a half-mile away. One participant, Phoenix Eliot, had recently moved into a shared house where everyone was a \u2018\u2018practicing rationalist\u2019\u2019 and reported that the experience had been positive. \u2018\u2018We haven\u2019t really had any interpersonal problems,\u2019\u2019 Eliot told me. \u2018\u2018Whereas if this were a regular house, with people who just like each other, I think there would have been a lot more issues.\u2019\u2019", "When I first spoke to Galef, she told me that, while the group tends to attract analytical thinkers, a purely logical approach to problem-solving is not the goal. \u2018\u2018A lot of people think that rationality means acting like Spock and ignoring things like intuition and emotion,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But we\u2019ve found that that approach doesn\u2019t actually work.\u2019\u2019 Instead, she said, the aim was to bring the emotional, instinctive parts of the brain (dubbed \u2018\u2018System One\u2019\u2019 by Kahneman) into harmony with the more intellectual, goal-setting parts of the brain (\u2018\u2018System Two\u2019\u2019).", "At the orientation, Galef emphasized this point. System One wasn\u2019t something to be overcome, she said, but a wise adviser, capable of sensing problems that our conscious minds hadn\u2019t yet registered. It also played a key role in motivation. \u2018\u2018The prefrontal cortex is like a monkey riding an elephant,\u2019\u2019 she told the group. \u2018\u2018System One is the elephant. And you\u2019re not going to steer an elephant by telling it where it should go.\u2019\u2019 The challenge, Galef said, was to recognize instances in which the two systems were at war, leading to a feeling of \u2018\u2018stuckness\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018Things like, \u2018I want to go to the gym more, but I don\u2019t go.\u2019 Or, \u2018I want my Ph.D., but I don\u2019t want to work on it.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 She sketched a picture of a duck facing one way and its legs and feet resolutely pointed in the opposite direction. She called these problems \u2018\u2018software bugs.\u2019\u2019", "Afterward, I chatted with O\u2019Brien and Mike Plotz, a circus juggler-turned-coder, about the program\u2019s appeal. When I asked Plotz why he thought the workshops attracted so many programmers, he glanced at O\u2019Brien. \u2018\u2018I think most of us are fairly analytical,\u2019\u2019 he began. \u2018\u2018We like to think about how complex systems work and how they can be optimized.\u2019\u2019 Because of this, Plotz added, he tends to notice patterns of behavior, in himself and in others. \u2018\u2018When you realize that people are complex systems \u2014 that we operate in complicated ways, but also sort of follow rules \u2014 you start to think about how you might tweak some of those variables.\u2019\u2019", "Deliberately or not, CFAR\u2019s application process also filters out many of the less committed. There is an extensive, in-person interview, conducted by an instructor. Afterward, participants are required to fill out an elaborate self-report, in which they\u2019re asked to assess their own personality traits and behaviors. (A friend or family member is given a similar questionnaire to confirm the accuracy of the applicant\u2019s self-assessment.) \u2018\u2018We get a fair number of people who say, \u2018I want to come to the workshop because everybody I work with is really irrational and I want to fix them,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Anna Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018Which is not what we are looking for.\u2019\u2019", "Despite this rigorous vetting, Salamon acknowledged that the center\u2019s aims are ultimately proselytic. CFAR began as a spinoff of MIRI, which Yudkowsky created in 2000, in part to study the impending threat posed by artificially intelligent machines, which, he argued, could eventually destroy humanity. (Yudkowsky\u2019s concern was that the machines could become sentient, hide this from their human operators and then decide to eliminate us.) Over the years, Yudkowsky found that people struggled to think clearly about A.I. risk and were often dismissive of it. In 2011, Salamon, who had been working at MIRI since 2008, volunteered to figure out how to overcome that problem.", "When I spoke with Salamon, she said that \u2018\u2018global catastrophic risks\u2019\u2019 like sentient A.I. were often difficult to assess. There wasn\u2019t much data from which to extrapolate; this not only made the threats harder to evaluate but also discouraged researchers from digging into the question. (Studies have shown that people are more likely to avoid thinking about problems that feel depressing or vague and are also more likely to engage in mental \u2018\u2018discounting\u2019\u2019 \u2014 assuming that the risk of something bad happening is lower than it actually is.) CFAR\u2019s original mandate was to give researchers the mental tools to overcome their unconscious assumptions. Or as Salamon put it, \u2018\u2018We were staring at the problem of staring at the problem.\u2019\u2019", "Like many in the community, Salamon believes that the skills of rational thought, as taught by CFAR, are important to humanity\u2019s long-term survival, in part because they can help us confront such seemingly remote catastrophic risks, as well as more familiar ones, like poverty and climate change. \u2018\u2018One thing that primates tend to do is to make up stories for why something we believe must be true,\u2019\u2019 Salamon told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very rare that we genuinely evaluate the evidence for our beliefs.\u2019\u2019", "It was a point of view that nearly everyone at the workshop fervently shared. As one participant told me: \u2018\u2018Self-help is just the gateway. The real goal is: Save the world.\u2019\u2019", "The next day\u2019s classes began with \u2018\u2018goal factoring,\u2019\u2019 taught by Michael Smith. Born in Washington State, Smith was home-schooled and raised by \u2018\u2018immortalist\u2019\u2019 parents. (Immortalists believe that one of humanity\u2019s most-pressing needs is to figure out how to overcome death.) Smith, who goes by Valentine, described his father as a former \u2018\u2018Ayn Randian objectivist\u2019\u2019 who believed in telepathy and named his son after the protagonist in Robert Heinlein\u2019s science-fiction classic \u2018\u2018Stranger in a Strange Land.\u2019\u2019 (In Heinlein\u2019s book, Valentine Michael Smith is raised by Martians but returns to Earth to found a controversial cult.)", "As a lecturer, Smith had a messianic quality, gazing intensely at students and moving with taut deliberation, as though perpetually engaged in a tai-chi workout. Goal factoring, Smith explained, is essentially a structured thought exercise: a way to analyze an aspiration (\u2018\u2018I want to be promoted to manager\u2019\u2019) by identifying the subgoals that drive it. While some of these may be obvious, others (\u2018\u2018I want to impress my ex-girlfriend\u2019\u2019) might be more embarrassing or less conscious. The purpose of the exercise, Smith said, was to develop a process for seeing your own motivations honestly and for spotting when they might be leading you astray. \u2018\u2018These are blind spots,\u2019\u2019 Smith warned. \u2018\u2018Blind spots that can poison your ability to keep track of what\u2019s truly important to you.\u2019\u2019", "To begin the factoring process, Smith asked each of us to choose a goal, list all the things we believed would come from accomplishing it and then brainstorm ways to achieve each thing. If you wanted a promotion to make more money, was there another way to get a higher salary \u2014 say, by asking for a raise or changing jobs? Finally, Smith said, we should imagine having achieved each of those subgoals. Were we satisfied? If not, that indicated the presence of a hidden motive, one that we had either overlooked or didn\u2019t want to acknowledge.", "Though the exercise didn\u2019t strike me as especially penetrating \u2014 garden-variety introspection made punctilious \u2014 it was hugely popular. My group in the goal-factoring session included Ben Pace, a sweetly lumbering 18-year-old in a suit jacket and running shoes, who tended to balance his notepad on his knee like an old-timey newspaper reporter. Pace had flown over from Britain for the workshop, which he discovered at 15 by reading the LessWrong blog. He had applied to Oxford for the fall, and was hoping to attend. \u2018\u2018I was feeling very worried about it,\u2019\u2019 he confided, \u2018\u2018but then I goal-factored it and realized that I could get many of the same things I want from Oxford in other ways.\u2019\u2019", "While Pace said that he had come to the workshop to practice the techniques of rationality, others had more pressing worries. During one break, I chatted with Andrew, a software developer specializing in mobile platforms who asked to be identified only by his first name to protect his privacy. Andrew acknowledged that he tended to struggle in social situations and suffered from depression and anxiety. \u2018\u2018My brain has a lot of ridiculous social rules,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I tend to be very closed off. And then there\u2019s a switch where I\u2019m almost completely open. It\u2019s this binary transition.\u2019\u2019", "Andrew said that he had initially been dubious of applied rationality, which he first heard about in a Reddit philosophy forum. Over time, though, he found that using the techniques made it easier to catch himself in the act of rationalizing a bad decision or avoiding an unpleasant task, like applying for a job. Initially, Andrew said, he assumed that he was simply afraid of rejection. But when he used aversion factoring \u2014 like goal factoring, but focused on what makes you avoid an unpleasant but important task \u2014 he made a surprising discovery. While visualizing how he would feel about applying for jobs if there were no chance of rejection, he realized that he still found the task aversive. In the end, he determined that his reluctance was rooted in a fear not of rejection but of making a bad career choice.", "It was a significant insight, the kind more typically won through hours of talk therapy. And indeed, some participants reported that the techniques had genuinely changed their lives, either by helping them with mental-health issues like attention deficit or obsessive-compulsive disorder or simply by allowing them to recognize unquestioned assumptions. For a few \u2014 especially a set of high achievers for whom success hadn\u2019t brought happiness \u2014 that process had been nearly tectonic. \u2018\u2018For most of my life, I believed \u2018If I do a good job, good things will happen,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 one person told me. \u2018\u2018Now I ask, \u2018If I do a good job, what does that mean?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "Others, though, seemed to see rationality less as a fundamental recalibration and more as a tool to be wielded. One participant, Michael Gao \u2014 who claimed that, before he turned 18, he made $10 million running a Bitcoin mine but then lost it all in the Mt. Gox collapse \u2014 seemed appalled when I suggested that the experience might have led him to value things besides accomplishment, like happiness and human connection. The problem, he clarified, was not that he had been too ambitious but that he hadn\u2019t been ambitious enough. \u2018\u2018I want to augment the race,\u2019\u2019 Gao told me earnestly, as we sat on the patio. \u2018\u2018I want humanity to achieve great things. I want us to conquer death.\u2019\u2019", "Given that I had already undergone a fair amount of talk therapy myself, I didn\u2019t expect the workshop to bring me much in the way of new insights. But then, at one point, Smith cited the example of a man with a potentially cancerous mole who refuses to go see the doctor. It was part, he said, of \u2018\u2018a broader class of mental errors\u2019\u2019 we\u2019re all prone to: the belief that avoiding bad news will keep it from becoming true. While this didn\u2019t strike me as particularly revelatory at the time, it turned out to be a stealthy insight. For an exercise the next day, I listed all the reasons I was avoiding talking with a financial planner, something I had intended to do for months. Many of them were pedestrian. Getting my financial records together would be tedious, and I was also mildly embarrassed by my income, which is on the low side. Working through the problem, though, I realized that the actual reason was humiliatingly simple: I was afraid of hearing that I needed to spend less and save more. Like mole man, I was afraid of what I might learn.", "But are such realizations alone enough to create change? Fears can be stubborn and not particularly easy to argue with. When I mentioned this to Smith, he shrugged. \u2018\u2018Hiding from the painful states of the world doesn\u2019t prevent them from happening,\u2019\u2019 he said. Then, like a strict parent telling a sniffling child to shape up, he added: \u2018\u2018The point isn\u2019t just \u2018How do I get myself to go to the doctor this time?\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018How do I make it so that I will never be susceptible to that type of thinking error again?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "CFAR draws on the insights of behavioral economics and a growing interest in how they might be marshaled to make us happier, healthier and more fiscally responsible. For years, economists were stumped by certain consumer behaviors that seemed irrational and self-defeating, like failing to sign up for a 401K or carelessly going deep into credit-card debt. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky\u2019s prospect theory explained these quirks as a product of a seemingly inbuilt set of misperceptions, known collectively as cognitive bias.", "Among other things, they found that people are typically both risk-averse and loss-averse: more likely to choose a guaranteed payout of $1,000 than to gamble on winning $1,400 when there\u2019s a 20 percent chance they could end up with nothing. They also discovered that people tend to underestimate the chance of a low-probability event occurring, thus inadvertently exposing themselves to terrible risks. (The 2011 tsunami, for example, caught the Japanese off guard and devastated parts of northeastern Japan.)", "In the past few decades, psychologists have identified dozens of cognitive biases, including \u2018\u2018gambler\u2019s fallacy\u2019\u2019 (believing that a coin toss is more likely to come up heads if the previous five flips were tails); \u2018\u2018anchoring\u2019\u2019 (the tendency to rely heavily on one piece of information \u2014 usually the first thing we learn \u2014 when making a decision); the \u2018\u2018Ikea effect\u2019\u2019 (disproportionately valuing things that you\u2019ve labored over); and \u2018\u2018unit bias\u2019\u2019 (assuming that a \u2018\u2018portion\u2019\u2019 is the right size, which accounts for our tendency to finish off an opened bag of cookies).", "More surprising was the degree to which these biases turned out to drive our behavior, in ways both quotidian (what we choose to buy) and dire (the mortgage collapse that led to the 2008 financial crisis). Since then, a welter of strategies has emerged for exploiting these same mechanisms to spur better long-term choices; some of these are already influencing public policy and public health. Governments have begun encouraging companies, for example, to make enrollment in an I.R.A. the default choice, rather than requiring people to opt in, or asking supermarkets not to put racks of candy right near the registers. Last year, President Obama established a Social and Behavioral Sciences Team at the White House; based on its findings, he recently ordered federal agencies to use behavioral-economics strategies to improve participation in their programs.", "What makes CFAR novel is its effort to use those same principles to fix personal problems: to break frustrating habits, recognize self-defeating cycles and relentlessly interrogate our own wishful inclinations and avoidant instincts. Galef described \u2018\u2018propagating urges\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a mental exercise designed to make long-term goals feel more viscerally rewarding \u2014 as an extension of operant conditioning, in which an experimenter who hopes to increase a certain behavior in an animal will reward incremental steps toward that behavior. Goal factoring and aversion factoring, she added, came out of behavioral economics, as well as research on a cognitive bias known as \u2018\u2018introspection illusion\u2019\u2019: thinking we understand our motives or fears when we actually don\u2019t. (That illusion is why the factoring process begins with listing every reason you\u2019re either avoiding something or pursuing a goal, and then uses a second round of thought experiments to ferret out hidden factors.)", "Figuring out how to translate behavioral-economics insights into a curriculum involved years of trial and error. Salamon recruited Galef, a former science journalist, in 2011, and later hired Smith, then a graduate student in math education at San Diego State. (Smith first met Yudkowsky at a conference dedicated to cryonics, in which a deceased person\u2019s body is stored in a supercooled vat, to be resuscitated in a more advanced future.) In early 2012, the group began offering free classes to test its approach and quickly learned that almost none of it worked. Participants complained that the lectures were abstract and confusing and that some points seemed obvious while others simply felt wrong. A session on Bayes\u2019s Theorem was especially unpopular, Salamon recalled, adding, \u2018\u2018People visibly suffered through it.\u2019\u2019", "The group also discovered a deeper problem: No one was very motivated to make his or her thinking more accurate. What people did want, Salamon recalled, was help with their personal problems. Some were constantly late to things. Others felt trapped by their own unproductive habits. Nearly everyone wanted help managing their email, eating better and improving their relationships. \u2018\u2018Relatively early on,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said, \u2018\u2018we realized that we had to disguise the epistemic rationality content as productivity advice or relationship advice.\u2019\u2019", "In the end, the group built a curriculum largely from existing research into human behavior, but the goal of Applied Rationality remained the same: to provide tools, not advice. \u2018\u2018Unlike a lot of self-help programs, we don\u2019t advocate particular things that people should do,\u2019\u2019 Galef told me. \u2018\u2018We just encourage them to look at the models that are driving their choices and try to examine those models rationally.\u2019\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018\u2018People are already making predictions, whether or not they\u2019re aware of it. They\u2019re already saying \u2018I\u2019ll be miserable if I leave this relationship\u2019 or \u2018I won\u2019t be able to make any difference in this big global problem because I\u2019m just one person.\u2019 So a lot of what we do is just trying to make people more aware of those predictions and to question whether they\u2019re actually accurate.\u2019\u2019", "At the San Leandro workshop, that approach seemed to have paid off. Participants sat raptly through the lectures, despite the intense pace: 80-minute sessions, held back to back, for nine hours, with additional sessions after dinner. Galef later said that this immersive structure was deliberate \u2014 a way to \u2018\u2018accelerate the absorption of unfamiliar concepts\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but I found it overwhelming. There were sessions on developing an \u2018\u2018inner simulator\u2019\u2019 to help visualize the possible outcome of a decision; one on \u2018\u2018focused grit,\u2019\u2019 in which participants had to brainstorm solutions to seemingly intractable personal problems within a five-minute time limit; another on \u2018\u2018trigger-action planning,\u2019\u2019 which used associative cues, or TAPs, to spur the development of productive habits, like \u2018\u2018The minute I walk through my front door, I will change into my gym clothes.\u2019\u2019", "The TAPs session was led by Salamon, a thin, muppety woman with a corona of brown hair. As a graduate student, Salamon studied the philosophy of science, and her lectures often seemed to take the wry view of humans as only marginally more evolved chimps. Involuntary TAPs already drive much of our behavior, she said \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like: See open bag of Cheetos. Put in hand\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but could also be made intentional and productive.", "My partner for the TAPs exercise, a soft-spoken engineer who works at Google, told me that he had tried TAPs before, but with limited success. \u2018\u2018For a while, I was trying to drink more water, so I set up a TAP to drink a glass of water the minute I got to work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It worked for a few weeks, but then I stopped. I started just wanting to get to work.\u2019\u2019 Now, he said, he was considering changing his TAP, to cue himself to drink water when he wanted a break. \u2018\u2018Maybe it\u2019ll help me stop reading Reddit,\u2019\u2019 he added.", "If TAPs felt slightly gimmicky, like rat-maze training for adults, other techniques seemed more profound. My favorite was propagating urges, the one that focused on motivating yourself to reach long-term goals. What makes things like weight loss or learning to play the violin difficult, Salamon said, is that they often conflict with System One-driven urges (wanting a nap, craving a cookie). And because long-term goals typically require sticking it out through a series of unpleasant intermediate steps (eating less, practicing the violin), it can be easy to lose the original motivation. \u2018\u2018Things we feel rewarded by, we do automatically,\u2019\u2019 Salamon added. \u2018\u2018When I want Thai food, I\u2019ll drive there, look at the menu, go inside, order. I don\u2019t have to convince myself to take those steps. But in other cases, the connection is lost.\u2019\u2019", "The solution, she said, is finding a way to make long-term goals feel more like short-term urges, especially because our brains are wired to associate actions and rewards that follow closely in time. (To discourage bad habits, conversely, you should stretch out the time between an action and its reward. \u2018\u2018If you want to stop reading stuff online instead of working, have the pages load more slowly,\u2019\u2019 Salamon advised.) Because of this powerful association, small but immediate negative experiences can have disproportionate impact: the aversive moment of getting into a cold swimming pool can overwhelm the delayed rewards of doing morning laps. To override that resistance, she said, you need to associate the activity with a powerful feeling of reward, one with a stronger neurochemical kick than the virtuous goals (\u2018\u2018being healthier\u2019\u2019) that we normally aspire to. The next step is to come up with a mental image that vividly captures that feeling and that you can summon in moments of weakness. \u2018\u2018It has to be a very sticky image,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. \u2018\u2018If it isn\u2019t, you won\u2019t experience that gut-level surge of motivation.\u2019\u2019 She told a story about how Smith overcame his aversion to doing push-ups, which made him feel unpleasantly hot and sweaty, by tapping into his obsession with longevity: now he pictured the heat from the exercise as a fire that burned away cell-damaging free radicals.", "What made propagating urges so compelling, at least for me, was that it cut to the heart of a fundamental internal struggle: the clash between the shortsighted impulses that drive our daily behavior (checking email until it becomes \u2018\u2018too late\u2019\u2019 to go to the gym) and the long-term aspirations that might make us genuinely happier if we could only persuade the petulant toddler in our minds to get onboard.", "In a practice session, I paired up with Brian Raszap, a programmer at Amazon with a gentle smile and empathic manner. The aim of the exercise was to troubleshoot a long-term goal that we had each been struggling with and then create a new, sticky image to use as motivation. Raszap went first. He explained that he and some co-workers go to a Brazilian jujitsu class during lunch, usually once or twice a week. \u2018\u2018When I go, I love it,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. \u2018\u2018I feel so good. But half the time, I don\u2019t go.\u2019\u2019", "We talked through the problem for a while, then I asked Raszap to describe the feeling that he got from the class. He brightened. After working out, he told me, he is very relaxed, filled with a deeply pleasurable lassitude. When I asked if he could tap into that for motivation, Raszap nodded. \u2018\u2018Maybe that would work,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I usually think about wanting to get better at jujitsu. But maybe instead, I can think about feeling really good this afternoon.\u2019\u2019", "Many of CFAR\u2019s techniques resemble a kind of self-directed version of psychotherapy\u2019s holy trinity: learning to notice behaviors and assumptions that we\u2019re often barely conscious of; feeling around to understand the roots of those behaviors; and then using those insights to create change. But there was something unsettling about how CFAR focused on superficial fixes while overlooking potentially deeper issues. While talking with Raszap, I began by asking why, if he truly wanted to go, he often skipped the jujitsu class. Raszap listed practical obstacles: Sometimes he doesn\u2019t want the interruption; sometimes he just has a lot to do. But he also said that even the idea of attending the class more regularly makes him feel anxious. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a feeling of not doing enough,\u2019\u2019 Raszap told me. Perversely, the workout only heightened his fear of failing, of missing the next class. This was coupled with a claustrophobic sense of obligation, what Raszap called \u2018\u2018a fear of foreverness\u2019\u2019 \u2014 \u2018\u2018Like, if I go today, I\u2019ll have to keep going forever.\u2019\u2019", "When I told Raszap that these last anxieties sounded like the sort of thing that might benefit more from psychotherapy than from behavior-modification techniques, he agreed. \u2018\u2018I do have a good therapist, and we do talk about this,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s a different approach. Therapy is more about grand life narratives. Applied rationality is more practical, like, \u2018What if you went to jujitsu in the evening, rather than at lunch?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "Yet applied rationality doesn\u2019t typically acknowledge this gap. Proponents of rationality tend to talk about the brain as a kind of second-rate computer, jammed full of old legacy software but possible to reprogram if you can master the code. The reality, though, is almost certainly more complex. We often can\u2019t see our biggest blind spots clearly or recognize their influence without outside help.", "Several weeks after the workshop, I asked Salamon whether CFAR was intended to be a kind of D.I.Y. therapy, because that seemed to be how some participants were using it. She demurred, saying that the instructors have occasionally recommended counseling to participants who exhibit truly alarming behaviors and beliefs. But she considered therapy-grade problems to be relatively rare. \u2018\u2018Ninety percent of the time, when people aren\u2019t remembering to fill out their expense forms, there\u2019s nothing deep there,\u2019\u2019 Salamon said. Even when a participant does have a deep-seated issue, she added, the techniques can still be effective. \u2018\u2018You just have to give things a bit more space,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And not expect that they\u2019ll yield to hacks.\u2019\u2019", "Shortly before the CoZE exercise began on Saturday, I skipped the group dinner to hide in my room. After two days in Rationality House, I was feeling strung out, overwhelmed by the relentless interaction and confounded by the workshop\u2019s obfuscatory jargon. \u2018\u2018Garfield errors\u2019\u2019 were shorthand for taking the wrong steps to achieve a goal, based on a story about an aspiring comedian who practiced his craft by watching Garfield cartoons. \u2018\u2018Hamming problems\u2019\u2019 signified particularly knotty or deep issues. (The name was a reference, Salamon explained, to the Bell Labs mathematician Richard Hamming, who was known for ambushing his peers by asking what the most important problem in their field was and why they weren\u2019t working on it.)", "And while some exercises seemed useful, other parts of the workshop \u2014 the lack of privacy or downtime, the groupthink, the subtle insistence that behaving otherwise was both irrational and an affront to \u2018\u2018science\u2019\u2019 \u2014 felt creepy, even cultish. In the days before the workshop, I repeatedly asked whether I could sleep at home, because I lived just a 15-minute drive away. Galef was emphatic that I should not. \u2018\u2018People really get much more out of the workshop when they stay on-site,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018This is a strong trend ... and the size of the effect is quite marked.\u2019\u2019", "As it turns out, I wasn\u2019t the only one to find the workshop disorienting. One afternoon, I sat on the front steps with Richard Hua, a programmer at Microsoft who was also new to CFAR. Since the workshop began, Hua told me, he had sensed \u2018\u2018a lot of interesting manipulation going on.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something about being in there that feels hypnotic to me,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a social pressure, exactly, but you kind of feel obliged to think like the people around you.\u2019\u2019 Another woman, who recently left her software job in Portland, Ore., to volunteer with CFAR, said her commitment to rationality had already led to difficulties with her family and friends. (When she mentioned this, Smith proposed that she make new friends \u2014 ones from the rationalist community.)", "But there was also the fact that the vibe was just a little strange, what with the underlying interest in polyamory and cryonics, along with the widespread concern that the apocalypse, in the form of a civilization-destroying artificial intelligence, was imminent. When I asked why a group of rationalists would disproportionately share such views, people tended to cite the mind-expanding powers of rational thought. \u2018\u2018This community is much more open to actually evaluating weird ideas,\u2019\u2019 Andrew told me. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re willing to put in the effort to explore the question, rather than saying: \u2018Oh, this is outside my window. Bye.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 But the real reason, many acknowledged, was CFAR\u2019s connection to Yudkowsky. Compulsive and rather grandiose, Yudkowsky is known for proclaiming the imminence of the A.I. apocalypse (\u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if tomorrow was the Final Dawn, the last sunrise before the earth and sun are reshaped into computing elements\u2019\u2019) and his own role as savior (\u2018\u2018I think my efforts could spell the difference between life and death for most of humanity\u2019\u2019).", "When I asked Galef and Smith whether they worried that the group\u2019s association with Yudkowsky might be off-putting, they seemed genuinely mystified. Galef said the group designed its own curriculum, without consulting Yudkowsky, and also worked hard to remain \u2018\u2018value neutral,\u2019\u2019 emphasizing the techniques of rational thought rather than focusing on MIRI. Smith was more direct. Yudkowsky, he said, is \u2018\u2018entangled in our origins.\u2019\u2019 Then he shrugged. Newton was a jerk, he pointed out, \u2018\u2018but that doesn\u2019t affect physics.\u2019\u2019", "As the workshop drew to a close, the fear of falling back into old mental habits seemed to haunt participants. \u2018\u2018I think that if I actually did these things, my life would be measurably better,\u2019\u2019 Hua told me. \u2018\u2018But I can already predict that I\u2019m going to slack off after the workshop ends. There\u2019s a very big mental load around tackling these problems.\u2019\u2019", "To keep people on track, CFAR holds online practice sessions for 10 weeks after a workshop and also assigns \u2018\u2018accountability buddies\u2019\u2019 to encourage participation. The center is debating whether to develop an online version of its workshops that anyone can access. At the same time, it is also considering whether it would be \u2018\u2018higher impact\u2019\u2019 to focus on teaching rationality to a small group of influential people, like policy makers, scientists and tech titans. \u2018\u2018When I think about the things that have caused human society to advance, many of them seem to stem from new and better ways of thinking,\u2019\u2019 Galef added. \u2018\u2018And while the self-help function of the workshops is great, I wouldn\u2019t be devoting my life to this if that was all that I thought we were doing.\u2019\u2019", "I hadn\u2019t planned to practice the techniques myself, but in the weeks after the workshop ended, I found myself using them often. I began to notice when I was avoiding work \u2014 \u2018\u2018finishing\u2019\u2019 a section of the newspaper (unit bias!) or doing other unproductive foot-dragging \u2014 and then rationalizing the lost time as mental \u2018\u2018preparation.\u2019\u2019 I also found myself experimenting more and noting the results: working in a library rather than a coffee shop (more effective); signing up and paying for spin classes in advance (ditto); going to a museum on the weekend rather than doing something outdoors (so-so). Against all odds, the workshop had cracked open a mental window: Instead of merely muddling through, I began to consider how my habits might be changed. And while it was hard to tell whether this shift was because of the techniques themselves or simply because I had spent four days focusing intensely on those habits, the effect was the same. Instead of feeling stuck in familiar ruts, I felt productive, open and willing to try new things. I even felt a bit happier.", "When I emailed some of the other participants, most reported a similar experience. Mike Plotz, the juggler turned coder, told me that he had recently done \u2018\u2018a flurry of goal-factoring.\u2019\u2019 Among other things, he wanted to understand why he spent so much time checking Facebook every morning before work. Plotz said that he knew the Facebook habit wasn\u2019t helping him and that he often ended up running late and feeling harried. After goal-factoring the problem, Plotz said, he realized that what he really wanted was autonomy: the feeling of being able to choose what he did each morning. Now, he said, rather than passively resisting work through Facebook, he gets up an hour earlier and does whatever he wants. \u2018\u2018This morning I got up, made coffee and listened to \u2018Moby-Dick,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Plotz said when we spoke. \u2018\u2018So I\u2019d say that, so far, it\u2019s going well.\u2019\u2019", "I asked Plotz if he could tell whether the changes he made were due to the applied-rationality techniques or simply the product of a more active, problem-solving mind-set. \u2018\u2018In some ways, I think the techniques are that: a way to kick you into a more productive state of mind,\u2019\u2019 he told me. But he also noted that they supplied a framework, a strategy for working through the questions that such a mind-set might raise. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s one thing to notice your thoughts and behaviors,\u2019\u2019 Plotz said. \u2018\u2018Turning that into a technique that actually lets you accomplish stuff? That\u2019s hard.\u2019\u2019"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/facebook-to-shut-down-parse-its-platform-for-mobile-developers/": ["Facebook acquired Parse, a toolkit and support system for mobile developers, in 2013. At the time, the social network\u2019s ambitions were high: Parse would be Facebook\u2019s way into one day harnessing developers to become a true cloud business, competing alongside the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.", "Those ambitions, it seems, have fallen back to earth. On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shut down Parse, the services platform for which it paid upwards of a reported $85 million.", "\u201cWe know that many of you have come to rely on Parse, and we are striving to make this transition as straightforward as possible,\u201d Kevin Lacker, co-founder of Parse, said in a blog post. \u201cWe enjoyed working with each of you, and we have deep admiration for the things you\u2019ve built.\u201d", "Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia\u2019s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.", "Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.", "At one point, Facebook was willing to take those risks. When Facebook bought Parse in 2013, Facebook\u2019s stock was below its initial public offering price of $38. The company had not grown a robust mobile advertising yet, and Facebook was eager to seek out other lines of business in hopes of future profits, according to two people with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans at the time who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company.", "Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.", "Things have changed. Facebook is generating record profits and its mobile advertising business is booming; 80 percent of the company\u2019s advertising revenue now comes from mobile devices. As Facebook\u2019s fortunes have turned, it has shown less interest in pursuing other lines of business outside of what it does best. Instead, the company appears intent on building things that somehow, someday, will feed Facebook\u2019s core ad-based business \u2014 and those bets are going to have to get bigger and weirder", "Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.", "Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook\u2019s size.

Rift is designed for use while standing or sitting. Vive encourages you to walk around \u2014 there is a front-facing camera on the headgear to let you peek into the real world with the press of a button, in case you want to grab a glass of water, for instance.", "Both devices had some flaws. Rift was difficult to wear on my face; I failed to orient the device to block out the outside world in a space under my nose (perhaps because I have a long nose) and a quick head movement made the headgear go out of focus and required a readjustment. Because Vive encourages moving around, I tripped over the cord a few times. With both devices, I felt exhausted and overstimulated after 20-minute sessions \u2014 virtual reality feels like media designed to be consumed in small doses, not hours at a time.", "Oculus and Vive are initially targeting gamers with their products, and there are limits to the appeal of the systems. Consider the aesthetics of the headgear, which could be off-putting to everyday consumers. Both pieces of headgear still look freakishly sci-fi, like something out of a \u201cStar Trek\u201d episode.", "When I pointed that out to executives of Jaunt, a company based in Palo Alto, Calif., that provides a camera and software for companies to produce virtual reality content, they presented a smartphone wearing a case called the Figment VR.

Once the parade moves on, though, the focus will return to the pressing workaday demands of hiring employees, satisfying customers and getting goods out the door.", "At 3.4 percent, Iowa\u2019s unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country. With major metropolitan areas \u2014 crowded with hard-hat construction sites \u2014 painting an alluring picture of steady economic progress, business leaders here retain a sunny optimism that is rarely heard from the presidential candidates.", "But now that Iowa has achieved a tightening labor market that is the envy of most other states, many companies are confronted with a different set of challenges pushing them to rethink everything from recruiting to economic development.", "These include the fraught questions surrounding immigration. Iowa is home to United States Representative Steve King, the Republican anti-immigrant firebrand, and the kind of anxieties that he champions pop up in political advertisements in a state where roughly nine of every 10 residents are white.", "Some immigrants, particularly those without sought-after credentials in technology or science, say they have had trouble finding a job.

Dozing M.P.s jumped to their feet and barked across the room. One voice was heard jeering, \u201cTharoor only needs this bill for himself!\u201d", "The final tally was 24 votes in favor and 71 votes against, and the bill was sent back to Mr. Tharoor\u2019s drafting table. Yet the debate itself was a hopeful development: Two years after sexual minorities in India were dealt a terrible setback by the Supreme Court, more elected politicians are stepping up for L.G.B.T. rights.", "Unlike the courts, the politicians speak for constituents. Their statements come from and travel back to the hundreds of thousands of voters they represent \u2014 a national conversation that could do more than any learned court ruling to stop prejudice against L.G.B.T.

Convictions are rare, but the law is sometimes used to harass and blackmail gay men and transgenders.", "In a country where every kind of sexual preference permeates cultural heritage and lived reality, Section 377 is both antiquated and incongruous. Mr. Tharoor\u2019s bill proposed to rewrite the provision, penalizing only intercourse with minors and nonconsensual sex.", "For many years, the campaign against Section 377 focused on challenging the provision in court. And the strategy seemed to be succeeding: In 2009, an enlightened ruling from the Delhi High Court found that the clause violated the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality.", "But on Dec. 11, 2013, a panel of the Supreme Court reversed that decision, adopting an unusual position on judicial restraint. It was a bewildering abdication of the court\u2019s role as a guardian of civil rights, and devastating news for L.G.B.T. activists.", "A few days later, I joined an angry gathering on the steps of the town hall in Bengaluru, the city at the heart of India\u2019s technology industry. Just one year earlier, the local Pride March had ended on these stairs \u2014 an especially colorful and buoyant parade, with veteran participants and fearless trans-folk joined by giggling tech geeks hoisting banners branded by Google and Goldman Sachs. After the Supreme Court decision, however, the protesters wore black, and chanted, \u201cIf you\u2019re criminal and you know it, clap your hands!\u201d The occasion was called the Day of Rage.", "Soon, though, the insurgent anger mixed with astonishment at the outpouring of solidarity. On Twitter, even self-described \u201cHindu far/extreme-right-winger patriot-capitalist-conspicuous-consumers\u201d called for Section 377 to be revised by executive ordinance. The evening of the protest, the prime-time news shows were thundering against the Supreme Court decision, and inviting politicians to state their positions on it.", "Through the gloom there was a glimmer of consolation: The action had just shifted out of the courts and into popular politics.", "The first formal statement against the ruling came from the maverick Aam Aadmi Party, which had recently captivated the urban middle class with its campaign against corruption and politics-as-usual. It was followed by the Congress Party.

The B.J.P. won the 2014 general election, and today, after a year and a half in power, its leaders have softened their position on L.G.B.T. rights. At a literary festival in November, Arun Jaitley, the minister of finance conceded, \u201cWhen millions of people the world over have alternative sexual preferences, it is too late in the day to propound a view that they should be jailed.\u201d", "Section 377 remains for now, and as Mr. Tharoor learned, India\u2019s dysfunctional Parliament is still some way from changing it. But the gradual accretion of support for reform from politicians of various persuasions is creating what a wise judicial decision might well have pre-empted: a national conversation about accepting and respecting different sexual lifestyles.", "A progressive Supreme Court ruling would have revised the law all at once, but it would have done relatively little to change the social stigma and institutional hostility faced by sexual minorities. When major political parties affirm their support for L.G.B.T. Indians, it sends a different kind of writ to both their supporters and officials under their control.", "In the spring, Mr. Tharoor will reintroduce his bill. He hopes that a full discussion in Parliament will be an opportunity to broadcast that L.G.B.T. rights are \u201cnot about sex but about freedom.\u201d The chances of the bill\u2019s passing are still slim, at least until the B.J.P.\u2019s more liberal voices prevail over the bigoted ones. Indian politicians can be expected to prevaricate, pass the buck or pander to religious conservatives in their base.", "But some elected politicians have already begun to grapple with their responsibility toward sexual minorities, and thanks to the parallel efforts of activists, a small but growing legislative agenda for queer rights has become evident. A new bill protecting the rights of transgenders has passed in the upper house of Parliament and will be presented in the lower house this year. Last January, Madhu Bai Kinnar was elected mayor of Raigarh \u2014 the first transgender elected to run any Indian city.", "Unlike in the United States, where L.G.B.T. rights are an issue too hot for many politicians to touch, in India homophobia is diffuse, and hardly features in our culture wars.

On the third floor of the New Haven police station, Detective Kris Cuddy had just finished interviewing the mother of a young rape victim. After escorting the woman downstairs, she was returning to her office in the Special Victims Unit. Her square-heeled boots made a quick, hard sound as she left the elevators, a tock-tock-tock that could be heard above the ringing phones and cubicle chatter. The detective had an Irish face \u2014 blue-eyed, pale-skinned, puckish, her coppery brown hair shorn close at the sides into a fauxhawk. She was one of only four investigators in the S.V.U., and she had 32 cases open at the moment. But during interviews with victims or their family members, she never displayed any sign of the pressure she was under. Her manner was steady and reassuring. So we\u2019re here to discuss an incident that happened recently, she would begin, making only a vague allusion to the matter at hand before stepping back to allow people to tell the story in their own way. She would offer water, offer a tissue. Let them talk, circling back later to gather more details. At the end of interviews with victims, she almost always told them they were brave.", "That morning, in a voice edged with distress, the mother had described a girl who seemed broken by the assault. The mother, too, was overwhelmed. When she broke down sobbing, covering her face, Cuddy placed her hand on the woman\u2019s forearm, saying quietly, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re almost done. We\u2019re almost done,\u2019\u2019 as if she were coaxing her to swim a little longer (they were almost at the shore!), coaxing her even though in all likelihood that shore no longer existed for her.", "Cuddy shared an office with her partner, Detective Joe Landisio, their two desks facing each other and pushed together, edge to edge. The room was crowded with two printers, a table, another small desk and a huge file cabinet filled with old homicide cases that no one had bothered to move when the units switched offices. The bathroom was next door, so you could hear toilets flushing all day. When she walked into the office, she felt like going straight to sleep. The mother had been so distraught, and Cuddy couldn\u2019t make a dent in that. \u2018\u2018You know what this office needs?\u2019\u2019 she asked as she sat down at her desk, letting out a huge sigh. \u2018\u2018A bar.\u2019\u2019", "Landisio swiveled in his chair, scanning the room. \u2018\u2018It could go right against that wall there,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to a spot beneath a cartoon drawing of a man joyfully kicking a pregnant woman \u2014 a \u2018\u2018gift\u2019\u2019 from Officer Steve Formica, from Firearms, in recognition of the no-taboos humor char\u00adac\u00adteristic of the S.V.U. squad.

The girl had already been interviewed at the Yale Child Abuse Clinic, a five-minute drive from headquarters. The S.V.U. detectives never questioned children or young teenagers, leaving that job to the trained social workers with the clinic. But they observed these forensic interviews on a television screen in an adjoining room, along with a social worker and medical personnel from the clinic and a case worker from the state\u2019s Department of Children and Families. The room was always crowded and often overheated. It was hard for Cuddy to be just an observer \u2014 she would have liked to interview the children herself. Sometimes she talked to them afterward, not to question them but to offer her support, to compliment them on their courage, to try to cheer them up. Landisio never wanted to talk to the victims. He wouldn\u2019t know what to say. The whole thing just made him too sad.", "All the forensic interviews took place in a small, comfortable room with two armchairs facing each other and an easel set up in between, and they followed a set format. After some friendly chitchat, the social worker would hang two anatomical drawings on the easel, one male, one female, and ask the child to name various body parts, starting with the innocuous ones \u2014 hair, eyes, arms \u2014 which were then written on the drawings. The social worker wanted to make sure to use the child\u2019s own terminology \u2014 \u2018\u2018pee-pee\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018privacy\u2019\u2019 for penis, for instance, or \u2018\u2018coo-coo\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018toti\u2019\u2019 for vagina \u2014 so that the victim\u2019s testimony would be clear.", "Because interviewers always avoided leading questions, they often started the serious part simply by asking the child, \u2018\u2018So, why are you here today?\u2019\u2019 Then the social worker would draw out the details of the assault, one by one. The questions were always excruciatingly specific but asked in a kindly, matter-of-fact way: What did it feel like when he touched your coo-coo? Did he touch you on the outside of your toti or on the inside? Did he say anything when he put his privacy in your tush? As the children were questioned, they squirmed or stared bleakly at the floor. With the utmost concentration, a pony-tailed girl picked at a loose thread on her sweater. Another girl yawned hugely. A boy gripped and rubbed his elbow as if he had just injured it, grimacing theatrically as he bent over his arm, his face hidden from the social worker. A girl who was raped while watching a cartoon sat silently, tears streaming down her cheeks; another schoolgirl pulled her sweater over her head and answered the questions from there. Honey, I can\u2019t hear you, the social worker said.", "Late that afternoon, Cuddy handed her application for an arrest warrant to the supervisor of their unit, Sgt. Betsy Segui, for review. From there it would be submitted to the court, where an inspector for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office would review it again before the court decided whether to issue a warrant. \u2018\u2018Then we can get this [expletive],\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. It was her way, the only one she had, of fixing things. But winter turned to spring, spring to summer and then summer to fall, and still Cuddy waited for her arrest warrant.", "Most American rapes go unpunished. Rape statistics vary depending on the methodology used: The National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, states that only about 34 percent of rape or sexual-assault cases were reported in 2014. Based on a rigorous review of the academic research, End Violence Against Women International, a renowned research and training organization for law-enforcement officers and other professionals involved in sexual-assault investigations, estimates that only 5 to 20 percent of sexual assaults are reported, depending on the population studied. And according to a 2011 report by the University of Kentucky Center for Research on Violence Against Women, only 14 to 18 percent of all sexual assaults reported to the police are prosecuted.", "Ideas about what constitutes a \u2018\u2018real rape\u2019\u2019 still hinder rape investigations and prosecutions. In the minds of many police officers, prosecutors, juries, even victims themselves, a \u2018\u2018real rape\u2019\u2019 is committed by a male stranger who uses a weapon to threaten the victim and inflicts serious injury. And yet about three-quarters of all sexual assaults reported to the police are committed by someone known to the victim, only 11 percent involve weapons and most don\u2019t result in severe injuries. In a tragic twist, the most likely sexual-assault situations are often the ones most doubted or discounted by law enforcement \u2014 assaults involving drugs or alcohol, or those whose victims know their assailant or delay reporting the crime. Prostitutes are extremely vulnerable to rape, yet they are often treated dismissively by the police. The seriously mentally ill also suffer high rates of sexual assault, yet they are seen as unreliable. Many police officers continue to read vulnerability as complicity. It\u2019s as if a victim of robbery were disbelieved because she lived in a poor, crime-ridden neighborhood.", "There is another unacknowledged side to the investigation of sexual assault: the huge numbers of victims who are children or teenagers. In New Haven, the detectives estimate that more than 80 percent of their cases involve minors \u2014 a number above but not that far afield from national statistics. In a 2014 study published by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, which analyzed data from the F.B.I.\u2019s National Incident-Based Reporting System for the years 2009 and 2010, 61 percent of the female victims and 84 percent of the male victims of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement were younger than 18. For females, the age with the most sexual-assault victimizations was 14, and for males it was 4.", "These cases are rarely reported immediately because children often feel confused, afraid or to blame, and because the perpetrators are often family members or family friends. Even many adult victims don\u2019t report a sexual assault before the 72-to-120-hour cutoff after which hospitals will no longer conduct a forensic medical exam. Delayed reporting is the norm in sexual-assault cases, not the exception. In New Haven, the vast majority of the detectives\u2019 cases are reported days, weeks, months, even years after the fact. Not only is there bias against a victim who waits to report an assault, but the delay also means that there is rarely any physical evidence \u2014 neither forensic evidence taken from the bodies of the victims or suspects nor crime scenes to investigate.", "These prejudices about \u2018\u2018real rape\u2019\u2019 happen to dovetail with those rapes that are easier to investigate and prosecute. In a 2002 review of charging decisions made by prosecutors in three major cities, Cassia Spohn, now director of the School of Criminol\u00adogy and Criminal Justice at Arizona State University, found that prosecutors were substantially more likely to file charges \u2018\u2018if the victim was injured, if the suspect used a gun or knife and if there was physical evidence,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018if the victim reported the crime promptly\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018if there were no questions about the victim\u2019s moral character or behavior at the time of the incident.\u2019\u2019", "In spite of the difficulties of these investigations, it\u2019s far too common for special-victims units to be understaffed and low on resources, according to Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant with the San Diego Police Department and executive director of End Violence Against Women International. Police chiefs and sheriffs are often pressured by the community and the media to focus on more visible problems. \u2018\u2018They are focusing their energy on gangs and narcotics because that\u2019s what the community is talking about,\u2019\u2019 Archambault says. Rarely is there an outcry over police response to sexual assaults. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the hidden epidemic, right? Nobody really wants to know about it.\u2019\u2019", "These are also the first units to be plundered if more officers are needed elsewhere. At one time New Haven\u2019s S.V.U. had 15 detectives, two supervising sergeants and a lieutenant, but in August 2011, a year that saw the city plagued by 130 shootings and 34 homicides (more than four times the per-capita murder rate in New York City that year), it was disbanded, and all the detectives were assigned to Major Crimes. A year and a half later, under the new chief of police, Dean Esserman, the unit was resurrected \u2014 this time with four detectives and one sergeant, though for one memorable month that year, Cuddy was the only detective working on the squad. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know how you did this all by yourself,\u2019\u2019 Landisio commented one day. Cuddy replied, \u2018\u2018A lot of booze, a lot of booze.\u2019\u2019", "Most detectives in New Haven dreaded being assigned to the Special Victims Unit. But Cuddy and Landisio wanted to be there. For Cuddy, it was simple: \u2018\u2018It feels like the only unit where what you do really matters.\u2019\u2019 For Landisio, whom colleagues called Lando, it was also simple: He wanted to work with Cuddy. With 13 years on the job, four of them in the S.V.U., she was the detective with the most experience in the unit, but she also had a sense of humor that ran from ridiculously whimsical to jaw-droppingly filthy. In their office, it was not an unusual to see a strapping, dark-suited homicide detective walking away from some raunchy comment she made, shaking his head and murmuring, \u2018\u2018Cuddy, Cuddy, Cuddy.\u2019\u2019 She could be a charismatic flirt (waitresses; female bartenders; their supervisor, Sergeant Segui) and was deeply in love with her wife, whose name was tattooed on the inside of her left wrist. Landisio had eight years on the job and just under a year in the S.V.U. He was short and dark-eyed with a silver barbell piercing his tongue. He had passions for electronic music, firearms, pit bulls and T. rexes. His appearance and personality might have been put together by an eclectic collector. The two detectives kept up a running commentary throughout the day that consisted of lines from \u2018\u2018S.N.L.\u2019\u2019 sketches and YouTube videos, as well as bizarre quotations they\u2019d heard working the job. \u2018\u2018You two are like an old married couple,\u2019\u2019 one detective observed when she happened into the office one day as Landisio was running a lint roller down Cuddy\u2019s back.", "Last January, the unit lost two experienced detectives when they were transferred to Major Crimes, even though both wanted to stay with the S.V.U. They were replaced by Natale and Agosto, who shared an adjoining office. Natale, who was plucked from Homicide, didn\u2019t want to be there. A tall, straight-talking blond woman, she told me: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m usually not this miserable. I don\u2019t want to do this [expletive]. I have no interest. None.\u2019\u2019 Meanwhile, a group of rookies who were making the rounds at the station had visited every unit but theirs. Cuddy didn\u2019t seem to care, but Landisio did. When I asked why they didn\u2019t visit, Cuddy said: \u2018\u2018Because what we do isn\u2019t important. I\u2019m not kidding. You can\u2019t make this [expletive] up.\u2019\u2019", "When a patrol cop ducked in to get Landisio\u2019s and Cuddy\u2019s advice on whether she should take the sergeant\u2019s exam, she asked them, \u2018\u2018Why does everyone hate this unit?\u2019\u2019 Neither Cuddy nor Landisio seemed insulted by the question. Because you work your butt off, they told her. You will do more interviewing here \u2014 of victims, suspects, witnesses \u2014 than you will ever come close to in any other unit. \u2018\u2018It will make you a better cop,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said.", "But it wasn\u2019t just the workload; it was the nature of the crimes themselves. Too disturbing for your average cop. Then there was the amorphous character of the investigations: the lack of physical evidence, the time factor when so many of the reports came in long after the incident. A week into her assignment, Detective Natale said: \u2018\u2018It seems like 95 percent of these cases are [expletive],\u2019\u2019 sounding completely frustrated and baffled by the work of investigating a crime without a scene to examine, weapons to trace, eyewitnesses to interview.", "When the rookies were finally ushered into their office, after a lieutenant laughingly warned Cuddy to go easy on them, they stood just inside the doorway, shoulder to shoulder, looking blank-faced and ill at ease. Landisio swirled around in his chair, kicked off with a description of their caseloads, then looked to Cuddy to chime in. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m just going to sit here and eat my cold sore,\u2019\u2019 she said pleasantly. The rookies stared at her.", "Landisio tried again, going into a history of his law-enforcement career. \u2018\u2018I started walking in \u201909. \u2026\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018On Milford beach,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy interjected brightly. \u2018\u2018Collecting seashells.\u2019\u2019 The rookies shifted uneasily side to side. One guy finally asked Cuddy whether she had chosen to be in this unit. No, she said, she was assigned, but she had worked in almost every other unit, and none was as satisfying as this one. Not a lot of people want to be here, she said, because \u2018\u201890 percent of our cases are kids being drilled in the ass by their grandfathers. But when you lock up their grandfather, that kid will never forget you for being their voice.\u2019\u2019 When the rookies left, five uncomfortable minutes later, I got the feeling that they were all fervently hoping they would never be assigned there, but Cuddy merely rolled her eyes.", "The first step to a successful sexual-assault investigation is investigating, which would seem to be a given. All too often, though, that\u2019s not what happens. A recent review of the New Orleans Police Department by the city\u2019s inspector general, for example, found that from 2011 to 2013, five detectives from the sex-crimes unit filed investigative reports in only 14 percent of the sexual-assault and child-abuse cases assigned to them. Most initial reports of assaults were misclassified as \u2018\u2018miscellaneous\u2019\u2019 and simply closed without any investigation at all. In a particularly galling example, detectives closed the case of a 2-year-old who was taken to an emergency room after a suspected sexual assault, and who tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease. The primary detective wrote in his report that the toddler did not disclose any information that would warrant a criminal investigation. The inspector general found that the sex-crimes detectives worked without supervision and closed cases without any review.", "In New Haven, unless a victim chooses not to file charges, every case that is assigned to an S.V.U. detective is investigated. According to Segui, the detectives refer about 90 percent of their cases to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office for an arrest warrant \u2014 though that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get one. Every recommendation by a detective either to proceed with an application for an arrest warrant or to close a case is first reviewed by Segui, then by the court. The detectives have considerable influence on Segui. \u2018\u2018I trust them,\u2019\u2019 she told me. If the detectives feel they should close a case, she looks it over herself and then occasionally has the prosecutor \u2018\u2018in essence, quote-unquote, check our work.\u2019\u2019", "During my months with the unit, the detectives closed six cases out of dozens without applying for an arrest warrant. There was a young woman who told an emergency-room nurse that a friend raped her. Her lip was swollen as if she\u2019d been punched in the mouth. She didn\u2019t want to file a complaint, but Cuddy persuaded her to take the sexual-assault exam, so that they would have the evidence if she changed her mind. A mother reported that her 3-year-old son said her ex-partner bit and pulled his penis, but the boy never disclosed this or any other abuse during his forensic interview. If there\u2019s no medical evidence (there wasn\u2019t), and if a child doesn\u2019t mention abuse during the forensic interview, the case doesn\u2019t move forward. Cuddy also noticed that when the mother was asked to repeat exactly what her son said, she used the word \u2018\u2018penis\u2019\u2019; in his interview, the boy always used the word \u2018\u2018pee-pee.\u2019\u2019", "Some cases were so tangled and muddy that the truth remained unknowable, and they eventually withered because of a lack of probable cause. One of these was a case that came back to the unit: an injured woman whom the detectives interviewed in the hospital two months earlier, after hospital personnel called in a case of possible domestic abuse. The victim told the detectives she didn\u2019t know how her face became bruised and bloodied. She had been sleeping at her ex-boyfriend\u2019s house the night before, so she could drive him to work the next morning, and she woke to the taste of blood in her mouth. She said her ex-boyfriend told her she had fallen. She thought maybe he had elbowed her in her sleep. With no claim of domestic abuse, Landisio referred the case back to patrol, and an officer interviewed the ex. That report concluded: \u2018\u2018Due to [complainant\u2019s] conflicting report and no evidence of domestic violence, there was no arrest made. No further actions were taken.\u2019\u2019", "But shortly afterward, the victim claimed her ex-boyfriend had beaten and sexually assaulted her, and the case was reassigned to Landisio. \u2018\u2018She definitely got [expletive] up,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. He was sitting at his desk across from Cuddy, examining a photograph of the woman\u2019s face \u2014 the right side was puffy and purpled, the eye sealed shut, as if she\u2019d been lying half-submerged in water. \u2018\u2018Yeah, but how?\u2019\u2019 Cuddy asked. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the question.\u2019\u2019", "Landisio and Cuddy interviewed the victim again, and this time she described her ex asking for sex that night and hitting her after she refused. The last thing she heard before passing out was her clothes being ripped, she said. When Landisio asked her why she didn\u2019t mention the assault before, the woman said it took a few days for the memories to come back to her.", "Landisio filled out a request for the victim\u2019s medical records, while Cuddy found the suspect\u2019s profile on Facebook. He had posted a handful of photos from fishing trips of himself proudly displaying his catch, the fish gripped in his right hand. All of the woman\u2019s injuries were to the right side of her face, which meant that if she was punched, it was likely to have been by a left-handed person. Landisio and Cuddy started searching on Google for images of facial injuries from falls to see if there was any resemblance between those and the particular bruising and swelling on the woman\u2019s face. The assault story was looking weaker to them, but they both thought the woman\u2019s injuries seemed too severe for just tumbling out of bed.", "Three weeks later, Landisio interviewed the ex-boyfriend. He didn\u2019t like interviewing suspects. When you asked a victim a hard question, you were doing it for her benefit. But suspects? He worried about the innocent ones tripping themselves up. \u2018\u2018I think of how the implications of what they\u2019re saying could lead to a lifetime in prison,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. The suspect was voluble and animated to the point of cartoonishness. In his version of events, his ex-girlfriend was drinking and taking prescription medicine that night and didn\u2019t fall off the bed \u2014 he heard a crash while he was in another room and found her lying in the middle of the bedroom. To him, it seemed she had keeled over from a standing position, like a felled tree. When he tried to move her, she told him to leave her alone.", "Afterward, Landisio felt his account was credible. He never deflected a question or repeated it to buy himself time. He leapt at every query, often interrupting Landisio, eager to explain. And the suspect was all of one piece: amiable, entertaining, self-absorbed and contemptible \u2014 but consistently so. When he heard her fall? He was aggravated by the noise because a family member was sleeping upstairs. When the victim refused to be moved? He went about his night, fixing his dinner, checking in occasionally to see if she was still breathing. When he woke in the morning to find her gone? He called her son, even driving to their house on his suspended license hoping she was there. He still wanted her to drive him around. And the suspect signed his statement with his right hand.", "The victim\u2019s son later confirmed to Landisio that the suspect had called several times and come to their house looking for his mother. Landisio submitted copies of the interviews, the medical records, the original police report and his own report to Segui. He told her he didn\u2019t think they had probable cause for an arrest warrant. Segui and then the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office agreed. No arrest warrant was issued, and the case was closed.", "One of the least-examined myths surrounding rape investigations is that these cases come down to he said, she said: When the victim and the suspect give their versions of the event, one party is lying and one is telling the truth, and somehow the detectives have to examine the quality of each person\u2019s testimony, discern their individual characters and decide which is which. But the most current thinking on sexual-assault investigations is that there is always corroborating evidence. Detectives just have to be willing to search for it. It might be found in cellphone records or on social media; there might be witnesses before or after the act. Finding this other evidence requires commitment and creativity on the part of the investigators. These are complicated, time-consuming investigations.", "In early February, Cuddy was assigned a case involving a teenage girl who claimed she was raped by an older male relative while she was in elementary school. A delay of more than seven years in reporting? Not even worth commenting on. Often the victims decided to talk because something happened, there was some final pressure and they broke. For this teenager, it was her mother lecturing her once again about boys and sex. The girl lost it. She didn\u2019t even like boys, she told her mother. She didn\u2019t even want them touching her. That got her mother\u2019s attention in a whole different way.", "According to the Department of Children and Families report Cuddy was reading, the girl claimed she was raped while in the care of her mother\u2019s friend when her mother was incarcerated. The male relative showed up at the house and told the friend she could leave \u2014 he would watch the child. Then he raped her.", "The girl had a forensic interview scheduled at the Yale clinic later in the month, but the mother was coming to the station that day. Before she arrived, Cuddy ran her name through various law-enforcement databases. She was looking for dates when the mother was locked up. Yellow highlighter suspended, Cuddy frowned at the printout in front of her. She saw several jail sentences, all suspended. Six months, suspended; one year, suspended. There was no jail time that matched the year the girl would have been raped.", "In the interview room, Cuddy sat no more than an arm\u2019s length from the mother, taking notes on a legal pad. The mother kept her elbows on the table and her hands clasped. Her face was tense and grave, and at first there was a slight tremor in her voice. Cuddy opened the interview with: \u2018\u2018And this is in regard to your daughter?\u2019\u2019", "Yes, the mother nodded.", "\u2018\u2018O.K., why don\u2019t you tell me everything that happened from the beginning?\u2019\u2019", "The mother described the argument that led to her daughter\u2019s divulging the rape. When her daughter named her rapist, the mother\u2019s voice went hard and flat. \u2018\u2018Walk me through it,\u2019\u2019 she said to her daughter tersely. The girl told her what the man did, and when she repeated the words he said while he raped her, the mother knew her daughter wasn\u2019t lying: He said the same thing before raping her when she was a girl.", "The interview solved one mystery: The mother told Cuddy that she believed the rape took place while she was detained after being picked up on a misdemeanor charge. She was locked up for only six or seven hours while she waited to be arraigned. Still, the situation felt slightly improbable. How did the relative happen to walk through that narrow window of opportunity?", "Cuddy went back to the records, no longer looking for a jail sentence during the time period the girl was assaulted but an arrest \u2014 an arrest at a location the mother named that led to approximately six hours of lockup. She would find that first and figure out the suspect\u2019s omniscience later.", "And then there it was: the right year, the right misdemeanor charge. An arrest and then hours later, the booking. Scanning the police report, Cuddy suddenly said very quietly: \u2018\u2018He was with her. That\u2019s how he knew. He was with her.\u2019\u2019", "The police arrested the mother in front of him and took her away, and there he was \u2014 with the certain knowledge that she would be gone for hours. \u2018\u2018I got it,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018Phew!\u2019\u2019 Then she let out a relieved laugh.", "During the teenager\u2019s forensic interview, which Cuddy watched craned close to the monitor so she could catch every word, her voice was barely audible. She never once made eye contact with the social worker. If she could gesture \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 rather than speak, she did. After it was over, Cuddy asked the mother if she could speak to her daughter. In a room set aside for children, they sat over a game of Jenga, and Cuddy told the girl she was proud of her. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re a survivor now, not a victim,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re free from this point on. You\u2019ve talked about it, and you don\u2019t need to talk about it again.\u2019\u2019", "As she headed back to headquarters, Cuddy said, \u2018\u2018I finally got her to smile.\u2019\u2019 When she told the girl she was going to arrest the relative, Cuddy asked for a high-five. The girl slapped her hand, a smile slipping shyly into view. \u2018\u2018Which makes me feel great, you know?\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018Win-win.\u2019\u2019", "The office smelled of industrial floor cleaner and burned coffee. Officer Steve Formica lingered in the doorway, coffee cup in hand. \u2018\u2018Go back to your office with your Hello-Kitty-ass mug,\u2019\u2019 Landisio told him, looking up from a case file. Not blinking, his lips barely moving, Formica said, \u2018\u2018I came out for coffee.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018I came out for [expletive],\u2019\u2019 Cuddy chimed in. Formica\u2019s eyes gleamed briefly, like the pulse from a lighthouse, but his face remained immobile. It was snowing outside. A toilet flushed next door. Landisio continued to read. He had just been assigned a case of a 15-year-old who said a classmate assaulted her in the school auditorium. He had gone to the school to look at the layout and collect any footage from the school\u2019s surveillance cameras. An hour before the girl\u2019s forensic interview, he scanned the police report, reading sections out loud. The teenager told the patrol officer that she and the boy were backstage in the auditorium, making out, and \u2018\u2018the next thing she knows, he was inside of her,\u2019\u2019 Landisio read.", "\u2018\u2018There you go, those are the key words,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018The next thing I knew.\u2019 She\u2019s leaving something out.\u2019\u2019 That was one of the verbal cues they paid attention to, those time gaps in a subject\u2019s story. \u2018\u2018And before I knew it. ... \u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The next thing I remember. ... \u2019\u2019 During interviews, they would first let the subject proceed with her unprompted narration, and then they would return to those gaps \u2014 slowing the narration down, backfilling the account with details. Those specific questions could make the case stronger. Or they could reveal that the subject was evasive on purpose. Understanding why was essential. Many victims will try to present themselves as \u2018\u2018better victims,\u2019\u2019 embarrassed or afraid to admit they were drunk at the time, for instance, or that they were close to their attacker. The detectives almost never interviewed a victim more than once, because even the smallest contradiction between their statements was a gift for a defense attorney. So they had to get it right the first time. If they didn\u2019t, they might not be able to pursue a case. The heart of every investigation was that victim interview \u2014 if done right, it provided exploratory avenues for the detectives. It became the road map for the investigation.", "As Landisio continued to prepare for his interview with the 15-year-old, Cuddy took a call from the Connecticut state laboratory: There was a DNA match linking a suspect to two stranger rapes that occurred in 2012 and 2013. The first victim, who worked as a prostitute, was attacked late at night; the second, a mother in her 40s who was assaulted as she was walking to work before dawn. Each woman was yanked off the street at knife point, pulled into an empty lot, forced to her knees and then onto her back and then upright again as she was orally, vaginally and anally raped.", "Rapes by strangers are more likely to be reported, and reported immediately, but they have their own investigative challenge: identifying the perpetrator. Images from a surveillance camera at one of the crime scenes were too fuzzy to be of use, even after Cuddy sent them to the F.B.I. lab for enhancement. The victims\u2019 descriptions of the rapist narrowed it down to a light-skinned man with a Spanish accent, no facial hair, possibly in his 30s \u2014 it was hardly much to work on. Victims\u2019 identifications are usually too fragmentary to be helpful, Cuddy told me. \u2018\u2018Sometimes they can\u2019t tell you anything, but they can tell you he had a black thumbnail because they just focused on that to get out of the moment. When you think of what\u2019s happening, they have to focus on something, and it\u2019s not gonna be his face.\u2019\u2019", "DNA evidence from a sexual-assault exam can be the key to solving stranger rapes \u2014 but only if the rapist\u2019s DNA is in the F.B.I.\u2019s national database, known as the Combined DNA Index System (Codis). In 2011, the Connecticut state lab lost its accreditation after federal audits found a backlog of thousands of DNA cases. A year later, the lab regained its accreditation and underwent a major expansion with a new director. This fall, Connecticut passed new legislation mandating that the police submit rape-kit evidence to the lab within 10 days of a crime and that the lab test the evidence within 60 days. But in some parts of the country, many kits are still never tested at all. Tens of thousands sit untested in police storage units and public lab facilities. And those are the ones that have been counted. Many police agencies do not even inventory the rape kits in their evidence lockers. Underfunded and poorly staffed forensic labs have been partly responsible for the backlog, because processing a single rape kit typically costs between $1,000 and $1,500. Last year, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, along with the Department of Justice, awarded a total of nearly $80 million in grants to local jurisdictions across the country to eliminate rape-kit backlogs. (To provide the grants, the Manhattan district attorney used asset-forfeiture funds from settlements with international banks that had violated United States sanctions.)", "Another cause is police discretion: In most jurisdictions, investigators decide whether to forward a rape kit to the lab for processing. Officers may shelve the evidence because they think the case is unlikely to be taken up by the prosecutor. Many also mistakenly believe that DNA testing is useful only in identifying an unknown rapist. And yet acquaintance-rape cases with DNA evidence do better in court \u2014 not only are these cases more likely to be pursued by prosecutors, but they\u2019re also more likely to end in a successful conviction. Having that DNA in the database also often helps solve other cases, because many rapists are repeat offenders. (In a 2006 study, interviews with 41 serial rapists found that their first victims were younger siblings, neighborhood children, girlfriends, spouses; in other words, they started as acquaintance rapists.)", "A lack of leads led Cuddy to close both stranger-rape cases almost a year earlier, though they were subject to being reopened if any new evidence came in. And so it did \u2014 nearly three years after the first assault. The DNA had been matched to a man who was in prison for another, nonsexual offense.", "\u2018\u2018Yes!\u2019\u2019 Cuddy declared when she got off the phone with the state lab, after hearing about the Codis match.", "\u2018\u2018That\u2019s awesome!\u2019\u2019 Landisio said.", "\u2018\u2018That\u2019s some \u2018Law & Order\u2019 [expletive] right there,\u201d Formica added. When Segui came into the office, Cuddy told her the news. \u2018\u2018That deserves a drink,\u2019\u2019 the sergeant said.", "\u2018\u2018I think that deserves breast milk from the supervisor,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy replied. Segui tilted her head, smiling and looking at Cuddy the way you might at a particularly precocious and captivating child, then headed off to a meeting.", "\u2018\u2018So good, so good,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said emphatically, talking to herself, as she looked up the suspect\u2019s criminal record. \u2018\u2018Stranger rapes never get solved.\u2019\u2019 She stared at his mug shot for a minute: a slight, rabbity-looking man in his early 20s with an almost concave face. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the little [expletive].\u2019\u2019 Immediately, she made out the arrest warrant for each attack, handing them to Segui for review. Segui submitted them to court a week later. The suspect was due to be released from prison in November, so it seemed as if nothing could possibly go wrong. The man would be served with the warrant while he was still locked up; no other woman would be forced through that terrible ordeal.", "Victim No. 1 had dropped out of sight, but Cuddy phoned victim No. 2, the mother in her 40s. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m calling to let you know I received a Codis match, and I will be doing an arrest warrant for your attacker. As soon as I serve it, I will let you know.\u2019\u2019 There was a pause. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re welcome. Goodbye.\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said the victim started crying at the news. She turned to me, her face lit from the inside, and said, \u2018\u2018And that, my dear, is why I do this job.\u2019\u2019", "Across the country, in this city and that jurisdiction, improvements in sexual-assault investigation are slowly being made. Human Rights Watch recently released a report on four cities that had re-examined their approach to sex crimes and significantly improved their investigative practices \u2014 Austin, Tex.; Philadelphia; Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Kansas City, Mo. The highly regarded sex-crimes unit in San Diego (which Joanne Archambault supervised for 10 years) was used as a benchmark. In these cities, detectives are trained extensively in interviewing trauma victims, making suspects the focus of their investigations and dismantling their assumptions about \u2018\u2018real rape\u2019\u2019 and how a \u2018\u2018real victim\u2019\u2019 is supposed to respond. After being assigned to the Kansas City Special Victims Unit, detectives work with a senior member for three months under close supervision. In San Diego, new members of the sex-crimes unit not only receive 32 hours of training in topics related to sexual-assault investigation, but also have a two-week training pe\u00adriod with two detectives, and their first victim interviews are observed. These city police departments recognize that experience investigating homicides and other major crimes is not adequate preparation for rape cases.", "In most of these model cities, victims aren\u2019t interviewed in the bare-bones rooms used for suspects but in more comfortable ones, with couches, artwork and lamps. They\u2019re given handouts describing how the criminal-justice process works, how to apply for victims\u2019 compensation and information on victims\u2019 support groups. Austin and Grand Rapids have a blind reporting option that allows the victim to be anonymous but still give useful information to the detectives.", "All these police agencies have extensive reviews in place, so detectives aren\u2019t allowed to shelve a case without oversight. Philadelphia significantly revamped its sex-crimes unit after a 1999 Philadelphia Inquirer investigation revealed that the unit was misclassifying \u2014 basically burying \u2014 about a third of all complaints it received. Since then, an external oversight committee made up of experts in women\u2019s legal rights, children\u2019s advocates and staff members from rape-crisis centers has examined 300 to 400 cases annually, including all \u2018\u2018unfounded\u2019\u2019 rape reports.", "In these units, detectives and victims stay in contact. The No. 1 complaint of sexual-assault survivors, according to Archambault, is that law enforcement doesn\u2019t keep them up to date on the status of their investigations; often detectives don\u2019t even return victims\u2019 phone calls. Yet keeping in touch with the victims is espe\u00adcially important in the case of sexual assault, she says, \u2018\u2018because there are so few good outcomes.\u2019\u2019 Denied justice, victims especially need to feel respected by law enforcement. But the reason that it\u2019s crucial to stay in contact with the victims is the same reason that detectives often don\u2019t \u2014 they hate being the bearers of bad news. As noted in the policy and training guidelines published in 2015 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police: \u2018\u2018Virtually all sexual-assault victims want validation from the authorities that the crime occurred, and this may be a more critical element of a successful response and investigation than a criminal prosecution or conviction. Regardless of the investigative results, responding officers and investigators have the power to help a person heal from sexual assault.\u2019\u2019", "Many educators and leaders in this field say that arrest rates are not the best indicators of success. Instead, the thoroughness of the investigation and whether the victim stays in the process are more useful. Crime numbers are also not a good indicator of successful policing, unless you\u2019re willing to use what feels like reverse logic: Better, more responsive policing means more victims come forward. And more honest record-keeping means more of those assaults are counted.", "New Haven\u2019s sexual-assault unit adheres to only some of these best practices. Cases involving minors are reviewed twice a month by a multi\u00addisciplinary team that includes representatives from local police departments, the Department of Children and Families, the Yale Child Abuse Clinic and the Clifford Beers Clinic, a mental-health facility that serves children and their families in the greater New Haven area. But cases involving adult victims are reviewed \u2018\u2018in house\u2019\u2019 by Segui. The unit has been short-staffed, though according to an assistant chief, Archie Generoso, the department plans to add three detectives to the S.V.U. by early March. What makes the New Haven S.V.U. effective is the mentality and the dedication of the detectives who want to be there. You can teach technique and locate resources, but attitudes are harder to change. Cuddy and Landisio each had friends who were abused as children or raped as young adults. They didn\u2019t start from a place of suspicion and denial, as so many law-enforcement officers do.", "In the spring, Cuddy and Landisio stored their portable heaters back under their desks. They started doing push-ups and squats every hour on the hour in the small space, so Cuddy could get in shape for a coming vacation with her wife in Mexico. They went on a Paleo diet. They were both at their desks after one of their mini workout sessions, typing up reports, when Cuddy received a call about her Codis cases.", "The assistant state\u2019s attorney had decided that the office was going to, in his words, \u2018\u2018wait\u2019\u2019 on the warrant regarding the prostitute\u2019s rape, because there was semen from multiple men on the vaginal swab. Cuddy was furious. \u2018\u2018The guy is a serial rapist,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And obviously, there\u2019s a mix \u2014 she\u2019s a prostitute.\u2019\u2019 And although there was a mix of DNA on the vaginal swab, only the suspect\u2019s DNA was found on the swab taken from the woman\u2019s mouth.", "The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had also requested an additional piece of information for the other warrant. Now that it had a suspect, the court wanted Cuddy to ask the second victim whether she knew the man or ever had a sexual relationship with him. Cuddy had no choice but to make that call, and later that day she typed two additional sentences into the warrant application saying the victim did not know the suspect and never had sex with him before the rape. She looked angry and tired, and Landisio kept casting worried glances her way.", "There were dark moments at the S.V.U., and this was one of them; they moved in fast and sucked the light out of the room. And then you saw how much sense it would make to chuck everything \u2014 the sobbing mothers, the kids and the women muscling their way through their statements, every word like a nail in their mouths.", "That afternoon, a fresh-faced intern, a criminal-justice major from the University of New Haven, popped into the office. \u2018\u2018The copy machine\u2019s not working again,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018It says it needs resources. It has paper, it has toner, what resources does it want?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018It wants your soul,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy told her. \u2018\u2018Just slip it in the slot. We all have.\u2019\u2019 There was a beat of silence, then Landisio, the intern, Natale and Formica (who had ducked into the office to see why it was so weirdly quiet) broke into laughter. Cuddy lowered her sharp little chin and, glancing coyly at them all, flashed a grin.", "This is what they lived on, what drove them forward \u2014 a sense of justice, of course, but that justice was so infrequent, so arbitrary, that their fuel had to be camaraderie and humor. They carried one another, quite literally in one case \u2014 Landisio hauling Cuddy into her apartment on his back after a night of drinking on the anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Once, when I asked them what the toughest part of their job was, they didn\u2019t say mucking through the ugliness of these cases every day; they didn\u2019t mention their huge workload. They said it was waiting for the court to approve their arrest warrants. The average delay, Cuddy said, was three months. One case that I watched them pursue took 10. Victims gave up. \u2018\u2018I just had a victim drop out of a case last week,\u2019\u2019 Landisio told me at one point. \u2018\u2018She said to me, \u2018I didn\u2019t think it would take so long.\u2019 She said she was over it now and just wanted to move on.\u2019\u2019 Months crawled by, and suspects disappeared.", "By spring, Natale got her wish and was transferred to Major Crimes. Detective Shayna Kendall, from their old crew, got her wish and returned. She moved her desk into Cuddy and Landisio\u2019s office, and you could feel the unit picking up cohesion, efficiency, speed. (By the fall, Detective Lenny Soto would also be returned to the unit, and he, too, would move his desk inside that tiny office, so the four detectives were almost joined at the hip.) A week after Kendall\u2019s return, she had 17 cases, some carried over from when she was still in the squad, cases waiting at court for arrest warrants, as well as new ones assigned by Segui. Cuddy had 22. Landisio, working 21 cases, including a sex-trafficking case he was investigating with the F.B.I., said he felt as if he were \u2018\u2018juggling cannon balls.\u2019\u2019 Segui apologized, saying she tried to hold back those that weren\u2019t as urgent, but Cuddy said, \u2018\u2018Just [expletive] assign them. We\u2019ll prioritize and do what we have to do.\u2019\u2019", "When Cuddy finally received her arrest warrant for the Codis case, it was six months after her first request, and three months after she was asked to add the follow-up sentences. The inspector at the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office called her with the news, and she reminded him that the suspect was in prison, so the court would serve the warrant. Shortly afterward, the inspector emailed her. When she read the email, she was livid. The suspect was released early \u2014 a month prior, in fact. \u2018\u2018They sat on a Codis case for what? Six months?\u2019\u2019 she said, spitting out the words. \u2018\u2018He\u2019s gonna be in a homeless shelter. I\u2019m never gonna find this guy \u2014 if he\u2019s not already in Mexico.\u2019\u2019 He had been released without parole, so there was no parole officer to contact and no forwarding address.", "She, Kendall and Landisio began searching databases, trying to find some whiff of him, while Cuddy muttered to herself: \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t get frustrated. Just do all this [expletive]. Do it for nothing.\u2019\u2019 Then Kendall hit on something \u2014 their suspect was stopped by the police three days earlier, and when they asked where he lived, he gave them his sister\u2019s address. Within minutes, the three detectives, Sergeant Segui and Officer Formica were piled into two cars, heading to the address. The suspect\u2019s two sisters were in the second-floor apartment of a multifamily house. Once the detectives were let in to search the premises, Cuddy found a bedroom that was locked. After shouting \u2018\u2018Police!\u2019\u2019 to no response, she kicked the door in while the sisters screamed at her in Spanish. But no one was inside. The sisters said they hadn\u2019t seen their brother since he was locked up over a year ago.", "On the ride back to the stationhouse, as the detectives recounted the raid, the adrenaline seeped from the car like boiling water from a pot going dry. Cuddy didn\u2019t believe the sisters; in a way, she didn\u2019t want to. But the next day, she found out that her suspect was, indeed, gone for good. He had been deported back to Mexico. \u2018\u2018And these guys never stop,\u2019\u2019 Cuddy said.", "Over the next 24 hours, her anger died away, morphing into a kind of grim fatalism. She had done everything right, the victims had soldiered through the investigation, submitting to the forensic exam, recounting the attack for the record. They had actually nailed the guy, and now he was gone. Cuddy stared bleakly at the pile of case files on her desk, making no move to open them. Finally she let out a sigh. She had to inform her victim now. The woman had cried with relief when she learned they had identified her rapist. Cuddy decided she had to do it in person. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll come with you when you do it,\u2019\u2019 Landisio said. Cuddy looked at him and nodded. Then she turned to her newest case file."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/dining/mississippi-roast.html": ["Fifteen or so years ago, by her recollection, a woman named Robin Chapman made a pot roast in her slow cooker.

Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military. You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war. When that war began, we had 8,000 planes. Today, we have about 4,000. When that war began, we had 529 ships. Today, we have 272.", "You want to know what carpet bombing is? It\u2019s what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy. Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day. He\u2019s not arming the Kurds. We need to define the enemy. We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy. And we need to be focused and lift the rules of engagement so we\u2019re not sending our fighting men and women into combat with their arms tied behind their backs.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz\u2019s record match his rhetoric?", "RUBIO: Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending. And I think that\u2019s a bad idea for the following reason.", "ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries. ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides. ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq \u2014 not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said \u2014 mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time \u2014 the city of Dabiq in Syria. They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.RUBIO: This group needs to be confronted and defeated. They are not going to go away on their own. They\u2019re not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes. They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.", "Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history. You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that\u2019s being diminished. When I\u2019m president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.", "(CROSSTALK)", "WALLACE: Senator Cruz, you\u2019ve got 30 seconds. You were mentioned.", "(APPLAUSE)", "CRUZ: Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama. Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.", "What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.

Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?", "CHRISTIE: Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe. Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.

They should have made it more open ended for the next president. We shouldn\u2019t have the war fighters have their arms tied behind their back as President Obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn\u2019t popular at the time. It became popular after the attack in Paris, and San Bernardino. Now we hear the tough talk.", "Prior to that, in the Reagan Library, I gave a detailed plan. Exactly what to do as it relates to ISIS. And it is from the lessons from history that we do this because if we allow this to fester, we\u2019re going to have Islamic terrorism, multi-generations of it all across this country. The caliphate of ISIS has to be destroyed, which means we need to arm directly to Kurds, imbed our troops with the Iraqi military, re engage with the Sunni tribal leaders.

Doesn\u2019t your position run afoul of the First Amendment?", "RUBIO: Megyn, that\u2019s the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It\u2019s hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino.", "Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times.", "He told the police, \u201cI did it because I was inspired by ISIS,\u201d and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.", "Look, the threat we face from ISIS is unprecedented.

And this is where I\u2019ve had my disagreement with Senator Rubio.", "When he brought forward the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill to give citizenship to those who came here illegally, I put forward an amendment that says we should have more scrutiny on those who are coming as students, those who are coming as immigrants, those who are coming as refugees, because we had two refugees come to my town in Bowling Green and try to attack us.", "Marco opposed this because they made a deal. He made a deal with Chuck Schumer that he would oppose any conservative amendments. And I think that\u2019s a mistake, and I just don\u2019t think Marco can have it both ways.

I...", "KELLY: ... profiling. Profiling. In December, two radical Muslims killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Neighbors of the terrorists said that they did not report the couple to law enforcement prior to the crime, because they were afraid that they would be accused of profiling.", "Now, you have said that we should not profile. How do you square that with the San Bernardino case?", "CHRISTIE: Well, because you can do it without profiling, Megyn, when you do it on the facts. What those facts knew was that these folks had weapons. They knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it.", "That\u2019s not profiling, that\u2019s law enforcement. And that\u2019s the difference between somebody who knows how to do this and somebody who\u2019s never done it before.", "KELLY: They didn\u2019t know they were going to attack the country.", "CHRISTIE: They knew they were talking about the issues of attacking people, Megyn. They knew that.", "(CROSSTALK)", "KELLY: That\u2019s not true. The neighbors said they saw men going in and out of the garage. They saw packages being delivered. They saw Muslims, and they did not think that was enough to call the cops. Do you?", "CHRISTIE: Listen, I think that what people should do is use their common sense. And the fact is, let law enforcement make those decisions. I\u2019ve told people that from the time I was U.S. attorney 13 years ago.", "It\u2019s not for them to make those decisions about whether or not something is legal or illegal, or profiling or not. You see something that\u2019s suspicious, you call law enforcement and let law enforcement make those decisions.", "That\u2019s what should be done. That can be done. That can be done without profiling people. What that is, is just common sense. They thought something was wrong.", "And here\u2019s the problem in this country right now. The problem is that Barack Obama has made law enforcement the enemy, Hillary Clinton has made law enforcement the enemy.", "They\u2019re not supporting our law enforcement officers, it\u2019s making everybody nervous to get out of their cars, if you\u2019re a law enforcement officer.

Given what she perceives as a rise in Islamaphobia in this country. Do you think the GOP messaging on Muslims has stoked the flames of bias on this as the Democrats suggest, and how would you answer this veteran?", "CARSON: Well, I don\u2019t know about the GOP messaging, but I can tell you about my messaging. You know, need to stop allowing political correctness to dictate our policies, because it\u2019s going to kill us if we don\u2019t.", "(APPLAUSE)", "CARSON: And in the Holy Land Foundation trial in 2006 in Texas, they had a memorandum, an explanatory memorandum that talked about the fact that Americans would be easy to overcome and to commit civilization jihad because they were going to be trying to protect the rights of the very people who were trying to subvert them.", "But I believe in the Teddy Roosevelt philosophy. Teddy Roosevelt said, we are a nation of immigrants. As such, everybody is welcome from any race, any country, any religion, if they want to be Americans. If they want to accept our values and our laws. If not, they can stay where they are.", "(APPLAUSE)", "KELLY: Governor Kasich, stand back. You appear to back in another debate, a so-called back door to encrypted cell phone technology, which protects most smartphones that we all have from hacking. And it includes our phones and it also protects the cell phones of the terrorist.", "Now the tech companies and a group of MIT scientists, smart guys, right, warn that if they create a way for the FBI to have a back door into our encrypted communications, then the bad guys will exploit it too. And they say that this is going to cause more security problems than it would solve for everyday Americans. Are they wrong?", "KASICH: Well, look the Joint Terrorism Task Force needs resources and tools. And those are made up of the FBI, state and local law enforcement. And Megyn, it\u2019s best not to talk anymore about back doors and encryption, it will get solved, but it needs to be solved in the situation of the White House with the technology folks.", "MEGYN: But this is public testimony.", "KASICH: But I just have to tell you that it\u2019s best with some of these things not be said. Now I want to go back something. See, I was there when Reagan rebuilt the military. I was there in \u201989 when the wall came tumbling down because we were strong.", "And I was there when we went into the Gulf War. We didn\u2019t win that war just from the air, we won that war by assembling a group of Arab leaders who stood in the Rose Garden and stood with America. We want to destroy ISIS, it has to be in the air and on the ground. It has to be with our friends in the Arab world and our friends in Europe, the coalition that we had when we went to the first Gulf War.", "And then when we win that, and we will win that against ISIS as it settles down, and we should leave. Because we shouldn\u2019t be policemen of the world. But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.KASICH: But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there\u2019s an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks. So we have a unique opportunity to bring everybody together.", "I saw Reagan do it, I\u2019ve seen other presidents do it. And frankly, if you want to be commander in chief, you have to have the experience. At the same time we\u2019re doing all that, the Pentagon must be reformed so we get what we need for our men and women in uniform. All of that together, we\u2019re going to be just fine and America is going to continue to lead the world.", "KELLY: Governor, thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: Governor Bush, just today, a wounded warrior organization designed to help wounded veterans and their families is coming under fire for raising tens of millions of dollars, but spending almost half of that on travel and hotels and dinners and luxury, lavish conferences. So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.", "If you were president. would you police these charity organizations that say they\u2019re helping vets?", "BUSH: Of course. And there\u2019s all sorts of ways that can be done at the state, local and federal level to do that. But the first duty of the next president of the United States is to fix the mess at the Department of Veterans Affairs. That\u2019s his first responsibility.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Look, we have waiting lists for veterans that are \u2014 that are leaving because of the sequester where we\u2019re gutting the military. More and more military personnel are leaving becoming veterans, and the waiting list grows. They\u2019ve given out $140 million of bonuses to Veterans Department employees, including reducing the waiting lists, without giving veterans care. People died, and only three people have been fired.", "I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we\u2019ll give veterans a choice card so that they don\u2019t have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider. You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them \u2014 give veterans choices and you\u2019ll get a much better result. And as it relates to all the other organizations, let me give you a good example.", "In Houston, Texas, there\u2019s an organization in place because someone acted on their heart, wanted to make sure that there\u2019s no homeless veterans in Houston. And they\u2019ve come pretty close to that without federal government assistance. We need to mobilize the entire country to treat our veterans and treat them with much more respect than they get today.", "BAIER: Governor Bush, thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Speaking of veterans, we have a question from a veteran who is one of the top Youtube creators.

Why aren\u2019t we using the technology available to better protect our communities?", "BAIER: Senator Paul, that question to you.", "PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve supported legislation to allow body cameras. I\u2019ve been to Ferguson, I\u2019ve been trying to look for solutions to our criminal justice problem.", "One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines. People were just being fined to death. Now you and I and many of the people in this audience, if we get a $100 fine, we can survive it. If you\u2019re living on the edge of poverty and you get a $100 fine or your car towed, a lot of times you lose your job.", "I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don\u2019t unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males.", "In Ferguson, for every 100 African-American women, there are only 60 African-American men. Drug use is about equal between white and black, but our prisons \u2014 three out of four people in prison are black or brown. I think something has to change.

But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.", "So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don\u2019t have health insurance? And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?", "CRUZ: Sure. Well, let\u2019s take it one at a time. First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.

Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.", "If I\u2019m elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE)", "CRUZ: Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform. It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.", "Three specific reforms that reflect those principles. Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines. That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.", "Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs. And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.", "And I\u2019ll tell you, Bret, I think that\u2019s a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: Senator Cruz, thank you.", "Governor Bush, you\u2019ve advocated for statehood for Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden. Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed. So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?", "BUSH: No, they shouldn\u2019t. And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination. If I was a Puerto Rican, I\u2019d vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship. They serve in the military. They would have to pay federal taxes. They would \u2014 they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship. But they should have the right of determine \u2014 self-determination.", "Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando.", "And a lot of people are doing that. And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms. The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not \u2014 the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won\u2019t be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they\u2019re facing right now.", "BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019re one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race. Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire \u2014 he and his administration \u2014 for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it. How would you have handled that?", "KASICH: Well, you\u2019ve got to be on top of it right away. And, you know, I don\u2019t know all the details of what Rick Snyder has done. I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable. But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that.", "And I\u2019ve had many situations in the state of Ohio where we\u2019ve had to move, whether it\u2019s storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting. There are many crises that come \u2014 a water crisis in Toledo. You\u2019ve got to be on top of it. You\u2019ve got to go the extra mile. You\u2019ve got to work with local communities and you\u2019ve got to work with the federal government.", "Because you realize that people depending on you. And so, you go the extra mile. But people have to be alert. They have to be alert to problems. And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it. And people at home are saying they\u2019ve got a problem, listen to them. Because most of the time, they\u2019re absolutely correct.", "So the fact is that we work for the people. The people don\u2019t work for us. And we have to have an attitude when we\u2019re in government of serving-hood. That\u2019s what really matters. We serve you. You don\u2019t serve us. We listen to you and \u2014 and then we act.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: Senator Rubio, on the issue of climate change, in 2008, you wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap- and-trade system, a program for carbon emissions, which many Republicans thought at the time would hurt the Florida economy. Now, you\u2019re a skeptic of climate change science. And in fact, you warn that federal efforts to fight climate change will cost U.S. jobs and hurt the U.S. economy.", "So why the change?", "RUBIO: Well, Bret, first that\u2019s not entirely the story. At the time, the liberal governor of Florida, who claimed he was a Republican \u2014 his name was Charlie Crist \u2014 he wanted to impose cap-and-trade on Florida. And I opposed it. I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.", "And then we saw that the leading candidates for president at the time, both the Republican and the Democrats, all supported it. And what we said is, if they\u2019re going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it. But I have never supported cap- and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time.", "And I do not believe it\u2019s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.", "When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: Thanks, Senator.", "KELLY: All right. We\u2019re going to move on. Because coming up, immigration, and something you\u2019ve never seen before.", "Stay tuned, right after this break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "KELLY: Welcome back everyone. Live, in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, we move onto the topic of immigration. Senator Rubio, we\u2019ll start with you.

Here are just a few examples. Watch.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "RUBIO: Never support.

It\u2019s what they call it. And, the reality of it is this, it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "RUBIO: You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that\u2019s wrong for our country, bad for our future.", "(END VIDEO CLIP)", "KELLY: Within two years of getting elected you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven\u2019t you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?", "RUBIO: No, because if you look at the quote, and it\u2019s very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty...", "KELLY: ... But, you went on from there...", "RUBIO: ... I do not support amnesty...", "KELLY: ... You said more than that, Senator...", "RUBIO: ... No, I said I do not support blanket amnesty...", "KELLY: ... You said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. You...", "RUBIO: ... It was...", "KELLY: ... supported earned path to citizenship...", "RUBIO: ... It absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.", "What I\u2019ve always said is that this issue does need to be solved. They\u2019ve been talking about this issue for 30 years, and nothing ever happens.

If we don\u2019t know who you are, or why you\u2019re coming, you will not get into the United States.RUBIO: Number two, we\u2019re going to enforce our immigration laws. I am the son and grandson of immigrants. And I know that securing our borders is not anti-immigrant and we will do it.", "We\u2019ll hire 20,000 new border agents instead of 20,000 new IRS agents. We will finish the 700 miles of fencing and walls our nation needs. We\u2019ll have mandatory E-verify, a mandatory entry/exit tracking system and until all of that is in place and all of that is working and we can prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control, nothing else is going to happen.", "We are not going to round up and deport 12 million people, but we\u2019re not going to hand out citizenship cards, either. There will be a process. We will see what the American people are willing to support. But it will not be unconstitutional executive orders like the ones Barack Obama has forced on us.", "KELLY: Governor Bush, do you agree Senator Rubio has not reversed himself on his immigration promise?", "BUSH: Well, I\u2019m kind of confused because he was the sponsor of the Gang of Eight bill that did require a bunch of thresholds but ultimately allowed for citizenship over an extended period of time. I mean, that\u2019s a fact. And he asked me to support that. And I \u2014 I supported him because I think people, when you\u2019re elected, you need to do things.", "And he led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years.

You can get it at $2.99 on Amazon. It\u2019s not a bestseller. I can promise you.", "(LAUGHTER)", "There won\u2019t be any \u2014 you can get it. It\u2019s affordable for everybody. We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you\u2019re not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.", "(APPLAUSE) I think that is the \u2014 I think that\u2019s the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.", "RUBIO: May I respond?", "KELLY: Go ahead, senator.", "RUBIO: It\u2019s interesting that Jeb mentions the book. That\u2019s the book where you changed your position on immigration because you used to support a path to citizenship.", "BUSH: So did you.", "(LAUGHTER)", "RUBIO: Well, but you changed the \u2014 in the book...", "BUSH: Yeah. So did you, Marco.", "(APPLAUSE)", "RUBIO: You wrote a book where you changed your position from a path of citizenship to a path of legalization. And the bottom line is this, we are not going to be able to do anything on this issue until we first bring illegal immigration under control. The American people have been told for 30 years they\u2019re going to enforce the border, they\u2019re going to build a wall and it never gets built and it never happens.", "It is very clear there will be no progress on this issue in any way, shape or form, until you prove to the people of this country that illegal immigration is under control.

I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.", "And when you led the charge with the Gang of Eight, I supported it because you asked me to.

He cut and run. And that\u2019s a tragedy because now...", "(BELL RINGS)", "... it\u2019s harder and harder to actually solve this problem.", "KELLY: All right. This will be the last one.", "RUBIO: There\u2019s not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws. That is abundantly clear. You\u2019re not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach. The only way we\u2019re are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.

Yes, it would.", "Pressed last month on why you supported legalization, you claimed that you didn\u2019t. Right? Like you just did. Saw that.", "(LAUGHTER)", "You argued that this was just a poison pill amendment, basically it\u2019s something designed to kill the bill and not actually get it through. But that is not, however, how it sounded at the time. Watch.", "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)", "CRUZ: I want this bill to be voted down. I don\u2019t want immigration reform to fail.

That would fix the problem, and also allow, for those 11 million people who are here illegally, a legal status, with citizenship off the table.", "KELLY: Was that all an act? It was pretty convincing.", "CRUZ: You know, the amendment you\u2019re talking about is one sentence \u2014 it\u2019s 38 words. Anyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn\u2019t say a word about legalization. I introduced...", "KELLY: But the bill allowed both.

TIME magazine once called you \u201cthe Republican savior.\u201d Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.", "But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you\u2019re in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points. If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?", "RUBIO: Well, let me be clear about one thing, there\u2019s only one savior and it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.", "(APPLAUSE)", "RUBIO: And so \u2014 and I\u2019ve always made that clear about that cover story.", "As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you\u2019re going to go to a caucus site and you\u2019ll be the first Americans that vote in this election. You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?", "And let me tell you what the answer better not be. It better not be Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.", "(LAUGHTER)", "We don\u2019t want to be Sweden. We want to be the United States of America.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States. In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...", "(LAUGHTER)", "Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server. And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi. And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: Thank you, Senator.", "WALLACE: Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the \u201cBridge-gate\u201d case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.", "Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal. Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?", "CHRISTIE: Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing. And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible. And that\u2019s what you expect from a leader.CHRISTIE: And, I\u2019ll tell you something else. I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation. And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey\u2019s had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve put conservative policies in place.", "And, I\u2019ll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me? Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they\u2019re going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September. And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.", "I will be ready. I will take her on, and when I take her on I guarantee you one thing, she will never get within 10 miles of the White House.

Chris?", "WALLACE: Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.", "Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith. In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he\u2019s going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.", "Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you\u2019re getting in and he isn\u2019t?(LAUGHTER)", "KASICH: No. You know, Chris, here\u2019s what happened with Medicaid in my state. We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we \u2014 we innovated the government.", "And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home. And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money \u2014 I mean, Washington doesn\u2019t have any money. It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don\u2019t think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they\u2019re not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don\u2019t live in emergency rooms.", "How has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. That\u2019s basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director. The mentally ill? They\u2019ve been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.", "In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance. But I\u2019m not deciding that anybody\u2019s got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do. But what \u2014 I will tell you this. The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Because we don\u2019t want them in and out \u2014 we don\u2019t want them in and out of the prisons. Give people a chance. We talked about criminal justice reform. We\u2019ve enacted it in our state. Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America. Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.", "And that is what we have done in Ohio. We\u2019re running surpluses. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. And guess what? The formula is working. I\u2019d suggest people take a look at it.", "Thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer. A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.", "Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience. But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.", "CHRISTIE: No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed. And that someone in that office has to do their job. So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn\u2019t violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.", "I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it. But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it. And so if there\u2019s someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that\u2019s what we should do.", "But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said. You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith. And here\u2019s the problem with what\u2019s going on around the world. The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us \u2014 every one of us. And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.", "They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do. They do not want us to exercise religious liberty. That\u2019s why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls. As a Catholic, that\u2019s what I want to do. And no matter what your faith is, that\u2019s what I want you to be able to do.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Thank you, sir.", "Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama\u2019s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. He said you\u2019re wrong on the facts and you can\u2019t, quote, \u201cslime your way to the White House.\u201d I assume in the last two weeks, you\u2019ve done some fact-checking. Do you want to take anything back?", "RUBIO: Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we\u2019ll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves. But you\u2019ve just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country. And I think this is an important question. I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don\u2019t understand our history. You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world \u2014 no, the most generous people in the world? Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?", "It is not because of the tax writeoff. It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor. This is what\u2019s made our nation so special.", "And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith. Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures. And when I\u2019m president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I\u2019ll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.RUBIO: Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Thank you, senator.", "Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn\u2019t get into politics to fight about abortion. You said you were more concerned about the national debt. Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.", "Does that mean that if a liberal state, let\u2019s say, wants to make abortion legal, that you\u2019re okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?", "PAUL: You know, I think abortion is always wrong. I\u2019ve supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal. In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.", "But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue \u2014 requires a virtuous people. In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.", "Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint. There\u2019s a lot packed into that statement. But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation. The government is not always going to save us and it\u2019s not always going to come from government.", "But if we don\u2019t know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way. I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.", "WALLLACE: Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific...", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question. Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states\u2019 rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that\u2019s their choice? Yes or no?", "PAUL: Both. No, both the federal and a state approach. I have said that we could leave it to the states but I\u2019ve also introduced a federal solution as well. So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.", "But I\u2019ve also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states. So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade \u2014 Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue. If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again.", "I think it would be better the more \u2014 the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives.", "WALLACE: Thank you, sir.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: Gentlemen.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.", "Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia\u2019s actions inside Ukraine. Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia. Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article IV, an attack on one is an attack on all. What do you do?", "CARSON: Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he\u2019s a bully, and we have to face him down. And I would \u2014 first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region. I think we need to put in some armored brigades there. We only have one or two. We need much more than that. We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania. They\u2019re terrified by the saber rattling. I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.", "I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country: oil and energy. And we ought to fight them on that level.", "We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping him contained. So, yes, I\u2019d absolutely would go in if he attacked. I think on Article IV of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BAIER: Gentlemen, you\u2019ve all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.", "Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who\u2019ve said you would tear it up on day one. But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars \u2014 tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.", "The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal. So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran. So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?", "RUBIO: Well, let me first describe Iran because they\u2019re not just a normal nation state. And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people. But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future. RUBIO: He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims \u2014 all Shia Muslims on the planet. And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.", "That is why they\u2019re building an \u2014 right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there\u2019s going \u2014 they\u2019re going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.", "We will \u2014 when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice. They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they\u2019re going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.", "BAIER: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said that Marco Rubio is wrong...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.", "KASICH: Look, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in ten months. And if I were president of the United States right now, I\u2019d be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are \u2014 violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.", "We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it\u2019s not gonna be anywhere near as effective. But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.", "And I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m worried about \u2014 I\u2019m worried about money. You read about all the companies now that are doing business \u2014 about to do business in Iran, and if we don\u2019t get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we\u2019re the only ones putting the sanctions on.", "We need to move aggressively now. But I would say this to you, Bret. Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them. And number two, if we find out they\u2019re developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we\u2019re gonna go take it out. That is what we have to do. We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.", "BAIER: But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.", "KASICH: That\u2019s right. Yes.", "BAIER: And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.", "KASICH: I know, Bret.", "BAIER: They don\u2019t want...", "KASICH: But Bret, here\u2019s the problem. You take a look at the \u2014 at Belgium. I talked to a diplomat from Belgium. I said, \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d He said, \u201cwe have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we\u2019d ever see it.\u201d", "See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together. The Turks are being threatened. We know about the French. We know about the Belgians. We know about the Brits. Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.", "So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...", "(BELL RINGS)", "... and say there is something more important than money. It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren. That\u2019s the kind of leadership this country needs. It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.", "And that\u2019s only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.", "BAIER: Governor, thank you. Governor Christie...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... Libya is the newest base for ISIS. Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.", "So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?", "CHRISTIE: Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.", "In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, \u201cwhat is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?\u201d Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong. If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.", "Here\u2019s what I\u2019d do. This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS. We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.", "As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.", "BAIER: Thank you, Governor.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: We\u2019re not finished yet.

Megyn?", "KELLY: Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton\u2019s history with women is fair game in this campaign. How do you answer those who say you don\u2019t hold the sins of the husband against the wife?", "PAUL: You know, I\u2019ve never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question. I don\u2019t blame Hillary Clinton at all for this. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s responsible for his behavior. But I do think that her position as promoting women\u2019s rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired. They would never be hired again.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community. And the thing is, she can\u2019t be a champion of women\u2019s rights at the same time she\u2019s got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior. So it is difficult.", "KELLY: Of her husband\u2019s?", "PAUL: Yeah. But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they\u2019ve taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: We have another question from one of Youtube\u2019s top creators. Here it is.", "QUESTION: I\u2019m Nabela Noor. I\u2019m a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.", "In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I\u2019ve seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims. This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.", "As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?", "WALLACE: Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?", "BUSH: Well first of all, I think it\u2019s important that when we\u2019re running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we\u2019re living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.", "Donald Trump, for example \u2014 I\u2019m glad \u2014 I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him... (LAUGHTER)", "BUSH: ... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people\u2019s fears that we should ban all Muslims. Well, that creates an environment that\u2019s toxic in our own country. Nobela (ph) is a rising entrepreneur. She wants to pursue the American dream. She\u2019s an American citizen. She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship. She\u2019s not the threat. The threat is Islamic terrorism.", "We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS. We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate. We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there. You can\u2019t do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they\u2019re as threatened as we are.", "So, I think it\u2019s important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I\u2019ve been critical of Donald Trump. Disparaging women, disparaging hispanics, that\u2019s not a sign of strength. Making fun of disabled people...", "(BELL RINGING)", "BUSH: ... We\u2019re never going to win elections if we don\u2019t have a more broader unifying message.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Governor, thank you. Senator Cruz, change of subject. You called for an end to the renewable fuel standards which mandate that refineries blend biofuels, including ethanol into gasoline. As you well know, ethanol\u2019s a big industry in this state, $10 billion dollars a year.", "Last week, Terry Branstad, the popular Governor of Iowa...", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: ... Who is in the hall tonight, said that you\u2019re bankrolled by big oil, and that Iowa voters would be making a mistake supporting you. Why should those voters side with you over the six- term governor of the state, sir?", "CRUZ: Well, Chris, I\u2019m glad to discuss my views on ethanol and energy. I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above. We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels. But, I don\u2019t believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers. And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.", "(APPLAUSE)", "CRUZ: And, indeed, my tax plan that I\u2019ve introduced, it\u2019s available on our website. It\u2019s a simple flat tax for everyone. It\u2019ll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there\u2019s no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.", "Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol. It\u2019s not true. I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.", "And, I would not that there\u2019s a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that\u2019s the EPA\u2019s blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline. I will...", "(BELL RINGING)", "CRUZ: ... Tear down the EPA\u2019s blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates. All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace. And, I\u2019ll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa\u2019s Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign. Because he understands that I\u2019m committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Dr. Carson, I\u2019d like to ask you about exactly that issue. Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question. Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?", "CARSON: Well, as anyone knows who\u2019s been listening to me, you know? I\u2019m very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know? We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations. If you stack that up it would be a three-story building. This is absolutely absurd. And, they\u2019ve insinuated themselves into everything.", "Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it\u2019s probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money. People have invested a lot of energy into that.", "But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be talking for new sources of energy. Seventy percent of our population lives by costly (ph). What about hydroelectric power? We can develop that, you know? We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin \u2014 put him back in his little box where he belongs.CARSON: Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing. And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.", "And we can get a lot of them out if we get the government out of our lives.", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Doctor, thank you.", "BAIER: Coming up, closing statements from the candidates as our debate continues, live, from Des Moines, Iowa.", "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)", "KELLY: Welcome back, everybody.

The prophetically titled exhibition gathers together the most futuristic work of the Houstonian\u2019s artist circle, which includes Chris Bexar, Paul Kremer, El Franco Lee II and Susie Rosmarin. Billed as a group show governed by a common interest in digital printing, it celebrates years of fruitful friendship both in and out of the studio \u2014 and the informal layout, which includes a mattress floor and plywood fortresses, is more reminiscent of a clubhouse than an exhibition. \u201cI get the idea and the title for a show at the same time,\u201d explains Flood, who has been collecting his peers\u2019 work for decades. \u201cI don\u2019t think the future is going to look like a James Bond movie; I think it will be some shelter where everyone sits on the floor surrounded by art.\u201d Here, a look at Flood\u2019s brave new world.", "Houston\u2019s iconic skyline comes to mind when looking at the artist Chris Bexar\u2019s works \u2014 but appearances can be deceiving. \u201cThat\u2019s a heat sink; it\u2019s the computer\u2019s radiator,\u201d says Bexar, pointing at one of his blurred images. \u201cIt has a nice form; it reminds me of Modernist German architecture.\u201d A former member of I Love You Baby, a painting collective, Bexar worked alongside Flood on a series of projects. \u201cChris\u2019s work is really the most futuristic of the bunch, but he\u2019s been doing this for years,\u201d Flood says.", "The painter El Franco Lee II\u2019s digital prints hang across one wall of the gallery with stacked, plastic-wrapped multiples on the floor beneath. \u201cI woke up one morning and realized I could put El Franco Lee II in the show because he printed all those multiples,\u201d Flood says with a smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d let me hang them the way I wanted to, but I think the digitized prints play even in plastic wrap. They fit in with the others.\u201d A painter whose work balances the jazz of Archibald Motley\u2019s frenetic scenes and the childlike hand of Henry Taylor, the reserved El Franco Lee II\u2019s work stands out for its more traditional artistic language. \u201cI was worried they wouldn\u2019t convey his art, but they absolutely do,\u201d Flood says.", "\u201cI\u2019ve been a Susie fanatic for decades. I probably own more Susie than Susie does,\u201d Flood says. He beams when speaking about his longtime friend Rosmarin, whose digitally inspired and printed paintings feature prominently in the exhibition. Working backward from painted images, Rosmarin zooms in and blows up her individual pigments into a colorful oblivion. \u201cI love that computers have led me back to painting,\u201d says Rosmarin in front of one her gridded pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s like evolution in reverse.\u201d", "Paul Kremer\u2019s paintings, some of which are based on Google searches, echo the digitized vocabulary of his fellow Houstonians. \u201cHe is so computer-savvy, he did Lou Reed\u2019s website,\u201d says Flood of Kremer. \u201cI hooked him up with Susie, and they just went crazy. The clicked immediately.\u201d Kremer\u2019s Google search prints are contrasted in the show with his abstract paintings, which demonstrate a more hands-on form of artistry. These simple geometric compositions add a breath of minimalism to the otherwise maximalist display. Rosmarin echoes her collaborator\u2019s claims: \u201cPaul can do anything, but I really love the work he is making now.\u201d", "The exhibition also features several pieces of Flood\u2019s own work. Notably, a painting that spells out \u201cYOLO,\u201d a piece from Flood\u2019s recent \u201cLOL\u201d series, adds a tongue-in-cheek lightness to the show. When questioned about their gregarious leader, the participating artists recall funny encounters and long-held friendships. \u201cMark is always putting people together,\u201d Rosmarin says. The dark-humored Flood seems equally surprised by the natural chemistry of the show: \u201cIt all happened in the nick of time. I didn\u2019t want things to be contrived or forced, but in the end it all came together very organically.

That\u2019s very different to today.

They started out just tapping, and gradually, as tap went out of fashion, replaced it with more singing and comedy.", "To help arrange the anecdotes into a show, Mr. Hines brought on Jeff Calhoun, a director (\u201cNewsies\u201d ) who had started out as a Broadway hoofer. At their first meeting, Mr. Calhoun asked if Mr. Hines had any more photos. \u201cMy mother saved everything, and she left everything to me,\u201d Mr. Hines said. \u201cI was the brother to take care of all the stuff.\u201d", "During \u201cTappin\u2019 Thru Life,\u201d those photos, many of them impossibly adorable, are projected onto portable panels. \u201cThe show is about hanging out with Maurice, and he\u2019s showing you his mother\u2019s scrapbook,\u201d Mr. Calhoun explained in an interview.", "The photos and the stories lead into tributes that Mr. Hines sings to the many celebrities he and his brother worked with: Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Judy Garland. The big names are almost all singers, but he is always dancing, embellishing his vocal delivery with the upper-body flair of Fayard Nicholas. He taps all through the show, mincing the floor with small and quick steps to punctuate his stories, and in several stand-alone dance numbers. One is a re-creation of the bump-and-grind routine that the brothers learned as boys from their ex-chorus-girl grandmother.", "In other dance numbers he is sometimes joined or challenged or briefly replaced by tap dancers who are nearly as young as the Hines Kids were back then: the flashy Manzari Brothers, in their early 20s, and a rotating lineup of superskilled children that Mr. Hines and Mr. Calhoun found through auditions in cities where \u201cTappin\u2019 Thru Life\u201d played over the past year.", "\u201cHe feels the responsibility of passing the torch,\u201d Mr. Calhoun said.", "In his dressing room, Mr. Hines was eager to plug the Maurice and Gregory Hines Performing Arts Center, a school and theater that he and a real-estate developer plan to open in Harlem.

His recent triple album, \u2018\u2018The Epic,\u2019\u2019 is a nearly three-hour suite for a 10-piece jazz band, backed by a 32-piece orchestra and a 20-person choir. Washington\u2019s show promised to be a typical swirl of activity, a sprawling procession of dancers, musicians, DJs and singers unified by the magisterial sound of Washington himself, a 34-year-old tenor saxophonist who has emerged as the most-talked-about jazz musician since Wynton Marsalis arrived on the New York scene three decades ago.", "At that moment, Washington was at his aunt\u2019s dance studio, trying to figure out where to put all the dancers. Lula Washington \u2014 whose troupe would be doing the dancing, at least if her nephew could convince her \u2014 knew that there would be a crowd onstage, and she didn\u2019t want her people to get lost in it. Kamasi listened patiently, then got down on the floor and sketched the Nokia stage, insisting that it was more spacious than she imagined. Maybe a riser here? She looked skeptical. They would work it out somehow, she said, but she did not seem persuaded. (As it turned out, Kamasi\u2019s vision exceeded the limits of this particular stage: Lula\u2019s dancers did not perform in the show.)", "Near the end of our visit, I asked Lula if she knew what the \u2018\u2018epic\u2019\u2019 in the album title referred to. \u2018\u2018As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018Please, do tell.\u2019\u2019 I was relieved: Washington had been promising to tell me the story for several days. Since the release of \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 last May, Washington has gone from being a well-known local musician to that rarest of musical species: a jazz celebrity, praised by critics and featured on \u2018\u2018The Tavis Smiley Show.\u2019\u2019 The timing of the release was providential: Only months earlier, Washington played saxophone on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u2018\u2018To Pimp a Butterfly,\u2019\u2019 for which he also wrote the string arrangements. Lamar\u2019s landmark hip-hop album, a harrowing coming-of-age memoir, featured the contributions of several of Washington\u2019s bandmates, young Los Angeles musicians for whom the boundaries between jazz and more popular genres are so porous as to be nonexistent. On social media, \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 was promoted as a kind of jazz sequel to \u2018\u2018To Pimp a Butterfly.\u2019\u2019", "I assumed that \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 referred to some momentous story from the past or, more broadly, to the sweep of the album\u2019s musical ambitions. But as far as I could tell, Washington had never told the story in public before, nor (apparently) had he told his own aunt. We looked at him expectantly.", "The answer was more involved than I had guessed. \u2018\u2018After I recorded the music,\u2019\u2019 he began, \u2018\u2018I had this dream about a group of young warriors living in a village beneath a mountain.\u2019\u2019 He went on: \u2018\u2018At the top of that mountain, there\u2019s this gate, protected by a guard. The warriors spend all their time training to kill the guard and seize control of the gate. One by one, they are defeated by the guard. But the last warrior has the power to win, and the guard hesitates for the first time, because he sees that the warrior\u2019s heart is good and that his own time has come.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018That was all in one dream?\u2019\u2019 Lula asked.", "Kamasi nodded. Actually, he said, he went on to have a series of interrelated dreams, a hall of mirrors in which it turns out that the guard wasn\u2019t really killed by the young warrior. He said it would take him three hours \u2014 no, days \u2014 to tell us the whole thing. He planned to turn it all into a graphic novel with an illustrator friend.", "I asked what all this had to do with jazz. Kamasi again nodded.", "\u2018\u2018The guard is the person who protects the music and pushes it forward,\u2019\u2019 he said. The hope of the young warrior, he continued, is to take his place and impose his own standards. This explained, perhaps, why the first track of \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 is called \u2018\u2018Change of the Guard.\u2019\u2019 It begins with a bright series of chords laid down by the pianist Cameron Graves, followed by a tidal wave of reeds, choir and strings. A brash and infectiously bombastic wall of sound, the opening stirs memories of the grand, modal style that John Coltrane patented in the 1960s. When I first heard \u2018\u2018Change of the Guard,\u2019\u2019 I was struck by its unabashed evocation of an era that Washington never experienced directly.", "Unaware of the manga-style story that inspired the title, many listeners heard it as an allegory of that greatest of American epics, the African-American freedom struggle since slavery. Certainly Washington looked well cast for the part, a bearded, dashiki-clad man with an Afro whose sheer size seemed to convey the magnitude of his ambitions. \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 tapped into an intense nostalgia for an era when, as Washington puts it, \u2018\u2018music was a sword of the civil rights movement.\u2019\u2019 But it has awakened those feelings in listeners who, in most cases, were not alive to know that era. The audiences lining up to see his band have been unusually large (Washington plays in concert halls, not small jazz clubs), unusually multiracial and unusually young. And they do something that people at jazz concerts seldom do anymore: They dance. When I saw him perform in Brooklyn, the audience roared when he came onstage, as if he were a rock star. (He will, in fact, be joining Guns N\u2019 Roses in the lineup at the Coachella festival in April.)", "This kind of feverish response explains the hysteria \u2014 and occasional bewilderment \u2014 that Washington\u2019s name provokes among jazz people. \u2018\u2018People are talking about this in a way that I haven\u2019t heard them talking about anything in a long time,\u2019\u2019 the jazz pianist Jason Moran told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a moment when black L.A. has something to say, and people are listening.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u2018\u2018Our relationship with this country has always been documented through how the music changes. This is a time when black America is on fire, and Kamasi is adding fuel to the flames.\u2019\u2019", "Like the dream that inspired \u2018\u2018The Epic,\u2019\u2019 Washington\u2019s own story is a tale of guards and warriors. Every young jazz musician has had to wrestle with the gatekeepers of tradition; jazz celebrates youthful originality, but it also prizes respect, even reverence, for the music\u2019s founders. Washington is no less sensitive to the spirits of the past than Wynton Marsalis and the so-called Young Lions who burst onto the scene in the early 1980s, playing a somewhat updated version of 1960s-era small-group jazz in Brooks Brothers suits. Marsalis wanted to revive the fundamentals of blues and swing, which he believed jazz musicians had forgotten during the 1970s, an era of avant-garde and fusion experimentation. Washington, by contrast, conjures the ghosts of 1960s and \u201970s black-consciousness jazz, of the ecstatic, expressive Coltrane and his successors.", "It would be unfair, and a little silly, to ask whether Washington might be the next Coltrane. In any case, there\u2019s room for only one Coltrane in the theology of jazz. But with his overt spiritualism and his humble bearing, Washington has reawakened the widespread longing for a Coltrane-like figure who might lead jazz out of the desert of obscurity and restore its spiritual purpose. He is not the first such figure \u2014 Pharoah Sanders, Albert Ayler and David S. Ware have been cast as prophetic messengers in the wake of Coltrane\u2019s death in 1967 \u2014 but he is the first to come along in some time. Stranger still, he comes from a city that few people even associate with jazz.", "In fact, Los Angeles has a venerable jazz tradition, going back to the Central Avenue scene of the 1940s and the West Coast \u2018\u2018cool\u2019\u2019 of the 1950s. But most of the city\u2019s better-known players (Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Dexter Gordon) had to head East to make a name for themselves. Washington\u2019s father, Rickey, a saxophonist and flutist, was one of those who stayed behind. In early October, shortly after I arrived in Los Angeles, I had lunch with Rickey and Kamasi at a vegan soul food restaurant in Inglewood, a working-class, predominantly black bedroom community near Los Angeles International Airport. They mostly talked about jazz. Actually, Rickey did most of the talking. He reeled off the names of the great musicians who made Los Angeles, his Los Angeles, such a vibrant jazz scene. Men like the pianist Horace Tapscott, the leader of the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra, who used his art to raise the political consciousness of the black community in the 1960s and \u201970s, and the drummer Billy Higgins, who came home to build the World Stage, a performing-arts center in South Central. These were the musicians who nurtured him and prepared the way for his son. His pride in Kamasi was obvious, but I thought I also detected a rueful note: Rickey supported his family as a music teacher and never earned more than a local reputation. Kamasi didn\u2019t say much, until a noisy piece of jazz fusion came on the stereo.", "\u2018\u2018You know what record this is?\u2019\u2019 he asked.", "\u2018\u2018Yeah, yeah. .\u2009.\u2009.\u2019\u2019 Rickey hummed the tune. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know who\u2019s playing, though.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018The drummer played in your band. He used to dye his hair blond.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Blond hair and played in my band?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018It\u2019s Ronald Bruner Sr.\u2019\u2019", "Bruner Sr., who played with the Temptations, is the father of two of Kamasi\u2019s bandmates: Ronald Bruner Jr., also a drummer; and the bassist and singer Stephen Bruner, who makes brooding, ethereal indie-funk under the name Thundercat and whose nimble playing is all over Kendrick Lamar\u2019s latest album. Like the Marsalis brothers, many musicians in the Los Angeles scene come from musical families. Kamasi told me that \u2018\u2018Change of the Guard\u2019\u2019 is a tribute to men like his father and Bruner Sr., musicians who \u2018\u2018had something to say but never had a chance to say it\u2019\u2019 beyond Los Angeles. Throughout the 1980s, Rickey Washington led a Christian jazz band, which Bruner joined after giving up secular music. When Kamasi first expressed a desire to play, his father sent him to church. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the best place to learn,\u2019\u2019 Rickey said. \u2018\u2018You play every week, and you\u2019ve got to play a groove. It doesn\u2019t come any other way but with a groove. They\u2019re clapping on two and four, and you\u2019re moving to the music. If you listen to Kamasi, you know what the groove is, because it\u2019s right in his body.\u2019\u2019", "I went to hear Washington play gospel a few days later at a Nigerian evangelical church. The stage was bathed in pink and purple lighting worthy of a Prince show. Hundreds of parishioners, overwhelmingly Nigerian, many in African ceremonial clothes, swayed to gospel songs made faster and funkier by Nigerian highlife beats. Washington\u2019s solos were modest in length, as befit a sideman, but he kept his big, preacherly sound. Whenever he played, the music came into stirring focus, and his flowing African robes gave him the air of a griot or medicine man.", "\u2018\u2018I always noticed that \u2019Trane thing, that spirituality, in Kamasi\u2019s playing,\u2019\u2019 said the guitarist Greg Dalton, who performs under the name Gee Mack and who once employed Washington in a band. \u2018\u2018You can have all the technique in the world, but if you can\u2019t connect with an audience, it doesn\u2019t matter. And this man, Kamasi, is a poet.\u2019\u2019 The church\u2019s pastor wasn\u2019t aware that Washington is a rising star of the tenor sax, but as we left the church, a young boy came up to tell us that he had just seen him on television. Washington smiled at the boy. \u2018\u2018Do you play an instrument?\u2019\u2019 he asked.", "Washington lives in Inglewood, in the same house where he grew up. He now rents it from his father. The lawn is immaculately manicured, the yellow-stucco front entrance nearly hidden by flowerpots. He works on his music in the garage, which he converted with his father into a home studio furnished with a keyboard, a drum set and recording equipment. There are Christian inspirational illustrations on the wall; a dog-eared copy of the score of \u2018\u2018The Rite of Spring\u2019\u2019 lies on his desk, and stacks of old vinyl cover the floor. Washington moved back to Inglewood a few years ago, after living in Westwood and Culver City, where he felt \u2018\u2018an undercurrent of racism, like you don\u2019t want me here.\u2019\u2019 He added, \u2018\u2018This is home, whereas there, I felt like I was in someone else\u2019s home.\u2019\u2019", "That sense of home, of African-American pride and identity, reverberates throughout \u2018\u2018The Epic.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s not just the tributes to his grandmother and great-grandmother, or the concluding hymn to Malcolm X, which incorporates Ossie Davis\u2019s eulogy as well as one of Malcolm\u2019s speeches. It\u2019s the album\u2019s soaring panorama of black American musical history, from gospel and blues to jazz, doo-wop and funk, offered as a celebration of black beauty in the face of adversity. Its sound is particularly evocative of the early 1970s, when Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Stevie Wonder were composing their own epics and jazz musicians like Max Roach were playing spirituals with gospel choirs. The Afro-futurist cover of \u2018\u2018The Epic,\u2019\u2019 too, suggests an early \u201970s LP: a picture of Washington in a black dashiki against an interstellar backdrop, saxophone in hand.", "That blend of rebellious intent and retro self-fashioning is hardly unique to Washington. It permeates the cultural renaissance spawned by Black Lives Matter, a movement that has combined Black Power nostalgia with an exuberant faith in the revolutionary potential of technology and social media. \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 is arguably the most ambitious expression thus far of this renaissance, whose touchstones also include Claudia Rankine\u2019s prose-poem \u2018\u2018Citizen,\u2019\u2019 Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s memoir \u2018\u2018Between the World and Me,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Angelo\u2019s album \u2018\u2018Black Messiah\u2019\u2019 and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u2018\u2018To Pimp a Butterfly,\u2019\u2019 with its indelible refrain, \u2018\u2018We gon\u2019 be alright.\u2019\u2019 Not surprisingly, \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 has found a particularly receptive following among black intellectuals. As Robin Kelley, a historian at U.C.L.A. and a biographer of Thelonious Monk, puts it, \u2018\u2018In a world where you feel like blackness is under assault and you\u2019re looking for a way to express joy, pain and possibility, \u2018The Epic\u2019 speaks to what black people feel inside.\u2019\u2019 The writer Greg Tate, who calls Washington the \u2018\u2018jazz voice of Black Lives Matter,\u2019\u2019 told me that his music offers \u2018\u2018a healing force, a place of regeneration when you\u2019re trying to deal with the trauma of being black in America.\u2019\u2019", "I mentioned Tate\u2019s assessment to Washington as we stood in the midday heat on Crenshaw, a main boulevard in South Central, in front of a Senegalese shop where he has his dashikis made. At the mosque next door, a small group of men was gathered, and an old man was selling baked chicken and cornbread from a cart. \u2018\u2018Music is an expression of who you are, and \u2014 at least in that sense \u2014 I think I epitomize Black Lives Matter,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m a big black man, and I\u2019m easily misunderstood. Before I started wearing these African clothes, people would assume that I was a threat and that it was O.K. to be violent toward me.\u2019\u2019 He scratched his beard and paused to reflect. \u2018\u2018The harsh reality in our communities is that the greatest representatives of order, the police, are basically against you, so you feel as if you live in a society without order.\u2019\u2019", "Washington grew up with a constant fear of violence. The middle child of his parents\u2019 three sons, he was born in 1981, at the beginning of an era plagued by crack cocaine, gang warfare and police brutality that culminated a decade later in the Rodney King riots. The first house he lived in, on 74th and Figueroa in South Central, was, he said, \u2018\u2018deep in the hood.\u2019\u2019 (At one point, Rickey found the body of a prostitute in the backyard.) When he was 3, his parents divorced, and his mother, a chemistry teacher, moved to a better part of South Central. Soon Rickey Washington left, too, moving to Inglewood, and Kamasi split his time between the two homes. Both neighborhoods were a considerable step up from 74th and Figueroa, Kamasi said, but still \u2018\u2018there were gunshots and sirens every night.\u2019\u2019", "A gifted student in math and science, Washington was at once scared of the gangs and enamored of them. The Bloods and the Crips had emerged after the decline \u2014 or destruction, as many in South Central would say \u2014 of nationalist organizations like the Black Panther Party and exerted an almost irresistible mystique. Some of Washington\u2019s friends in junior \u00adhigh school carried guns, and he flirted with gangster style and speech. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t think my parents understood how off I was,\u2019\u2019 he recalled. What dispelled the glamour of the gangs for him was \u2018\u2018The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\u2019\u2019 He was given a copy by a group of men who visited his school; they were from a nationalist organization called Ujima, Swahili for the principle of collective work and responsibility. \u2018\u2018I saw that these ideas weren\u2019t random, that there was a force behind them,\u2019\u2019 Washington said. \u2018\u2018I realized I didn\u2019t want to be a part of our self-destruction. I wanted to be a positive force in the world.\u2019\u2019", "His turn to jazz was hardly unexpected. \u2018\u2018Kamasi was hearing \u2018A Love Supreme\u2019 before he even knew what he was listening to,\u2019\u2019 his father told me. He started out on drums at 3 and began studying the clarinet at 9. But Kamasi says he mostly listened to hip-hop until he was 11, when a friend of his older brother gave him a mixtape of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers with the trumpeter Lee Morgan. (That friend, Lamar Van \u00adSciver, is now a hip-hop and R&B producer.) \u2018\u2018That\u2019s when I finally got into jazz,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018All of a sudden, I became aware of all this music I had around me at home.\u2019\u2019 He studied his father\u2019s vinyl collection and taught himself to play Wayne Shorter songs on soprano saxophone.", "At 13, Washington announced to his father that he wanted to be a jazz musician. To test his seriousness, Rickey asked his son to sing a Charlie Parker solo. (\u2018\u2018I knew if you couldn\u2019t sing it, you couldn\u2019t play it,\u2019\u2019 Rickey said.) Kamasi sang the head and solo of Parker\u2019s 1951 bop classic \u2018\u2018Blues for Alice\u2019\u2019 note for note. His father\u2019s reward was a Conn 6M alto saxophone, the same model Parker played. He played the alto in church for nearly a year, then switched to tenor \u2014 his father\u2019s. \u2018\u2018He took my tenor!\u2019\u2019 Rickey said. \u2018\u2018A Selmer Mark VI, the best saxophone they make. He didn\u2019t realize how valuable it was.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s the only tenor Kamasi has ever played.", "Coltrane became his obsession. His favorite record was \u2018\u2018Transition,\u2019\u2019 a defining work of Coltrane\u2019s classic quartet. It was avant-\u00adgarde yet still melodic, exhilaratingly expressive but never chaotic. \u2018\u2018He was just treading a line in a way that was powerful,\u2019\u2019 Kamasi said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Transition\u2019 was like the rarest of the rare steaks without being raw. You could still eat it.\u2019\u2019 He modeled himself on Coltrane, not just his sound but also his legendary practice regimen \u2014 as long as 12 hours a day, with sometimes hours spent on a single scale or even a single note. Washington was soon averaging nine hours a day; as if to summon the master\u2019s spirit, he often worked on Coltrane tunes. He and Cameron Graves, who is now his pianist, \u2018\u2018used to compete with each other to see who could practice the most.\u2019\u2019 It was a monkish existence, Washington said. \u2018\u2018Becoming a musician is a strange thing. It\u2019s not all cupcakes and ice cream. You\u2019re trying to master an instrument, and you sometimes can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re getting better. You love it, but you also hate it.\u2019\u2019", "It was not long after he took up the tenor sax that Washington met another jazz \u2018\u2018guard\u2019\u2019: Reggie Andrews, a music teacher at Locke High School in Watts. Andrews, whose former students included Rickey Washington, had grown frustrated that the city\u2019s magnet schools had poached the best young musicians \u2014 including Kamasi Washington, who was discovering Prokofiev and Stravinsky at Alexander Hamilton High School, a prestigious musical academy near Culver City. Andrews began visiting nearby schools and asking the music teachers to identify their best pupils. His idea was to pick them up in his van after school, drive them to Locke and turn them into a group. He called it the Multi-School Jazz Band, and before long it was performing throughout the city. I drove with Washington to Locke, a squat structure surrounded by a wire fence that made it look more like a prison than a school. \u2018\u2018The amazing thing is that white kids were coming down to Locke to rehearse because the band was so good and they wanted to be in it,\u2019\u2019 he remembered. \u2018\u2018It was kind of ironic, since we were being bused to their schools.\u2019\u2019 Seeing young whites flock to Locke gave Washington a taste of power, an awareness of the cachet he possessed as an African-American musician. In spite of the \u2018\u2018denial of our humanity,\u2019\u2019 he realized, \u2018\u2018everybody wants to dress and talk like us.\u2019\u2019", "The Multi-School Jazz Band reunited Washington with the Bruner brothers and introduced all three to the musicians with whom they would eventually form the Los Angeles jazz underground, including the alto saxophonist Terrace Martin (who wrote and produced much of the music on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s latest album), the pianist Cameron Graves, the bassist Miles Mosley and the trombonist Ryan Porter. \u2018\u2018Reggie Andrews realized that there was a brain drain from the community and that we were losing the advantages of being connected to one another,\u2019\u2019 Washington told me. After band practice, Washington would go home with Ronald Bruner Jr. and jam in his father\u2019s shed. Like Washington, Bruner was driven partly by a sense that his own father hadn\u2019t achieved his potential as a musician. \u2018\u2018My father was on the way to becoming the guy, and then he gave it up to play Christian music,\u2019\u2019 he told me.", "Music was not the only thing Andrews\u2019s students had in common: Most of them were growing up black, male and at risk in Los Angeles. \u2018\u2018We could have gone into gangbanging,\u2019\u2019 Bruner told me. \u2018\u2018That model was available to us. I was in a situation that got out of control, and a friend of mine died. But that difficulty made everyone stronger. The threat of being caught up in that makes you push harder.\u2019\u2019", "They had Andrews to keep them on track. A tall, solidly built man now in his late 60s who wears a mustache and a Tuskegee baseball cap, Andrews radiates self-confidence, drive and impatience with excuses. Over breakfast one morning at a local soul-food restaurant, he told me how he made sure his players kept their grades up and emphasized the importance of craftsmanship and professionalism. \u2018\u2018Kamasi can do the Archie Shepp thing or the \u2019Trane thing and ride that note,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but he knows how to take it back.\u2019\u2019", "Washington received a different kind of mentoring in Leimert Park, where he and his friends went to after-hours jam sessions. Leimert Park was designed by the Olmsted firm in the late 1920s as a whites-only planned community, but by the 1960s it had become an African-American neighborhood. After the 1965 Watts riots, Leimert Park became a center of the Black Arts movement, a cultural offshoot of the Black Power movement. Lined with fig trees and exuding community pride, Leimert Park was as close to an oasis as you could find in South Central. Even during the crack epidemic, it remained a home to black-owned art galleries, bookstores and clothing shops.", "When Washington began going there in the mid-1990s, it was in the middle of a revival. Its mecca was the World Stage, the nonprofit performing-arts gallery established by Billy Higgins and the poet Kamau Da\u00e1ood, a leader of the Black Arts movement. Higgins and Da\u00e1ood envisioned the World Stage as an extension of the \u201960s jazz activism pioneered by Da\u00e1ood\u2019s mentor, Horace Tapscott. It could barely seat 50 people, but it attracted some of the greatest musicians in jazz and helped inspire a scene that cut across divisions of generation and genre. \u2018\u2018We were in Leimert Park every night,\u2019\u2019 Washington says. \u2018\u2018We\u2019d get in everywhere without money. I still don\u2019t know how we did it.\u2019\u2019", "In 1999, Washington began studying at U.C.L.A. with the composer Gerald Wilson, who had written charts for Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald. But in his first year, Marlon Williams, Snoop Dogg\u2019s musical director, invited Washington to go on tour with the rapper. A former guitarist in the black rock band Fishbone, Williams had already recruited Washington\u2019s friend Terrace Martin to put together Snoop\u2019s horn section, and Martin immediately called Washington. \u2018\u2018I was a big Snoop Dogg fan, and I knew the repertoire \u2014 I mean, this was dope,\u2019\u2019 Washington recalled. Although \u2018\u2018it was cool to make money,\u2019\u2019 financial considerations were far less compelling than the promise of adventure. \u2018\u2018I had never been on the road,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d been to New York and D.C. once, so it was a chance to go on tour. I was young and on a full scholarship, so I hadn\u2019t even gotten to the point of thinking about the economics of the music business.\u2019\u2019 Washington continued his studies with Wilson, but he received an equally important education with Professor Snoop.", "At the point when Washington got the call, he had been spending most of his time trying to master harmonically demanding songs like Coltrane\u2019s \u2018\u2018Giant Steps.\u2019\u2019 Now his job was to play apparently simple riffs to \u2018\u2018line up with the groove.\u2019\u2019 Playing those riffs, however, was tougher than it looked: Hip-hop was a miniaturist art of deceptive simplicity. \u2018\u2018When you play jazz in school, you talk about articulation, but it\u2019s a very light conversation,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The question was about what you were playing, not how you were playing it. But when I was playing with Snoop, what I was playing was pretty obvious \u2014 anyone with ears could figure it out. The question was how to play it, with the right articulation and timing and tone.\u2019\u2019 Snoop didn\u2019t come to rehearsals or even really explain what he wanted. \u2018\u2018It was all very unspoken. You had to use your intuition to figure out why it didn\u2019t sound right. We had to have it right before he got there, because if it was wrong, he\u2019d veto it, and we\u2019d have to just sit there.\u2019\u2019", "Snoop was particularly demanding when it came to the placement of notes in relation to the beat, and Washington struggled at first to hear the beat the way Snoop did. After a while, though, he began to discern what he calls \u2018\u2018the little subtleties,\u2019\u2019 the way, for example, \u2018\u2018the drummer D-Loc would lock into the bass line.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t like the compositional elements in Stravinsky. It wasn\u2019t about counterpoint or thick harmonies. It was more about the relationships and the timing, the one little cool thing you could play in that little space. It might just be one little thing in a four-minute song, but it was the perfect thing you could play in it. I started to hear music in a different way, and it changed the way I played jazz. Just playing the notes didn\u2019t do it for me anymore.\u2019\u2019 He came to see hip-hop as a relative of jazz. \u2018\u2018All forms are complex once you get to a really high level, and jazz and hip-hop are so connected,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018In hip-hop you sample, while in jazz you take Broadway tunes and turn them into something different. They\u2019re both forms that repurpose other forms of music.\u2019\u2019", "Washington often skips in conversation from Kendrick Lamar to Coltrane, and from Charlie Parker to Stravinsky. The reason that we don\u2019t see these connections, he says, is that we\u2019re captives of \u2018\u2018preconceived notions,\u2019\u2019 the most confining being the very idea of \u2018\u2018jazz.\u2019\u2019 Some musicians complain that even the word \u2018\u2018jazz\u2019\u2019 deprives them of a popular audience; others see it as an insult. As the trumpeter Nicholas Payton recently put it, \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Jazz\u2019 is an oppressive, colonialist slave term.\u2019\u2019 For musicians like Payton, \u2018\u2018jazz\u2019\u2019 is a white establishment label that cuts their music off from other black musical forms; they prefer terms like \u2018\u2018black art music,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018black classical music,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018black creative music\u2019\u2019 or simply \u2018\u2018black music.\u2019\u2019", "But Washington\u2019s criticism of musical categories is at once more expansive and more subtle than Payton\u2019s. For Washington, the problem is not merely that categories ghettoize forms of music, but that they prevent us from fully listening. All music, he believes, deserves a fair hearing \u2014 even much ridiculed forms like \u2018\u2018smooth jazz.\u2019\u2019 I had brunch one morning with Washington and his girlfriend, Tiffany Wright, an earnest young woman with long braids who established a private elementary school in Wilshire under her own name, the Wright Academy. An insidiously saccharine ballad by the smooth-jazz saxophonist Najee came on. I asked Washington if it bothered him that some people mistook this sort of jazz for the real thing.", "\u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have an aversion to it,\u2019\u2019 he said. In fact, he went on, he liked some smooth jazz, notably the saxophone player Grover Washington Jr. (no relation). Gently taking me to task for my snobbery, he noted that Najee, like many smooth-jazz players, had roots in gospel \u2014 and that in any case, no musical genre is entirely devoid of value.", "\u2018\u2018You want my layman\u2019s interpretation?\u2019\u2019 Wright volunteered. \u2018\u2018Kamasi is totally nonjudgmental, in all areas. It makes life a lot less stressful.\u2019\u2019", "That mellow, West Coast inclusiveness is another pointed contrast between Washington and the young Wynton Marsalis, who once declared, \u2018\u2018There is nothing sadder than a jazz musician playing funk.\u2019\u2019 When Washington and his trombonist, Ryan Porter, trade riffs, they make no secret of their love of Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley, two of the horn men in the James Brown band. \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t a mistake to call James Brown\u2019s music funk, but I\u2019m not sure it was good for jazz,\u2019\u2019 Washington told me. Jazz, as he sees it, is not so much a genre as a way of styling music. Which means that if he is playing Debussy\u2019s \u2018\u2018Clair de Lune\u2019\u2019 \u2014 as he does in a languorous, brazenly sentimental arrangement on \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s jazz.", "Surprisingly, given that Washington toured with Snoop and later Lauryn Hill, one genre you don\u2019t hear on \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 is hip-hop. \u2018\u2018I was already playing all that,\u2019\u2019 he explains. \u2018\u2018When I got to do my music, I wanted to play like me.\u2019\u2019", "As it happened, his friends from the Multi-School Jazz Band felt the same way, and in 2009 they did what independently \u00adminded jazz musicians have done since the 1960s: They organized themselves into a collective, the West Coast Get Down. They started out playing at a Hollywood cocktail lounge called Piano Bar, developing a repertoire in front of crowds of 20-somethings who had no interest \u2014 or at least no prior interest \u2014 in jazz. (Eventually the crowds grew so large that the fire marshal was called in.) The collective\u2019s founder was Miles Mosley, who plays an upright bass through a wah-wah pedal, but Washington soon established himself as the charismatic leader. He was playing jazz, but it was jazz imbued with the vibrations of the church and the \u2018\u2018little subtleties\u2019\u2019 of pulse and timbre that he picked up from Snoop Dogg. It was, in other words, a groove-based jazz, adjacent to the Afro-futurist psychedelia of his friend and collaborator Steven Ellison, a musician who records under the name Flying Lotus. (Ellison is the grandnephew of Alice Coltrane, John Coltrane\u2019s second wife and a major pianist and composer in her own right.) You didn\u2019t have to be a jazz geek to appreciate it; in fact, it was easier to appreciate if you weren\u2019t.", "In 2011, after two years of testing their ideas at Piano Bar, Washington and his friends decided that it was time to go into the studio. They all pitched in to rent the Kingsize Soundlabs in Echo Park, canceled all their gigs for December and barely left except to sleep. The musicians weren\u2019t paid for their work, because they were all playing on one another\u2019s records. By the end of the month, they had 192 songs; 45 were under Washington\u2019s leadership. He chose 17 for \u2018\u2018The Epic,\u2019\u2019 14 of them his own compositions. The album came out on Brainfeeder, an independent label run by Ellison.", "Ellison didn\u2019t blink when Washington told him that his album for Brainfeeder was going to be three hours of music. \u2018\u2018Kamasi is a murderer on the saxophone,\u2019\u2019 Ellison said when I ran into him at a concert in downtown Los Angeles.", "The music on \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 was already quite dense, with three people on horns, two drummers, two bassists, two keyboardists and a singer, but Washington wasn\u2019t done tinkering. While touring with Chaka Khan, he began to write choir and string parts. Washington told me that he wanted to evoke Stravinsky\u2019s \u2018\u2018Symphony of Psalms\u2019\u2019 in the choir and string arrangements, but they\u2019re equally reminiscent of Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018\u2018What\u2019s Going On\u2019\u2019 and Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u2018\u2018Superfly.\u2019\u2019 Above all, \u2018\u2018The Epic\u2019\u2019 breathes new life into the black consciousness or \u2018\u2018spiritual\u2019\u2019 jazz of the early 1970s, when saxophonists like Pharoah Sanders, Gary Bartz, Joe Henderson and Billy Harper grafted free jazz sonorities onto hard-bop melodies and danceable grooves, often embroidering them with African percussion as well. An expression of the cultural nationalism that spread across urban black communities in the 1970s, spiritual jazz has often been dismissed as Afrocentric kitsch in histories of jazz, but it was popular in black America, and it was the jazz that Rickey Washington played on the stereo at home. It aimed to move the audience but also instruct them. If they didn\u2019t get the message, the album titles spelled it out: \u2018\u2018Black Unity,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Black Saint,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018In Pursuit of Blackness,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Power to the People.\u2019\u2019", "In a 1966 essay, \u2018\u2018The Changing Same (R&B and New Black Music),\u2019\u2019 Amiri Baraka called for a new \u2018\u2018unity music,\u2019\u2019 a synthesis of jazz and black vernacular styles that would \u2018\u2018include all the resources, all the rhythms, all the yells and cries, all that \u00adinformation about the world, the Black ommmmm\u00admmmmm\u00admmmmm, opening and entering.\u2019\u2019 Kamasi Washington is far from being the first musician of his generation to set off in search of that om. Jason Moran, Robert Glasper, Steve Coleman and other East Coast musicians have been working toward such a synthesis for years. But Washington and the West Coast Get Down have managed to strike a chord with audiences in a way that has eluded most of their peers on the East Coast.", "Serendipity, of course, has been an important ingredient in their success. As Greg Tate told me, \u2018\u2018You have to go to mysticism to explain how these things come together at the same time: the best heroic jazz origin story since the Marsalis brothers, being on Kendrick Lamar\u2019s record and Flying Lotus\u2019s label, and Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u2019 But the Los Angeles scene would not have had the same impact without Washington\u2019s personal charisma, his deeply spiritual sound and his welcoming, Buddha-like aura. He may not be a major innovator, but he is a remarkably forceful communicator: in the words of Kamau Da\u00e1ood, \u2018\u2018a perfect vessel for the coming together of generations in his music.\u2019\u2019", "In October, a couple of weeks before Washington would fly to Tokyo on his first world tour, his father organized a dinner with a group of distinguished older jazz musicians. \u2018\u2018When you are chosen,\u2019\u2019 Rickey explained to me, \u2018\u2018you need the blessings of your elders.\u2019\u2019 (Reggie Andrews had a more down-to-earth explanation: \u2018\u2018Kamasi\u2019s about to step into the fast lane, so Rickey wanted him to receive some advice from people who\u2019ve been there.\u2019\u2019) This \u2018\u2018change of the guard\u2019\u2019 ceremony took place at the Ladera Heights home of Curtis Jenkins, who runs a business that provides care for disabled children in South Central. In a flight of enthusiasm, Rickey had invited me to attend the dinner. The next day, Kamasi\u2019s manager, Banch Abegaze, disinvited me; she said it was for only close friends and family. But she suggested that I stop by later in the evening.", "When I arrived, the shades were fully drawn, as if a s\u00e9ance were in session, but inside I found a group of nine older men nibbling on plates of Ethiopian vegetarian food. (The only women there were Kamasi\u2019s manager and his girlfriend.) There were paintings of Miles Davis, African-themed artworks and framed photographs of Jenkins with the Obamas and the Clintons. Jenkins, a small, excitable man who grew up in Compton at the time of the Watts riots and studied filmmaking at U.C.L.A., told me that when he first heard \u2018\u2018The Epic,\u2019\u2019 it struck him as \u2018\u2018an announcement.\u2019\u2019 Not since the days of Davis and Coltrane had he been so moved by a work of jazz. When he read in The Los Angeles Times that Kamasi Washington was the son of his old acquaintance Rickey Washington, he contacted Rickey, who asked him to document Kamasi\u2019s concerts on video. He has been traveling with the band off and on ever since. \u2018\u2018Kamasi is a messenger, and his message speaks to something deep within me.\u2019\u2019 I asked him what the message was. \u2018\u2018Freedom of thought and action,\u2019\u2019 he replied.", "After dinner, the men gathered on sofas around Kamasi, who sat in a chair in front of a fireplace. He was wearing a dashiki and a knitted Jamaican cap; he seemed to be deep in thought, his eyes in some far-off place. The first speaker was Bennie Maupin, who played bass clarinet on Davis\u2019s \u2018\u2018Bitches Brew\u2019\u2019 and a variety of reed instruments in Herbie Hancock\u2019s fusion band Headhunters. He began by asking Kamasi to explain the meaning of his name.", "\u2018\u2018It was intended to be Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti tribes in Ghana,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018To be under the kuma tree is to bring people together, to bring peace.\u2019\u2019 Rickey Washington and a friend had gotten lost one night in Kumasi while they were on tour in Ghana in the late 1970s. \u2018\u2018A guy came out of his house and gave them a place to stay for the night,\u2019\u2019 Kamasi said. \u2018\u2018The hospitality was higher than anything he\u2019d experienced in Watts, where you might just get robbed. He wanted to name me after that city, but since this was before Yahoo and Google, he misremembered what it was called.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Yeah, I was into that whole consciousness thing when I named him,\u2019\u2019 Rickey said. \u2018\u2018The kuma tree brings shade, and I prayed that Kamasi would be a person who brings people together.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018The energy in this music is a healing energy,\u2019\u2019 Maupin continued, praising Kamasi\u2019s wisdom and kindness, promising to stand behind him and urging him to choose his friends carefully and be mindful of his health.

The world has changed, he told the crowd: Google the floor plans of stadiums and concert sites before going to them. Study the layout of your grocery store. Make a note of places to make a quick exit or to hide. And be ready to pounce, if you must, with maximum aggression.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t go out here and not have a mind-set to win the fight,\u201d Chief Sparks said. \u201cCan\u2019t go around here with no sheepish-type mind-set.

Everybody in Douglasville, we tigers, lions, bears, elephants, whatever you want to be.\u201d", "And so it went in this macabre genre of continuing education class, an increasingly common ritual in a firearm-saturated nation where many feel particularly vulnerable after the murderous Islamic State assaults in Paris in November, the bloody attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs two weeks later and the massacre of county employees in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.", "Held one night during the week after Christmas, the Douglasville meeting attracted about 80 people: worried retirees, worried office workers, worried teachers and parents, and a worried 21-year-old in a heavy metal T-shirt, Chris Wallace, who said he felt particularly exposed in crowded public places. He was thinking about applying for a concealed carry permit.", "\u201cYou can never be too safe,\u201d he said.", "Over the course of 90 minutes, the police encouraged them to adopt a view of the world that was, in essence, the default view of police officers: Keep your head on a swivel.

But in recent weeks, more sessions like the one here have bloomed nationwide. Hundreds came for a seminar at City Hall in Livonia, Mich. Boy Scout Troop 212 received a lesson in survival from the Iowa City Police Department.

The idea of proactive self-defense was embraced wholeheartedly in Douglasville, a suburban city of 32,000 just west of Atlanta.

In the video, many of the students moved out of what the instructor called the \u201ckill zone\u201d: the gunman\u2019s initial view of the room. Some of them gathered on either side of the door. When a man pretending to be the attacker entered the room, they pounced on him, grabbing his forearms and wrestling him to the floor.", "A question-and-answer session followed the video. Kimberly Fugate, 49, a middle school Spanish teacher, said that her public school had a lockdown plan, and that she had told her students to hide and be quiet if there were an attack. \u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d she asked.", "The chief said that if the opportunity presented itself, she could \u201cjab that guy in his eyeball\u201d with a pencil. \u201cYou bite his nose off.\u201d The students, he said, could kick the attacker while he was down \u201cwith a hundred little feets.\u201d", "The crowd laughed, but some safety experts consider such advice dangerous. \u201cIt requires a lot of judgment in terms of whether to fight or not,\u201d David Esquith, the director of the federal Department of Education\u2019s safety office, said in an interview. \u201cAnd this is a judgment that only an adult can make.\u201d", "While mass shootings dominate cable newscasts, they make up a minuscule proportion of the nation\u2019s 32,000 gun deaths annually.

It said that at the time, it notified its customers of suspicious activity on their accounts and forced them to reset passwords, without specifying where the attacks might have come from.", "\u201cWe weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,\u201d Microsoft said in the statement. \u201cWe also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.\u201d", "Few Internet companies at the time had publicly committed to letting their users know when they suspected government hackers of targeting them. One exception was Google, which in June 2012 began posting banners atop Gmail accounts warning users when states or state-sponsored groups seemed to be trying to gain control of their accounts.", "In a blog post describing their warnings, Google declined to say exactly how it knew the attacks were state-sponsored, but said its alerts were the result of detailed analysis and victim reports. Google advised users to take additional precautions, like using stronger passwords and turning on two-step verification, which provides users with secondary codes via text messages or phone calls for accessing their accounts.", "In October, Facebook said that it had begun notifying its users of state-sponsored efforts to take over customers\u2019 accounts.", "Around that time, Iranian hackers had compromised the social media and email accounts of State Department officials who focused on Iran and the Middle East, The New York Times reported in November.", "In December, Twitter also began issuing similar alerts to its users, followed by Yahoo."], "https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/educators-against-intolerance/": ["More than 4,600 educators in the United States have signed an open letter speaking out against intolerance and discrimination, particularly towards Arab and Muslim Americans.

The reduction in immigrants\u2019 rights codified by the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the restrictions on free speech established by the Espionage and Sedition Acts of 1917-18, and the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII were all policies born from fear, and all resound throughout history as stark contradictions to American values.", "We are concerned that we could head down a similarly dark path today.

Public personalities have openly called for barring Muslims from entering the US and have not ruled out building databases to track American Muslims.", "While denounced by the majority, such rhetoric normalizes intolerance. It permits actions with undesirable and unintended consequences. The visa waiver bill, voted through by over 90% of the House on Dec. 8, 2015, is one such example. Under this bill, specific individuals from the 38 countries eligible for a visa waiver would be barred from using it. Those newly excluded would include British citizens of Iranian descent, as well as Germans who volunteered for relief work in Syria. As such legislation is often reciprocated by other nations, it may well relegate American Arabs and Muslims to second-class citizen status and deter all Americans from traveling to places where our help is critical.", "Broad-brush, discriminatory and highly visible measures targeting Arab and Muslim populations are likely to create division, not heal it \u2013 playing right into the extremists\u2019 hands. Making it harder for individuals to travel hurts the very exchange of ideas that fosters tolerance in our society and allows our universities to become world leaders in producing knowledge and promoting free speech and rational discourse.", "Our universities indeed exemplify how we thrive by enabling people from different cultures, religions, political values and priorities to cohabit and work together productively. As we interact with our students, fellow educators, and policy makers, we are constantly reminded of how important this diverse and open exchange is, and the critical part it plays in informing the fabric of our values. As we see signs of fear clouding our judgment, we are compelled to speak out in defense of tolerance, rational discourse, and basic human values.", "We therefore categorically reject all forms of intolerance and any discriminatory treatment of Arab and Muslim Americans and other minority groups.

Shortly thereafter, I told the company\u2019s public relations people that at some point I would love to interview Larry Page, the company\u2019s co-founder. I\u2019ve been waiting ever since.", "Mr. Page is a fascinating character who has changed the world a few times over and is worth tens of billions of dollars. But he makes little time for the press. He rarely grants interviews, and, when he does, they are usually limited to staged events like TED.", "That presented a big hurdle while I reported on a profile of Mr. Page for Sunday\u2019s paper. He declined several requests for comment on my article, as did a good number of past and present Google employees who have worked closely with him.", "Before we go any further, I want to say loud and clear that I don\u2019t think Mr. Page or any other business leader has a responsibility to talk to the press. He is a busy man and his media shyness probably should not be confused with reclusion. Mr. Page is visible at Google\u2019s Mountain View, Calif., campus and regularly talks to the company\u2019s 60,000 employees there and around the world (via videoconference), during the company\u2019s weekly T.G.I.F. gatherings.", "But companies are run by people, so it is extremely difficult to understand Google without understanding Mr. Page. If you can\u2019t talk to the man himself, the next best thing is to talk to people who have worked with him.", "As I reported the story, two things kept surfacing. The first was that a number of recently departed Googlers told me that after they gave notice, Mr. Page personally asked them to stay. They said that, during these conversations, he honestly laid out his concerns and aspirations for the company and its future.", "The second thing was that as I reported the profile \u2014 as well as other technology stories \u2014 I kept meeting scientists and other researchers who had bumped into Mr. Page at Google\u2019s various academic and scientific gatherings.", "What these groups had in common was candor. They provided a glimpse, though narrow, into how Mr. Page thinks about technology and Google, which recently reorganized into a holding company called Alphabet. The profile I wrote was hardly an expose, but it helped me \u2014 and therefore helped Times readers \u2014 get a better understanding about Mr. Page and his company, which has moved far beyond search into self-driving cars, space travel and biotechnology, among other areas.", "Whenever someone asks me what I do at The Times, and I tell them I cover Google, the result is often a confused stare. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d", "Not really.

There\u2019s a strong argument that Google is now the most important company in the world. It is worth $500 billion and is neck and neck with Apple as the most valuable company by market capitalization. Six Google products have more than one billion users. I use Google to research stories, I email my editors through Gmail, and I use Google Maps to go to meetings.", "Google\u2019s power is unparalleled and partly explains why it and other giant technology companies have faced a bit of cultural backlash in the wake of Edward J.

For example, a few weeks after Mr. Page announced the formation of Alphabet, the author Jonathan Franzen published \u201cPurity,\u201d his fifth novel. I read the book for fun, but, as often happens on the Google beat, it quickly turned into work.", "One of the main characters in Mr. Franzen\u2019s novel is Andreas Wolf, a hacker who has exposed secrets about the East German Stasi and the United States nuclear arsenal, but, during one fictional exchange, refused to publish leaks from two Google employees for fear that the company might use its search engine to tar Mr. Wolf\u2019s reputation.", "I emailed Mr. Franzen, via a publicist, to see if he might be willing to tell me what kinds of real-world concerns led to that imaginary exchange.", "\u201cThat paragraph came out of the distance between what the N.S.A. was collecting in terms of metadata, basically the Snowden leak, a relatively paltry amount of data compared to the rather large amounts of data we are willingly giving up \u2014 or unwillingly giving up by clicking the \u2018I accept the terms box\u2019 \u2014 to these very powerful corporations,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cAnd my feeling is, you look around at who is powerful in the world now, and, yes the U.S. government still has drones and a nuclear arsenal \u2014 it has some might \u2014 but in terms of power over people\u2019s daily lives, I think it\u2019s shifted to the private sector.\u201d", "Later, he added: \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate always to resist concentration of power in the hands of too few. There is bound to come a point where that becomes dangerous.\u201d", "Google\u2019s power is predicated, of course, on the enormous volume of information at its disposal. Its competitors, as I noted in my profile, have accused the company of abusing its dominance in the search space to steer consumers to Google services over theirs, and the European Commission seems to agree.", "But Mr. Page has also used his own power \u2014 through an unusual share structure, he and co-founder Sergey Brin control the company outright \u2014 to isolate himself from Wall Street\u2019s demands.

During a 2014 interview with Charlie Rose, he said he wished there were a vehicle for people to donate money to their company so that it could be used for projects that had some kind of social purpose.", "These are some of the ideas I tried to get at in the article, but of course I would love to have included an interview with the man himself. There is a popular image of reporters as a pack of pushy cold callers who will stalk anyone to get their story, and while that is true at times, I can tell you from experience that it is really awkward and emasculating to try to interview someone who doesn\u2019t want to talk. You feel like a big dork.", "In total, I have encountered Mr. Page three times for a total of five minutes or so. Once was at an off-the-record gathering where nothing interesting happened, and another was at a press event where he politely shook my hand before heading in another direction.", "The other time, I was at Google\u2019s Mountain View campus, talking to an executive, when Mr. Page rode up on his bike to say hello to his employee.

After your details are forwarded, usually via text, one of those subcontractors jumps in a car and heads to your vehicle or home.

The latter, which claims its main office is in TriBeCa, promises that employees will earn as much as $4,000 a month and says it is looking for people \u201cwho are not afraid of new things.\u201d Like many of these companies, Mr. Locks covers itself by stating \u2014 in Hebrew and on a site that caters to Israelis \u2014 that it is looking for United States citizens.", "Many of the recruits later establish their own lead-gen operations, which then recruit more talent. This has increased competition and made deceiving Google an ever more esoteric pursuit. That was evident during a conversation with Roy Alverado, the owner of Locksmith Force, the company that created the fake pink building in Sun City. He insisted that he ran an authentic local business, with trained and courteous locksmiths.", "As for that fake building: \u201cWe wanted to have a store in that area, but the rents were too high,\u201d he said. He told a web design firm to create a building using Photoshop. Actually, all but one of the buildings are Photoshop creations, since Locksmith Force\u2019s sole physical location is in Phoenix, Mr. Alverado said. The more buildings on the site, he candidly stated, the more people would believe they were calling someone who could show up at a car or house quickly.", "Mr. Alverado said those fake buildings were necessary because getting to the first page in Google results now took ingenuity and cunning.", "\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said, sounding a little weary when asked about competition. Israelis were his toughest rivals, he said, and they had instilled a kind of awe in him. \u201cI can tell you point-blank, they are freaking smart,\u201d he said. \u201cI really admire them.\u201d", "A few months ago, he decided that he needed some help with search engine optimization. A company called Over the Top SEO showed up on the first page of an \u201cSEO company\u201d search, so he figured it was very good. Then he saw that the company was based in Israel. Mr. Alverado was sold.

Few know the particulars better than Bryan Seely, who worked for a lead-gen outfit in the automotive glass repair field, based in Southern California, from 2008 to 2010. During that time, he produced about 3,000 fake auto glass repair listings across the country. Eventually appalled by his handiwork, he became what he calls a reformed hacker and explained his techniques in a self-published book, \u201cCyber Fraud: The Web of Lies.\u201d", "\u201cMy hope was that the book would cause Google to patch up these holes,\u201d he said on the phone recently. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work.\u201d", "In the interest of minimizing mischief, the methods Mr. Seely described will not be detailed here. But they involve chicanery with two platforms: Google My Business, essentially the company\u2019s version of the Yellow Pages, and Map Maker, which is Google\u2019s crowdsourced online map of the world. The latter allows people around the planet to log in to the system and input data about streets, companies and points of interest.", "Both Google My Business and Map Maker are a bit like Wikipedia, insofar as they are largely built and maintained by millions of contributors. Keeping the system open, with verification, gives countless businesses an invaluable online presence. Google officials say that the system is so good that many local companies do not bother building their own websites. Anyone who has ever navigated using Google Maps knows the service is a technological wonder.", "But the very quality that makes Google\u2019s systems accessible to companies that want to be listed makes them vulnerable to pernicious meddling.", "\u201cThis is what you get when you rely on crowdsourcing for all your \u2018up to date\u2019 and \u2018relevant\u2019 local business content,\u201d Mr. Seely said. \u201cYou get people who contribute meaningful content, and you get people who abuse the system.\u201d", "The most obvious symptom of abuse is a wild proliferation of lead-gen listings. Charles Eastwood, a locksmith in Phoenix, subpoenaed Acxiom, a data brokerage firm, as part of a lawsuit he filed against a group of purported lead gens in 2010. He wanted to know how many locksmiths were listed in Arizona.", "\u201cThere were 9,600 of them in the list I got from Acxiom,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s about 9,000 more than anyone believes actually work in the state.\u201d", "To fight lead gens, Google deploys a little-known army of volunteers, called Mappers, many of whom are engaged in a contest that takes wit and stamina. These are people around the world who propose and approve edits to Google Maps, with an assist from Google employees, all in the interest of refining the product and fighting spam \u2014 a term that in this context means anything fake and misleading.", "It may seem bizarre that people would work gratis for one of the world\u2019s richest companies. But many Mappers turn the job into a calling. For Dan Austin, who lives in Olympia, Wash., it was more like an addiction.", "A former truck driver for DHL, he became a Mapper after he was laid off from his job and started fixing mistakes he had noticed on Maps while on the road. By the fall of 2011, Mr. Austin had discovered locksmith spam and was soon spending 10 hours a day, seven days a week, deleting it from Maps.", "\u201cIt was like a video game except it had a moral element to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019d have wiped out 1,000 locations and I would think, that\u2019s 1,000 phone calls that didn\u2019t get made, 1,000 consumers who didn\u2019t get scammed. I felt like Superman.\u201d", "Mr. Austin became a Regional Lead, the highest rank in Google\u2019s Boy Scout-like badge system of incentives, a job \u2014 still unpaid \u2014 that required him to sign a nondisclosure agreement.", "He was quickly locked in a struggle that seemed inspired by Cold War spycraft. Some lead-gen owners became Mappers themselves, hoping to stealthily protect their listings. They were essentially moles. One of them, who called himself Baton Sason, contacted Mr. Austin through a private detective.", "\u201cAt first, he thought I was another spammer,\u201d Mr. Austin recalled. When Mr. Sason realized that Mr. Austin was truly on Google\u2019s side, he tried to win amnesty for his sites in exchange for help informing on his competitors. Mr. Austin played along for a few months, then deleted Mr. Sason\u2019s sites too.", "Initially, Mr. Austin regarded Google as a benign Goliath that cared about consumers and small businesses. But about 18 months after his campaign began, pessimism crept in. He realized, he said, that spammers were changing tactics much faster than Google was adopting countermeasures.", "\u201cFor me, it was always like I was looking at a five-alarm fire,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, it was smoldering.\u201d", "By the fall of 2012, Mr. Austin was disillusioned. He decided that the subtle approach to getting attention wasn\u2019t working. So he did something obnoxious. In the middle of the Google Map of Los Angeles, he placed a marijuana grow house. Not a dispensary, which is legal. A grow house, which is a place where plants are harvested. Those are illegal. Then he highlighted the stunt on a Map Maker forum.", "The plan was to demonstrate that it was too easy to hoodwink Google. The plan failed. Google fired him from his unpaid job. (A Google spokesman declined to comment.)", "Today, Mr. Austin has the faintly bitter tone of a man who has left a cult, but he is cleareyed about why Google never seemed to respond quickly enough to spammers. It wasn\u2019t a priority, he said. The company is dominated by software coders, and they want to solve the most interesting problems, or create the coolest products.", "\u201cFighting spam is boring,\u201d Mr. Austin said. \u201cThe employees who cared didn\u2019t have the political clout in the company. I\u2019d hear Googlers say, \u2018Maps is a mess. It\u2019s known at the highest levels, but we don\u2019t talk about it publicly.\u2019\u201d", "The justice system is the most obvious alternative to Google in the fight against locksmith lead gens, and in 2009, federal prosecutors in St. Louis went after three principals of Dependable Locks on charges of a variety of nationwide frauds. This was the most ambitious action ever taken against a suspected lead gen; postal inspectors had surprised the company by showing up at its headquarters in Clearwater, Fla., with a search warrant. Files were confiscated, employees were persuaded to tell all.", "Little, it seems, went right after that. One defendant fled the country, according to prosecutors. In 2013, a federal magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case because the government had deported four witnesses, all of them former Dependable employees who might have helped the defendants. The judge also suggested that the case would be difficult for the prosecution to win because Dependable phone representatives usually added the phrase \u201cand up\u201d when quoting prices.", "One of the prosecutors, Mr. Ware, the assistant United States attorney in St. Louis, respectfully disagreed with those findings.", "\u201cNinety percent of people were charged more than the estimate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had locksmiths tell us that they would take whatever they could get from customers.\u201d", "One lesson of the Dependable case, which took years from inception to dismissal, is that the criminal courts are a terrible way to fight purported lead-gen locksmiths. Civil cases have fared no better. Mr. Baldino, the locksmith in Washington area, lost a case against Google and other directories in which he said the companies commingled legitimate and illegitimate players in listings. Last February, a Virginia state court found that Google had immunity under the Communications Decency Act, which extends to all information that does not originate with Google \u2014 \u201ceven when given notice that it has published false information,\u201d the court concluded.", "Only Google, it seems, can fix Google.

He\u2019d just returned to the family\u2019s dingy second-floor apartment in Aurora, Ill., from the warehouse where he and his 19-year-old daughter, Sham, sorted boxes. At work, Mahmoud tried to keep her in sight. \u2018\u2018I saw how tired she was,\u2019\u2019 he continued. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s more than she can take.\u2019\u2019 Sham\u2019s English classes provided only a shaky foundation in the language, and she struggled to negotiate basic conversations. Mahmoud also spoke little English \u2014 we were sitting with an interpreter \u2014 but he could manage the essential. Mahmoud work tomorrow, Mahmoud no work tomorrow, he said in self-parody. But he, too, was tired. He rolled up his sweatpants to reveal a swollen leg. In Syria, Mahmoud, 57, who once owned a flourishing locksmith business in the Emirates, would have already retired.", "\u2018\u2018We didn\u2019t expect it to be so expensive,\u2019\u2019 he said of life in Aurora, an industrial river town 41 miles from Chicago, where the al-Haj Alis arrived in March. \u2018\u2018What can we do?\u2019\u2019 The federal government and the nine nongovernmental agencies that help to relocate refugees in the United States select cities like Aurora because housing and jobs are readily available and the cost of living is relatively low. The al-Haj Alis also receive help with the rent from a local organization, the Syrian Community Network. Still, it isn\u2019t enough. Mahmoud and his wife, Azizeh, had been counting on their son Waseem, who is 27 and trained as a psychologist, to help support the family. His wife, Noorhan, and their two young sons were supposed to be in Aurora, too. But, at the last minute, something went wrong with their application to resettle in America. Now they were stuck in Jordan.", "Mahmoud flipped through the spiral notebook in which he calculates monthly expenses: Internet, $52; garbage collection, $40; rent, $1,125; repayments on the United States government loan for the plane tickets from Amman to America, $172. Mahmoud went into his and Azizeh\u2019s bedroom and found the bill for the family\u2019s airfare: $6,130. \u2018\u2018Since I used to own a business, I like to record everything,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "Most nights, Mahmoud works at the warehouse until 11 before returning home with Sham. The al-Haj Alis\u2019 sons Ahmad and Mohamed arrive home around then, too, from six-hour after-school shifts at a local supermarket. Although they\u2019re twins, the boys, 17, dress and act as if they weren\u2019t. Mohamed, curls stiffened with gel, favors a tie. Ahmad, an artist, is often bed-headed and prefers sweatsuits. Every day he tucks a Syrian flag into his waistband before heading to West Aurora High School, despite the occasional trouble the flag invites. At the supermarket, he mans the cash register; he likes to interact with customers, in part to show off the Syrian identity to which he clings. Mohamed, who is shyer and speaks far less about Syria, prefers to herd the stray carts in the parking lot.", "Now, collapsed on the couch, the twins scrolled through homemade videos of Ahmad strolling around their new neighborhood in sunglasses and found footage showing the rubble of their hometown, 6,000 miles away. The al-Haj Ali family comes from Khirbet Ghazaleh, a town of 16,000. It is 15 miles from Daraa, where the revolution against Assad began, in 2011, after his security forces arrested and tortured a group of students for writing antigovernment slogans.", "The al-Haj Ali twins were only 13 at the time. They had nothing to do with the protests. Nor did anyone else in the immediate family. Although they listened to news reports of the Assad government\u2019s ferocious attacks on civilians, they saw little indication, at first, of the violence around them. There was the odd black helicopter in the sky. And once, when Waseem was taking Azizeh to driving school, they watched a group of protesters carrying olive branches stream out of Daraa. Only later did they realize these were people fleeing a massacre by Assad\u2019s forces.", "Then the airstrikes began. Government security forces raided the family\u2019s home dozens of times. Their cousins, who lived next door, were imprisoned and tortured. Still, the al-Haj Alis hung on; they adapted to living in a war zone, spending evenings in the dark. Then, one morning in August 2012, they learned from a television news report that Azizeh\u2019s brother, a high-ranking official in Assad\u2019s military, had defected overnight to Jordan. His family would most likely be punished, with death, in his stead. He hadn\u2019t warned them. He couldn\u2019t: His phone was bugged, and sending a message would only have further endangered them. The al-Haj Alis never slept at home again. Within days, they left Syria for Jordan by car. Azizeh feared they\u2019d be unable to make it across the border and was even more terrified that the names of her family members would be on a blacklist and that they would be arrested. Mahmoud handed their keys to a neighbor whose house had been flattened by airstrikes. \u2018\u2018If we\u2019re not back by sunset,\u2019\u2019 he told her, \u2018\u2018you can have our house.\u2019\u2019", "The war scattered the al-Haj Alis across the globe. Mahmoud, his wife, the twins and Sham made it to Aurora after a 30-month stay in Amman, Jordan. Two elder daughters, Rasha and Ruba, are in the Netherlands. Rasha arrived with her husband two years ago, and this fall Ruba followed. She and her three boys fled first to Morocco, then to Spain by boat, making their way on foot to an asylum center in the Nether\u00adlands, sharing a single room with two other families. (Ruba would like to bring her sons to America, but now that they are in a safe country, there is little chance of resettlement in the United States.) A third daughter, Rana, recently gave birth in Egypt; her 1-month-old is officially stateless. Another, Fatimah, is in Jordan. Yet the child of greatest concern to the family is their adult son, Waseem.", "The al-Haj Alis worry he may never make it to Aurora. The family had been in Illinois for eight months when ISIS attacked in Paris, killing 130 people. Early reports claimed that one of the terrorists made his way to Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee. European countries imposed new border restrictions, and 31 American governors, including the governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, called for a moratorium on Syrian refugees. In December, when a militant couple shot up a center for the disabled in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 and earning accolades from ISIS, the rhetoric grew more vociferous. A store clerk was shot in Michigan, a Somali restaurant was set ablaze in North Dakota and anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked around the United States.", "Azizeh wondered if she had brought her sons from Syria only to put them at risk in America, and if Waseem would ever join them now.", "The al-Haj Alis are five of the 2,647 Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the United States, roughly 0.06 percent of the more than 4.5 million driven from the country since the uprising began in 2011. The scale of the crisis is such that of the 20 million refugees flooding the world today, one in four is Syrian. Although President Obama has committed to bringing at least 10,000 more Syrians to the United States by this October, that number is still a trickle compared with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s effort to resettle 25,000 in Canada; Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s acceptance of nearly 93,000 in Germany last fall; and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s promise to bring 30,000 more Syrian refugees to France over the next two years. Why has the United States taken so few?", "\u2018\u2018It\u2019s extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee \u2014 the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better,\u2019\u2019 says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which helps place refugees from 40 countries in American cities. And Syrians are subject to an extra degree of vetting. Although all refugees are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other intelligence agencies, Syrians must complete what is known as the Enhanced Syrian Review. This is an added screening by caseworkers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, which assesses each Syrian case and selects some for processing through the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate office. This extra step was put in place because of the difficulty of assessing the allegiances of the various rebel groups in Syria\u2019s continuing war \u2014 what Barbara Strack, chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, describes as \u2018\u2018the myriad actors and dynamic nature of the conflict.\u2019\u2019", "Until recently, Syria\u2019s refugees were not a pressing domestic political concern. To many Americans, the war in Syria seemed remote, a problem for Syria\u2019s neighbors. Of greater import were the 11 million immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Then last summer, images of the Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi lying dead on the Turkish shore mobilized American sympathies in favor of refugees, and the Obama administration found itself faulted for admitting so few. Quietly, President Obama directed Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to work with the State Department to find out why vetting for Syrian refugees required 18 to 24 months.", "McDonough, known for urging Obama to be cautious in engaging militarily in Syria, took the issue of refugees personally. As a Catholic growing up in Stillwater, Minn., the 10th of 11 children, he worked with his church to help arriving Vietnamese refugees. Now, carrying a stack of charts and graphs, he met with refugee advocates and members of Congress to learn about the pitfalls and procedural bottlenecks within the resettlement program and to study potential means of bringing Syrians more quickly to the United States without compromising on security. In closed-door National Security Council meetings last year, he advised State Department officials to lift bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, the United States has opened up refugee-processing centers in new locations that refugees can actually reach, including one in Erbil, in northern Iraq. By streamlining the process of resettling Syrian refugees, the Obama administration also hoped to demonstrate support for its European allies. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s important to the president\u2019s view to show our allies overseas, who are taking a considerable influx of Syrians, that we support them and we\u2019re doing our part,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me recently.", "Paris threatened to change everything. The Syrian passport found near the body of one mili\u00adtant turned out to be a fake, but at least two of the attackers had exploited the refugee routes from the Middle East to Europe. Overnight, the global good will toward refugees that had been building all but vanished. Suddenly, the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees heading north inspired not empathy but alarm. According to the Soufan Group, a New York-based company that provides security-intelligence services, between 27,000 and 31,000 foreign fighters have gone to Iraq or Syria since the start of Syria\u2019s civil war, the vast majority to fight alongside ISIS. At least 10 percent have headed back home. What once seemed like a trickle of vulnerable civilians now looked, to some, like a potentially dangerous flood.", "Republican presidential candidates seized on the Syrian refugee issue as proof that Obama wasn\u2019t keeping Americans safe. Dr. Ben Carson conflated Syrian refugees with \u2018\u2018rabid dogs.\u2019\u2019 Jeb Bush called for deprioritizing Muslim refugees from the Middle East in favor of Christians. Senator Ted Cruz echoed this sentiment, proclaiming that Muslims should be sent to \u2018\u2018Muslim-majority\u2019\u2019 countries while \u2018\u2018Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them.\u2019\u2019 Donald Trump upped the ante by calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.", "In November, Republicans and some Democrats rallied behind House Bill 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, introduced by Representative Michael T. McCaul of Texas to slow the arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States. Days before the House vote, McDonough and Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security, briefed members of Congress on the Syrian-refugee-resettlement program and its screening process, in an attempt to reassure them that such a measure was unnecessary. The House nonetheless voted in favor of the bill, and as 2015 drew to a close, the Syrian refugee issue was at risk of becoming part of the year-end omnibus bill amid discussions of a government shutdown.", "In the face of mounting political opposition, the president, in a choreographed Trudeau-esque gesture at the National Archives in Washington, welcomed 31 people from 25 countries at their citizenship ceremony. In private, McDonough rang up supporters and opponents alike. \u2018\u2018Every phone call I\u2019ve had with my friends on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat, and with governors around the country, I\u2019ve underscored that we recognize the fear,\u2019\u2019 McDonough told me. He spoke of the need to \u2018\u2018send a message\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018the Assad regime and to ISIL that the United States will continue to play the role that it has, that the world has become accustomed to it playing \u2014 mainly the role of alleviating suffering at the source and of being a refuge for the most vulnerable people.\u2019\u2019", "The Syrian crisis is often described as a crisis of migration, but that\u2019s not how it began. \u2018\u2018This exodus didn\u2019t come out of nowhere,\u2019\u2019 says Dr. Zaher Sahloul, senior adviser for the Syrian American Medical Society. The war in Syria has left some 250,000 people dead and displaced millions. And Syrian-American activists often refer to it as Obama\u2019s Rwanda. \u2018\u2018From Day 1 of the Syrian catastrophe,\u2019\u2019 says Bassam Barabandi, co-founder of the organization People Demand Change, \u2018\u2018the U.S. started signing checks to the U.N., but they missed the point.\u2019\u2019 The point, he said, is ending the war, not creating a welfare state made up of refugees.", "\u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a zero-sum choice,\u2019\u2019 Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken, who served as Obama\u2019s national security adviser before returning to the State Department, where he began his career, has been asked by the White House to handle the thorny refugee issue. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re working 36 hours a day to solve the war in Syria,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018but meanwhile, what do you do about the huge immediate challenge of more than four million people displaced from their country?\u2019\u2019", "For millions of Syrians, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have become vast waiting rooms. \u2018\u2018The two biggest drivers of onward migration are lack of access to education and lack of access to work,\u2019\u2019 Blinken told me recently, at the United States Embassy in Amman. The United States frequently trumpets the fact that of the countries donating to the United Nations in support of Syrian refugees, it gives the most aid, much of it going to front-line countries. But this is in part a self-serving strategy. The United States supports Syria\u2019s neighbors so that they can withstand the pressures of millions of additional people. Refugees place a large burden on natural resources and social services. As a result, relations between Syrians and their hosts are souring. (Jordanians, groaning under the burden of 633,000 refugees, joke darkly that they live \u2018\u2018between Iraq and a hard place.\u2019\u2019) Part of American strategy in the region has been to ease tensions between Syrians and their hosts. The United States provides services (schools and hospitals) for the refugees as well as for the citizens of host countries. They also allocate money for development to keep the host country happy. In Jordan, Blinken had just attended a falafel lunch with Jordanian venture capitalists who started a fund, with United States government support, to incubate technology start-ups.", "Resettlement in the United States, however, remains a political challenge. \u2018\u2018This is where ISIL neatly joins the problem,\u2019\u2019 Blinken said. \u2018\u2018Very few of the refugees we admit are young males without families \u2014 we focus on women, children, the sick and those vulnerable to violence. But you now have this new concern that these refugee populations will somehow be infiltrated by terrorists.\u2019\u2019 In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, European countries hardened their stance on refugees, making illegal migration more difficult by closing borders. (For the first time in 50 years, for instance, those crossing between Denmark and Sweden have to show photo ID.) Turkey is under pressure to do the same. Recently, after receiving promises of $3.25 billion in aid from the E.U., Turkey reportedly arrested 1,300 asylum seekers trying to cross the sea to Greece.", "The refugees already in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are more likely to be stuck there, which means that a humanitarian crisis is becoming an economic-development problem. Syrians, many of whom lived sophisticated lives, are often unable to access even the most basic services. \u2018\u2018These are people who had microwaves and cars, and now they\u2019re in tin boxes in the desert,\u2019\u2019 says Jonathan Campbell of the World Food Program. The key factor in their migration is hopelessness. This past fall, the W.F.P. sent text messages to 230,000 Syrians living in Jordan to tell them that their food benefits were going to be substantially reduced because of lack of funding and donor fatigue. (They were later restored.) Although the United States made a large pledge, other countries, facing financial crises at home, did not. As a result, 64 percent of the refugees told the W.F.P. they were going to be forced to leave the country. One family out of every four took a child out of school to work. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not a pull factor that makes them move, it\u2019s a push factor,\u2019\u2019 says Myriam Baele, head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees\u2019 refugee-resettlement unit in Jordan. \u2018\u2018If there isn\u2019t a means to survive here, they will go,\u2019\u2019 she went on. \u2018\u2018Either to Europe or back to Syria, where they will die.\u2019\u2019", "Waseem al-Haj Ali and his wife, Noorhan, keep two blue suitcases packed in the apartment they once shared with their family in Amman. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a nightmare,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said on a recent evening. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no future here in Jordan. I can\u2019t even get a driver\u2019s license.\u2019\u2019 In exasperation, he raised his eyebrows, bushy like his father\u2019s. The apartment\u2019s peeling walls were covered in blue and purple flowers, drawn by his brother Ahmad before he left for America.", "Early last spring in Amman, when the al-Haj Alis were all still together, Waseem, Noorhan and their sons, who are 4 and 2, cleared the Enhanced Syrian Review and completed four days of cul\u00adtural-orientation classes \u2014 which include everything from pictures of what to pack (warm clothing and money) and what not to (weapons and illegal drugs) to the importance Americans place on such concepts as punctuality and pri\u00advacy. These courses are offered only to those who are in the process of resettling in the United States. Noorhan, who had been studying in Syria to become a teacher and whose dark eyes glitter with an easy intelligence, paid special attention to the weather. \u2018\u2018Arizona is like the gulf,\u2019\u2019 she recalled learning. \u2018\u2018Hot, dry and full of snakes.\u2019\u2019", "Ten days before Waseem and his family were scheduled to leave, they had completed everything but their medical exams. Then they received a call from the Americans: They couldn\u2019t go just yet. Something had come up in their security clearance, Waseem recalled being told. In retrospect, Waseem\u2019s parents wonder if they should have waited for him. The plan had always been for Waseem to support the family: Azizeh had three ruptured disks and needed back surgery; Mahmoud had an old leg injury. But if the al-Haj Alis had delayed and lost their place in line, they might never have gotten to America. Waseem now feels guilty that he encouraged them to go ahead. He wasn\u2019t sure his parents could make it without him. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m trying to be patient for my parents,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it weren\u2019t for them, I would\u2019ve already left.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018If we don\u2019t get a call from the Americans before smuggling season begins in the spring, we\u2019ll leave for Europe,\u2019\u2019 he went on. The last thing he and his wife wanted to do was take two toddlers over the sea. Like everyone else, they had seen the photos of Alan on the beach. Their children couldn\u2019t swim, and neither could Noorhan. But what choice did they have?", "\u2018\u2018We think only about traveling,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018All we want is to go the United States.\u2019\u2019 Day after day, he checked the news on Facebook and chatted with his mother in Aurora. \u2018\u2018We hope to live in a simple house, with a car outside, and just to watch our kids grow up,\u2019\u2019 Noorhan said. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want a palace or some luxury life.\u2019\u2019", "When the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn\u2019t dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refu\u00adgees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. \u2018\u2018My father used to be a wealthy man,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud\u2019s locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone.", "Among Syrian refugees, \u2018\u2018on hold\u2019\u2019 is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem\u2019s case \u2018\u2018is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\u2019\u2019", "Officials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant\u2019s security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem\u2019s name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, \u2018\u2018recurrent vetting\u2019\u2019 raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: \u2018\u2018If you have an 800 credit score and you\u2019re good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card.\u2019\u2019", "Or maybe it was Azizeh\u2019s brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not looking for beauty or history,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m looking for a country with human rights and freedom.\u2019\u2019 Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh\u2019s brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support \u2014 which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride \u2014 to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States.", "As months passed with no answers, Waseem turned over the strange questions he was asked during his final interview. Could these hold the key to the predicament in which he now found himself? Did he intend to commit terrorism in the United States? No. Did he intend to visit a prostitute in the United States? No. Refugees often refer to questions like the last one as \u2018\u2018the crazy questions,\u2019\u2019 a senior immigration official told me: queries that, by law, immigration officials must ask to determine grounds of inadmissibility, even though they\u2019re anachronistic. Others include Are you a member of the Nazi Party? and Are you a habitual drunkard?", "The system of vetting refugees was first overhauled after Sept. 11. Since then, America\u2019s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and conflicts in Africa and Asia have led to further refinements in how the United States evaluates refugees. Since 2007, for instance, the Defense Department has worked with the Homeland Security Department to share its intelligence on Iraqis, who represent one of the largest influxes of refugees to the United States in the last decade (more than 85,000 since 2008). Many won the right to apply for admission to the United States after risking their lives to aid American soldiers. Yet, as these Iraqis began to arrive, opposition to resettling them was swift. It began, for the most part, with fringe groups. Ann Corcoran, a conservative from rural Maryland, started a blog called Refugee Resettlement Watch, in which she chronicles news re\u00adlated to Muslims and others arriving in the United States. She warns that Muslims are coming to build \u2018\u2018cities within cities\u2019\u2019 and to establish Shariah law in America. Corcoran told me that in Iowa last spring, she handed her book, \u2018\u2018Refugee Resettlement and Hijra to America,\u2019\u2019 directly to Donald Trump.", "Resettling refugees isn\u2019t a perfect process. \u2018\u2018No immigration program is completely without risk,\u2019\u2019 a senior intelligence officer says. Yet over more than a decade, the United States agencies involved in the program have learned to communicate more effectively. \u2018\u2018We got a lot smarter and developed additional relationships with the intelligence community beginning with the large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007,\u2019\u2019 Strack, of U.S.C.I.S., says. She adds, \u2018\u2018We are the opposite of stove-piped \u2014 we\u2019re incredibly networked.\u2019\u2019", "One common misconception about how a Syrian refugee comes to America is that she simply approaches the United States Embassy in Jordan or Turkey or wherever she first lands. This is not how resettlement works. To be legally designated a refugee, she must first apply to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. U.N.H.C.R. takes a photograph and scans her iris. Verification can take anywhere from a couple of months to a few years before she\u2019s interviewed in person. Although these interviews aren\u2019t considered security vetting, caseworkers are trained to eliminate those who may be lying, as well as those who have persecuted others or may be war criminals.", "In addition to collecting biometric data like iris scans and photographs, U.N.H.C.R. case officers are trained in basic facial recognition and have 2-D screening capabilities to detect fake passports. The goal is to make sure people meet the criteria of the refugee convention, established after World War II. They\u2019re also experts in country-of-origin information. \u2018\u2018Listen, I know where your school is, I know the colors of its walls,\u2019\u2019 one U.N.H.C.R. officer says. \u2018\u2018We detect lies based on what\u2019s happened in the country of origin. It\u2019s not just hour-by-hour events; it\u2019s ethnicity, region, family. We know the custom \u2014 we know what their dresses look like.\u2019\u2019", "U.N.H.C.R. then advocates for the most vulnerable 10 percent; the other 90 percent will have to make a new life as best they can. Of the 20 million refugees worldwide, less than 1 percent will be officially resettled, and of those, the United States takes about half. Resettlement is only one of three options. The others are returning home (which, for most Syrians, is impossible) or remaining in the host country (which, given the pressures Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are under, is becoming increasingly difficult). Those either barred or \u2018\u2018deprioritized\u2019\u2019 include individuals with certain military ties, as well as families with missing members. This is to guard against the possibility that the missing member may be fighting alongside an anti-American group like ISIS and later try to rejoin his family.", "Syrians, like other refugees, don\u2019t choose the country they end up in. U.N.H.C.R. selects the best option based on various criteria specified by host countries, like those from the most vulnerable groups or victims of torture. But there are limits to the requests countries can make. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re not a labor department,\u2019\u2019 a senior U.N.H.C.R. official said. \u2018\u2018If countries come to us asking for a particular religion, we don\u2019t encourage that.\u2019\u2019", "All of this takes place before U.N.H.C.R. refers the case to any one country. Once U.N.H.C.R. provides a complete file to the United States, then the applicant\u2019s entire family visits the State Department\u2019s Resettlement Support Center for a prescreening interview. At this point, each individual is run through several databases, including ones at the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense, and entered into the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System, which warehouses the data and facilitates interagency screening checks. A pilot program will soon include iris scans, which are currently used by U.N.H.C.R. only for identification, not security purposes.", "This fall, in several closed-door classified briefings before Congress and in public hearings, Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, defended the rigorous vetting process. Of the more than 784,000 refugees who have been admitted to the United States in the last 14 years, five have been arrested on terrorism-related charges: One was an Uzbek man arrested in Idaho; the other four were refugees from Iraq. Such mistakes have provided fodder for those who worry that the country is exposing itself to needless risk. \u2018\u2018ISIS has vowed to send its operatives into the West posing as refugees,\u2019\u2019 says McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. \u2018\u2018The threat is real.\u2019\u2019 Advocates say that the threat of a refugee being a terrorist is statistically negligible. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t leave holes, and we don\u2019t take chances,\u2019\u2019 Richard told me. \u2018\u2018If there\u2019s any doubt about someone, they don\u2019t come.\u2019\u2019 Indeed, as Le\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez, director of U.S.C.I.S., recently testified in Congress, the United States has barred 30 individuals from entering \u2018\u2018based on their showing up in the databases.\u2019\u2019 (When queried, a senior intelligence official would say only that there were individuals of \u2018\u2018national security concern.\u2019\u2019) Emily Gray, the executive director in Aurora of World Relief, a branch of the agency assigned by the United States government to help resettle the al-Haj Ali family, says, \u2018\u2018You\u2019d have to be a really stupid terrorist to come this way.\u2019\u2019", "After the U.S.C.I.S. officers in Washington conduct the enhanced review, the entire family is scheduled for another interview with a member of the Refugee Affairs Division, a team of 10 to 14 immigration officers from U.S.C.I.S. who spend six weeks on \u2018\u2018circuit rides\u2019\u2019 \u2014 traveling up to four times a year to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other locations in the region, interviewing refugees being considered for resettlement in the United States.", "\u2018\u2018Just having an interview doesn\u2019t sound so secure, but this is one heck of an interview,\u2019\u2019 Richard says. \u2018\u2018First off, refugees are people fleeing tyrannical governments, so they may not trust people in positions of authority. They may be used to lying. They have to be prepared to have this interview, and if they\u2019re caught lying, then they\u2019re not going to make it, no matter how worthy.\u2019\u2019 At the end of this process, there are four possible outcomes: immediate acceptance, which is rare and can still involve waiting another 18 months, especially if there is a new marriage or birth; acceptance pending verification; denial; and the limbo into which Waseem al-Haj Ali and his family have now fallen, \u2018\u2018on hold.\u2019\u2019", "From Jordan, one afternoon late this fall, Waseem called his mother in Chicago. \u2018\u2018How are you?\u2019\u2019 he asked. He hadn\u2019t anticipated her reply. She was fine, thank God, she said, but there was something wrong at the twins\u2019 school. The night before, she received a call from the school saying there would be police there the next day and it was fine if the boys stayed home. She wasn\u2019t sure what that meant or if other Syrians had received the same call. Azizeh sent the boys anyway. They survived airstrikes and house-to-house raids by Assad\u2019s security forces; they could face American high school. \u2018\u2018Oh,\u2019\u2019 Waseem said, and hung up. He and Noorhan were taken aback. What if, after all they had endured, his parents or Sham or the twins were hurt in America? Waseem was the one who was supposed to protect them, and all he could do was sit on the couch in Amman and accept handouts from his father.", "\u2018\u2018The worst thing is this game of waiting,\u2019\u2019 Issam Smeir, a psychologist in Aurora with World Relief who has counseled the al-Haj Alis, says. \u2018\u2018It kills your soul.\u2019\u2019", "The situation unfolding at West Aurora High wasn\u2019t quite as Azizeh understood it. Ron Murphy, an assistant principal of operations at the high school, explained that yes, the Aurora police were called in as a precaution (Mohamed even snapped a selfie with an officer). But it had nothing to do with the boys. After a student tweeted his support for Trump and Trump\u2019s stance on immigration, a Twitter war broke out. Even though there was no credible threat, the school took steps to reassure parents and defuse the situation. More than half of the school\u2019s population is Hispanic.", "The issue was immigration, not Islam, Murphy said. The school district models diversity remarkably; the twins were enrolled alongside Iraqis, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and immigrants from 57 countries in a curriculum for students learning English. Ahmad and Mohamed grumbled about it; these kids were uncool, and they only saw regular Americans during gym class.", "Outside school, the opposition to Syrian refugees wore on: In nearby Indiana, a Syrian family had to be rerouted to Connecticut because of the governor\u2019s opposition. In an attempt to block the arrival of another Syrian family, Texas sued the International Rescue Committee, the resettlement agency working with that family, as well as the federal government.", "In Congress, as the year drew to a close, House Bill 4038, which would have barred Syr\u00adian refugees, at least for a time, never came to the floor of the Senate, nor was it part of the omnibus \u2014 a pair of victories for McDonough and the White House. Instead, the mass shooting in San Bernardino refocused national security concerns on the visa-waiver program, which the administration had long seen as a problem.", "In January 2016, even as rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key players in the war in Syria, imperiled upcoming cease-fire negotiations at the U.N. The Senate stood poised to consider new legislation that would halt the arrival of Syrian refugees. \u2018\u2018We cannot stand by while jihadists try to exploit humanitarian programs to reach our shores undetected,\u2019\u2019 Michael McCaul, who sponsored 4038, said, citing serious screening gaps. Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, who recently introduced a similar bill in the Senate, also supports such legislation. \u2018\u2018Reputable media outlets are uncovering examples of how terrorists infiltrate the Iraq and Syria refugee programs in an effort to commit acts of violence against the American people and our allies,\u2019\u2019 Kirk said. \u2018\u2018Common sense requires thoughtful measures to keep Americans safe.\u2019\u2019", "One winter afternoon, not long after the incident at the boys\u2019 school, Azizeh nursed a cup of tea and talked bleakly of the family\u2019s future. What if the governor had the power to keep Waseem out of Illinois? And if he couldn\u2019t come, what would they do? Then there were the boys. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m worried someone will target them,\u2019\u2019 she said.", "She also worried about herself and Sham. The long coats and hijabs they wore when they went out might attract the wrong kind of attention. Sham had come to America at the worst age possible. At 19, she wasn\u2019t eligible to attend high school, and her English was too poor to pursue her dreams of becoming a lawyer. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s too expensive,\u2019\u2019 Sham said. \u2018\u2018It would take too many years.\u2019\u2019", "To secure a future for her, her parents had accepted the marriage proposal of an Iraqi used-car salesman named Layth Alali, Azizeh told me. Fifteen years older than Sham, Alali came to the country on a much-coveted Special Immigrant Visa in 2010, as part of the group of Iraqis who had worked with the United States military. (In Baghdad, he was the head of a checkpoint set up by the Americans.) The whole thing was rushed; he had asked just two weeks earlier, and the engagement ceremony was taking place immediately.", "After picking Sham and Azizeh up in a BMW S.U.V., Alali drove them to a prom-dress shop in Aurora, and they had less than an hour to find a dress. Sham picked out a spangled strapless confection, but Azizeh worried it exposed too much flesh. \u2018\u2018Problem, problem, problem,\u2019\u2019 she said, pointing to her daughter\u2019s bare neck, arms and shoulders. In the end, she snapped a picture and sent it via WhatsApp to her daughter-in-law, Noorhan, who was, as usual, sitting idle in the apartment in Jordan. A few seconds later, Noorhan sent back a smiley-face emoji with hearts for eyes. The dress, however flawed, was a yes.", "In a life marked by disappointment and compromise, Azizeh remarked, what did the dress really matter? As a married woman, Sham would be more secure, and so would her family. At least, Azizeh said, Sham would no longer have to work in the office-supply warehouse.", "The family had other concerns. The boys needed hundreds of dollars of dental work that Medicaid didn\u2019t cover. The al-Haj Alis were struggling to make the rent, and winter was coming, which meant a new bill for heating. Azizeh was trying to figure out what kind of program might help pay the gas bill. As the temperature dropped and it grew dark at 4:30 in the afternoon, Ahmad and Mohamed seemed to be slowing down; Azizeh had to prod them off the couch to get them to work at the market.", "School was still a challenge. After nearly a year, neither spoke enough English to hold a conversation. Unlike their fellow refugees, who learned English by watching television and American movies, the boys preferred to spend their downtime watching Arabic-language news about Syria or YouTube videos from home.", "For a long time, when they looked on Google Earth, they could see the debris of their family\u2019s homes, which had been either burned or bombed. Now a mysterious white film obscured satellite images of the town. Was it a glitch, or a security measure on the part of the Assad regime to protect this strategic town, which now serves as a military base?", "If Ahmad and Mohamed had stayed in Syria, they might be dead by now \u2014 either killed by the Assad government\u2019s barrel bombs or fallen among the young men who have joined up with the Free Syrian Army. When one of their friends or cousins fighting with the F.S.A. is killed, the boys study the photographs of his death, often posted on Facebook in tribute, with a mixture of envy and guilt.", "Issam Smeir, the World Relief counselor, met with the al-Haj Ali family to help them handle the psychological stress of Waseem\u2019s unexpected absence. He was watching for signs of depression in the boys. \u2018\u2018Depression in kids doesn\u2019t look like sadness,\u2019\u2019 Smeir said. \u2018\u2018It looks like restlessness and anger.\u2019\u2019 The biggest argument that Ahmad has had at school involved fellow Syrians who support the Assad regime. The two sides got into a fight over which flag was the true Syrian flag \u2014 the one belonging to the Assad regime, or the revolutionary flag that Ahmad tucks into his waistband.", "\u2018\u2018Students ask about what Syria was like before the war,\u2019\u2019 Ahmad said at home after work one evening. \u2018\u2018We say it was beautiful. It\u2019s kind of baffling how people feel that the value of those who die in France is higher than those who die in countries like Iraq or Syria.\u2019\u2019 That day at school, during their first-period English class, their reading-comprehension portion involved a lesson about Cappadocia, Turkey, where people built an underground city to protect themselves during invasions. Afterward, the teacher handed out work sheets quizzing the kids on what they had learned. Why did people in Turkey live underground? The answer was B: to hide from their enemies. But Ahmad circled C: to live.", "Three days later, a text came in from Noorhan. More American politicians were opposing Syrians, and what she and Waseem had been reading on Facebook made them think the United States was shutting its borders tighter than ever. It looked as if they were going to have to take their boys over the sea. \u2018\u2018After all the news,\u2019\u2019 she wrote, \u2018\u2018we have no hope to travel to America.\u2019\u2019"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/business/dealbook/alphabet-close-to-overtaking-apple-as-most-valuable-company.html": ["Alphabet could soon become the most valuable company in the world.", "The Google powerhouse traded on Friday morning with an equity value above $500 billion, less than 10 percent shy of Apple\u2019s value.

The websites of major airlines allow passengers to sign up for information about trip changes, be it through texts, emails or notifications from their smartphone app. However, it\u2019s not unusual for third-party apps to relay such information faster than the airlines themselves. For that reason, I have TripIt Pro, an app ($49 a year) that has pinged me about gate and flight changes before the airline itself.

If there\u2019s another flight leaving soon, it probably makes sense to have the airline put you on it. (Keep in mind that it\u2019s easier to get on a flight at the very last minute if you\u2019re not checking bags.) Another option is to pocket the refund and, if you can, buy a cheaper one-way flight on another airline. Or use the refund money toward some other form of transportation to get where you\u2019re going.

The topic \u2014 \u2018\u2018What does the Bible say about why Christians need to be involved in the political arena?\u2019\u2019 \u2014 was one of his favorites, and notably appropriate for a school founded by Jerry Falwell, who also founded Moral Majority, the once-powerful political action committee. Over the course of a 30-minute speech that touched on everything from the need for school prayer to the similarities between President Obama\u2019s Washington and Fidel Castro\u2019s Havana, the question of why slowly gave way to the question of who. The pastor concluded by telling his audience, \u2018\u2018God is saying to you: \u2018Vote for righteous people.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "In retrospect, the pastor\u2019s speech that day might be seen as the first (albeit subtle) public move in the eventual bid for the presidency by his son. Already Ted Cruz\u2019s strategists were discussing a run. His longtime adviser Jason Johnson would go on to spend most of 2014 researching how Republicans had won and lost presidential elections, while the senator appeared at various Iowa fund-raising events. When word began to circulate in March 2015 that Marco Rubio and Rand Paul would be announcing their candidacies sometime in April, by the end of the Senate recess, Cruz\u2019s game plan started to emerge. They set their sights on a date in late March, which would allow Cruz to dominate the news and draw a quick infusion of campaign money for at least a week before attention turned to Rubio and Paul. Needing to move quickly, and not wanting to tip off the opposition, Cruz\u2019s senior staff sought out a telegenic venue where a heavily conservative audience could be assembled on a moment\u2019s notice.", "That was how, 16 months after his father took the stage there, Ted Cruz became the first politician to launch a presidential campaign at Liberty \u2014 the largest Christian university in the world, with an enrollment of 77,000 students. His March 23 speech, which he hand-scribbled the evening before and delivered without benefit of notes or a teleprompter, included this pivotal thought: \u2018\u2018Today, roughly half of born-again Christians aren\u2019t voting. They\u2019re staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values.\u2019\u2019 That exhortation, an echo of his father\u2019s plea to \u2018\u2018vote for righteous people,\u2019\u2019 reflected the Cruz team\u2019s key political calculation: Of the 22 states that will be casting their ballots for a Republican nominee between Feb. 1 and March 5, 11 of them feature a Republican electorate that is more than 50 percent evangelical. Even more significant, the first state to vote is Iowa, roughly 60 percent of whose Republican caucus-goers describe themselves as evangelical Christians. As had been the case in recent election cycles, if Cruz could persuade this voting bloc to coalesce around him, then in this crowded field of Republican candidates he would almost certainly emerge the winner in Iowa. And unlike previous caucus winners, Cruz was already building a formidable national campaign organization that could capitalize on an Iowa victory and propel him toward the nomination.", "One morning early in January, in the lobby of a public library in Onawa, Iowa, I listened to Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, as he explained a central challenge of his previous few months. \u2018\u2018Prior to March 23,\u2019\u2019 Roe said, \u2018\u2018if you were to word-cloud \u2018Ted Cruz,\u2019 which we do every day \u2014 take all the Google mentions and Internet searches, dump them into a file and form a cloud \u2014 you can\u2019t find \u2018evangelical.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 In other words, voters were largely unaware of the Tea Party firebrand\u2019s religious faith. To convince evangelicals that Ted Cruz was the \u2018\u2018righteous\u2019\u2019 candidate, Roe told me, his team needed to sell him as such, from the very beginning: \u2018\u2018Regardless of what you\u2019ve got in the bank, you\u2019d better determine the narrative of the campaign, and show that\u2019s who we are, every day.\u2019\u2019", "Behind the scenes, Cruz and his team were in fevered competition with Rubio, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum to lock down the evangelical vote. The Cruz campaign courted movement leaders like Dr. James Dobson, who formally endorsed Cruz on Dec. 17 and joined the candidate on the Iowa campaign trail soon after. Eleven days after Dobson\u2019s endorsement, the Texas political activist and longtime Cruz supporter David Barton gathered about 300 \u2018\u2018faith leaders\u2019\u2019 for a meet-and-greet with Cruz at the ranch of the Republican billionaire Farris Wilks in Cisco, Tex. \u2018\u2018He was with them six hours, and about an hour and 20 minutes of that was nothing but prayer, and Ted was right in the middle of it,\u2019\u2019 Barton told me. \u2018\u2018The spiritual leaders wanted to pray for the country, and he was completely comfortable with that, and that was a pleasant surprise to many of them.\u2019\u2019", "As a fund-raiser, Ted Cruz has given victory-starved evangelicals some cause to believe that his campaign is, as the Iowa conservative talk radio host and Cruz supporter Steve Deace puts it, \u2018\u2018superior to what we\u2019ve seen from any other movement conservative that\u2019s ever run for the presi\u00addency.\u2019\u2019 Cruz has raised over $50 million from more than 600,000 donations, including those from the Wilks brothers of Texas, who also have given $15 million to Cruz\u2019s super PAC: all numbers that establish him as a top-tier candidate. He has built large campaign organizations in the states immediately following Iowa \u2014 New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 and has also traveled extensively through the March 1 \u2018\u2018Super Tuesday\u2019\u2019 states of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma. Though his team is not staffed with the sort of elite Republican operatives who work for Rubio and Jeb Bush, it has thus far waged one of the most professional and error-free campaigns in the field.", "The results of these efforts will become manifest on Feb. 1, when Iowa Republican voters will settle the current hard-fought contest between Cruz and Donald Trump. Trump poses a threat to Cruz\u2019s presidential ambitions because, unlike the Texan, he does not seem to possess an electoral playbook, and instead can get by with something Cruz lacks: a lot of potential voters seem to like him and are titillated by the idea of him as president. Exactly two weeks before the Iowa caucus, when Trump himself spoke at Liberty University, he botched a Bible quotation and, against university rules, uttered a profanity, two miscues that Cruz would never commit. All the same, Liberty\u2019s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., declared that \u2018\u2018Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air,\u2019\u2019 and Trump has pulled ahead of Cruz in some national polls of evangelical voters.", "But Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, Roe \u2014 a beefy veteran operative from Kansas City, Mo., with narrow, gleaming eyes \u2014 told me that by at least one unit of measurement, their tactics were already working. \u2018\u2018In the word clouds we used to do before he announced, the words that always came up were \u2018Texas,\u2019 \u2018Tea Party,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Roe said confidently. \u2018\u2018Now it\u2019s \u2018Christian,\u2019 \u2018evangelical,\u2019 \u2018conservative,\u2019 \u2018leader,\u2019 \u2018strong.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "Early on a Friday morning in January, two dozen Cruz campaign volunteers gathered in the stairwell of their temporary sleeping quarters at a former college dorm near Des Moines International Airport and bowed their heads in prayer. A leader of the volunteers, Ken Brolin, a white-haired veteran of Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 run, said in a quiet voice: \u2018\u2018Many of us pray and believe that when we are diligent and have our hands behind the plow, that you are going to honor and bless that diligence, Lord, and allow us to have this man that we have a heart for \u2014 that we believe is your man \u2014 to step into the White House. And Father, we would thank you so much for that.\u2019\u2019 Brolin concluded by asking: \u2018\u2018Let every appointment with these undecided voters be the time that you want us to talk to them. And Lord, please allocate patience for everyone else that doesn\u2019t agree with us.\u2019\u2019", "The last remark provoked knowing chortles in the stairwell. The volunteers came from 26 different states, but the plurality of them were Texans. The undecided Iowa voters they met on doorsteps or on the phone often commented on their unmistakable accents. The volunteers would acknowledge their origins and then say: \u2018\u2018Well, is there anything we can tell you about Ted? Because we\u2019re from Texas, and we know him really well.\u2019\u2019 As one of them, Maggie Wright \u2014 a 70-year-old from the Fort Worth area who made her rounds in a sedan painted with portraits of Cruz \u2014 recounted to me: \u2018\u2018We say: \u2018Well, we know Ted\u2019s positions. He\u2019s for states\u2019 rights, for all the Constitution, he will not allow us to bash the gays but won\u2019t let anybody do jihad on the Christians.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "Though Cruz must do well in Iowa to establish momentum in the other early caucuses and primaries, the state in recent history has been a dubious springboard to national success. Since 1976, three winners of Iowa\u2019s contested Republican caucuses have ultimately gained the national party\u2019s nomination, but only one \u2014 George W. Bush, in 2000 \u2014 went on to become president. The last two caucus winners, Huckabee in 2008 and Santorum in 2012, managed to rally Iowa\u2019s social conservatives but lacked both the resources and the breadth of support to compete against John McCain and Mitt Romney, whose campaign themes were less pitched to the Christian right.", "And so the Cruz campaign has sought to assure Iowa evangelical leaders of two things: that Cruz is one of them, and that he can win the presidency. In return, Cruz\u2019s campaign team has sought from Iowa evangelical leaders not only their endorsement but also their commitment to rally congregants to the polls. Leading this effort has been Rafael Cruz, who since his son\u2019s announcement has spent 29 days in Iowa, talking to fellow evangelical ministers in groups ranging from 25 to 350.", "Bob Vander Plaats, a major evangelical activist in Iowa, told me, \u2018\u2018Evangelicals have really felt a great need to have one of the their own in the White House, and the last couple of election cycles they\u2019ve frankly felt a bit used.\u2019\u2019 He went on to say that in the general election, \u2018\u2018we\u2019ve gone with the guy who can win, but let\u2019s not talk about principles and wink-wink he\u2019ll deliver once he\u2019s there. And I think you now see that frustration in the huge numbers who stay home on Election Day.\u2019\u2019 Vander Plaats has enthusiastically endorsed Cruz; he says the conventional wisdom regarding an evangelical nominee can be proved wrong.", "\u2018\u2018When you run a true conservative like Ronald Reagan, you\u2019re going to win,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018George W. Bush, who said his mentor was Jesus \u2014 you win. The past two elections, we\u2019ve been leaving millions of conservatives home, because they see no reason to vote. Not this time. Now we have a full-spectrum conservative in Ted Cruz. This is a base election, and everyone knows it. And I think he crushes Hillary.\u2019\u2019", "What unites the evangelical bloc with the rest of the Republican base is a shared hostility toward not only those they see as antagonists to the American way of life \u2014 ISIS, undocumented immigrants, apostles of political correctness \u2014 but also their perceived appeasers in Washington. It\u2019s for this reason that many conservative Christians find themselves drawn to the outsider Trump, despite the latter\u2019s shaky command of Scripture. And this is also why it\u2019s not enough for Ted Cruz to brandish his evangelical credentials in order to win in Iowa and beyond. He must also remind Republicans that his biography is that of a proud foe of the political establishment.", "It\u2019s a notable feature of Cruz\u2019s political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that he became an outsider only after the insiders rebuffed him. He first materialized in the political world as a domestic-policy adviser for the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush. He quickly became known for his arrogance and ambition: One story was that he introduced himself to a colleague with the proclamation, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m Ted Cruz, and I\u2019m going to be Texas\u2019s first Hispanic governor.\u2019\u2019 Little of today\u2019s ideological staunchness was apparent back then. As one of the Bush campaign\u2019s top officials recalls of him: \u2018\u2018Conservative? Yes. Principled conservative torchbearer fighting the fight in the bowels of the campaign? Nope.\u2019\u2019", "Cruz wrote in his 2015 autobiography, \u2018\u2018A Time for Truth,\u2019\u2019 that it was \u2018\u2018a crushing blow\u2019\u2019 when he failed to receive a top post in the Bush administration. Not long after becoming the Texas solicitor general in 2003 at age 32, Cruz confided his ambitions for higher office during a four-hour meeting with the Republican establishment\u2019s reigning guru, his fellow Texan Karl Rove. The Bush consigliere advised the young solicitor general to bide his time. He spent the next few years developing a reputation as a notably tough and creative lawyer, winning several high-profile Supreme Court cases, and in 2008 he left office for a partnership at a private firm in Houston. The following year, Cruz decided to run for state attorney general after it appeared that the seat might become vacant. Cruz devotes several pages in his autobiography to describing how he persuaded former President George H.\u2009W. Bush to endorse him, only to be bullied by Rove into withdrawing his name so that a Bush crony could run in his place. (An adviser involved in the machinations told me that Cruz had misleadingly implied to the elderly Bush that he would be the only Republican in the race, when in fact it was well known in Republican circles that two friends of the Bushes were also eyeing the job.)", "Today\u2019s Washington outsider made a second pitch to the Republican establishment in 2010, before he kicked off a long-shot campaign for the Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. Both the state and national Republican chieftains offered him little in the way of encouragement. While trying to convince the Texas party chairman at the time, Steve Munisteri, that he could be a legitimate candidate, Cruz asked, \u2018\u2018What if I managed to raise $5 million?\u2019\u2019 Munisteri recalls saying, \u2018\u2018Well, then at the end of the day, that\u2019s $5 million you won\u2019t have anymore.\u2019\u2019", "It was only then that Cruz began to make a virtue out of his inability to impress the insiders. His 2012 Senate race was straight out of the Tea Party playbook, complete with endorsements from Sarah Palin and Rand Paul. Compared with his current quest for the presidency, the Senate candidate Cruz\u2019s courting of evangelicals was comparatively muted. This was because his chief opponent, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, was himself a rock-solid social conservative. Still, the upstart could not afford to cede the evangelical vote to Dewhurst. Cruz\u2019s former digital director Vincent Harris (who is now affiliated with Rand Paul\u2019s campaign) says that Cruz\u2019s father played an important role in his upset victory. \u2018\u2018When Ted couldn\u2019t be somewhere, Rafael was always there, and he got those crowds so fired up,\u2019\u2019 Harris recalls. \u2018\u2018Rafael was the dog whistle to evangelicals, saying things that libertarian and Tea Party types wouldn\u2019t hear as much but that evangelicals really understood.\u2019\u2019", "After scoring his upset victory in 2012, Cruz took his Tea Party platform with him to Washington, while his evangelical predilections remained in the margins. (Unlike his current monologues on the presidential campaign trail, Cruz\u2019s numerous speeches in 2013 seldom if ever contained biblical references. Though he quoted from Proverbs during his 21-hour anti-Obamacare floor speech, Cruz actually spent far more time reciting the Dr. Seuss book \u2018\u2018Green Eggs and Ham.\u2019\u2019) What did resurface was the same arrogance that had alienated his Bush colleagues, and that Cruz in his autobiography says he put behind him after the Bush experience taught him \u2018\u2018to treat others with greater respect and humility.\u2019\u2019", "Cruz has continued to struggle to get along with his Republican allies. Just 10 days after winning his Senate election in Nov. 2012, Cruz spoke in Washington before a decidedly friendly gathering hosted by the Federalist Society, of which he is a member. Many of the attendees had supported the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. In his speech, Cruz gleefully mocked the conservative credentials of the vanquished candidate, saying, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty certain Mitt Romney actually French-kissed Barack Obama\u2019\u2019 during their final debate. As one attendee who had contributed to both Cruz and Romney later said, \u2018\u2018He managed to offend so many good people in that room who had killed themselves for Mitt.\u2019\u2019", "Cruz also wasted little time offending his Republican colleagues in the Senate, well before any ideological battle lines had been drawn. Barely a month after the new Texas senator was sworn in, the Republican senators held a retreat in an ornate Library of Congress reading room. According to a senior aide who was present, Cruz \u2018\u2018arrived late, raring for a fight, sat down and almost immediately started engaging aggressively and theatrically in a way that was so out of place for Senate politesse, but especially for someone brand-new. People were looking around like, \u2018Who the hell does this guy think he is?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "Now Ted Cruz wears the Republican establishment\u2019s loathing of him like a badge of honor, but his campaign team is also aware that voters seldom elect candidates they deem unlikable. On the Iowa campaign trail, Cruz makes a point of complimenting audience members on the excellence of their questions, pouring them coffee and submitting to their selfie requests. \u2018\u2018I think for too long he spent too much time reciting Ted Cruz\u2019s greatest hits instead of relating to people,\u2019\u2019 says Steve Deace, the Iowa radio host. \u2018\u2018As it happens, he\u2019s very brilliant, but he\u2019s also funny and relatable. Let people get to know a guy named Ted, is what I say.\u2019\u2019", "But the questions about whether the guy named Ted can win the nomination, let alone the presidency, run deeper than concerns over his likability. In particular, the campaign\u2019s audacious decision to focus more on revving up the evangelical community than on broadening its outreach to young and Hispanic voters is a high-risk strategy that, should it backfire, might do more than cost Cruz the White House. His deeply conservative rhetoric could cost Republicans the Senate, erode their majority in the House and reinforce the party\u2019s reputation among emerging demographic groups as the party of embittered and narrow-minded white men.", "Cruz makes a special point in his stump speech to mock this apocalyptic scenario. After all, he tells audiences, the same fears were voiced in 1980, about an idealistic conservative candidate whom the Washington elite considered an extremist. Instead, Cruz reminds them, the outsider named Reagan inspired millions of disenchanted voters who yearned for a return to American primacy, following the failed policies of a Democratic president both at home and abroad.", "Even Cruz\u2019s own advisers find fault with this analogy. As one of them said to me: \u2018\u2018I think he\u2019s much more of a movement conservative than Reagan was. I mean, he\u2019s not putting Sandra Day O\u2019Connor on the Supreme Court.\u2019\u2019 The Reagan-Cruz parallels break down on other levels as well. America is not in a recession, as it was in 1980. The Republican nominee\u2019s opponent will not be an unpopular president but instead, in all likelihood, a female nominee who will be seen as a history maker. Reagan benefited from a less-polarized electorate, attested to by the fact that he garnered 27 percent of the Democratic vote in 1980. By contrast, only 7 percent of the 2012 Democratic electorate chose Romney, who, unlike Cruz, had governed in the blue state of Massachusetts. And the Reagan Revolution was abetted by the shift of white Southerners, who had long viewed themselves as Democrats, to the Republican Party. That revolution has already been fought and won by the Republicans. To win the general election without reaching toward the center, Cruz will have to create his own groundswell with another conservative voting group.", "The supposition that evangelicals could be this group is also shaky. Cruz\u2019s team argues that about 10 million such voters who did not vote in the 2000 election turned out for Bush in 2004 and have stayed home since. The Bush campaign strategist Matthew Dowd maintains that the increase in evangelical voters was much smaller, prob\u00adably closer to two million. (Given that the overall turnout increase from 2000 to 2004 was less than 17 million voters, and that nearly half of those voters went for John Kerry, the 10 million estimate would seem to be mathematically un\u00adlikely.) Dowd argues as well that the dominant issue in 2004 for all voting groups, including evangelicals, was national security; socially conservative causes like marriage and abortion, Dowd says, \u2018\u2018didn\u2019t even make the top five.\u2019\u2019 Researchers also dispute that Romney drove away evangelicals in 2012. \u2018\u2018In fact, they were overrepresented \u2014 they were 20 percent of the population but made up 26 percent of the electorate,\u2019\u2019 says Robert P. Jones, of the Public Religion Research Institute. Moreover, 78 percent of them cast their ballots for Romney, the same share of the evangelical vote that Bush received in 2004.", "But perhaps the diciest assumption made by the Cruz campaign is that it not only can turn out more registered evangelical voters than Romney did but also can recruit millions of unregistered evangelicals at the same time. Every demographic group includes many people who have no interest in the political process, and persuading them to engage is not as simple a matter as offering an appealing slate of issues. Should she become the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton will be mining the electoral turf for new voters as well. And in general, the task is an easier one for Democrats, given that their targets are more densely concentrated in urban areas. Cruz\u2019s strategists assert that Clinton will not inspire voters the way Obama did, and this may well be true. But the same might be said of Cruz among various voter groups. With his hard-line stance on immigration, will he repel even more Latino voters than Romney, who received a paltry 27 percent of their votes? Though Cruz might catalyze large pockets of unregistered evangelicals, Jones and others suggest that such voters are primarily in states like Alabama and Tennessee that are already firmly in the Republican column. Pursuing them with a deeply conservative platform could gain Cruz very few electoral votes, while costing him significantly among moderate voters in swing states like Virginia and Ohio.", "For some Republicans, this situation suggests a more disquieting comparison. \u2018\u2018What\u2019s flawed about Cruz\u2019s approach is that it\u2019s the same argument Barry Goldwater made in 1964,\u2019\u2019 says Doug Gross, a longtime fixture in the Iowa Republican establishment who worked on the Bush and Romney campaigns of 2000 and 2008 and has not endorsed anyone in the 2016 field. Though 80 percent of Republicans fell in line with Goldwater at the polls, only 36 percent of voters under 30, 38 percent of women and 6 percent of nonwhites preferred him over the landslide winner, Lyndon Johnson. \u2018\u2018While Cruz may seem pure and virtuous within the confines of his own base, you can\u2019t get elected with those voters, because there simply aren\u2019t enough of them. Now, within the Republican Party, the establishment and Tea Party are probably in a standoff. But within the general electorate, there are far more of me than there are of him.\u2019\u2019", "There is only one way to know for sure what will happen if Republican voters nominate Ted Cruz \u2014 and some in the party establishment are already braced for it, with Job-like resignation. As Gross told me: \u2018\u2018We may have to learn this lesson the hard way. This may well be the year that Cruz wins the nomination and we have to have a bloodletting as our medieval cure.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018I was looking up and seeing Joshua 24:15 on the wall,\u2019\u2019 Cruz said one morning in early January, to a crowd of 200 or so wedged among the shelves of a Christian bookstore in Boone, Iowa. Squinting, he read from the sign: \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Choose you this day whom you will serve. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\u2019 And what a powerful reminder of values that Washington, D.C., seems to have forgotten. What a powerful reminder of the values that built this great country.\u2019\u2019", "This country, Cruz said, is \u2018\u2018in crisis.\u2019\u2019 But, he added, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m here this morning with a word of hope and encouragement and exhortation. All across the state of Iowa and this country, people are waking up. There is a spirit of revival that is sweeping this country.\u2019\u2019 The candidate went on in a cadence that frequently descended into stage whispers or attenuated pauses, his face clenched in Shakespearean rapture, varying barely a syllable from the monologues he would deliver with equal fervor in 27 other stops on this six-day swing through the Hawkeye State.", "Whether Cruz was making a personal connection to this audience in Boone \u2014 whether they truly liked the messenger and not just his message, whether they saw in him the affable Reagan to whom he invited comparison \u2014 was difficult to judge. But at least a dozen times during his reliably 32-minute oration, someone standing nearby me murmured, \u2018\u2018Amen.\u2019\u2019 Some of their faces went taut with resolve as he declared: \u2018\u2018The men and women of this room scare the living daylights out of Washington. And when politicians are terrified, liberty is never safer. What we are seeing is a grass-roots army coming together!\u2019\u2019", "And when Cruz\u2019s final words invoked the \u2018\u2018Judeo-Christian values\u2019\u2019 that made America \u2018\u2018that shining city on the hill,\u2019\u2019 the audience exploded in applause. Many of them made their way toward the candidate. Others stood and looked at one another for a few moments, blushing with pleasure. It took a while for all of them to file out of the cramped little bookstore. Once Ted Cruz\u2019s grass-roots army had dispersed into the streets of Boone, the candidate and his half-dozen strategists climbed aboard the campaign bus and headed an hour westward, bound for another event at a steakhouse in Carroll, Iowa. Before the month was done, Cruz would visit all the state\u2019s 99 counties, delivering with practiced zeal the same singular message: I am one of you, and I can win. He could not pretend to be Donald Trump \u2014 wildly unscripted, crass, impossible to ignore or forget. He could only be Ted Cruz, with one case to make."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/opinion/why-the-post-office-makes-america-great.html": ["I WAS transported recently to a place that is as enchanting to me as any winter wonderland: my local post office.", "In line, I thought fondly of the year I came to this country from Turkey as an adult and discovered the magic of reliable mail service.

We have a capability that they\u2019re trying to develop to play defense.", "We have a lot of technologists that are very skilled. And they\u2019re trying to figure out how to play defense. But what we don\u2019t have is we don\u2019t have folks who are thinking about offense.", "We don\u2019t have war-fighters. We have technologists. Technologists are not war-fighters. Technologists are thinking, how do I protect cyber-security, how do I secure, how do I protect?", "SANTORUM: And we need to have a much more dynamic, how do we \u2014 how do we go after them?", "How do we respond?", "And we need leadership that\u2019s willing to make sure that when someone attacks us \u2014 and ladies and gentlemen, they\u2019re attacking us as we speak. They\u2019re attacking us all day every day, not just the government, but they\u2019re attacking private sector companies all day every day.", "They have to learn that we\u2019re going to pay \u2014 they\u2019re going to pay a price when they do so.", "And then right now, just like in every other aspect of our national security, people who attack us are not paying a price. We need a leader who will make sure that they know when they mess with America, they\u2019re going to pay a price.", "SMITH: Senator, would you \u2014 would you require anything of those companies like Facebook and Twitter if you were president?", "SANTORUM: Look, Facebook and Twitter can teach us things. We can cooperate with them. We can share ideas and information. But this is a \u2014 and this is a very dicey area for the government to go in and require the industry to do its job.", "It needs to develop that capability. We need to be \u2014 have responsible dialogue, but I don\u2019t think requirements are the order of the day.", "SMITH: Thank you, Senator.", "(APPLAUSE)", "REGAN: Ms. Fiorina, the president has just issued an executive order to expand the gun laws and background checks.

You see, he doesn\u2019t like the fact that Congress has rejected his ideas twice on a bipartisan basis, so he\u2019s decided he just gets to override them.", "Sorry, Mr. President, not the way \u201cThe Constitution\u201d works.", "Secondly...", "(APPLAUSE)", "FIORINA: \u2014 secondly, he basically admitted in that speech that he hasn\u2019t been paying much attention to enforcing the laws we have. He said, gee, we need a few more FBI agents. That would have helped, perhaps, stop a tragedy here in South Carolina with Dylann Roof, a guy who clearly never should have been sold a gun.", "In other words, Mr. President, you\u2019re right, we need to enforce the laws we have. Let\u2019s enforce the laws we have. There are criminals running around with guns who shouldn\u2019t have them. We don\u2019t prosecute any of them.

They do not know how to innovate.", "We have come seven generations of technology since 2011. We have bureaucracies that are incapable of bringing in that innovation.", "So, yes, there are some very specific things that we should ask the private sector to help us with, including making sure we have the latest and greatest in algorithms to search through all these databases so that we find terrorists before they attack us, not after it\u2019s too late.", "And, finally, when a president who understands technology in the Oval Office.

Of course, we want to stop gun violence, but the one common thing that has happened in most mass shootings is that they happened in gun- free zones where people who would have been law abiding citizens, who could have stood up and at least tried to stop it and we\u2019re not allowed to under the law.", "(APPLAUSE)", "SMITH: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.", "REGAN: Governor Huckabee, an American in San Bernardino murdered 14 people while terrorists with Belgian and French passports murdered 130 people.

And, of those, 58% were directed toward Jews.

Do you have a specific plan to protect us from this type of attack?", "SANTORUM: Well, the most devastating attack that could occur is an electromagnetic pulse attack, and that would be an attack that would be triggered by a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere of our country.", "The best way to stop that from happening is to make sure that those who contemplating and actually war-gaming and talking about using it, Iran, doesn\u2019t get a nuclear weapon so they can\u2019t explode that device.", "(APPLAUSE)", "SANTORUM: And the president of the United States has put Iran on a path to a nuclear weapon.

And this president has done nothing, number one, to take the most probable person to \u2014 probable country to launch an attack and stop them, and has done nothing to try to defend us, particularly our electric grid. The bottom line is, I put the original sanctions on the Iranian nuclear program when I was in the United States Senate. I\u2019ve been fighting for 12 years with one thing in mind, that we must stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. And...", "(APPLAUSE)", "SANTORUM: Because they\u2019re different than every other country. They do not want a nuclear weapon to defend themselves.

In his State of the Union Address the other night, President Obama touted his record on jobs, citing more than 14 million new jobs and boasted of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs added in the past six years.", "Do you dispute his track record of creating jobs?", "SANTORUM: Well, the numbers just don\u2019t add up. I mean, they have not added manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs have been lost in this country, 2 million of them. The bottom line is that this president has done more to take jobs away from the hard-working people who are struggling the most.", "And that\u2019s folks who are, as I said, the 74 percent of Americans who don\u2019t have a college degree. And they\u2019re out there talking about, well, we\u2019re going to provide free college for everybody. Well, who is going to pay for it? The 74 percent that don\u2019t have a college degree.", "They\u2019re not \u2014 nobody is focused.

Let people who are here illegally stay in this country.", "Almost all of the people who are here illegally, and most of the people who came here legally over the last 20 years, they\u2019re working in wage-earning jobs. That is why wages have flat-lined.", "And we have unfortunately two political parties with most of the candidates in this field for some form of amnesty, some form of allowing people to stay here even though they\u2019re here illegally and for increasing levels of legal immigration.", "I\u2019m someone who believes that we need to be the party that stands for the American worker.

How can you say you\u2019re going to pay down our country\u2019s debt without cutting Social Security or Medicare?", "HUCKABEE: Well, first of all, let\u2019s just remember that Social Security is not the government\u2019s money, it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HUCKABEE: For the government to say, well it is fault of working people that we have a Social Security problem, no. It is the fault of a government that used those people\u2019s money for something other than protecting those people\u2019s accounts. So let\u2019s not blame them and punish them.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HUCKABEE: But here is a fact, and I sometimes hear Republicans say well, we\u2019re going to have to cut this and extend the age. You know what I think a lot of times when I hear people say, well, let\u2019s make people work to their 70. That sounds great for white-collar people who sat at a desk most of their lives. You ever talk to somebody that stood on concrete floor for the first 40 years of their working life? Do you think they can stand another five years or 10 years, many of them will retired virtually crippled because they worked hard. And we\u2019re going to punish them some more? I don\u2019t think so. Here\u2019s the fact.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HUCAKBEE: Four percent economic growth, we fully fund Social Security and Medicare. Our problem is not that Social Security is just too generous to seniors. It isn\u2019t. Our problem is that our politicians have not created the kind of policies that would bring economic growth.", "And I still support strongly that we get rid of the 77,000 pages of the monstrous tax code...", "(APPLAUSE)", "HUCKABEE: ... pass the fair tax, supercharge this economy with the rocket fuel that happens with the consumption tax and we don\u2019t have to cut Social Security to any senior who has worked their lifetime for it.", "(APPLAUSE)", "REGAN: Thank you, Governor Huckabee.", "SMITH: OK. We\u2019re going to continue this conversation. We\u2019re taking a quick break and then coming up, the candidates\u2019 plans for strengthening the middle class.

That\u2019s according to Pew Research. The same research revealed a widening income gap in America. The rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.", "What will you do to strengthen a middle class that is no longer the majority?", "FIORINA: For decades, the professional political class in both parties has been talking about the middle class. For decades, Republicans in particular have been talking about reducing the size and scope of government, spending less money, reducing the complexity.", "And yet, for 40 years, the government has gotten bigger and more expensive.", "We now have a 75,000 plus page tax code, although politicians have run for office for decades promising reform. And all the while, middle class incomes have stagnated.", "You see, when government gets bigger and bigger, more powerful, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed.", "We need to understand who the job creators are in this country, because we need more jobs to grow the middle class and to grow the wages of the middle class.", "Who creates jobs?", "Small businesses, new businesses, family-owned businesses. (APPLAUSE)", "FIORINA: They create two thirds of the new jobs in this country and they employ half the people.", "I started out typing for a nine person real estate firm. My husband Frank started out driving a tow truck for a family-owned auto body shop. And we are crushing small businesses and destroying the middle class.", "So here\u2019s my blueprint to take back America. Let us first actually reform the tax code from 73,000 pages down to three. There\u2019s a 20-year-old plan to do exactly that.", "And then let us begin piece by piece to focus on every single dollar the government spends, so that we will spend less overall and still have enough for our priorities. And that requires the government to budget the way you do at home \u2014 examine every dollar, cut any dollar, move any dollar. The fancy term for that is zero- based budgeting, but I call it common sense.", "Citizens, we\u2019ve got to take our country back.", "(APPLAUSE)", "SMITH: Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.", "(APPLAUSE)", "REGAN: Governor Huckabee, you know it used to be you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job at the local factory, enough to take care of your family and yourself. Those days seem to be gone. It\u2019s pretty hard to do that nowadays.", "Businesses are increasingly turning to automation to increase their productivity levels. It\u2019s happening right here, in fact, at the Boeing factory in North Charleston.", "The president says automation threatens workers\u2019 ability to get higher wages.", "Do you agree with that?", "And if so, do you have a solution?", "HUCKABEE: Let me go back to the reason so many people are having a hard time getting ahead. The tax system punishes them.", "Think about this. If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket. So the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do.", "And it\u2019s one of the reasons that no matter how many different reforms you have to a tax on people\u2019s productivity, you\u2019re still taxing their work, their savings. You\u2019re taxing their capital gains, inheritance, dividends, you\u2019re taxing everything that produces something.", "And it\u2019s way I really believe it\u2019s time to do something bold, not something minute. This is no time for a tap of the hammer, a twist of the screwdriver. It\u2019s time for something big. That\u2019s why the fair tax transforms our economy.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HUCKABEE: And we don\u2019t punish workers. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get middle class people moving ahead again, because the harder they work, the more they keep. No payroll tax deducted from their checks. They get their entire paycheck.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HUCKABEE: And, one of the most important parts, it\u2019s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids, and trained dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And, you punish behavior you want less of. That\u2019s how I raise kids, it\u2019s how I trained our dogs, and folks, it\u2019s not that difficult.", "We now punish the behavior we say we want more of by taxing it, and we reward the behavior that we say we want less of, so if you make a good investment, we punish you with a tax. If you make a bad investment you can write that off and the rest of the taxpayers will help subsidize you, and bail you out.", "(APPLAUSE)", "REGAN: Thank you very much, Governor Huckabee.", "Senator Santorum, 40% of babies born today are born to single moms. That\u2019s twice as high as reported back in 1980, and it\u2019s 11 times as high as in 1940. Studies show that children are always better off economically, most often \u2014 and emotionally, with two parents in a household. From a policy perspective, should the government be doing anything to encourage family formation?", "SANTORUM: You know, we\u2019ve had this debate about the economy, and we haven\u2019t talked the one issue now increasingly even the right, and even the are coming to agreement. I\u2019ve run around doing 300 town hall meetings talking about a book written by a liberal Harvard sociologist, not a normal thing for me to be talking about, but I now name Robert Putnam who wrote a book called, \u201cOur Kids\u201d.", "And, he wrote this book, I think, ostensibly to support the Democratic argument that the middle of America\u2019s hollowing out, and income gap is widening, and rich are getting richer. When he studied all the information as to what was going on, he realized that the biggest reason that we\u2019re seeing the hollowing out of the middle of America is the breakdown of the American family.", "The reality is that if you\u2019re a single parent \u2014 a child of a single parent, and you grew up in a single parent family neighborhood, you went to that single parent family school, the chance of you ever, ever reaching the top 20% of income earners is 3% in America. At least \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but that\u2019s not good enough. And, we have been too politically correct in this country because we don\u2019t want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children. (APPLAUSE)", "You want \u2014 You want to be shocked? You read the first few chapters of Mr. \u2014 Dr. Putnam\u2019 book. He talks about Port Clinton, Ohio and growing up there in the 1950\u2019s, and how poor kids actually survived and did well, even though they were poor and disadvantaged. But, then he goes to the towns today and these kids are failing, and failing miserably. They don\u2019t even have a shot, and we won\u2019t even have the courage to have leadership at the federal level \u2014 not with legislation, but the most powerful tool a president have, the bully pulpit to encourage each and everyone of you, churches and businesses, and educators, and community leaders to let\u2019s have a national campaign to rebuild the American family, and give every child its birthright which is a Mom and a Dad who loves them.", "That will change this economy.", "(CHEERING & APPLAUSE)", "REGAN: Thank you.", "SMITH: Thank you, Senator.", "We\u2019re not finished yet.

But I spent the first half of my adult life in the private and nonprofit sector, raising a family, understanding how tough it is for people to make it.", "And that first half of my life is what led me to believe that America needs a different kind of leadership, not people who spent their whole life running from one office to the next, and living off the government dime. And I got involved because I got sick of what I saw.", "I also believe that there\u2019s got to be some leadership that not only addresses the monetary and military issues of this country, but the moral issues of this country.

She repeatedly attempted to please me by trying to say whatever she thought I would like to hear, despite the fact that I kept reminding her that this was her treatment, not mine.", "Through our explorations it had become clear that pleasing others was second nature to her, the way she navigated in the world, particularly around women whom she considered to be mother figures. She enslaved herself by compulsively fulfilling other people\u2019s expectations, which she recognized to be her own projections of her perfectionism. In turn she felt exploited by the very same people she tried to please and resented it.", "I expected this vicious cycle to creep into our therapeutic relationship sooner or later. And indeed it did, manifesting itself around the issue of time.", "T. always showed up exactly on time. She did not come in too early, which allowed her to avoid meeting other people in the waiting room and thus to keep pretending that she was my only patient. And in all the years we had worked together she had never been late, not even once.", "I, on the other hand, cannot say the same about myself. Punctuality is not my forte, and despite my attempts to be on time, there had been some occasions when I came to the waiting room a few minutes late. T., in response, would typically make some general comments about the importance punctuality had played in her life. She was self-critical about everything she did, but her punctuality \u2014 a measurable quality \u2014 allowed her to know that she was, at least in this respect, in the right.", "One day, when we started our session a few minutes late because of my tardiness, T. sat up on the couch and said she was enraged at me for being late. She went on to tell me that she read somewhere that one of the warning signs of a \u201cbad therapist\u201d was lateness and that she felt the whole session would be completely wasted as a result of my being late. \u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d she continued, \u201cbeing on time is not good enough for me \u2014 I operate on \u2018atomic time.\u2019\u201d", "Although I had a vague notion of what T. meant by \u201catomic time,\u201d I looked it up on Google after the session and read: \u201cInternational Atomic Time (TAI) is a time scale that uses the combined output of some 400 highly precise atomic clocks. It provides the exact speed at which our clocks tick.\u201d", "In the following weeks we continued to talk about this issue. When T. first mentioned \u201catomic time,\u201d I, having had my own struggles with perfectionism, felt caught, as if she had discovered my weakness, and I felt guilt and shame. But I soon regained my footing. One day I told T. that while I acknowledged my lateness as a problem, I was a human being, not a machine, that I was comfortable with my \u201chumanity,\u201d and that while I would continue to try to be punctual, I would be unable to see her on \u201catomic time.\u201d \u201cIn fact,\u201d I said to her, \u201cthis may sound paradoxical, but while I consider seeing you on time as very important, I don\u2019t think that meeting you on \u2018atomic time\u2019 will be helpful to you.\u201d", "T. did not seem pleased with my response. In the sessions that followed the issue of time became a constant conflict between us. For a while, we \u201cagreed to disagree.\u201d But the issue could not be avoided.

Since her mother neglected T.\u2019s basic needs and was irrationally punitive, T. learned early that pleasing her mother was a matter of life or death and so was resolved to become a \u201cgood girl\u201d in order to survive. She also sought the approval of her older siblings, but they mocked her for being her mother\u2019s pet.", "The issue of time was loaded with all sorts of meanings: T.\u2019s mother had a clock in the living room which was always set 15 minutes fast, thereby distorting the sense of time as well as the broader sense of reality; T. had a recurrent memory of her mother sitting on a chair lost in her own world; T. would sit at the window alone for hours waiting for her siblings to show up. Waiting became so painful for T. that she could not differentiate between waiting for a few minutes and waiting for hours \u2014 the two felt the same to her.", "At one point in our sessions, T. confessed that before she arrived for a session she had a wish to merge with me so that the two of us would become one. She had a fantasy that when she rang the bell I would appear like a good mommy who was totally ready to fulfill her wishes. If I was not on time then the spell was over, the magic was broken, and the entire session would go to waste. At another time she confessed that she, in fact, envied my flexibility, and wished that she could get rid of her compulsive rigidity. I, in turn, got to understand her despair on a much deeper level and empathized with her desperate need to have me there as the reliable mother she had never had.", "Oddly, my tardiness \u2014 my failing to appear magically to merge with her on atomic time \u2014 fostered her ability not only to embrace reality but also to focus on pleasing herself rather than others.", "Rivka Bekerman-Greenberg, a psychoanalyst in New York, is a faculty member and supervisor at the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy.

It made me wonder if I need one at all. So I asked Kimber Streams, who tests laptops at The Wirecutter, a product reviews website owned by The New York Times, for some advice.", "For people who basically use their laptop to browse the web and send email, is there a cheap option?", "Definitely. For those people, I recommend a Chromebook.", "It\u2019s a laptop in the traditional sense, but it runs Chrome OS, a lighter operating system by Google that\u2019s basically just a web browser. And you can get a great one for around $400. A Windows laptop that\u2019s just as good costs at least $500, and they tend to be bigger and heavier, with worse battery life.", "With a Chromebook, can I use all the Google apps and store documents and spreadsheets on Google Drive?", "Yes. Google\u2019s apps (which I use all the time for work) can open spreadsheets and documents, including those created in Microsoft Office. And most Chromebooks come with 100 gigabytes of free Google Drive storage for two years. Chromebooks encourage people to store documents in the cloud, because the machines have very little local storage (usually about 32 gigabytes).", "Microsoft also offers Office 365, a way to access Word, Excel and such on the web, if you need to use those particular programs.", "What\u2019s the cheapest Chromebook to buy and what do you recommend?", "There are $200 Chromebooks, but we don\u2019t recommend them because they usually have two gigabytes of memory and poor processors, which means you can\u2019t have more than a couple of tabs open and everything loads very slowly. They\u2019re truly painful to use, even for light browsing.", "Our top pick, the Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Chromebook, is $430, and our budget pick, the Dell Chromebook 3380 Education, costs $300. That one is fast enough, but it has a shallow keyboard and a dim, low-resolution screen. Even so, it\u2019s the cheapest viable Chromebook.", "I always wondered why these things can\u2019t run the apps that can run on phones, so I can do more things with them.", "Well, Google\u2019s working on that! But it\u2019s pretty rough around the edges right now. Google perpetually updates Chrome OS, so it\u2019s possible apps will improve over the next couple of years.", "When I buy a laptop, do I still need to be concerned about specs?", "Yes, but only a little bit.", "Right now, a Chromebook shouldn\u2019t have fewer than four gigabytes of memory, and a Celeron processor. A Windows laptop for everyday work needs at least eight gigs, and we recommend a Core i3 or Core i5 processor and a solid-state drive. For gaming or video editing, you\u2019ll need 16 gigabytes of memory, at least a Core i5 or i7 processor, a dedicated graphics card and a solid-state drive.", "Processors aren\u2019t improving as quickly as before, so any of the past few generations are fine, as long as they\u2019re Core i processors.", "If I still need a real laptop, what should I be thinking about? Do you even recommend the best cheap Windows machine?", "Not really. Chances are, if all you need is a cheap laptop, then a Chromebook would work just as well and offer better performance.", "If you have only $500 to spend, then the cheap Windows laptop is your only option. It\u2019ll do everything you need it to, but it\u2019s large, bulky and has poor quality.", "If possible, I highly encourage people to save up an additional $200 or so and get the budget pick from our review of the best Windows ultrabooks: the Asus ZenBook UX330UA. It\u2019s thin, lightweight, has excellent quality and battery life, and costs only $750. It\u2019s an amazing computer for the price.", "It\u2019s so good that we seriously discussed whether to recommend it over the Dell XPS 13, which has been our best Windows ultrabook since it was introduced in early 2015. We ultimately decided that Dell\u2019s superior trackpad, Thunderbolt 3 support and portability made it worth the splurge if you can swing it, but the ZenBook is still a great option.", "In fact, my mom is shopping for a laptop right now, and that\u2019s the one I told her to buy."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/learning/lesson-plans/401-prompts-for-argumentative-writing.html": ["Of all the resources we publish on The Learning Network, perhaps it\u2019s our vast collection of writing prompts that is our most widely used resource for teaching and learning with The Times.", "This list of 401 prompts (available here in PDF) is now our third iteration of what originally started as 200 prompts for argumentative writing, and it\u2019s intended as a companion resource to help teachers and students participate in our annual Student Editorial Contest. (In 2017, the dates for entering are March 2 to April 4.)", "So scroll through the hundreds of prompts below that touch on every aspect of contemporary life \u2014 from social media to sports, politics, gender issues and school \u2014 and see which ones most inspire you to take a stand. Each question comes from our daily Student Opinion feature, and each provides links to free Times resources for finding more information.

The first group of documents, published March 7, suggested that the C.I.A. had found ways to hack Apple iPhones and Android smartphones, Microsoft Windows computers, Cisco routers and Samsung smart televisions.", "Since the initial release of the C.I.A. documents, which the agency has not confirmed are authentic, major technology companies have been scrambling to assess whether the security holes exploited by the C.I.A. still exist and to patch them if they do.", "All of the surveillance tools that have been disclosed were designed to be installed on individual phones or computers.

It would then act as a \u201clistening post,\u201d broadcasting the user\u2019s activities to the C.I.A. whenever the machine was connected to the internet.", "A similar tool called NightSkies was developed in 2009 to spy on iPhones, the documents said, with the agency figuring out how to install it undetected before a new phone was turned on for the first time. (Apple said that flaw affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in all later models.)", "Although most of the tools targeted outdated versions of the Apple devices\u2019 software, the C.I.A.\u2019s general approach raises new security concerns for the industry, said Eric Ahlm, who studies cybersecurity at Gartner, a research firm. By rewriting the most basic software of a computer or a phone, tools that operate at the chip level can hide their existence and avoid being wiped out by routine software updates.", "Under an agreement struck during the Obama administration, intelligence agencies were supposed to share their knowledge of most security vulnerabilities with tech companies so they could be fixed. The C.I.A. documents suggest that some key vulnerabilities were kept secret for the government\u2019s use.", "The C.I.A. declined to comment Thursday, pointing reporters to its earlier statement about the leaks, in which it defended its use of \u201cinnovative, cutting-edge\u201d techniques to protect the country from foreign threats and criticized WikiLeaks for sharing information that could help the country\u2019s enemies."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/arts/design/charles-darwin-research-notes-hackers-project.html": ["Deep into the night, 15 computer whizzes toiled feverishly on Charles Darwin\u2019s groundbreaking research notes at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan.

Legions of scientists remain devoted to its text and to the observations that went into its preparation.", "Against this backdrop, the manuscripts project is reassembling Darwin\u2019s notes as he originally wrote them.

One page, for example, might be observations made about bees visiting flowers in 1840, originally placed in a portfolio on the behavior of bees. Perhaps 10 years later, he tore or cut that page, moving some of the observations into a portfolio on the pollination of flowers. By reassembling the original pages, researchers hope to understand fully the long arc of Darwin\u2019s research and the gradual maturation of his thinking.", "Before the manuscripts project began 10 years ago, Dr. Kohn tried to crack the code of Darwin\u2019s handwriting. He would sit for hours at the Cambridge University Library, where the original manuscripts are stored, and focus on the slopes and curves of the botanist\u2019s scrawl. In 2007, a five-person team embarked on the task of transcribing thousands of pages of Darwin\u2019s scientific papers, drawings and book research.", "Working from the transcriptions, the computer experts then began trying to reassemble the manuscripts digitally. Their work will accomplish in months what would take years to do by hand.", "Darwin, an experimenter extraordinaire, might have appreciated the efforts.", "A wealthy landowner, he used Down House, his property of 20 acres or so in England, for hands-on testing of his theories. His laboratory included five greenhouses and a vegetable garden, and his initial experiments consisted of observing 1,000 flowering plants over three summers in the gardens on his relatives\u2019 grounds.", "Darwin also enlisted some of his 10 children to gather flowers or collect moths at night. They even drew enchanting pictures of flowers on the backs of his notes. Darwin himself \u201cwas a terrible drawer,\u201d Dr. Kohn said.", "\u201cI was, however, surprised at the depth of involvement with his family,\u201d he added. \u201cDarwin had a network to gather and test his theories.\u201d", "During the 24-hour hackathon, Dr. Kohn inspired the computer experts with some of these stories about Darwin\u2019s exploits in experimentation. For example, Darwin would put vegetable or flower seeds in little bottles with salt water to see how long they could float. That way, he could test his theories about how far seeds could travel and survive.", "To sort through the notes, the computer experts used coding and image processing to differentiate pages with ragged, fuzzy or sharp edges. Then they matched curves by performing a shape analysis. The project is expected to be completed by the end of March.", "Luis Ibanez, a software engineer from Google who helped with image-processing functions, found out about the manuscripts project at his company, which promoted it internally. He said he had taken part in 15 hackathons for various projects and enjoys picking up \u201cnew tricks\u201d from other hackers.", "Mr. Ibanez was especially impressed that Darwin was able to experiment at his own pace over the decades. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that at Google,\u201d he said.", "For her analysis of the manuscripts, Ms. Chung applied tools like the Fourier transform, which breaks wave forms into alternate representations. \u201cI got more exposure to image-processing tools during the hackathon,\u201d she said.", "Data from the project is being uploaded onto GitHub, the open-source software-sharing library, and is publicly accessible.", "Dr. Kohn suggested that Darwin would be tickled with the new technology tools.", "The naturalist kept up his research until the day he died in 1882. His manuscripts were stored in steel trunks that remained in a son\u2019s house until the 1940s, when they were transferred to the Cambridge University Library.

Borrowing a Silicon Valley mantra from Facebook, he told his shocked listeners that \u201cyour job is to move fast and break things,\u201d according to a person who was present. \u201cFigure out what needs doing, and then just do it. Don\u2019t wait for permission.\u201d", "His audience was surprised. Conventional political wisdom advocated a robust and elaborate campaign hierarchy.", "But Mr. Bannon demanded the opposite. Winning, he said, required tactics and ideas \u2014 like distributed decision making; quick experimentation and execution rather than thoughtful deliberation; learning from left-leaning advocacy groups and video game companies \u2014 that were drawn from the management playbooks of Silicon Valley start-ups.", "After that meeting, many thought Mr. Bannon\u2019s strategy was crazy, the person who was present said. Then Mr. Trump won the election. And now we can argue that Mr. Trump is, in many ways, the first genuine Silicon Valley start-up candidate and president.", "President Barack Obama may have embraced technology, weaponized social media and sought advice from the co-founders of Facebook and LinkedIn. But he was ultimately a traditional campaigner and manager. It is Mr. Trump\u2019s team who, surprisingly, have embraced the philosophy of disruption and the management styles of Silicon Valley, and who have sought to imitate the tactics that have powered companies like Uber and Amazon.", "\u201cTrump is the Silicon Valley candidate in every way except that the ideology is flipped,\u201d said Sam Altman, a prominent technology leader, chief executive of Y Combinator and a major Hillary Clinton donor. \u201cHe\u2019s an outsider. He took on a system he thought was broken and then disregarded the rules, he got to know his users well and tested his product early and iterated rapidly. That\u2019s the start-up playbook. That\u2019s exactly what we tell our start-ups to do.\u201d", "It remains to be seen, however, whether Mr. Trump will successfully transition from a start-up to a mature commander in chief. Just as Uber and other young tech firms have stumbled while growing, so Mr. Trump seems, right now, in over his head at the White House.", "But understanding these early missteps \u2014 and how start-up thinking vaulted Mr. Trump into power \u2014 is important, because it gives us a lens into the strengths and weaknesses of management techniques that are increasingly being imitated by other industries around the world.", "Put differently, the president\u2019s success has demonstrated the strength of the start-up philosophy. But is it a good or a bad thing if Mr. Trump becomes the first political unicorn?", "The irony is that many technologists abhor Mr. Trump and his beliefs. Silicon Valley overwhelmingly voted and raised funds for Mrs. Clinton, and tech workers have angrily protested his immigration ban. At the New Work Summit, a gathering of top technology executives hosted by The New York Times this week, participants strongly complained that their industry should not be associated with, or held accountable for, Mr. Trump\u2019s victory.", "But the fact remains that he is a prime example of the disruptive forces that the tech industry celebrates. At the most basic level, Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of technology \u2014 the millions of dollars he has raised through online donations, and his capacity to mobilize huge crowds through email and drive news through Twitter blasts \u2014 is crucial to his unexpected political success.", "And his team\u2019s embrace of Silicon Valley philosophy goes much deeper. As Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign gained steam, for instance, top officials began a dedicated effort to study the tactics of successful digital advocacy groups, particularly the left-leaning Moveon.org, as well as #BlackLivesMatter, to reverse engineer methods for rapidly mobilizing voters.", "His campaign also reached out to video game companies to learn how to make addictive content. During the race, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Gabriel Leydon, founder of a company in Palo Alto, Calif., named MZ, previously known as Machine Zone, which created the highly popular games Mobile Strike and Game of War: Fire Age. Mr. Leydon, one of the biggest online advertisers, agreed to share insights about digital marketing tactics with the Trump campaign. (In a statement, MZ said it never formally worked for Mr. Trump.)", "The influence of start-up philosophy on Mr. Trump\u2019s team extends to day-to-day management. The campaign and the White House have looked to tech industry management techniques to empower staff members to start policy initiatives, to conduct rapid digital tests, and to push fund-raising and advertising campaigns without seeking authorization from senior officials.", "In contrast to the methodical Obama White House and the Clinton campaign, where tweets often needed approval from at least three officials before they were posted, members of the Trump team could dream up ads or email blasts almost without oversight. At its peak, his campaign was running 60,000 different online advertisements per day to see which phrases and images outperformed others.", "However, the most significant connection between Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley thinking is how thoroughly he embodies the \u201cdisruption thesis\u201d that has propelled so many emerging technology firms. Mr. Trump\u2019s team has deliberately worked to remove the traditional gatekeepers \u2014 the big donors, the political parties, the advocacy groups and the news media \u2014 that have, in the past, often determined political viability.", "A senior campaign official said the strategy \u201csidestepped the power brokers the same way Uber sidestepped taxi dispatchers,\u201d and asserted that politics as practiced by Mr. Trump was part of a revolution that started in technology and was now spreading to other industries and governments around the world.", "Many within Silicon Valley dislike this idea. \u201cPresident Trump is not a disrupter, but is self-serving and often dishonest,\u201d Clay M. Christensen, a father of disruption theory and the author of \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d said in an email. \u201cDisruptive innovations make products more affordable and accessible so that many more people can use things that historically were only available to the rich and skilled.\u201d", "Yet, even by that measure, Mr. Trump, who attracted many first-time voters, and who was elected with a big boost from Americans without college degrees, seems to fit the bill.", "Which all presents a question: If the playbook was so successful in electing Mr. Trump, why is he stumbling now? Why has the Silicon Valley mentality failed to thrive in Washington?", "It might be that Mr. Trump simply needs to evolve to the next level of tech industry thinking. And, in fact, there is a ready playbook for how start-ups transition into mature firms. Google, for instance, began floundering when it reached about 200 employees. So the company\u2019s founders brought in a more established leader, Eric Schmidt, to \u201cbe a bit of chaperone, providing adult supervision,\u201d as Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, explained in 2001. When Facebook\u2019s work force hit 1,800 in 2008, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, hired Sheryl Sandberg, a seasoned manager, as chief operating officer to rein in the firm\u2019s freewheeling, decentralized culture.", "We\u2019re seeing a similar shift in the White House. After Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban caused widespread confusion at airports and within federal agencies last month, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, put in effect a formal process for rolling out executive orders. When the president was preparing for his address to Congress last week, his team used a formal process to review the script. Republican leaders are pushing the White House to bring on more aides with prior governing experience. As at Facebook and Google, a hierarchy is being built.", "But for many within the technology industry, this new, more mature White House is cause for concern. \u201cI think most people don\u2019t want him to succeed at all,\u201d said Laszlo Bock, who until last year was a senior vice president at Google. \u201cNo matter how Trump manages the White House, what he believes in is the opposite of Silicon Valley values. We don\u2019t want him to learn from us.\u201d", "Ultimately, say Silicon Valley luminaries, the world is changing thanks to forces beyond the control of any one industry. Technology companies aren\u2019t to blame for these shifts. They have merely seen and taken advantage of them faster than everyone else.", "It is not a question of whether campaign managers, politicians and leaders in other industries should mimic the technology industry, but rather a question of when they will realize that it is too late to resist.", "\u201cI think all of this \u2014 the current start-up revolution, Trump and lots of other things \u2014 is largely a consequence of the internet breaking down traditional barriers,\u201d Mr. Altman, the Y Combinator executive, wrote in an email. \u201cThis societal openness has some great consequences in my opinion, like the start-up boom of the last 20 years, and some bad ones, like Trump.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/briefing/brexit-netherlands-scotland-your-tuesday-briefing.html": ["Good morning.", "Here\u2019s what you need to know to start your day in Europe:", "\u2022 A day of parliamentary Ping-Pong ended late last night with Prime Minister Theresa May winning authority to begin Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union.", "Raising the stakes, Scotland\u2019s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, called for another referendum on Scottish independence.", "These added to the existential threats facing Europe today.

(For the sake of coherence, I\u2019m going to stick to monthly rates, before taxes; note that Amazon\u2019s video service comes with Amazon Prime\u2019s $99 annual fee.) Hulu carries more television shows than movies, but it\u2019s not light on movies, particularly popular ones. Unless you like to watch commercials, in which case your Hulu will run $7.99, the desirable option will be commercial-free version at $11.99. Add HBO Now ($14.99), Starz ($8.99) and Showtime ($10.99). That\u2019s $65.94 worth of monthly streaming. (Explorers of Amazon Video/Amazon Prime will point out that there\u2019s a good deal of HBO programming already free through the service; this doesn\u2019t include movies currently on HBO, or the most recent original programming, including made-for-the-channel movies. This is worth considering when determining whether or not to add HBO Now.) But if you want to rent or purchase a film on demand, either a classic or something recently released in theaters, there are also movies available \u00e0 la carte, from $2.99 to $14.99, available on Amazon, Vudu, Google Play, iTunes and more. Let\u2019s postulate that each month you spend $2.99, $4.99 and $14.99 on a single movie from one of these \u2014 that\u2019s $22.97. So the services and a few potentially spur-of-the-moment purchases, you\u2019re looking at $88.91.

I\u2019d say the foundation would be FilmStruck with the Criterion Channel option at $10.99 a month. It\u2019s $6.99 a month without Criterion, but you\u2019ll want Criterion, for its smartly chosen array of largely foreign cinematic milestones. Warner Archive ($9.99) is the odds and ends of a great American studio, not a very global concern but still full of enticing options. Then there\u2019s the limited-run streaming art house Mubi ($5.99), which has, during special promotions, offered enticing yearly subscription discounts ($34.99 as opposed to $47.99). Fandor, an eclectic and often exciting service with thousands of movies ranging from martial arts romps such as \u201cMaster of the Flying Guillotine\u201d to expansive, obscure French brainteasers like \u201cOut 1,\u201d is $10 a month. And the solid indie provider Sundance Now, which also offers original series, is $6.99.

You\u2019ll need Warner Archive ($9.99); the blaxploitation service Brown Sugar ($3.99); and the horror specialist Screamhouse ($4.99), which runs scary gamuts each with its own menu subheading, including \u201cExtreme,\u201d which has the indeed highly unpleasant \u201cCannibal Ferox.\u201d Shudder, another horror service ($4.99), recently made waves by offering the controversial Ken Russell nuns-gone-wild film \u201cThe Devils\u201d; finicky horror lovers almost immediately protested on social media that it was not the uncut version. (In fairness to Shudder, the actual provenance of an uncut version of this movie is highly obscure.) Amazon\u2019s video service is rife with noir titles in various states of disrepair or restoration. A lot of genre stuff in the public domain (until a copyright owner can effectively yell \u201cFoul!\u201d) is on YouTube, which is free; for the sake of argument, we\u2019ll add YouTubeRed ($9.99) to this bill of fare. Crunchyroll has an anime-only membership for $6.95. And the Urban Movie Channel ($4.99) is not as blaxploitation-heavy as Brown Sugar, but it doesn\u2019t exactly lack, either, especially when it comes to latter-day genre variants like the Southern sins-of-the-fathers 2009 thriller \u201cIn the Electric Mist\u201d or the bayou-psychic tale \u201cThe Sickle\u201d (2015). Total: a little over $45; with Amazon added as a digging option, a little under $55.", "All this of course can be supplemented by free services other than YouTube, like the site of DVD label Shout!

Much of the cache released by WikiLeaks appears to show how the agency has created or acquired a variety of tools to thwart tough encryption or intercept messages before encryption tools make them useless to the intelligence agency.", "What is new about the C.I.A. program?", "Using malware to hack into devices ranging from smartphones to webcams has been going on for years. Sometimes the intent is to steal information \u2014 like names, addresses and credit-card numbers for identity theft and fraud. Sometimes the goal seems to be to create havoc.", "Last year, for example, household and commercial webcams and router computers were taken over and used as launching pads to create so-called denial-of-service attacks that clogged portions of the internet and interrupted service for hours for people in parts of the United States.", "But the C.I.A. program seems to have been particularly sophisticated, far-reaching and focused on surveillance.

The Senate passed a bill this week to overturn Obama-era broadband privacy rules.", "Under rules created last October by the Federal Communications Commission, Verizon, Comcast, AT&T and other broadband providers had to ask your permission to track your online behavior to sell for advertising purposes. On a party-line vote, Republicans in the Senate decided that was too onerous. If the measure passes the House and gets President Trump\u2019s signature, broadband companies will be free to track you without your permission.", "Mike: Um, this sounds \u2026 bad?", "Farhad: Why is it a good idea to let broadband oligopolies automatically track people\u2019s browsing behavior?

Large electronics \u2014 tablets, laptops, e-readers, basically everything you need to keep your sanity on a long flight \u2014 must now be checked.", "The American government says these rules are meant to counter a security threat and have nothing to do with President Trump\u2019s immigration policies. But given the White House\u2019s track record on banning stuff from other countries, lots of people were skeptical about the aims for this policy. If the government was simply trying to punish Middle Eastern airlines, making their long-haul flights far less comfortable would be a good way to go about it.", "Mike: What\u2019s next?", "Farhad: Well, several companies, including AT&T and Johnson & Johnson, announced that they\u2019d be pulling down their ads from YouTube because of fears that their brands were appearing next to ISIS videos and other hate speech. It\u2019s not clear that this will amount to a big financial problem for YouTube and Google, its parent company, but these companies\u2019 fears do highlight a larger problem with the online ad business.", "More and more ads are being sold \u201cprogrammatically\u201d \u2014 that is, through financial algorithms run by computers rather than by human marketers determining the exact placement of any given spot. But it\u2019s not clear that the big programmatic companies, of which Google is the largest and most powerful, have perfected ways to keep prominent brands off some of the seedier corners of the internet.", "Mike: I imagine Taco Bell probably doesn\u2019t want its brand new chalupas brought to viewers alongside alt-right Pepe frogs.", "Farhad: I suspect this is a short-term problem. Google is good at search and mining content for meaning; it should be able to come up with a way, soon, to identify the worst parts of its network, and keep its biggest brands far away from that content. So as long as Google acts fast, I see this is a temporary blip. What do you think?", "Mike: I have a different take on this. Here\u2019s the thing: This has been a problem ever since programmatic advertising existed in the first place. YouTube is great at taking down copyrighted content; it pioneered a system called \u201cContentID,\u201d and it\u2019s been a huge savior in dealing with copyright concerns from content owners.", "But how do you deal with ads that appear on videos that have racist or xenophobic content in them? Doesn\u2019t that get into the realm of sentiment analysis? Isn\u2019t that difficult to handle in the long term? I feel like that requires the aid of artificial intelligence, a field that C.E.O.s have admitted still needs help understanding very human issues.", "The other side of this lies with the folks who have to write up the community guidelines around what constitutes racism and hate speech, an area into which companies like Google and Facebook have increasingly been drawn as reluctant arbiters of speech. That\u2019s the last place they want to be headed, but I think they won\u2019t have much of a choice.", "My guess on how this plays out: A bunch of brands will yank ads. YouTube will come out with some rewritten policy on community guidelines that\u2019s somewhat more hardline against certain kinds of speech, but still relatively squishy. Brand advertisers will reinsert their ads on YouTube. The heat will go away. Life will steadily march on.", "Speaking of that, I\u2019m going to go enjoy life and find a truck horn to honk.

The idea is to create a kind of virtual, peer-to-peer energy trading system built on blockchain, the database technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.", "The ability to complete secure transactions and create a business based on energy sharing would allow participants to bypass the electric company energy supply and ultimately build a microgrid with energy generation and storage components that could function on their own, even during broad power failures.", "\u201cCommunity members can work both individually and collectively to help meet demand in an efficient way,\u201d said Audrey Zibelman, who recently resigned as chairwoman of the New York State Public Service Commission, which regulates the state\u2019s utilities.", "\u201cIt takes a central procurer \u2014 in this case, historically, the utility \u2014 out of the mix,\u201d she continued, \u201cand really sets the market where they\u2019re not buying and selling to the utility but they\u2019re identifying each other\u2019s need and willingness to buy and sell.\u201d", "The project is but one example of how rapidly spreading technologies like rooftop solar and blockchain are upending the traditional relationships between electric companies and consumers, putting ever more control in the hands of customers. Across the globe, upstart companies like LO3 Energy, which is designing the Brooklyn experiment with the industrial giant Siemens, are building digital networks that offer the promise of user-driven, decentralized energy systems that can work in tandem with the traditional large-scale grid or, especially in emerging economies, avoid the need for a grid at all.", "In Australia, where Ms. Zibelman will soon run the nation\u2019s energy markets, a company called Power Ledger announced the start of a residential electricity trading market based in blockchain last year at a housing development in Perth.", "In Bangladesh, where an estimated 65 million people lack access to a central grid, ME SOLshare has been developing peer-to-peer trading networks of rural households with and without rooftop solar systems.

There is no centralized feed-in from one big power plant.\u201d", "In New York, the Brooklyn microgrid is conceived to work with the conventional grid, which is in the midst of a reboot under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s directives to make it more flexible, resilient and economically efficient while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. That effort, known as Reforming the Energy Vision, or REV, includes encouraging the development of microgrids and more active community participation.", "The ideal power system, said Richard L.

But Lawrence Orsini, LO3\u2019s chief executive, said the state still needed to determine how to define his company and its network of participants before it could get its market up and running, a move he anticipates by June.", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing technically infeasible about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order for transactive energy to take off as a whole, regulators have to be comfortable that markets can actually work this way and, more importantly, that people want markets like this.\u201d", "Over the past year, LO3 has been working to find those people, using Google Earth to identify homes with rooftop solar installations and then knocking on doors to enlist participants, with some success throughout Park Slope and Gowanus.", "On a block of President Street last year, the company carried out two sales of green electricity credits generated by one homeowner\u2019s solar system to a neighbor across the street \u2014 tiny transactions, but important in proving the concept\u2019s viability.", "Those sales involved test versions of renewable-energy credits \u2014 numbered certificates that are used to track electricity exported from a renewable system to the grid. Utilities, corporations and other customers can buy the credits to claim green energy use.", "In the Brooklyn case, LO3 used the credit sales, conducted over PayPal, to test its approach; it cannot legally buy and sell electricity until regulators determine its market status. Once that occurs, Mr. Orsini said, the company will be able to facilitate the trading of energy among its participants \u2014 though they would still pay the utility, Con Edison, for infrastructure fees and services, as customers now do when they choose to use a green energy supplier through the utility.", "Mr. Orsini\u2019s team is busy collecting data from meters installed in prosumer homes, measuring production, use and export of the solar electricity to help model the market. They are also testing a smartphone app that customers will be able to use to manage their electricity purchases, setting parameters to control the source \u2014 selecting from a range of conventional, renewable, local and bulk options \u2014 as well as how much they are willing to spend.", "Mr. Orsini said he expected that most users would want to make their choices and then let the system take over.", "\u201cNo one wants to day-trade energy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving something to people that they haven\u2019t ever had before, and that\u2019s really a way to personalize their energy consumption.\u201d", "That is the aspect that appeals to a number of the participants, including Garry Golden of Windsor Terrace, a futurist who consults for a variety of businesses, including electric utilities and infrastructure companies. Mr. Golden installed solar as part of a group purchase that proved so popular with his neighbors that almost a dozen systems are within view of his roof, forming an attractive cluster for the microgrid experiment.", "\u201cWe need to make energy a product and a service that people can purchase on their own and not rely on a large centralized entity,\u201d Mr. Golden said.

Mike is out this week, so Cecilia Kang, a tech reporter in Washington, stepped in.", "Farhad: Hi, Cecilia! Great to have you here. Mike is on vacation, blessedly. He\u2019s barely even been on Twitter. In unrelated news, I\u2019ve had a really terrific week, and the strange odor in the office is completely gone. How\u2019s D.C.?", "Cecilia: Hey Farhad! Awesome to be here in the newsletter and in D.C., where every day since Nov. 8 feels like a whirlwind. It also smells awfully nice here with the flowers blooming.", "Farhad: O.K., so I\u2019m excited you\u2019re here because I love to talk about tech and government. Tech policy has undergone a huge change under President Trump, but it doesn\u2019t seem that a lot of the changes are getting much attention, considering everything else the administration is doing.", "Cecilia: Excited to talk about tech policy? Music to my ears.", "So much is happening, and in a normal news cycle, the rollback of Obama-era tech policies would get a lot more attention. But make no mistake, the changes coming in privacy, net neutrality and potentially many more tech regulations will be profound. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, promised the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state,\u201d and right away we\u2019ve begun to see that happen.", "Farhad: So we\u2019ll get to all that in a second. But first, let\u2019s go over the news of the week.", "WikiLeaks released a huge cache of documents that purport to show the tools that the C.I.A. uses to break into smartphones, computers and even smart TVs. Other than embarrassing the United States government, the leak has fed into more conspiracy theories about Russia (Sean Hannity was having a ball this week), and they\u2019ve given people some tips for how to protect themselves from governmental spying. If you want to safeguard your own devices, read our colleague Brian Chen\u2019s handy guide.", "But the best take I read on the leak came from the social media scholar Zeynep Tufecki, who pointed out that WikiLeaks overhyped this cache. The documents actually show that the C.I.A. finds encrypted communications apps like Signal and WhatsApp very difficult to break into.", "Cecilia: And it was amazing to see the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange offer help to tech companies like Apple and Google by sharing the leaked computer code so they could fix the flaws described in the C.I.A. documents. How awkward would that be? Remember, relations are still pretty tense between tech and law enforcement on the issue of encryption, which is certainly going to come up again.", "Farhad: This week, there was also another attempt by Facebook to copy Snapchat. This time it was Messenger\u2019s turn. Facebook\u2019s messaging app rolled out a new feature that allows people to create Snapchat-like slide shows \u2014 known in the Snapchat world as Stories \u2014 on the service. Facebook calls it Messenger Day.", "I don\u2019t know about this. Messenger used to be a simple beloved chat app. Now it\u2019s a mess of different things. I don\u2019t get it, honestly.", "Cecilia: I left Messenger when it became a separate app. If you make me jump through even one extra hoop, I\u2019m out.", "Farhad: Oh man, you\u2019d never be able to work with Mike.", "Google also had a huge conference to show off its cloud computing services. A lot of these are too boring and business-y to mention here, but there was one thing that caught my eye: Google Hangouts is being transformed into something more like Slack, the group-messaging app that has taken businesses by storm. I\u2019m happy about this because Google seemed to have forgotten about working on Hangouts these last few years. An overhaul is way overdue.", "Cecilia: Zzz. You kinda lost me at cloud conference. But seriously, I\u2019m pumped about any improvements to Hangouts. Essential reporting tool.", "Tech\u2019s biggest boosters of space exploration, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, were in Washington this week.

One idea he mentioned was building tunnels under cities.", "Musk\u2019s companies \u2014 SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity \u2014 have a lot at stake with any changes that could occur in government contracting and energy tax breaks and subsidies. It\u2019s been fascinating to watch how he\u2019s basically dodged criticism for advising the president. Why is Musk Teflon while Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was pressured a few weeks ago by anti-Trump employees and customers to resign from the president\u2019s advisory council?", "Bezos was also here this week to announce the first paying customer for Blue Origin, his rocket company. A day later, he announced another customer for Blue Origin rockets. Blue Origin probably won\u2019t be profitable for a long time, but the company is now officially more than just a billionaire hobby horse.", "Farhad: Now to tech and Trump. Under the new president we have a new F.C.C. commissioner, possibly a different standard for antitrust review on big mergers, and maybe lots of money for infrastructure that might seep into the tech economy. Can you go over the biggest tech policy changes we\u2019re expecting under Trump?", "Cecilia: Ajit Pai, Trump\u2019s pick to head the F.C.C., has quickly repealed rules created during the Obama administration. The first big real target will be broadband privacy.", "Mr. Pai started by shelving new data security rules that were supposed to go into effect this month. He is also targeting broader broadband privacy rules approved last fall that would have forced AT&T and Comcast to ask for a consumer\u2019s permission to track browsing and app activity. If he doesn\u2019t scrap those rules first, Congress will. Mr. Pai\u2019s Republican allies, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, are in the process of rescinding the F.C.C. privacy rules through the Congressional Review Act, which is basically a tactic used by Congress to remove recently adopted agency rules.", "Farhad: Wait, wait, what would these rules have done? From what I\u2019ve read, they would have just stopped your broadband company from tracking you unless they asked permission. That seems \u2026 good?", "Cecilia: Yep, and that \u201copt-in\u201d mandate underlies potential fortunes for advertisers. If given the explicit choice of getting tracked online, many consumers would say no. Pai has an interesting argument against the broadband rules that says a lot about his view of the tech industry. He says broadband providers shouldn\u2019t have heavy-handed privacy rules when Google and Facebook don\u2019t. Privacy violations by telecom and tech companies should be policed by the Federal Trade Commission, he argues.", "Farhad: Huh. O.K., what\u2019s next?", "Cecilia: The next big target will be net neutrality, which ensures equal access to all content online. Pai wants a diluted version of the rules put in place by Tom Wheeler, his predecessor. He\u2019s going to permit zero-rating and could also be flexible on things like sponsored data, which is when a company like AT&T gives unlimited streaming of DirecTV channels for its mobile customers. That offering would make it much harder for a streaming company like Vimeo to compete.", "Farhad: Oh boy. It\u2019s sort of incredible how quickly all this is happening. I\u2019d imagined there would at least be a transition period of a few months in which nothing changed, but we\u2019re just going to dive in to a whole new regime for regulating tech and media. Buckle up!", "Anyway, thanks for being here. I actually learned something, which, let me tell you, never happens when Mike is here.", "Cecilia: Loved being your guest co-pilot.

Other advertisers, including BMW of North America and Scribie, a transcription service, also appeared on Breitbart after blocking their ads from the site, a practice known as blacklisting.", "The problem underscores the challenges companies continue to face with the largely automated nature of online advertising, which tends to show messages to people based on who they are, rather than what site they visit. While errant appearances on unwanted sites may be rare \u2014 Nordstrom runs millions of ads daily, it said, and fewer than 200 show up on Breitbart \u2014 the risks of being viewed there have spiked, with consumer watchdogs and news outlets using screenshots and social media to call out brands for appearing near questionable content like hate speech or terrorist propaganda. Brands are frequently left scrambling to figure out how they got there.", "\u201cIf a brand doesn\u2019t want to be associated with a particular publisher for whatever reason, it\u2019s kind of crazy that they request for it to be blacklisted and still spend money on it,\u201d said Andrew Casale, the chief executive of Index Exchange, an online advertising exchange. \u201cThis is all evidence of gaps in our supply chain, which are becoming visible to the mainstream.\u201d", "AT&T and Johnson & Johnson were among prominent advertisers that pulled their marketing from YouTube and Google ad exchanges on Wednesday after news reports showed their ads running next to offensive material.

That effort has been led by a Twitter account called Sleeping Giants, which uses screenshots to publicize and shame brands with ads on the site. The anonymously led account, which has more than 75,000 followers, was created in November as Breitbart drew attention for its ties to Stephen K.

Automated technology allows companies to advertise on numerous websites in an attempt to cheaply and efficiently reach specific people based on their browsing habits.

Before I went, I loaded up Google Earth to look at the islets that I could possibly travel to. I actually picked Ejit Islet to go to based on the Google satellite imagery.

With about half of our stories in this series, we actually ran screen grabs from the 4K drone video. You can barely discern a difference on the web and in print as long as you keep your motion slow. I\u2019m shooting 30 frames a second at 4K. So I\u2019m getting stills out of my video captures that are plenty large enough to use for anything we want. That\u2019s another reason why I can prioritize video footage instead of stills.", "Can we talk a little bit more about the Carbon\u2019s Casualties series, which recently took first place for Documentary Project of the Year in the Pictures of the Year International awards. How did you envision it from the start?", "At the end of 2015, I got the opportunity to travel to Greenland to accompany the U.S. ambassador to Denmark, taking a tour of some of the climate research happening. I decided that was a good place to bring the drone that I had been practicing with. While there, the reporter, Coral Davenport, and I found another story \u2014 a research group trying to measure the size of \u2018meltwater\u2019 rivers on top of the second-largest reserve of frozen freshwater in the world. They were flying helicopters out over the ice sheet, setting up camp and staying for several nights in freezing cold temperatures. I joined them.", "While I was there, we discovered that the researchers themselves were doing drone mapping. They were flying a very high-elevation drone to get middle-range drone imagery that was between the satellites and what I was getting with my drone. Later, we were able to seamlessly transition scenes from ground-level drone footage to middle-range drone footage mapping the watershed that they were in, all the way up to NASA satellite imagery.", "That\u2019s something that couldn\u2019t be done before.", "After Greenland I went to the Marshall Islands.

We want to keep pushing the envelope, so I\u2019m in the process of identifying new technologies we might be able to use for the next set of stories about climate change and its impact on people.", "How do you compose for stills with a drone?", "For still photos I try to use the drone to create very formal, or very graphic composition. I think that it\u2019s best to not shoot at a 45-degree angle with the horizon line in every photo. I\u2019ve been focused on shooting straight down as much as I can, or at semi-oblique angles so you don\u2019t quite show your horizon line. When I\u2019m filming from a helicopter, that\u2019s a very stressful, dangerous angle to take, because you\u2019re really hanging outside of the helicopter. With a drone, it\u2019s a lot easier to shoot straight down.", "What is the role of changing technologies like the drone in visual journalism?", "One of the things that I think working photojournalists need to do is constantly adapt. It would have been very easy to do these Carbon\u2019s Casualties stories from a purely still photographic perspective. And I think the still photographs I took on the ground would have been greatly improved had I been able to spend three times as much time on just the stills. But I think that it is a service to our readers to constantly experiment and figure out how to integrate new technologies into our storytelling in successful ways.", "It was important for me to be one of the first to use this technology. Luckily, The Times prioritized it and sent three of us to a drone training workshop under the F.A.A. at Virginia Tech to practice with this technology before we could even use it. And what was unique about the time period we chose to do this series is that many countries still hadn\u2019t formalized their drone laws.", "In some ways it was the golden era for drone exploration. Even six months later when I tried to do an assignment in Canada, I had to fill out an 80-page application and wait weeks to be able to find out if I was certified to fly in their airspace.", "You had to take an exam in the United States to get a pilot\u2019s license?", "In the past, you had to be a licensed pilot in order to fly a drone. But the F.A.A. announced a new rule so people who understand the drone laws can be certified to fly in certain airspaces under a very strict list of rules. So I took the test the first day that it was offered.", "In five years, will there be drones everywhere and an oversaturation of drone imagery?", "Definitely. I was lucky to be able to use this technology so early on because millions of drones were sold for last Christmas. What\u2019s unique about our drone laws in the United States is that hobbyists can fly in many more situations under more relaxed restrictions than commercial operators, and the law considers media organizations commercial operators.", "Just like the influx of digital cameras and camera phones created a saturation of imagery, we\u2019re going to have to adapt and figure out how we can bring our creativity to these new technologies. With this series, I tried to be thoughtful about how we employed the drone and not just fly it everywhere \u2014 to make sure that this is the right technology for the right story. Just because you have a drone, doesn\u2019t mean you have to use it.", "What new technology is next?", "Here\u2019s a scenario to consider: I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before we have micro drones with high-quality cameras that reporters can take into the field.\nAm I then sitting at my home in San Francisco talking on the phone and I\u2019m flying a drone, taking pictures and shooting video for a reporter who\u2019s working across the globe? I think that would be a huge disservice to our industry, because we photojournalists bring so much to the reporting.", "So in similar ways that the United States is conducting drone warfare from an office building in Las Vegas, I think it\u2019s only a matter of time until that technology gets small enough to put in a journalist\u2019s pocket. We need to plan for a world where that\u2019s possible and decide how we want to treat storytelling should that happen.", "But perhaps the photographer is also the reporter.", "Hopefully as we think through the newsrooms of the future, photojournalists will be able to maintain the journalist part of our job title. And we\u2019ll be recognized for the breadth of both the visual journalism and the text journalism that we can bring to each story.", "One story we did that was purely visually driven was called \u201cLiving in China\u2019s Expanding Desert.\u201d This was a new type of storytelling that we championed for this one particular piece in the Carbon\u2019s Casualties series. It was a story that the reporter Ed Wong and I conceptualized from a purely visual standpoint along with Hannah Fairfield, Jeremy White and Derek Watkins.", "The way our industry categorizes things hasn\u2019t caught up to the type of visual journalism that we\u2019re able to do with all of these new technologies. So we\u2019re still honoring separations between still photographs, multimedia, documentary and video reporting. We haven\u2019t settled on an overall visual journalism category.

First, a doctor out for a morning jog saw me lying unconscious, and used a pair of jeans he dug out of my backpack to slow the bleeding until an ambulance came. I was treated at the intensive care unit at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and underwent rehabilitation at Helen Hayes Hospital in Rockland County, where a skilled medical team worked tirelessly for more than a month treating injuries to my head, lungs and spine. And over the next six months, nonstop support from loved ones and expert rehabilitative care helped me recover much of what I had lost.", "But there was one feat they could not accomplish.

I became increasingly aware of how large, inflexible bureaucracies with a \u201cgood enough\u201d approach to infrastructure and services can disenfranchise citizens with disabilities, many of whom cannot bridge these gaps on their own.", "Before my injury, I had felt that dealing with grittiness and unreliability were the price of entry for living in New York, and even took a smug pride in dealing with obstacles. Since my accident, I have been humbled to realize the often dire effect of civic dysfunction on the vulnerable, and have had to recognize that some of what I once took for resourcefulness was in truth enabled by privilege.", "I was once like many other able-bodied New Yorkers, only vaguely aware of subway elevators, merely noting that they seemed dingy and often out of service. But now that I needed them, the reality was more stark. New York\u2019s subway is by far the least wheelchair-friendly public transit system of any major American city, with only 92 of the system\u2019s 425 stations accessible. That means fewer than one in four stations can be used by people in wheelchairs when elevators are working \u2014 and they frequently are not.", "On average, 25 elevators a day stop working, and these breakdowns are not quickly resolved; their median duration is nearly four hours. Moreover, with a single elevator serving both directions at most stops, a breakdown means that a disabled rider exiting the train will be trapped on the platform, and one hoping to board will have to find some other way to travel to where they need to go.", "Other problems make this bad situation worse: There is no sure way for riders to know when a breakdown has occurred: There are no intercom announcements, and the listings on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s website are unreliable. In the past month only two of the eight elevator failures I encountered were listed, making it likely that official statistics are an undercount.", "I often wheel off a train only to discover that the sole elevator to ground level is out of service. No information on alternate routes is posted as it is for other service changes and delays \u2014 indeed, subway personnel are often unaware of the situation. So the options are to wait for the next train and continue to an accessible stop \u2014 possibly many stations away \u2014 or call the fire department to be carried up the stairs.", "I\u2019ve done both, although on occasion fellow passengers have agreed to carry me \u2014 a 170-pound stranger in a wheelchair \u2014 up to the street. And it has been heartening to find that in moments of need, people step forward to help.", "But these acts by individuals cannot be accepted as a substitute for a functional system. Rather, a system that routinely leaves vulnerable riders stranded has abdicated its responsibility. The need for extraordinary goodness, like that shown by the doctor in Central Park, should be the exception, not the rule.", "All of this can make an accessible subway seem impossible. But it isn\u2019t.", "When I traveled to Boston several years ago, I was amazed to discover that its subway system \u2014 as old as New York\u2019s, though far smaller, with only 53 stations \u2014 is more than 90 percent wheelchair-accessible.", "Was Boston just a nicer town? Not necessarily. The admirable accessibility was legally mandated. In 2002, wheelchair users sued Boston\u2019s transit authority and the eventual settlement included guarantees for elevator construction, maintenance and monitoring.", "So are legal challenges the only way to get equal access for the disabled? They are undoubtedly a useful tool, and sometimes a necessary one. But however change comes, accessibility advocates will have to counter the belief that devoting resources to help one group necessarily shortchanges others.", "The lawyer and activist Angela Glover Blackwell shows in her study \u201cThe Curb-Cut Effect\u201d that there are times when steps initially taken to aid one population \u2014 like people with disabilities \u2014 are ultimately good for all. As she recounts, in the early 1970s, pedestrian curb cuts were unheard-of in American cities. A group of wheelchair activists in Berkeley, Calif., frustrated about the difficulty of wheeling around their city, began pouring concrete for makeshift ramps that would ease getting on and off sidewalks.", "At first, the activists were threatened with arrest, but before long the first official curb cut was made and many cities followed, as they realized what now seems obvious: The curb cuts weren\u2019t useful only for wheelchair users. Parents with strollers, workers with handcarts and travelers with luggage all benefited. This action helped people with disabilities integrate further into economic and cultural life. When I go to work, or pick up my children from school, those curb cuts help me get there.", "I owe a debt to those activists, and to others whose actions helped move us toward the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Now it is my turn to speak up, thank my fellow New Yorkers for their underrated kindness, and ask the transit authority to commit to follow their lead and work for all of us."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/fashion/watches-smartwatches-tag-heuer.html": ["A watch introduced last week has reignited the debate about Switzerland\u2019s role in the future of smartwatches.

At 34, she began losing a lot of weight, which she at first chalked up to her training for a half marathon. But she was also so constipated she was making endless trips to the bathroom. She had a colonoscopy and learned she had advanced colorectal cancer that was inoperable and had spread to her lung.", "\u201cIt was staring me in the face the whole time,\u201d said Ms. DeBord, who lives in Minneapolis and has such advanced disease that she can never stop chemotherapy treatment. \u201cI\u2019d Google \u2018blood in stool,\u2019 and 10 different things would come up,\u201d including colon cancer, \u201cbut I thought colon cancer was only in older people.\u201d", "Most cases of colon and rectal cancer are indeed found in people 50 and over. But there has been a sharp increase of colorectal cancer in adults as young as their 20s and 30s, with the proportion of cases found in adults under 50 increasing to 11 percent in 2013, up from 6 percent in 1990, according to the American Cancer Society. A recent study from the group that analyzed colon and rectal cancer incidence by birth year found that rates dropped steadily for people born between 1890 and 1950, but have been increasing for every generation born since 1950.", "The cause, or causes, of the increase have eluded scientists. While rates of cancers tied to human papillomavirus, or HPV, have been rising in recent years, that virus causes cancers mainly of the cervix, back of the throat and anus (anal and rectal cancers are distinct), and scientists do not believe sexual behaviors or HPV are driving the increase in colon or rectal cancer.", "Ms. DeBord, who has two young children and works for the Colon Cancer Coalition, is encouraging young adults to be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, and urges them to get a second opinion, or a third, if they think their doctor might be missing something. Younger people are much more likely to be diagnosed after the disease has spread, when it is much harder to treat, as in Ms. DeBord\u2019s case.", "Warning signs include blood in the stool, rectal bleeding or stools that are dark or black in color. The blood, released from the tumor, may be bright red or \u201ctarry\u201d in appearance, which can result when blood has broken down in the intestine. Unexplained or unintentional weight loss or fatigue can also be symptoms. General digestive complaints can also occur, including persistent abdominal cramps, gas pain or low back pain, feeling bloated, or experiencing a change in bathroom habits that lasts more than a few days, such as diarrhea, constipation, narrower than usual stools or a feeling that your bowel is not emptying completely.", "\u201cI kept making excuses for my symptoms,\u201d said Ms. DeBord, until \u201cit got so bad I knew something was wrong.\u201d", "Many symptoms that could indicate colorectal cancer may be benign, or related to other medical conditions, which is why the diagnosis is often missed in young adults, experts say.", "Iron-deficiency anemia, for example, is common in women with heavy periods, but it can also be a sign of colorectal cancer. In women who are not menstruating and in men, \u201canemia is colon cancer until proven otherwise,\u201d said one expert, Dr. Thomas Weber, who serves on the steering committee of the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. In general, he said, worrisome symptoms that persist should be investigated, and doctors should consider ordering a colonoscopy.", "Dr. Renee Williams, an assistant professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine and a gastroenterologist at Bellevue Hospital Center, said she would take steps to rule out colorectal cancer even in menstruating women with iron deficiency if they are in their 40s, as well as in younger women with a first case of iron deficiency if they do not have heavy periods.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a panic, and the frequency in younger adults is still relatively low, but we are seeing an increase,\u201d said Dr. Mark Pochapin, director of gastroenterology at NYU Langone Medical Center, and treasurer of the American College of Gastroenterology.", "The new data \u201craise the flag to be vigilant,\u201d Dr. Pochapin said. \u201cWe need doctors to realize colorectal cancer is possible in younger patients, and if they are having something like rectal bleeding, this could be something more serious. Young people\u2019s symptoms should not be dismissed.\u201d", "Physicians are trained to think of the most common conditions first, that \u201cWhen you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t as much a zebra as people think.\u201d", "Routine screening tests for colorectal cancer are not currently recommended in people under 50 who are considered to be at average risk because the number of cases is so low that universal screening tests would most likely do more harm than good, experts say. Colonoscopies, for example, are often done with sedation and can result in serious complications, such as perforation of the intestine, in a small percentage of cases.", "So what\u2019s the average millennial or Gen-Xer to do?", "\u25a0 Find a primary care physician whom you like and trust, and establish a relationship with him or her, even if you don\u2019t have any medical issues, said Dr. Pochapin. \u201cGo to a doctor when you\u2019re well,\u201d he said. That way, if you ever develop worrisome symptoms, \u201cyou have easy access, and can get care from someone who knows you already. A lot of young people are embarrassed to talk about these things.\u201d", "\u25a0 Know your family history and share it with your physician. Has anyone in your family had colorectal cancer, or had precancerous polyps removed? \u201cIf you have a first-degree relative \u2014 a parent or sibling \u2014 who had colon cancer at 50,\u201d for example, \u201cyou should be screened at 40,\u201d or 10 years earlier, said Dr. Williams. Illness in a more distant relative may also increase the risk. Certain medical conditions, like inflammatory bowel disease and certain other cancers, may also increase the risk for colorectal cancer. If you are African-American, some medical organizations encourage screening starting earlier, at age 45, Dr. Williams said.", "\u25a0 Know what\u2019s normal for you, said Anne Carlson, executive director of the Colon Cancer Coalition. \u201cKnow your body,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at your stool \u2014 it\u2019s really the picture of your health. Take pictures to show your doctor if you\u2019re concerned. Keep a journal of what\u2019s going on in your toilet and your eating habits and diet, and be aware of changes in your body.\u201d", "\u25a0 If your doctor isn\u2019t taking a concern seriously, be persistent, Ms. Carlson said. \u201cWe are taught physicians know best. But you know when something isn\u2019t right for you,\u201d she said. If a doctor is dismissive, \u201cgo to another one, and another one.\u201d Even though routine screening is not recommended until age 50, doctors can order diagnostic tests if you are having persistent symptoms. In addition to flexible sigmoidoscopy, which examines the rectum and lower colon, and colonoscopy, there are noninvasive laboratory tests that can be done to examine stool samples for microscopic amounts of hemoglobin, a marker for blood, and for DNA markers indicative of colorectal cancer. \u201cColon cancer is one of the most treatable cancers if it\u2019s found early,\u201d Ms. Carlson said.", "\u25a0 Last but not least, a healthy lifestyle that lessens your risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes may also protect you from colorectal cancer. Eat a diet that\u2019s high in fruits, vegetables and fiber, and provides enough folate and calcium. Avoid eating lots of red or grilled meats and processed meats, which are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Obesity, smoking, heavy use of alcohol and sedentary lifestyles are also associated with an increased risk. Try to keep your weight under control.

In the last year alone, the company\u2019s employee base has doubled in size to more than 12,000.", "But that turbocharged expansion has come at a cost, employees have said. Growth, they said, was prioritized above anything else. That skewed the development of the organization into something that embraced the \u201ccult of the individual,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said.", "Top performers were rewarded and promoted into management positions. Some 63 percent of managers had never previously held a leadership position, and Uber did not provide much training for new managers, some said.", "\u201cFor the first several years, we had to just focus on executing our operational goals, and that was kind of the be-all, end-all,\u201d said Nicole Cuellar, an operations and logistics manager who has worked at Uber for nearly four years. \u201cThere was never the need to think about our culture like that.

The driver, who had been working with the company since 2011, accused Kalanick of undercutting drivers of high-end cars like his, plunging him into bankruptcy. Kalanick responded with a lecture about the basic economic logic of his company: Soon, the supply of luxury cars on the app would be reduced, causing demand to increase. Besides, he went on, if the company hadn\u2019t added a lower-priced tier, it would have been beaten by competitors. This did not satisfy the driver, which seemed to enrage Kalanick, who erupted into a moralizing tirade. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like to take responsibility for their own [expletive],\u201d he said, before leaving the car.", "The scene in the clip, obtained and published by Bloomberg, was striking.

There were allegations of sexual harassment and intellectual-property theft; The Times uncovered a brazen effort to thwart local authorities. These scandals drew scrutiny to Uber\u2019s corporate culture. But the recording of Kalanick shed light on something else: the model around which the company is built.", "Uber, like so many other successful tech companies in 2017, is a \u201cplatform business,\u201d one built around matchmaking between vendors and customers. If successful, a platform creates its own marketplace; if extremely successful, it ends up controlling something closer to an entire economy. This is intuitive in a case like eBay, which connects buyers and sellers. Airbnb, too, resembles an age-old form of commerce, connecting property owners with short-term lodgers. TaskRabbit and Fiverr connect contractors with people looking to hire them. Some of the largest platforms are less obviously transactional: Facebook and Google connect advertisers with users, users with one another, software developers with users. But while the transactions that happen on their platforms largely take a different form \u2014 taps, shares, ads served and scrolled past \u2014 the principles are essentially the same, as are the benefits. These businesses are asset- and employee-light, low on liability and high on upside. They aspire to monopoly, often unapologetically, and have been instrumental in rehabilitating the concept. (The logic is seductive and often self-evident: Facebook is more useful if everyone is on it, therefore everyone should be on Facebook.)", "Predictably, platforms have long been intoxicating to investors. They\u2019ve also been the subject of rapturous popular business writing. In their 2016 book \u201cMatchmakers: The New Economics of Multisided Platforms,\u201d the economists David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee cast the subject in revolutionary terms, calling for a \u201cnew economics\u201d to account for businesses that are \u201ctransforming economies\u201d around the world, \u201cmaking life easier and better for billions of people\u201d \u2014 the sort of broad and ideological claim previously reserved by economists for capitalism as a whole.", "Amid the cheerleading, a comprehensive criticism of the platform model has been slow to emerge. Nick Srnicek\u2019s \u201cPlatform Capitalism,\u201d published in December, tries to situate the rise of platforms in a broader history of capitalism and to project those lessons forward. Srnicek recasts a few features of platform businesses as potentially problematic. Among them is their tendency to metastasize from transaction enablers to, with sufficient success, participation gatekeepers. A food-delivery app like Seamless begins its life with promises of liberation, connecting customers with nearby restaurants, taking care of payments and eliminating phone calls. But in the cities where it has been most successful, its customer base becomes too big to ignore, even for restaurants that struggle to afford its steep commissions. In other industries, the stakes are much higher. An insurgent Airbnb feels as if it\u2019s enabling new types of transactions between previously unconnected people. A dominant Airbnb might come to resemble something between a superintendent and a landlord for millions, not to mention a force reshaping cities in its image.", "Platform companies have themselves hired economists to help conceptualize and manage the economies they\u2019ve created. Google, Airbnb, Uber and Amazon have aggressively recruited professors and researchers to help understand what, exactly, they have on their hands, and how to expand, regulate and exploit it. Within a rigidly structured platform like Uber, for which the company sets prices, the economic problems are somewhat akin to those of a command economy: How low can we push the cost of a ride before drivers stop participating? (Quite low, for now.) How do we deal with sudden increases in demand? (Surge pricing, controversially.) How might new drivers be both induced to join the platform and more deeply compelled to stay? (Through the introduction of vehicle-financing programs and short-term loan services.)", "Platforms are, in a sense, capitalism distilled to its essence. They are proudly experimental and maximally consequential, prone to creating externalities and especially disinclined to address or even acknowledge what happens beyond their rising walls. And accordingly, platforms are the underlying trend that ties together popular narratives about technology and the economy in general. Platforms provide the substructure for the \u201cgig economy\u201d and the \u201csharing economy\u201d; they\u2019re the economic engine of social media; they\u2019re the architecture of the \u201cattention economy\u201d and the inspiration for claims about the \u201cend of ownership.\u201d", "But the tensions that platforms like Uber create with their customers, their workers and the world that surrounds them will soon become harder to ignore as these companies foment economic and social change, the consequences of which will increasingly be thrust into spectacular display. The Kalanick video was a P.R. nightmare not just for Uber but also for the platform economy in general, posing grand questions about the world it promises, or threatens, to create. The zeal for platforms, combined with the technology industry\u2019s internalization of their merits and inevitability, will push them into areas where the tensions they create become starker and the ideologies they carry become more apparent.", "Nowhere is that ideological dimension more clear than in the Kalanick video from February. Driver and founder sat inches apart, alienated from each other by the system over which one presides and within which the other toils: the founder explaining to the driver how the platform works and must work; the driver appealing to this person for better pay. It resembles nothing more than one man remarking on the rain while the other thinks, \u201cDon\u2019t you control the weather?\u201d Platforms seek total control even as they abdicate responsibility. In other words, they\u2019re perfect.", "For now, the tensions that platforms can breed have been obscured \u2014 or at least ignored \u2014 in large part because platformized labor has arrived first in sectors where employment was already widely precarious and contract-based, like taxi driving. As the model expands, these tensions may become more visible as workers with more political and social capital are subjected to them. The recent history of platforms, however, has been defined by the failure of all but a few smart or lucky people to imagine just how successful and powerful they can be."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/points-of-no-return.html": ["Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music", "In The New York Times Book Review, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen reviews Mohsin Hamid\u2019s new novel, \u201cExit West.\u201d Nguyen writes:", "On this week\u2019s podcast, Hamid talks about \u201cExit West\u201d; Gillian Thomas discusses Marjorie J.

And therein problems may lie. Price sensitivity isn\u2019t limited simply to objects on shelves in stores; it now goes with wardrobes, too. Better take it \u2026 well, into account.", "Ms. Trump apparently did.

That is, after Ms. Trump had separated her personal social media accounts from her brand\u2019s social accounts, but before she had taken a formal leave of absence from the company.

Because segueing away from high-end jewelry doesn\u2019t just bring the collection in line with the rest of the Ivanka Trump product portfolio \u2014 the clothes and bags and shoes \u2014 it brings it in line with what is increasingly emerging as the Ivanka Trump personal portfolio: the issues of child care, working parents and sacrifices made.", "Rhodium plate is consistent with her message in a way that diamonds and 24-karat gold would not have been. This was probably first brought home to Ms. Trump during the outcry over her appearance on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in a $10,800 bracelet from her own line, one her company subsequently marketed (oops).

The problem is that he would get someone else to pay for them, especially when he is in the midst of pushing an austerity plan.", "Taken together with current allegations that he enriched family members by employing them in nonexistent jobs, the clothing freebies underscore the perception that he is elitist and corrupt.

This is a choice he made after formerly wearing custom suits from Lagonda, which retail from \u20ac800 to \u20ac1,200 ($854 to $1,281), during his earlier career as an investment banker \u2014 a canny exchange probably based more on constituency than aesthetics.

Our digital crude is a rich brew of mundane, everyday activities \u2014 our searches, texts and tweets \u2014 along with the GPS coordinates from our phones, the biometric information we share with fitness devices, even the IP addresses of our connected refrigerators. To the average person, this raw material is undetectable noise. But for organizations that know how to identify signals, there\u2019s immense value in refining what has become an unlimited supply.", "Understanding what data we create, and how others exploit it, is vitally important. Soon, powerful machine-learning algorithms and artificially intelligent systems will analyze our data to reach decisions about and for us: whether we qualify for a bank loan, whether we\u2019re likely to commit a crime, whether we deserve an organ transplant. And unlike us, machines aren\u2019t burdened with an emotional attachment to privacy.", "The popular old data-as-oil idea opens Andreas Weigend\u2019s new book, \u201cData for the People,\u201d an exhaustive and insightful look at how data is collected and used, often without our knowledge and almost always without our input. Weigend, the former chief scientist at Amazon, details the \u201csocial data\u201d that emanates from billions of cameras, sensors and other devices, as well as social networks, online retailers and dating apps. Data refineries \u2014 those companies and people who turn our digital crude into profitable information \u2014 hunt for patterns, then sort us into buckets based on our behavior: what we might buy, what we\u2019ll watch, whom we might fall in love with. As Weigend points out, this exchange benefits everyone: If we let ourselves be mined, we receive personalized recommendations, connections and deals. Yet there\u2019s an imbalance of power. Companies make a lot of money from our data, and we have very little say in how it\u2019s used.", "Weigend argues persuasively that in this \u201cpost-privacy\u201d world, we should give our data freely, but that we should expect certain protections in return. He advocates a set of rights to increase data refineries\u2019 transparency and to increase our own agency in how information is used. Companies like OkCupid, WeChat and Spotify should perform data safety audits, submit to privacy ratings and calculate a score based on the benefits they provide \u2014 a sort of credit score for the companies that mine our data. Meanwhile, we should have the right to amend, blur and import or export our own data into any system we please.", "Not everyone believes that our information should be freely available as long as we agree to the terms of use. In \u201cThe Art of Invisibility,\u201d the internet security expert Kevin Mitnick advocates the opposite. Mitnick notes various reasons we may want to hide our data: We\u2019re wary of the government; we don\u2019t want businesses intruding into our lives; we have a mistress; we are the mistress; we\u2019re a criminal. Mitnick, who served five years in prison for hacking into corporate networks and stealing software, offers a sobering reminder of how our raw data \u2014 from email, cars, home Wi-Fi networks and so on \u2014 makes us vulnerable. He describes basic privacy protections (using a strong password, avoiding public computers) along with more advanced techniques (encrypting files on a hard drive, using a VPN and Bitcoin for online purchases). Most will seem familiar and perhaps rudimentary to those with any technical savvy. For everyone else, he offers an uncomfortable view of how data can be exploited.", "Both books are meant to scare us, and the central theme is privacy: Without intervention, they suggest, we\u2019ll come to regret today\u2019s inaction. I agree, but the authors miss the real horror show on the horizon. The future\u2019s fundamental infrastructure is being built by computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and security experts just like Weigend and Mitnick, who do not recognize their own biases. This encodes an urgent flaw in the foundation itself. The next layer will be just a little off, along with the next one and the one after that, as the problems compound.", "Right now, humans and machines engage in \u201csupervised learning.\u201d Experts \u201cteach\u201d the system by labeling an initial data set; once the computer reaches basic proficiency, they let it try sorting data on its own. If the system makes an error, the experts correct it. Eventually, this process yields highly sophisticated algorithms capable of refining and using our personal data for a variety of purposes: automatically sorting spam out of your inbox, say, or recommending a show you\u2019ll like on Netflix. Then, building on this foundation of data and algorithms, more teaching and learning takes place.", "But human bias creeps into computerized algorithms in disconcerting ways. In 2015, Google\u2019s photo app mistook a black software developer for a gorilla in photos he uploaded. In 2016, the Microsoft chatbot Tay went on a homophobic, anti-Semitic rampage after just one day of interactions on Twitter.

This comes through in both books. In Mitnick\u2019s, women appear primarily in anecdotes and always as unwitting, jealous or angry. Near the end, Mitnick describes trying to enter Canada from Michigan, and wonders if he\u2019s stopped \u201cbecause a Middle Eastern guy with only a green card was driving.\u201d (He might be right, but he doesn\u2019t allow for the possibility that his own criminal record could also be responsible.)", "Weigend\u2019s book is meticulously researched, yet nearly all the experts he quotes are men. Early on he tells the story of Latanya Sweeney, who in the 1990s produced a now famous study of anonymized public health data in Massachusetts. She proved that the data could be traced back to individuals, including the governor himself. But Sweeney is far better known for something Weigend never mentions: She\u2019s the Harvard professor who discovered that \u2014 because of her black-sounding name \u2014 she was appearing in Google ads for criminal records and background checks. Weigend could have cited her to address bias in the second of his six rights, involving the integrity of a refinery\u2019s social data ecosystem. But he neglects to discuss the well-documented sexism, racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the machine-learning infrastructure.", "The omission of women and people of color from something as benign as book research illustrates the real challenge of unconscious bias in data and algorithms. Weigend and Mitnick rely only on what\u2019s immediate and familiar \u2014 an unfortunately common practice in the data community. University computer science, math and physics departments lack diversity in staff and coursework. Corporate data science is homogeneous. So are professional and academic conferences, where the future of data is discussed.

One study found that it may \u2014 may \u2014 have resulted in 21 more new offerings a year, but given the small numbers in the analysis, that is questionable.", "Moreover, the JOBS Act has done nothing to revive the market for small companies, those with a market capitalization of under $75 million. They still number less than a handful each year.", "And while fingers get pointed at regulation like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the number of initial public offerings fell off the cliff in 1996 \u2014 years before either bill was passed. So there must be something more here.", "Those who have examined this issue have come up with a number of possible reasons.", "The first theory is that the decline is a result of structural changes in the market ecosystem. Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida, has argued that the dearth of initial public offerings has been caused by companies selling out quicker.", "The Credit Suisse paper also brings up this theory, noting that mergers are the major cause for companies to be delisted from a stock exchange. It appears that this deal activity has spread to the private markets, co-opting the process of taking companies public.", "For example, Cisco Systems purchased AppDynamics on the eve of its market debut. And acquirers seem willing to pay top dollar in these instances, as research and development by many large corporations now consists largely of acquiring smaller, usually private, companies.", "This is aptly illustrated by the buying sprees of Google and Facebook, which took candidates to go public \u2014 like Instagram, Nest, Waze and WhatsApp \u2014 out of contention.", "Another possibility involves demand. In a paper that I wrote with Robert Bartlett and Paul Rose, we explore this theory. The drop-off in activity is largely attributed to the disappearance of the small offering.", "In 1996, average proceeds for an initial public offering were $85.7 million, and 54 percent of these offerings were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. In 2014, however, average proceeds were $186.4 million and only 4 percent of offerings were small.", "The market for new issues has moved toward liquidity and bigger stocks. Mutual funds prefer making big investments rather than small ones for liquidity and administrative purposes \u2014 lots of small investments simply require more people and more monitoring.", "A third possibility is that companies simply no longer need the public market. The private markets are more efficient, and financing is readily available from venture capitalists and banks.", "There are even markets and mechanisms that exist not only to allow for financing, but to allow for selling employees\u2019 and founders\u2019 shares in private markets. In addition, the JOBS Act allowed companies to expand the number of shareholders and still be private, a change that encouraged companies to remain private.", "There are other theories. One of these notes that the 1990s saw a surge in I.P.O. activity and that we are just back to what the activity was in the 1970s and \u201980s. Who is to say what is a normal market?", "Another possible reason is that companies are shying away from the public markets to avoid shareholder activism, short-termism and the glare of public scrutiny.", "Yet the growing use of dual class shares and staggered boards by new companies, measures that help founders retain control, argues against this need. And they are tools that can be used by any company \u2014 even Shake Shack went public with dual-class stock.", "The bottom line is that while there might be rational reasons to reduce regulation on capital raising \u2014 to make it easier and less expensive \u2014 we are kidding ourselves if we think that simply deregulating will bring back initial public offerings.", "The task is much harder. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for one, could help build an infrastructure for buying small company offerings. Allowing mutual funds more latitude to buy illiquid small investments and to change their compensation structures if they do would be a big step.", "In addition, we could explore more novel ways of bringing companies to the public markets. Special purpose acquisitions companies \u2014 those created to buy a private company and bring it public \u2014 have attracted criticism, including from me. Yet a recent $900 million deal in the energy business shows one possible way to take more companies public, provided there are investor protections.", "Then there is the argument that maybe we shouldn\u2019t do anything, given how hard it will be. The idea behind the public markets is to provide capital funding. But if the private markets are now efficient and capable of providing even less expensive capital at lower cost, maybe we should be fine with the current state of affairs.", "Still, that overlooks the fact that for most of us, our retirement money is in the public markets. We should be worried about all of this money flowing into a smaller and smaller group of companies.", "One answer is to allow mutual funds to invest more in private companies. Already 26 mutual fund groups had $11.5 billion invested in late-stage companies in 2016, according to Credit Suisse.", "That\u2019s one answer, but that will result in yet more intermediaries.

It feels like a watershed. For gender-diversity advocates in the tech industry, Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations, and the public outcry they have ignited, offer a possibility that something new may be in the offing.", "What could happen? Something innovative: This could be the start of a deep, long-term and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women \u2014 not just at Uber but across the tech business, too.", "\u201cI still see hope and opportunity for Uber,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, a partner at the venture capital firm Kapor Capital and co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, who along with her husband, the entrepreneur Mitch Kapor, are investors in Uber. Last week, the couple published a scathing open letter pushing the company to more openly investigate its culture. Ms. Kapor Klein said that Uber was well known in the tech industry for its unfriendliness to women.", "\u201cUber is pretty far along a spectrum,\u201d she said. \u201cThe word among women engineers I talk to is that Uber is the epitome of bro-grammer culture.\u201d", "But precisely for those reasons, Ms. Kapor Klein argued that if Uber mounted an honest investigation into its culture and pledged to transparently remake what ails it, it could become a model for the industry.", "\u201cThey did ask me, \u2018Has anyone gotten it right in tech?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cAnd I said not yet. And that means an opportunity for Uber.\u201d", "This might sound Pollyannaish. But Uber\u2019s business incentives lend credence to Ms. Kapor Klein\u2019s guarded optimism. At the moment, Uber\u2019s brand is in tatters. It has weathered a long series of scandals and controversies stemming from its aggressive fight against regulators and competitors. Customers refuse to give it the benefit of the doubt; even when Uber\u2019s actions aren\u2019t devious (as when it was wrongly accused of breaking a New York taxi strike held in protest of President Trump\u2019s immigration ban), few spring to its defense.", "That\u2019s a reasonable position given the new depths to which Uber constantly sinks. For instance, last year the company defied California state regulators to run a self-driving car experiment in San Francisco. When one of its cars ran a red light, Uber put out a statement blaming human error for the problem. As The New York Times reported last week, that wasn\u2019t true. The car was driving itself and Uber had misled the public.", "Any company with such a reckless culture and tarnished reputation would have to do something to remake its brand. But Uber faces extra motivation to do so.", "Unlike many aggressive start-ups that have come before it \u2014 Amazon and Facebook, for instance, were no pushovers \u2014 Uber is not a natural monopoly. It sells a service that has ready substitutes, and it has well-funded competitors in many of its major markets. Its rivals have put their supposedly friendlier brands at the center of their competitive strategy. They are all waiting for Uber to fail, and every time Uber finds a way to lower its reputation even further, competitors can peel off customers, drivers and engineers.", "Finally, there\u2019s the Trump factor. Ever since the presidential election, people in the tech industry have been amped up. Employees and customers have learned to take up arms against companies that don\u2019t espouse their values, and companies have started to listen.", "\u201cLeft-leaning Silicon Valley has been embracing the Women\u2019s March and had this heightened awareness about issues that women face due to misogynistic men,\u201d said Karen Catlin, a former software engineer who is now an advocate for women in the tech industry. Now the same social-media energy aimed at President Trump is being marshaled against Uber, better known on Twitter as #deleteUber.", "Put all these factors together and you get something toxic to Uber\u2019s bottom line. As Ben Thompson of the Stratechery blog noted last week, Uber\u2019s reputation now looks like an existential problem. Its brand is so diminished that it is possible, for the first time, to see how the company\u2019s enormous valuation of about $70 billion could begin to unravel.", "Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s chief executive, and others at the company appear to understand the gravity of the threat. The company moved swiftly to open an investigation into Ms. Fowler\u2019s allegations. Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur who sits on Uber\u2019s board, were among those it appointed to find out what\u2019s going wrong at the company.", "In an emotional meeting with female engineers last week, Mr. Kalanick sounded contrite and determined to fix the company. \u201cThere are people in this room who have experienced things that are incredibly unjust,\u201d he said, according to a recording obtained by BuzzFeed News. \u201cI want to root out the injustice. I want to get at the people who are making this place a bad place. And you have my commitment.\u201d", "All of this could be for show. To a lot of people, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s word no longer carries much weight. But you don\u2019t have to just trust him. If Uber is serious about remaking its culture, we can watch for concrete action.", "Ms. Kapor Klein is looking for several steps. She wants Mr. Holder\u2019s report to detail for the public everything he\u2019s found at the company. She wants to see new policies for how Uber hires people, ones that put more weight on the diversity of its work force. She wants the company to offer more formal and informal ways for employees to report problems to management, including allowing them to do so anonymously in order to avoid retribution. She also wants Uber to offer more training for employees, and better workplace surveys to get a sense of what\u2019s going wrong.", "Finally, Ms. Kapor Klein said, she would be scrutinizing Mr. Kalanick\u2019s own actions.", "\u201cYou need unequivocal commitment from the top,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen someone does something abhorrent, do you fire your best performer? That is the litmus test.\u201d", "An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the outcome of Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, which is just beginning, but said that all of Ms. Kapor Klein\u2019s recommendations were on the table.", "Mr. Kalanick also showed that he was willing to eliminate offenders. After Recode found that Amit Singhal, Uber\u2019s new senior vice president for engineering, had left his old job at Google under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations, Mr. Kalanick fired Mr. Singhal. (Mr. Singhal has denied any wrongdoing.) And he is apparently willing to alter his own behavior. On Tuesday, after Bloomberg published a video showing Mr. Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver over the company\u2019s prices, Mr. Kalanick sent an apology to his employees: \u201cIt\u2019s clear this video is a reflection of me \u2014 and the criticism we\u2019ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\u201d", "Whatever Uber does in the next few weeks will only be a start.

The big opportunity for all consumer internet companies is the money that will flow from TV ads to digital ads, and I think Snap has a pretty good shot at capturing a huge slice of that market.", "I also wouldn\u2019t compare it to GoPro. Yes, Snap says it\u2019s a camera company, but we\u2019re taking it too literally. It\u2019s a camera company whose main innovation is camera software, not hardware. In this way it is a bit like Apple: Apple\u2019s physical phone hardware is in many cases on par with that of competitors, but the reason that Apple makes essentially all the profit in the smartphone business is that its software keeps people glued to iPhones. Snap, too, is investing in software that hooks you in, and its hardware will be secondary to that.

Spindly granite towers, it was suggested, could be carved into free-standing statues honoring heroes of the American West: Red Cloud, Sacagawea, Lewis and Clark. Instead of gold, South Dakota could harvest tourists.", "Only one American sculptor seemed up to the task. He was, like the sculpture he would create, a larger-than-life weirdo: John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum, son of a Danish immigrant, friend of Auguste Rodin, publicity hound, populist, salesman, self-styled tough guy with a white Stetson and a flowing scarf and a dark, bushy mustache. At the time, Borglum was working on another huge sculpture chiseled into the front of a mountain: a tribute, in Georgia, to great heroes of the Confederacy \u2014 Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson.

Anything else, he argued, would be too limited, too provincial, not sufficiently star-spangled \u201cU.S.A.!!!\u201d Borglum believed that America was a special artistic challenge, a place so heroically grand that the effete styles of Europe could never hope to do it justice. \u201cArt in America should be American,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdrawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement.\u201d He accepted the challenge to transform the Black Hills.", "From the beginning, the project struck many locals as absurd. Controversy raged in the newspapers. To carve statues in the mountains, one wrote, \u201cwould be as incongruous and ridiculous as keeping a cow in the rotunda of the Capitol building.\u201d \u201cWhy not just paint a mustache on everything?\u201d another asked.", "Funding for Mount Rushmore was touch-and-go, as was political and public support. But Borglum would not give up. The project took far longer, and cost far more money, than anyone could have imagined. Logistics were murderously complex. Men were lowered over the rock face on sling chairs; carving was done mainly with dynamite and jackhammers. At one point, a crack running through the stone threatened to break Thomas Jefferson\u2019s nose, so his face was blown off the mountain and started again in a different spot.", "Mount Rushmore is not just big; it is about bigness \u2014 a monument to monumentalism. Borglum was obsessed with America\u2019s size: the heroic story of a handful of tiny East Coast settlements growing to engulf an entire continent. The four presidents were chosen largely for their roles in this expansion. Jefferson, for instance, not only wrote the Declaration of Independence but also greatly increased the country via the Louisiana Purchase. Teddy Roosevelt oversaw the creation of the Panama Canal, which increased America\u2019s global reach.", "The sculpting of Mount Rushmore began in 1927, with a ceremony overseen by President Calvin Coolidge, who wore a comically large hat. Work spanned 14 years, encompassing some of the defining spasms of American history: the Great Depression, the beginning of World War II. Separate dedication ceremonies were held for each of the four faces; Franklin Roosevelt himself came to dedicate Jefferson. The sculpture was finished one month and one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Work would have continued \u2014 the plan was to depict each of the presidents down to the waist \u2014 but funding began to dry up again, and Borglum died, and after a few finishing touches, the figures were abandoned as good enough. This was precisely the moment when American influence was about to explode, the dawn of 50 years of prosperity and cultural dominance. Mount Rushmore was completed, conveniently, just in time to serve as a kind of superheated mascot for the mythology of the Greatest Generation and baby boomers: that America\u2019s hugeness is bound up with its nobility, that it deservedly dominates the globe.", "The granite of Mount Rushmore is so hard that the sculptures will erode at a rate of one inch every 10,000 years.", "Several times, as we drove to Mount Rushmore, we worried that the road was too small for our car. We had rented a huge S.U.V., like a tank without the gun turret \u2014 a rolling monolith of American power \u2014 and the road to Rushmore was old, narrow and winding. It passed through forests of ponderosa pine; the trees held the snow way out on the tips of their branches, in clumps, as if they were clutching snowballs. The road, in summer, is loaded with traffic, but that morning we had it all to ourselves. The pavement was covered with a skin of snow; we chugged over it with total confidence. In this way, winding and winding, switchback after switchback, we made our way up the mountain.", "Huge thrusts of rock burst out of the landscape at random intervals in the forest.

More than once, I had the feeling that we were driving in a theme park. Each tunnel had been carefully blasted to frame a perfect view of Mount Rushmore. The presidents were watching us come to them. Our daughter screamed when she saw them and made me pull over so she could get a good angle for Snapchat.", "\u201cI hate pictures,\u201d our son said. \u201cYour mind is your own picture-taker-thing.\u201d", "At one point, we passed a roadside cliff that looked vaguely like a face, and we all spent several minutes debating whether it had been carved like that deliberately or if we were maybe going slightly crazy in the snowy, empty woods. Soon everything we saw started to look like a face: rocks, trees, snowdrifts. \u201cThey\u2019re haunting me!\u201d our daughter shouted. \u201cEvery rock I look at! I don\u2019t understand life!\u201d", "By the time we pulled into the Mount Rushmore parking garage, after an eternity of winding, everyone was exhausted and starving. The park\u2019s restaurant was closed for renovation, so we settled into a sort of triage-unit cafe next door. We ate in tense silence. The food was bad. I drank a beer called Honest Abe Red Ale, the can of which featured a picture of Mount Rushmore below the slogan GET SICK-N-TWISTED.

That was really the biggest thing you could say about it: There it was. Rushmore is a ubiquitous American image, tattooed on the inside of every citizen\u2019s eyelids, so it felt disorienting to see it in three-dimensional space, pinned to this particular spot on the earth. We had the viewing deck almost to ourselves, which meant that the presidents and our family faced off. Four of us, four of them.", "There was Washington, out front, the leader of the band \u2014 noble, aristocratic and smooth, his mouth a grim stone line. A dollop of snow stuck to the bridge of his nose. Peering over his shoulder, like a shy sidekick, was Jefferson, his big nose held high, showing his nostrils to the world. (This was not an artistic choice; the grain of the rock forced Borglum to tilt the head back.) Lincoln stood apart from them, heavy eyebrows frosted with snow, and in the middle, almost swallowed by the mountain, was Teddy Roosevelt, with his wire-rimmed spectacles and Freddie Mercury mustache. They were all looking in slightly different directions, not at us but far over our heads, into the great American distance.", "I must admit that, in person, I was not especially moved by the beauty of the sculptures. They were, essentially, traditional busts, distinguished mainly by their insane scale and placement. The novelty of it was stronger than the beauty.", "What stood out most was everything around the presidents\u2019 faces: the Black Hills landscape that spreads and spreads, incorporating eons of old rock and new growth, last century\u2019s roads and yesterday\u2019s snow. This was something that was hard to appreciate in photographs, which tend to be tightly cropped \u2014 just the presidents, stony and smooth. But the mountain itself is magnificent: rough and rutted and craggy, like an ancient crocodile\u2019s back. The stone is warped and twisted, a frozen surge flowing toward and around the artificial faces; it is like a diagram of the geological energy that thrust it into being nearly two billion years ago. This speaks to forces much larger than America or nationalism of any kind. It made the giant heads look small.", "I felt a rush of emotion that was not patriotism but awe: awe at human weirdness, at our capacity to create, in the actual world, such an improbable and unnecessary artifact as this. Why had humans done this? Why did Mount Rushmore exist?", "\u201cOh, it\u2019s a nice little mountain thing,\u201d my son said appreciatively, and then he asked if we could leave.", "We drove away from Mount Rushmore, down and down, through the uncarved wilderness, into the city of Custer, a windswept Old West outpost where the guidebook recommended a coffee shop and a bakery, both of which turned out to be closed. We sat for a while, instead, sheltered from the icy wind, inside a Pizza Hut. We debated whether it was snowing outside or whether the outrageous wind was just blowing all the old snow around. Our children giggled over their phones. A vending machine by the door sold Christian stickers for 50 cents: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in luck, I believe in Jesus.\u201d", "Outside Custer was the Crazy Horse Memorial \u2014 another granite mountain being carved, Rushmore-style, into the enormous likeness of a historic figure. This one depicted Crazy Horse, the enigmatic leader of the Oglala Sioux, one of the fiercest defenders of the Black Hills from the indignity of white invasion. It was a sort of corrective to Rushmore, a reclaiming of the landscape by the people from whom it was stolen. My family was tired and refused to get out of the car, so I walked through the museum myself. I looked at a tiny model of the monument.

We are born a fantasy of bigness. We are tall and strapping, with big hats and big hair and loud clothes and booming voices. We drive our big cars through the epic landscapes of our giant continent. We work in tall buildings, where we give 110 percent in order to build larger-than-life careers that distinguish us from the huge teeming masses of our fellows. Our great ideas define infinite eras. Our big weapons win big wars. We are economically, geographically, culturally and spiritually huge: the Gigantic States of America.", "There is something childish about this fantasy \u2014 the way it tends to conflate virtue and size. Why does goodness have to be huge? It is a dangerous belief, and one that inevitably causes stress and confusion when \u2014 as it must \u2014 it runs up against reality. Inevitably, there will be a shift in scale; the dominant thing (nation, culture, religion, demographic) will begin to shrink. Does it lose its virtue with its dominance?

A small herd of pronghorns glided over a bluff, ghostly white on the snow. It was as beautiful as any land I\u2019ve ever seen; driving through it inspired the kind of awe that the sculptures of Rushmore had not. But then again, we never would have seen this landscape if we hadn\u2019t come to look at Rushmore.", "At one point, our car was besieged by a herd of burros. They surrounded us completely, forcing us to stop. We rolled our windows down. They stuck their heads in and worked their giant lips; we could see, deep inside their mouths, tiny sets of teeth clacking away in anticipation of food. It was like a horror movie, but hilarious. The burros were not native to the Black Hills: Their ancestors had been brought to the region as pack animals, then set loose, so these creatures were a result of many generations of acquired wildness. We had nothing to feed them, so they started licking our car, presumably for the salt from the roads. When we got out later, the entire vehicle was covered in thin white swirls.", "It took some doing to find a lodge near Rushmore that was open in the off-season. Its driveway was thick with unplowed snow, but our S.U.V. ate its way through. The place was a log cabin bed-and-breakfast, lushly decorated with antler-based furniture; it billed itself as the only lodge with a full-frontal view of the monument itself. After our day of driving, I looked forward to studying the presidents\u2019 faces in detail, at length, warm and undisturbed. The owner of the lodge was a living exponent of the story of Rushmore, the granddaughter of the man who designed the pigtail bridges. Whenever I asked her a question, history books poured out of her mouth.", "She pointed me to the Rushmore view, and sure enough, there it was, unobstructed. But it was so far away that you could barely see it. Binoculars hung by the window. Even magnified, the heads were tiny. Borglum made the sculptures on Mount Rushmore 80 times as large as an average human head \u2014 each one roughly the size of a sperm whale. This window shrank those heads down to the size of a pin.", "As the evening wore on, the view got stranger. Outside, somewhere in the wilds of the Black Hills, a fire was burning. As the sky darkened, the fire grew and grew, and from our perspective through the window, it was directly in front of Rushmore. It sent its smoke into the presidents\u2019 miniature faces, and the smoke glowed an eerie red. George Washington looked at us through the screen of a red cloud. It seemed like one of those weird meteorological events, an eclipse or a comet, that ancient cultures invested with meaning.

At one point, Mr. Bogachev had control over as many as a million computers in multiple countries, with possible access to everything from family vacation photographs and term papers to business proposals and highly confidential personal information.

For Russia\u2019s surveillance-obsessed intelligence community, Mr. Bogachev\u2019s exploits may have created an irresistible opportunity for espionage.", "While Mr. Bogachev was draining bank accounts, it appears that the Russian authorities were looking over his shoulder, searching the same computers for files and emails. In effect, they were grafting an intelligence operation onto a far-reaching cybercriminal scheme, sparing themselves the hard work of hacking into the computers themselves, officials said.", "The Russians were particularly interested, it seems, in information from military and intelligence services regarding fighting in eastern Ukraine and the war in Syria, according to law enforcement officials and the cybersecurity firm Fox-IT.

But the piggybacking on Mr. Bogachev\u2019s activities offers some clues to the breadth and creativity of Russia\u2019s espionage efforts at a time when the United States and Europe are scrambling to counter increasingly sophisticated attacks capable of destroying critical infrastructure, disrupting bank operations, stealing government secrets and undermining democratic elections.", "This relationship is illustrated by the improbable mix of characters targeted with the sanctions announced by the Obama administration. Four were senior officers with Russia\u2019s powerful military intelligence agency, the G.R.U.

Russian intelligence agencies also appear to occasionally employ malware tools developed for criminal purposes, including the popular BlackEnergy, to attack the computers of enemy governments. The recent revelations by WikiLeaks about C.I.A. spying tools suggest that the agency also kept a large reference library of hacking kits, some of which appear to have been produced by Russia.", "It also hints at a struggle to recruit top talent. A job with the Russian intelligence agencies does not command the prestige it did in the Soviet era. The Russian state has to compete against the dream of six-figure salaries and stock options in Silicon Valley. A recruiting pitch from a few years ago for the Defense Ministry\u2019s cyberwarfare brigade offered college graduates the rank of lieutenant and a bed in a room with four other people.", "And so the Kremlin at times turns to the \u201cdark web\u201d or Russian-language forums devoted to cyberfraud and spam. Mr. Bogachev, according to court papers from his criminal case, used to sell malicious software on a site called Carding World, where thieves buy and sell stolen credit card numbers and hacking kits, according to the F.B.I. One recent posting offered to sell American credit card information with CVV security numbers for $5. A user named MrRaiX was selling a malware supposedly designed to pilfer passwords from programs like Google Chrome and Outlook Express.", "Rather than shut down such sites, as the F.B.I. typically tries to do, Russian intelligence agents appear to have infiltrated them, security experts say.", "Some of the forums state specifically that almost any type of criminality is allowed \u2014 bank fraud, counterfeiting documents, weapons sales. One of the few rules: no work in Russia or the former Soviet Union. In Carding World, and in many other forums, a violation results in a lifetime ban.", "The F.B.I. has long been stymied in its efforts to get Russian cybercriminals. For a time, the bureau had high hopes that its agents and Russian investigators with the F.S.B. would work together to target Russian thieves who had made a specialty of stealing Americans\u2019 credit card information and breaking into their bank accounts. \u201cHere\u2019s to great investigations,\u201d F.B.I. and F.S.B. agents would toast each other at Manhattan steakhouses during periodic trust-building visits, Mr. Berglas said.", "But help rarely seemed to materialize.

Working around the clock, his criminal gang infected an ever-growing network of computers. It was able to bypass the most advanced banking security measures to quickly empty accounts and transfer the money abroad through a web of intermediaries called money mules. F.B.I. officials said it was the most sophisticated online larceny scheme they had encountered \u2014 and for years, it was impenetrable.", "Mr. Bogachev became extremely wealthy. At one point, he owned two villas in France and kept a fleet of cars parked around Europe so he would never have to rent a vehicle while on vacation, according to a Ukrainian law enforcement official with knowledge of the Bogachev case, who requested anonymity to discuss the continuing investigation. Officials say he had three Russian passports with different aliases allowing him to travel undercover.", "At the height of his operations, Mr. Bogachev had between 500,000 and a million computers under his control, American officials said.

And Snap\u2019s shares will most likely rise on Thursday even after exceeding the previous range.", "Snap\u2019s bankers accomplished this by underestimating the range from the get-go to build this upward momentum in pricing.

The thinking was: How could people outside New York not love either? But Fairway filed for bankruptcy and Shake Shack\u2019s shares are now trading at below its first-day closing price. The touch of Theranos here is the need for secretiveness and control. Snap is siloed with the secretive Mr. Siegel at the center.", "I could, of course, be all wrong about this.

Before his administration has even come up with the $1 trillion infrastructure proposal he has repeatedly promised, his Department of Transportation is sabotaging an important commuter rail project in California opposed by the state\u2019s Republicans. This doesn\u2019t send a good signal about the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to infrastructure investment.", "The Transportation Department is withholding $647 million in federal grants for a $1.9 billion project that would modernize and increase the capacity of Caltrain. About 65,000 people use the rail line every day to commute between San Francisco and San Jose \u2014 a traffic-clogged corridor that is home to some the country\u2019s most valuable technology companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google. Caltrain plans to use the money to switch to modern electric trains, from old diesel locomotives that are prone to failure. The change will also allow the transit system to serve many more people in a growing region.", "Federal officials said they were delaying the grant because they need to see if the president\u2019s forthcoming budget includes enough money for transportation projects. That explanation is perplexing because Congress has already authorized the program that would fund Caltrain improvements. The department\u2019s decision runs counter to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises of increased infrastructure spending.", "The new secretary of transportation, Elaine Chao, could be acceding to California\u2019s 14 Republican members of Congress, who feel electrification would benefit a high-speed rail line, being built by the state, that they consider a boondoggle. While the two projects are separate, high-speed trains are expected to use Caltrain tracks in the Bay Area. California Republicans have tried everything to disrupt the high-speed rail project, but this move is particularly damaging.", "Caltrain has already secured $1.3 billion in other funds and permits and approvals for the electrification. The project was so far along that the transit system had to renegotiate with its contractors to delay the start of construction. The delay will also jeopardize the 9,600 jobs Caltrain says will be created directly or indirectly in places like Utah, Texas and West Virginia, where the new equipment is manufactured.", "By any measure, Caltrain is the equivalent of a dated personal computer running Windows 95 way overdue for an upgrade. Rush-hour trains are so crowded that their aisles are filled with passengers. Trains break down frequently and the locomotives belch plumes of black smoke into the air \u2014 a sight more in line with the early industrial age than 21st century Silicon Valley.", "During the campaign Mr. Trump and supporters like Peter Thiel, the Bay Area venture capitalist, argued that he was the only candidate who could rebuild America.

One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion.", "The company was valued at $5.5 billion early last year after investors, including General Motors, poured about $1 billion into it. It is unclear how far along Lyft is with the new fund-raising and whether the round will be completed.", "Lyft, which is based in San Francisco, declined to comment.

And Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, sued Uber last week, claiming it had used technology stolen by one of its employees.", "This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced.", "Lyft has long been the underdog to Uber. Lyft operates only in the United States while Uber is a global company. The two have previously engaged in pricing wars and have bad-mouthed each other. In August, Lyft held discussions with General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing about selling itself. The company could not agree with potential buyers on a price.", "Yet Lyft\u2019s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive.

Lyft\u2019s app subsequently soared to the top of the Apple app store\u2019s download list.", "Neither Lyft nor Uber has emerged as a financially sound business.

Apple said on Tuesday that many of the security issues described in the WikiLeaks documents had already been patched in the latest version of its software and that it was working to address remaining vulnerabilities.", "Not all Apple devices can get the latest operating system.

It was Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly described Schumer as his friend \u2014 which, the New York senator was at pains to clarify when we first spoke in mid-February, \u201cisn\u2019t quite true.\u201d There had been the occasional favor; at Schumer\u2019s request, Trump hosted a fund-raiser for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at Mar-a-Lago in 2008, and Schumer made a cameo on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2006. Beyond that, Schumer told me: \u201cI bump into him at meetings here and there. We never went out to dinner once. We never played golf together. I sort of knew him.\u201d", "On election night, Schumer was at Hillary Clinton\u2019s party at the Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan when, around 8 p.m., he saw some troubling exit polls coming out of Florida and North Carolina. They showed that college-educated women in both states \u2014 a demographic that everyone assumed would be a lock \u2014 were underperforming for Clinton. Schumer called one of her top campaign advisers, who tried to reassure him. \u201cHe says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, our firewalls in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Michigan are strong,\u2019\u2009\u201d Schumer recalls. \u201c\u2009\u2018There\u2019s no way Trump can win.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Schumer kept up appearances. He tweeted a photo of himself in front of a catering table with Kate McKinnon, who plays Clinton on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (\u201cI got to congratulate Hillary Clinton \u2014 oops, wrong Hillary!\u201d), and then took the stage, leading the crowd in a chant of \u201cI believe that she will win!\u201d But by shortly after 11 p.m., Trump had taken Ohio and North Carolina. The probability dashboards on the data-journalism websites had lurched Trumpward, and an unthinkable future was lumbering into view.", "Schumer, who was in line to succeed Harry Reid as the top-ranking Democrat in the Senate after Reid\u2019s retirement in December, had spent roughly $8 million of his own campaign funds on Democratic senatorial campaigns in other states in hopes of retaking control of the upper chamber, which the Democrats lost in 2014, and of making himself the majority leader. On his bookshelf he kept a copy of \u201cMaster of the Senate,\u201d the historian Robert Caro\u2019s exhaustive chronicle of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s years as the Democratic majority leader, which Caro had inscribed to Schumer: \u201cWhose career I have been following for years with real admiration, so that I have no doubt that he will be a great leader of senators.\u201d But by the early hours of Wednesday it was clear that the Democrats would not take the Senate and that Schumer would not be Lyndon Johnson.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll work together,\u201d Trump said on the phone call. He said he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 \u201cthat A.C.A. is terrible,\u201d he told Schumer \u2014 which was an obvious nonstarter for the incoming minority leader. He also said he wanted a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, a trillion dollars sounds good to me,\u2019\u2009\u201d Schumer told me. But to get Democrats on board, he warned, three conditions had to be met. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it with these tax breaks,\u201d he said. Second, he could not \u201ccut the programs we care about \u2014 Medicare, education, scientific research \u2014 to pay for this. It\u2019s got to be new spending.\u201d Finally, the bill had to preserve existing environmental and labor protections. \u201cI said, \u2018To do that, you\u2019re going to have to get half your party really mad at you.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Schumer, as he saw it, was calling Trump\u2019s bluff. \u201cDonald Trump ran as an anti-establishment populist \u2014 against both the Democratic and Republican establishments,\u201d he told me. Whether or not he had meant it, the Democrats could try to hold him to it. On the several occasions that Trump called Schumer in the weeks after the election, Schumer argued that he could try to govern as a hard-right conservative, but \u201cAmerica is not a hard-right country,\u201d and there would be electoral consequences.", "It might not have been the strongest card to play, but Schumer did not have a strong hand. The election in November left the Democrats stripped of power at every level of federal authority. Schumer would now possess the only means they had of exerting even limited influence over Trump\u2019s agenda: a Senate Democratic caucus that, while several seats shy of a majority, was large enough to make life complicated for Senate Republicans. But that could happen only if the Democrats formed a united front \u2014 and it was unclear whether they could, or even wanted to.", "The 2016 election was not just an electoral crisis for the party but also an existential one, more severe than any that the Democrats had experienced in decades. The party had glided through the campaign with a sense of destiny: In July, Schumer breezily remarked that \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d Then Hillary Clinton lost to a candidate who revived a strain of nativist, nationalist politics that had been dormant in the Republican Party for at least a generation, and who won in part on the ballots of Barack Obama voters in traditionally Democratic strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin. \u201cI sleep like a baby,\u201d Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, told me. \u201cAnd I can sleep anywhere \u2014 on the road, on the floor, in my kid\u2019s bed jammed up against the wall.\u201d But on election night, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but I stayed up all night. I was, mentally, totally unprepared. At some level, you do have this \u2014 \u201d he trailed off and was silent for a moment. \u201cYou do start to question whether you know the country as well as you thought.\u201d", "The Democratic primaries and caucuses, meanwhile, had left the party sharply divided. Clinton lost 22 states to Bernie Sanders, Vermont\u2019s independent and self-identified socialist senator, whose out-of-nowhere challenge had stirred a grass-roots excitement that Clinton\u2019s campaign conspicuously lacked and acrimoniously split the Democratic Party\u2019s centrist and left-leaning contingents \u2014 the latter of which viewed the Obama years as a missed opportunity to fight economic inequality, reorient trade policy and rein in Wall Street. Clinton might have won the popular vote, but in a way, this only amplified the confusion: about whether the party needed to transform or simply tinker; whether it needed to move to the right or to the left; whether the voters who were willing to vote for a candidate who said the things Trump said could be won back at all.", "These were problems for anyone trying to chart a course for the Democrats, but in a particularly acute way they were problems for Schumer, a politician who was better known as a dealmaker, a student of consensus, than as a pathfinder. As majority leader, the next two years might have been the pinnacle of his career: bill signings, valedictory news conferences (and few politicians visibly delight in news conferences the way Schumer does), the sorts of late-night negotiations that historians like Caro write books about. Instead, Schumer found himself with a job that The Times Union, in Albany, observed two days after the election was \u201csomething of a booby prize.\u201d The Democrats, who spent Obama\u2019s presidency railing against Republican obstructionism, would soon be facing a president who, in his stated ambitions to unmake much of Obama\u2019s legacy, was all but inviting them to try the same. Whether this was in Schumer\u2019s DNA was one question. Whether it was in the party\u2019s was another.", "The Democrats have never been a natural opposition party, or a particularly effective one. Republicans from Reagan to the Tea Party broadly believed in reducing government, as the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist famously put it, \u201cto the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d Cutting budgets and eliminating programs might require a Republican president and a congressional majority, but lacking this, a disciplined minority party could gum up the works, starving existing initiatives and blocking attempts to expand them.", "Democrats, by contrast, have generally been united by a belief in government that tries to do big things, in the manner of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or Johnson\u2019s Great Society or, later, Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 a belief that, practically speaking, requires either landslide majorities or a willingness to compromise. Several public-opinion polls in recent years have found that this difference is reflected in the party\u2019s electorates, which have increasingly come to view the political process in starkly different ways. In a 2014 Pew survey, 82 percent of people who identified as \u201cconsistently liberal\u201d said they liked politicians who were willing to make compromises; just 32 percent of \u201cconsistently conservative\u201d respondents agreed.", "The week of Trump\u2019s inauguration, David Brock \u2014 the onetime conservative journalist turned liberal gadfly \u2014 hosted a private gathering of Democratic luminaries at Turnberry Isle, a golf resort outside Miami. One speaker Brock invited was Ronald Klain, the former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, who previously worked for Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, in the aftermath of the 1994 midterms, when the Republicans took control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Addressing Brock\u2019s crowd, Klain called for Democrats to embrace what he dubbed the Hundred-Day Fight Club. As Klain learned from working with Daschle, \u201cYou have to take on a lot of fights to win any fights,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the minority, you can\u2019t be too choosy. I advocated a strategy of more comprehensive opposition.\u201d But plenty of the Democrats present \u2014 among them the Chicago mayor and former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who was sharing the stage with Klain \u2014 disagreed. \u201cAt the time, there was more of a divide,\u201d Klain told me. \u201cThe \u2018we gotta pick our spots\u2019 philosophy: \u2018He\u2019s a new president \u2014 we don\u2019t want to look like McConnell looked in 2009.\u2019\u2009\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Republican senator from Kentucky who was then the minority leader and is now majority leader, reportedly mapped out a program of near-total resistance shortly before Obama took office \u2014 a strategy that Democrats spent subsequent years attacking as cynical and irresponsible. \u201cWe\u2019re Democrats,\u201d Klain said. \u201cWe like to govern.\u201d", "Among the Democrats who appeared to share Klain\u2019s postelection view was Harry Reid, Schumer\u2019s predecessor as minority leader, who would be retiring in December. Reid and Schumer, then Reid\u2019s deputy, were an effective team for years in the Senate, partners in a long-running good-cop-bad-cop act. Schumer was known as a sharp-elbowed partisan during his 18 years in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate he had become an avatar of the gabby aisle-crossing bonhomie that had historically characterized the upper chamber. \u201cYou know, I get along,\u201d Schumer told me. \u201cI\u2019m in the gym in the morning, I\u2019m talking with Thune, and Lamar, and Cornyn all the time,\u201d he said, referring to the Republican Senators John Thune, Lamar Alexander and John Cornyn. \u201cI\u2019m friends with them. They attack me, I attack them. We understand that.\u201d", "This was the old way of the Senate \u2014 one that began to fade in the late 1970s as the ideological consolidation of the parties accelerated, reducing their need and taste for compromise. By the time Schumer arrived in 1999, four years after the Newt Gingrich-helmed Republican revolution, it was fast becoming an anachronism, with meals in the senators\u2019 bipartisan dining room giving way to one-party caucus lunches. By the time Reid became minority leader, amid the scorched-earth polarization of George W. Bush\u2019s second term, it was all but gone.", "Reid, like his Republican counterpart, McConnell, was one of the rare politicians who seemed to genuinely not care if people liked him or not. He was known for his blunt-instrument floor speeches, sandbags of verbiage delivered with minimal theatrics and less ambiguity of purpose. It was in this mode that he took to the Senate floor, a week after the election, and drew a line.", "Senate Democrats had tried for years to pass the kind of infrastructure bill Trump had suggested, Reid reminded his colleagues, only to run up against Republican opposition. \u201cIf Trump wants to pursue policies that will help working people, Democrats will take a pragmatic approach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also have other responsibilities.\u201d He made clear that the price of Democratic cooperation should be Trump\u2019s dropping of Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive chairman who ran his campaign and whom Trump named as his chief White House strategist two days earlier.", "\u201cIn his first official act, Trump appointed a man who is seen as a champion of white supremacy as the No. 1 strategist in his White House,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAs long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office,\u201d he added, \u201cit will be impossible to take Trump\u2019s efforts to heal the nation seriously.\u201d", "Reid and Schumer might have differed temperamentally, but they were both thinking about the 2018 midterm elections, in which 25 Democratic senators would be defending their seats. Lose eight seats, and the Republicans would have 60, enough to override a Democratic filibuster \u2014 at which point the Democrats\u2019 debates about what they stood for or against would be academic. Five of the those senators \u2014\u201cthe Big Five,\u201d Schumer called them \u2014 were moderate Democrats in states in the Midwest, the Mountain West and Appalachia that Trump had just won handily. The abiding question was what, exactly, the voters who cast ballots for both Trump and, say, North Dakota\u2019s Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp, were voting for in 2016; the party was still far from a clear answer.", "Schumer, who began holding weekly dinners with the Big Five after the election, believed it was best to allow these senators to cooperate with Trump as necessary. But according to members of Reid\u2019s staff at the time, Reid (who declined to comment) worried that, given Trump\u2019s lack of interest in policy detail and disregard for ethical conflicts, even well-intentioned legislative compromises could prove to be politically costly \u2014 that an eventual backlash against the president would also fall upon Democrats who gestured toward working with him. \u201cReid didn\u2019t want to validate the assumption that this incompetent blowhard could get a bill to the floor in the first place, which has proved to be a struggle for Trump so far,\u201d Adam Jentleson, at the time Reid\u2019s deputy chief of staff, told me.", "Democrats were also still deeply divided over whether it was even possible to navigate 2017 without resolving the ideological and policy differences that fractured the party in 2016. At a closed-door meeting of the Democracy Alliance \u2014 a network of high-rolling Democratic campaign donors \u2014 at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington the week after the election, Senator Elizabeth Warren delivered an emotional address, excoriating the party for losing its way. One attendee paraphrased her speech to me: \u201cPeople want someone to fight for them \u2014 that\u2019s why they voted for Donald Trump. He might not actually do it, but he said he would fight for them. On trade, in American politics, we\u2019ve gotten where we either look like we\u2019re all about free trade without any empathy for people who have lost their jobs, or we\u2019re rabid nationalist-protectionists. We need to build a policy in between. In 2016, we did not come out clear. When we are clear about what we believe, when we fight for people, we\u2019ll win.\u201d To beat pugilistic right-wing populism, maybe you needed pugilistic left-wing populism.", "Reid brought Warren onto the Democratic Senate leadership team in 2014, and she was one of the people he most trusted to keep the Senate caucus on its bearings through the difficult weather ahead. Shortly before Thanksgiving, he summoned Warren to the minority leader\u2019s office. When she arrived, the room was littered with art supplies; on an easel was a half-finished portrait of Reid that would be unveiled at his retirement party the following month. Its subject was preoccupied with the future of the party to which he had dedicated decades of his life. Reid told Warren she needed to think seriously about running for president in 2020. \u201cHe was worried in November,\u201d Warren told me recently. \u201cFor me, it was so important to make clear: We will fight back \u2014 we will fight back. We\u2019re not here to make this normal.\u201d", "Warren believed that the Democrats\u2019 first postelection battle should be over the 21st-Century Cures Act, a $6.3 billion medical-research funding bill then before the Senate, which she argued gave away too much to the pharmaceutical industry and would weaken drug regulations. At a Nov. 28 meeting of the party\u2019s Senate leadership team, she argued that the Democrats should negotiate harder than they had on the bill. But the idea was dead on arrival; Trump was not in office yet, and the Obama administration supported the legislation, which among other things would finance the Cancer Moonshot initiative that Joe Biden planned to make his life\u2019s work after leaving office. Warren crusaded against the bill on the Senate floor anyway, but only two Democrats joined her in voting against it.", "It was a minor fight, but an illuminating one. From one perspective, Warren\u2019s move looked quixotic at a time when the party had bigger problems. From another, it was an argument for survival: Whatever unity the Democrats could manage would be worthless without settling what, and who, the party stood for.", "On the evening of Dec. 14, as Democrats were still struggling to find their way, a Google Doc appeared online titled \u201cIndivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda.\u201d Its main authors were three young former Democratic congressional staff members whose ambitions were at once modest and sweeping. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting an organization, and we\u2019re not selling anything,\u201d they wrote. What they were offering was a blueprint. \u201cThe guide is intended to be equally useful for stiffening Democratic spines and weakening pro-Trump Republican resolve,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe believe that the next four years depend on citizens across the country standing indivisible against the Trump agenda. We believe that buying into false promises or accepting partial concessions will only further empower Trump to victimize our fellow citizens.\u201d", "The Twitter account that first circulated the blueprint belonged to Ezra Levin, then a 31-year-old associate director for federal policy at an antipoverty nonprofit and one of the document\u2019s authors. Shortly after graduating from college, Levin was hired by Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic congressman representing Levin\u2019s hometown, Austin, Tex., and he was working at Doggett\u2019s office on Aug. 1, 2009, when the congressman went to meet his constituents at a Randalls grocery store in South Austin. At the time, Democrats were trying to maneuver the Affordable Care Act through the House of Representatives, and organizers of the nascent Tea Party movement decided to mount a show of force at the town halls that representatives typically held in their districts during the August recess.", "As Doggett spoke outside the Randalls, a large crowd of demonstrators gathered, armed with DON\u2019T TREAD ON ME flags, signs assailing \u201csocialized health care\u201d and, in one case, a large poster of Doggett\u2019s face augmented with devil horns. \u201cThey chased him out into the parking lot,\u201d Levin told me recently. When Doggett tried to leave, the crowd surrounded his car.", "For the congressional staff members who experienced the uprising that August, the lessons of the Tea Party were mostly tactical, and unambiguous. Representatives live in fear of the wrath of their constituents, but also at a remove from it; the legislative process is complicated, blame is easily distributed and Washington is far away. There is an adage on Capitol Hill that five letters from the district about a bill is cause for alarm, and 10 is a full-blown emergency. By those standards, a couple hundred Tea Partyers besieging their elected officials in person was a borderline apocalypse.", "Republicans had in recent decades outperformed Democrats at this kind of dispersed, ground-level activism. This was in part because the party was more geographically distributed than the Democrats, who were increasingly concentrated in urban areas and interior suburbs. But Democrats had also historically relied heavily on unions and urban party machines to reach voters \u2014 a support apparatus that receded sharply by the late 20th century. The Republicans, who never had such luxuries, assiduously cultivated their own grass roots \u2014 an effort whose success has contributed to the deep erosion of the Democrats\u2019 presence in state legislatures (down 23 percent) and governor\u2019s mansions (down nearly 45 percent) since 2008.", "The most combustible Tea Party town halls were confrontations with Democrats, like Doggett, whose positions on the A.C.A. stood little chance of changing. But these representatives weren\u2019t really the intended audience; Republicans were. The shaky, hand-held videos posted to YouTube \u2014 the first real recognition, in American politics, of the platform\u2019s potential as a stage for agitprop theater \u2014 and looped endlessly on Fox News were a message to wavering Republicans that obstruction would be rewarded and compromise would be punished. \u201cThey were really smart on strategy,\u201d Levin told me: \u201cFocus on your local members, and be defensive in nature.\u201d Perhaps most important, \u201cThey understood that \u2018No\u2019 was a complete sentence.\u201d", "\u201cIndivisible\u201d was a bullet-pointed pr\u00e9cis of the tactics the document\u2019s authors had seen work against them \u2014 a guide to getting to \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusion that the resistance will defeat every piece of Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Levin told me. The Tea Party lost many battles, including its biggest: \u201cObamacare was passed. Dodd-Frank did pass. Lloyd Doggett did vote for health care. But it did slow down and water down legislation. We didn\u2019t get card check for unions. We didn\u2019t get cap and trade. We didn\u2019t get a lot of things.\u201d", "If the Indivisible Guide was a blueprint for a movement, it was an unusual one, bearing little resemblance to liberal or left-wing movements of the past. It called for no ideological remaking of the Democratic Party, no housecleaning of the establishment, no throwing-out of the bums \u2014 or at least not the Democratic ones. Its authors weren\u2019t political outsiders; they were members of Washington\u2019s mainstream Democratic professional class. The document presented not just a strategy for standing up to Trump but also an argument for sidestepping the party\u2019s most divisive internal conflicts. It offered a way of thinking about resisting the Trump administration that set aside the debate over what kind of party the Democrats should be. \u201cThis is not a panacea,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cnor is it intended to stand alone.\u201d It was not a policy agenda, and that was the point. \u201cThe Tea Party took root in 2009, focused on fighting against every proposal coming out of the new Democratic administration and Congress. This focus on defense rather than policy development allowed the movement to avoid fracturing. Tea Party members may not have agreed on the policy reforms, but they could agree that Obama, Democrats and moderate Republicans had to be stopped.\u201d", "Within two days of Levin\u2019s initial tweet, the guide was enthusiastically circulated by Democratic old hands (like Robert Reich, Bill Clinton\u2019s first labor secretary), liberal journalists (New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait) and celebrities (George Takei, Miranda July). When the authors set up a proper website, it was viewed more than five million times in its first month \u2014 a testament to how closely the guide mirrored where Democratic voters already were. Demonstrators flocked to impromptu protests in the days immediately after the election, prompting Trump to fume on Twitter less than two days after his victory: \u201cJust had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\u201d Five days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, congressional Democrats \u2014 aided by Bernie Sanders, who deployed the formidable email list he built during his presidential campaign \u2014 held rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act across the country, in some cases drawing thousands of demonstrators. What the crowds lacked for now, however, was any particular focal point besides the simple fact of Trump\u2019s presidency and what they anticipated it might try to do in its early days. They were a force in search of an object.", "The first significant chances for Democratic lawmakers to stand against Trump\u2019s presidency in some concrete form were the votes for his cabinet appointments. Five hours after he was sworn in, on Jan. 20, the Senate considered James Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, for defense secretary. Democrats broadly considered Mattis to be far from the worst pick for the Pentagon that Trump could have made. As Schumer told me, \u201cHe was against torture and got Trump to actually shift.\u201d The only member of either party to vote against him was Kirsten Gillibrand, New York\u2019s junior Democratic senator.", "Gillibrand\u2019s stated objection to Mattis was that his appointment would weaken civilian control over the military. She personally forced a roll-call vote on his appointment \u2014 an opportunity to literally stand up and be counted, as the lone opposition figure \u2014 which seemed to indicate that she understood the significance of the moment. Gillibrand was initially a moderate Democrat representing an upstate district in the House of Representatives, then almost immediately established herself as one of the most liberal members in the Senate after arriving there in 2009. She was also one of the first senators to grasp the importance, and potential, of the Women\u2019s March, which would descend on Washington the day after the Mattis vote. March organizers say they invited some senators to speak, but Gillibrand came to them asking to be involved.", "In the days after the Women\u2019s March, the rest of the party began to figure out what Gillibrand had already grasped: Maybe the party\u2019s base wanted the Democrats to act like McConnell. A protest against one aspect of Trump quickly became a protest against all aspects of him. A demonstration in Washington also drew crowds in Louisville, Ky.; Boise, Idaho; Charleston, S.C.; Des Moines. \u201cI lived very personally through the loss in 2000, the Supreme Court decision,\u201d Klain, who was general counsel for Al Gore during that year\u2019s presidential recount, told me. \u201cAnd the response this time has been nothing like that. There has been genuine grass-roots activism \u2014 not just in the big cities but also everywhere else.\u201d The Democratic base, at least, had gotten to \u201cNo.\u201d And it expected the Senate Democrats to get there too.", "The first demonstrations outside Schumer\u2019s Brooklyn apartment building were slightly apologetic affairs. The crowd of about 100 protesters who gathered on Jan. 8 around the 17-story prewar co-op across the street from Prospect Park carried unequivocal signs: MAKE US PROUD OR WE\u2019LL PRIMARY YOU; DON\u2019T CUT DEALS WITH THE DEVIL! But Mark Dunlea of 350Brooklyn, a group that put together the rally, was quick to explain to a reporter from the website DNAInfo that \u201cwe see Schumer primarily as an ally. We\u2019re just trying to encourage him to be more aggressive on these issues. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re protesting Schumer \u2014 we\u2019re urging him to be stronger.\u201d", "By the week after Inauguration Day, however, rallies were happening nationwide every Tuesday and had acquired an angrier edge. Trump was issuing a flurry of executive orders: reduced regulations on manufacturing, a pledge to disassemble the Affordable Care Act, advancements of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, the end of federal funding for \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 municipalities that limit their cooperation with federal authorities in detaining people suspected of immigration-law violations \u2014 and the go-ahead to build his long-promised United States-Mexico border wall. Then, on the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 27, the White House announced it was immediately blocking all travel to the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries.", "The next evening, thousands of demonstrators converged on international airports around the country as travelers who were caught up in the ban languished behind security cordons. Some Democratic lawmakers who were back in their districts for the weekend joined them. Warren was at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport, red megaphone in hand. Cory Booker was at the Alfalfa Club dinner \u2014 a cozy Washington institution that Trump skipped but several White House officials were, reportedly, attending \u2014 when his chief of staff called him from Dulles International Airport. \u201cI basically bolted,\u201d Booker told me. \u201cI mean, just compare: Who do I want to be standing with?\u201d By 11:45 p.m. he was in the terminal, his tuxedo jacket exchanged for a sweater, addressing the protesters: \u201cThis is going to be a long, arduous and tough fight. And let me tell you right now: We have to be determined to continue the fight.\u201d", "The following afternoon, when a crowd of 10,000 gathered to protest in Manhattan\u2019s Battery Park, the first person in line to address the demonstrators, after the rally organizers, was Chuck Schumer. Taking the microphone, Schumer led the crowd in an old standby of a chant \u2014 \u201cA people united will never be divided!\u201d \u2014 and, somewhat tentatively, raised his fist.", "A couple near where I was standing, next to the stage, started laughing. It was a strange thing to see: Schumer was at the barricades, but Schumer was not really a barricades kind of guy. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is life and death for so many people,\u201d he intoned, and waved his arm in the direction of the Statue of Liberty, glinting in the distance over his shoulder. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is that beautiful lady in the harbor \u2014 and what America is all about.\u201d", "Schumer\u2019s presence at the rally suggested just how quickly, and definitively, the politics of the moment had been settled. In the week since the Women\u2019s March, Trump\u2019s executive orders had confirmed liberals\u2019 worst fears of his intentions and the helplessness of congressional Democrats to stand in his way. And by the end of that week all four cabinet appointees under consideration \u2014 Mattis; Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly; Mike Pompeo, director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations \u2014 sailed through their confirmation votes with no serious opposition.", "Schumer, in particular, had become a target of outrage. He had not only declined to rally his caucus against the cabinet nominees, but he had also voted for all four of them himself. As he was speaking, I heard a burst of effusive applause and cries of \u201cSenator! Senator!\u201d coming from behind me. I turned and saw, gliding through the scrum in the direction of the stage, the bald dome of Cory Booker\u2019s head. He was beaming, obliging fans with high-fives and back slaps. By some measures, Booker\u2019s voting record in the Senate placed him a couple of clicks to the right of Schumer. But Booker voted no on Kelly and Pompeo, and Schumer did not. Booker was at the airport protests the night before, and Schumer was not.", "\u201cMy middle name is Ellis \u2014 Charles Ellis Schumer,\u201d Schumer was saying. \u201cI was named after Uncle Ellis, who was named after Ellis Island. I named my daughter\u2019s middle name Emma, after Emma Lazarus, and what she said 100 years ago that\u2019s emblazoned on that beautiful statue \u2014 \u201d", "\u201cVote no on Sessions!\u201d a handful of people around me were chanting now. Jeff Sessions, Schumer\u2019s Senate colleague, would be up for a confirmation vote as attorney general the following week.", "\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore \u2014 \u201d", "\u201cChuck loves Trump! Chuck loves Trump!\u201d the hecklers chanted. \u201cDon\u2019t vote for one of them!\u201d a woman next to me yelled.", "After Schumer yielded the stage to Gillibrand \u2014 \u201cShe voted no!\u201d another woman near me shouted approvingly \u2014 he started making his way through the crowd, right into what happened to be a particularly dense pocket of his detractors. \u201cPut \u2019em up, everybody!\u201d he said, grinning, offering his hands for high-fives. \u201cPut \u2019em up for our immigrants!\u201d", "\u201cVote no, Senator,\u201d someone yelled. \u201cVote no!\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m no on DeVos,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cNo on Tillerson. No on Mulvaney. No on Carson. No on Mnuchin. No on all of them!\u201d (He had, in fact, already announced he was voting against Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Mick Mulvaney \u2014 the prospective secretaries of education and state and head of the Office of Management and Budget, respectively.)", "\u201cWhy did you confirm Haley and Mattis?\u201d someone demanded.", "\u201cGrow a spine, Chuck!\u201d a gray-haired, trimly mustachioed man screamed, practically in Schumer\u2019s ear, his voice cracking: \u201cGrow a spiiiiiiiine!\u201d A scruffy young man, perched in the crook of a tree, began leading a chant: \u201cGrow a spine, Chuck! You must obstruct!\u201d", "Schumer is one of those politicians who seem to feed on the attention of a crowd, even a largely hostile one, and he pressed on gamely, smiling and shaking hands, pointing in the direction of the occasional familiar face: \u201cHey Dave, nice to see you!\u201d He was almost out to the street, the crowd around him thinning, when a middle-aged woman in a \u201cpussy hat\u201d called out, in a Brooklyn accent nearly as thick as Schumer\u2019s, \u201cWhat about the first four votes?\u201d", "Schumer stopped, a hint of a smile on his face, as if intrigued by the specificity of the harangue. \u201cWould you have voted against Mattis?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cEverything they do.\u201d", "\u201cHe\u2019s the only one who came out against torture.\u201d", "\u201cSo it\u2019s a defensive vote?\u201d", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep figuring out who\u2019s a relief?\u201d", "\u201cNo, no, no \u2014 all the other bad ones, we\u2019re going against.\u201d He swept off up the block with his aides, a man trying to figure out how to be reasonable in deeply unreasonable times.", "The next cabinet vote, as it happened, was for DeVos, a nominee whom Democrats considered as vulnerable as she was objectionable. In mid-December, Schumer wrote to McConnell demanding that certain conditions be met \u2014 only two cabinet votes a week, and all background checks by the Office of Government Ethics completed before the confirmation hearings \u2014 or else he would lead his caucus in opposing eight of the nominees, including DeVos. Two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had announced their opposition to DeVos. One more no vote would sink the nomination.", "The Democrats called for an all-night marathon debate of DeVos\u2019s nomination leading up to the vote on Feb. 7. It wasn\u2019t a filibuster \u2014 Reid had done away with those for cabinet nominees in 2013 \u2014 but a kind of sit-in: an effort to draw attention to the vote in hopes of further overloading the Senate office buildings\u2019 phone lines and nudging off the fence one of several Republican senators who had been identified, perhaps wishfully, as potentially persuadable. It was also an unsubtle challenge to Senate Democrats: the first moment since the airport protests for the party to stand up and stand together.", "As they held the floor Monday night and through the early hours of Tuesday, the senators stood in front of the C-Span cameras and read off messages from constituents, urging them to send more to their Republican colleagues before the noon vote. By Monday evening the hashtag #HoldTheFloor was trending on Twitter, accompanied by emoji of praying hands, by inspirational quotes, by photos of Nelson Mandela or of Hodor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d", "It was odd, amid the online clamor, to arrive at the Capitol shortly before 2 a.m. and find it pin-drop quiet, nearly empty. The Democratic senators filed in one at a time, spoke for an hour to the rotating crew of stenographers and left. Brian Schatz, a young senator from Hawaii, was waiting for his turn to speak and checking Twitter on his phone. He had voted for the first four nominees but then loudly declaimed against others. Shortly after the travel ban, he tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve never been a marching-on-the-street guy. But I do think it\u2019s time to march on the street.\u201d", "After an hour, the camera cut away, and a mildly disheveled-looking Tim Kaine ambled onto the floor to take his turn. \u201cTimmy!\u201d Schatz exclaimed. \u201cAre you going to speak for, like, an hour without notes?\u201d Kaine grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve got three pages,\u201d he said.", "The Senate chamber has the oxygenated, time-abstracting atmosphere of a casino on a slow night, the same woozy contextlessness. Sitting in the otherwise-deserted press gallery as the clock inched toward 4 a.m., I began to have the strange sensation of not knowing exactly what I was watching. The Democrats, it was clear by then, would lose this fight. But the point of the fight was to show that they would fight, to generate the affirming images and video clips that were cascading through blue-feed social media, demonstrations of the efficacy of a resistance whose long-term prospects rested largely on the impression that Democratic lawmakers were hearing, and responding to, its demands.", "\u201cFourteen Democrats voted for Mike Pompeo,\u201d Ezra Levin, the Indivisible Guide co-author, told me. \u201cThis was a man who slandered Muslims, was open to torture, and 14 Democrats voted for him! That\u2019s why you saw people outside Dianne Feinstein\u2019s office, outside of Schumer\u2019s office, Amy Klobuchar\u2019s office. The base wants them to stand on principle. In the two weeks between Pompeo and DeVos, there were massive protests. And zero Democrats voted for DeVos. Pompeo was an awful pick; DeVos was an awful pick. The thing that changed was not the degree of their awfulness, it was that people stood up.\u201d", "The next day, at a confirmation hearing for Jeff Sessions, Elizabeth Warren read from a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing his judicial appointment, prompting McConnell to censure her with an obscure procedural rule. McConnell\u2019s justification \u2014 \u201cShe was warned; she was given an explanation; nevertheless, she persisted\u201d \u2014 quickly evolved into a rallying cry, prompting nearly twice as many Google searches for Warren\u2019s name as her election to the Senate did in 2012. In the next 24 hours, members of the grass-roots organization MoveOn raised $300,000 for her 2018 re-election campaign, and Sessions was confirmed as the attorney general of the United States. Who could claim this as a victory? Trump? Warren? Both of them?", "By mid-February, spirits in Democratic Washington had palpably lifted. You wouldn\u2019t have described the mood as triumphal; it was more as if everyone had emerged from the basement after a tornado to discover that, while the car was upside down somewhere, at least the house was still standing. The travel ban remained marooned, at least temporarily, in the courts. (A redrafted executive order was issued on March 6, but it was unclear if it had fully resolved the legal issues of the first.) Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, the fast-food C.E.O. Andrew Puzder, backed out of consideration for the job in mid-February after the Republicans concluded that they did not have the votes to confirm him. The project of doing away with the Affordable Care Act was still tied up in committee amid disagreements among the Republicans themselves \u2014 an inevitable consequence, perhaps, of their eight-year all-or-nothing opposition effort that the Democrats were now studying. And the infrastructure bill that had threatened to divide Democrats against themselves never materialized; there was talk now of it being pushed back to 2018.", "On Feb. 28, a few hours before Trump was due to give his first speech to Congress, I went to see Schumer in the minority leader\u2019s chambers in the Capitol. The senator was sitting in a leather wingback chair in his shirt sleeves, and he seemed to be in a genuinely upbeat mood. \u201cThings look much better for us and much worse for him than I ever imagined based on the first month,\u201d he told me. The day before, three Republican senators \u2014 Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Rand Paul \u2014 had held out for nothing less than full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThat\u2019s the three votes they need, even with 52!\u201d Schumer crowed. (The following week, a replacement bill finally began to advance through committees in the House of Representatives, but Paul declared in a Fox News interview that it would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the Senate.) He pointed to the crowds that Indivisible and other groups had turned out in the thousands at town halls across the country the previous week. \u201cTrump is the enemy, and his Republican acolytes \u2014 not Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already beginning to coalesce around that. It was very positive. They throw a few brickbats, fine. This energy is enormous.\u201d", "But even as a sort of guarded optimism set in among many Democrats, there was a gloom among the party\u2019s left flank that appeared nearly as thick as it was in November \u2014 a sense that the party, buoyed by the easy gratification of opposition, was punting on resolving difficult questions, at its own peril. Just before visiting Schumer, I went to see Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office. In a couple of hours, the Vermont senator\u2019s colleagues would be gathering in Senate dining room to share a meal \u2014 a bipartisan tradition before presidential speeches to Congress. But Sanders did not intend to be among them. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to skip the dinner tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in a very convivial mood. I don\u2019t want to pretend. These are very, to my mind, frightening times.\u201d", "Since ending his presidential campaign in July, Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate, had been managing the complicated task of redirecting the movement that materialized around his candidacy toward a Democratic Party with which he had a tetchy relationship. Schumer had created a post for him in the party\u2019s Senate leadership, and Sanders had helped mobilize his grass-roots network for two rounds of rallies in defense of the Affordable Care Act. But earlier in the week, he said in a CNN interview that \u201ca total transformation of the Democratic Party\u201d was still in order, and that he had also not yet given the D.N.C. \u2014 which he called the \u201cestablishment\u2019s house\u201d \u2014 access to his campaign email list. \u201cIt\u2019s not some magical system,\u201d Sanders told me, disdain dripping off the word \u201cmagical.\u201d \u201cHow do we bring in, how do you raise money from, those people? You know what? You\u2019ve got to stand for something.\u201d", "I asked him if he thought the Democratic Party knew what it stood for. \u201cYou\u2019re asking a good question, and I can\u2019t give you a definitive answer,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly there are some people in the Democratic Party who want to maintain the status quo. They would rather go down with the Titanic so long as they have first-class seats.\u201d", "In early February, Elizabeth Warren, in a speech to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, warned that while the Democrats were fashioning themselves into an opposition party, that was not enough to solve the problems that put them in the position of becoming an opposition party in the first place. \u201cMen like Donald Trump come to power when their countries are already in deep trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some in the Democratic Party who urge caution.

In popular myth, the famous inkblots, part gothic horror, part toddler splat painting, are a shortcut to our subconscious, plunging through the artifice of our self-presentation and into our darkest mental recesses. In this cartoonish version of the Rorschach, what we see in the blots \u2014 whether a butterfly, or the bloodied stumps of our last victim\u2019s limbs after we hacked them off with a salad fork \u2014 is who we really are.", "It is perhaps no surprise that the Rorschach metaphor has become a clich\u00e9 of modern journalism. It\u2019s a fascinating idea that what we see in a given situation often reveals as much about our own selves \u2014 our quirks and prejudices and vanities \u2014 as it does about the thing we are looking at. This back and forth between self and world is at the heart of art and literature and criticism. Within this metaphorical universe, writing a book review is a perfect Rorschach test.", "Sadly, as it turns out, Rorschach the metaphor is a lot more compelling than Rorschach the reality. The actual test, still in sporadic use, takes a more persnickety, box-ticking approach to the human personality, less magical psychoanalytic Tarot cards and more Myers Briggs tests with splats. The scoring system is tediously technical, and surprisingly what you see in the blots counts less toward your result than the technicalities of how you perceive form and movement.", "It is the fortunes of this humdrum test that Damion Searls charts in his impressively thorough, if somewhat dry book. \u201cThe Inkblots\u201d is part biography of Hermann Rorschach, psychoanalytic supersleuth, and part chronicle of the test\u2019s afterlife in clinical practice and the popular cultural imagination.", "Rorschach, a young psychiatrist with the tousled rom-com looks of Brad Pitt, was working with deeply disturbed patients in a remote Swiss asylum during the golden years of psychoanalysis. Across the Alps, Freud was busy delving into the ids of rich Viennese housewives using an early version of talk therapy. But Rorschach speculated that in understanding the human psyche, what we see might be as important as what we say. A gifted amateur artist, he created the inkblots to see if his patients\u2019 differing styles of perception could help parse out the differences between various pathologies.", "Early results were promising. Schizophrenics responded differently to the blots than manic-depressives, and both responded differently than the people who were \u201cnormal\u201d controls. Before long, Rorschach was using the test to diagnose psychiatric illnesses and predict personality traits, claiming that he got it wrong less than 25 percent of the time.", "Rorschach died suddenly in his mid- 30s, but his inkblots had already captured the imagination of both experts and the general public. The rest of the book charts that history.", "While most of us stare at Rorschach tests and see life reflected back at us, Searls apparently looks at life and sees Rorschach tests staring back at him. His inventory of Rorschach sightings in popular culture over the last half-century is encyclopedic. But outside of journalistic clich\u00e9, many of the examples he gives feel relatively marginal, more a series of isolated occurrences than a genuine cultural pattern.", "More significant was the test\u2019s impact on clinical practice. At its peak, the Rorschach was used an estimated million times a year, in murder trials and child custody battles, psychiatric diagnoses and college admissions and job applications.", "It is only toward the end of \u201cThe Inkblots\u201d that Searls introduces research showing that when it comes to predicting human behavior, the Rorschach performs no better than chance.

But instead of alerting the companies so they could plug the security holes, the agency exploited the weaknesses to carry out cyberspying around the world.", "So Mr. Assange, speaking by video in an online news conference, offered a lifeline to the companies, saying the antisecrecy organization was prepared to share leaked computer code that it has not yet published with Apple, Google and other technology companies to help them fix the flaws described in the leaked C.I.A. documents.", "\u201cWe have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured,\u201d Mr. Assange said.", "The companies reacted cautiously to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there could be legal complications in accepting classified information stolen from the government.

In other words, Arizona Summit\u2019s results weren\u2019t even in the ballpark of respectability.", "Arizona Summit can\u2019t blame the aptitude of its students for its low bar passage rate. The median LSAT score at Arizona Summit is 143, which is on the low end, but about the same as the median score at Florida A&M University College of Law. Still, over half of Florida A&M law school graduates passed the Florida bar last summer. And Florida A&M charges about $14,000 in yearly in-state tuition, a fraction of the cost of Arizona Summit, which charges about $45,000 in tuition and fees per year. That doesn\u2019t include the cost for Bethune-Cookman students to move from Florida to Phoenix.", "So why is this an appropriate affiliation deal? Edison Jackson, the president of Bethune-Cookman, said of Arizona Summit, \u201cTogether, we aim to be a leading force in disrupting a legacy of exclusion that has persisted into the 21st century.\u201d Officials from both schools claim that their goal is to increase \u201cdiversity\u201d in legal education.", "But encouraging African-American students to attend Arizona Summit will not help them achieve their goals.

Too many aspiring black students are trying to piece together education plans based on career fairs and Google searches.", "And it shows. African-Americans make up the majority of graduate students at for-profit institutions. Because graduate students are likely to finance their education with loans on top of what they already owe for college \u2014 and graduate students can take out much more in loans than undergraduates \u2014 many black students become saddled with tremendous amounts of debt as they collect for-profit degrees that can\u2019t help them achieve their goals.", "I was the first person in my family to go to law school, but I went to Harvard for undergrad.

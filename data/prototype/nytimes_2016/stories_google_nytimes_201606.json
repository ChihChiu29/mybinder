That is especially true when browsing websites not hosted on a Chinese server.", "This week, an online report published in China Daily, a state-run, English-language newspaper, said that China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, ranked an abysmal 91st in the world in internet speed, with the average broadband connection scored at a mere 9.46 megabits per second, or Mbps. There are nearly 200 countries in the world.", "The report ranked the top five countries in internet speed as South Korea, Sweden, Norway, Japan and the Netherlands. The average broadband speed in South Korea was reported as 26.7 Mbps. In Sweden, it was 19.1 Mbps.", "The data was part of a broader report that was aimed at boasting of China\u2019s internet connectivity, under the title \u201cEvolution of the Internet in China.\u201d The report listed as its sources the China Internet Network Information Center, an agency under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; the website of People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper; the Broadband Development Alliance, a research group; and Akamai Technologies, a content delivery network and cloud services provider based in Cambridge, Mass.", "The report promoted the fact that China now has 688 million people online, about half the population; that it added 40 million new internet users in 2015; and that 90 percent of users can get online via their mobile phones.", "It also said 358 million people now make financial transactions using online payment tools.", "The statistics showing China\u2019s poor internet speed were relegated to the bottom of the page.", "Many foreign websites \u2014 including The New York Times, Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube \u2014 are blocked by the Great Firewall, the system of internet censorship in China. People who want to visit those sites must use software that provides a virtual private network, or VPN, which allows the user to go through a foreign server to get to the websites. That slows down internet use even more. VPNs are also less reliable than ever in China, constantly dropping out.", "In April, the man credited with developing the Great Firewall, Fang Binxing, had to use a VPN to try to enter South Korean websites during a presentation he was giving at his alma mater, the Harbin Institute of Technology. The VPN kept dropping out, forcing him to ad-lib some of his presentation.", "Many people in China do not watch videos hosted on non-Chinese servers because the videos download or stream too slowly.", "During politically sensitive periods, internet speed becomes molasseslike, especially in Beijing. This happens every spring around the time of the annual legislative conclave here.", "During mass protests and violence, China can shut down access to the wider internet in entire regions, forcing users to rely on a very limited intranet. This was enacted for one year in Xinjiang, in the west, after ethnic violence erupted there in 2009.", "There is also extremely limited internet access in some Chinese-ruled Tibetan areas where Tibetans have self-immolated to protest government policies.", "Last October, a report on internet freedom by Freedom House, a prominent American pro-democracy group, ranked China last among 65 nations, behind Iran, Cuba and Myanmar. (North Korea was not part of the report.) China has been steadily falling in the rankings in the annual report. In 2014, it ranked third to last, ahead of Iran and Syria.", "The report said that \u201cover the past year, the renewed emphasis on information control led to acts of unconcealed aggression against internet freedom.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/technology/personaltech/devices-that-deserve-to-go-along-on-vacation.html": ["CHILDREN are usually forced to pick just one or two of their beloved stuffed animals to take with them on summer vacation.

And you probably should leave your more expensive gadgets at home, unless you want to become a target for muggers.", "What to do? My personal packing starts with devices that are compact and lightweight. The price tag should not exceed $500, and if my smartphone can capably perform a task, I don\u2019t bother with something that does the same thing.", "Here is a guide to products that I have found useful on an airplane, in a rental car, in a hotel, in an Airbnb house rental and outdoors, or traveling overseas. I have tested all of the items in the last few years, and some of them were purchased through The Wirecutter, a product recommendations website and creative partner of The New York Times.", "This happens too often: After cramming into your airplane seat, you shut your eyes to relax and a baby starts screaming behind you. You need a media device to drown out the noise with music or a movie.", "My favorite media tablet for travel is the Apple iPad Mini, which starts at $399 (though I would buy the $499 model for the extra storage). Its compact size makes it easier to rest on an airplane tray. Because it is a multifunctional tablet, you can choose from a host of distractions, such as reading a book and playing a mobile game. (In other words, leave your Kindle at home.)", "For watching videos on a tablet, SeaGate\u2019s wireless portable hard drive, which costs $100, may also be worth stowing in your carry-on luggage. Ahead of your trip, you can load movies and other media onto the hard drive, and the drive creates its own Wi-Fi network to stream movies to your iPad.", "As for earphones, I will skip recommending a fancy pair of earbuds \u2014 just another small, valuable item to lose on a trip. The earbuds that came with your smartphone, like the Apple EarPods, should sufficiently drown out the noise.", "Most hotels include cable television, but after channel surfing for a few hours, you will realize that the only movies that ever seem to air are \u201cTotal Recall\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d", "Chances are you will be aching for the variety of programs you could get from streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and HBO. So I would pack Roku\u2019s new Streaming Stick, which is the size of a thumb drive, making it easy to stow in a travel pouch.", "One major bonus of the Roku stick is a feature called Hotel & Dorm Connect. It bypasses an obstacle in many hotels \u2014 the requirement that you log into their Wi-Fi networks through a web page \u2014 by letting you enter the credentials through your smartphone browser.", "Another common headache in a hotel is finding enough outlets to charge multiple gadgets. Anker\u2019s four-port USB wall charger can be plugged into a single outlet to charge four USB devices at the same time.", "The most annoying part of renting a car is all the upsells, particularly the extra fee for a GPS device and a mount \u2014 as if your smartphone did not provide maps already.", "The best solution is to pack your own smartphone car mount. TechMatte\u2019s MagGrip CD Slot, which costs only $11, is a fantastic travel companion on trips with lots of driving. The mount holds your phone with a magnet; you put a magnet sticker on your smartphone case, so mounting your phone is as simple as tapping the back of the phone on top of the magnet. What\u2019s more, because the MagGrip hooks up to an unused CD player slot, the phone doesn\u2019t block your view of the road.", "As for playing music from your phone, I recommend packing a standard audio jack that connects a smartphone with a stereo system, like the $5 audio cable from Amazon.", "When renting a house on Airbnb or a similar site like HomeAway, the situation may be different from a hotel if a large group and a kitchen are involved.", "This may sound odd, but I have found it extremely useful to pack a sous vide precision cooker on Airbnb trips. First, a primer: A sous vide cooker heats water to a precise temperature; you seal food like steaks and salmon into plastic bags and immerse them in the water to cook them evenly at that temperature.", "The $199 Anova Precision Cooker, recommended by our technology columnist Farhad Manjoo, is slim enough to store in a weekender bag. Anova\u2019s cooker also includes a bracket so that the device can be easily mounted to your Airbnb host\u2019s cooking pot \u2014 meaning all you probably need to pack are the cooker and some zip-close bags.", "The benefit of bringing along a sous vide cooker is the amount of time it frees up for you to enjoy other activities instead of paying attention to your food. Imagine going hiking for three hours and returning to a perfectly cooked medium-rare beef roast. It beats going to a restaurant.", "When you\u2019re outside, you don\u2019t need much technology other than a camera. Assuming you bought a smartphone in the last few years, don\u2019t bother packing an extra camera like a GoPro \u2014 that\u2019s just extra space and another power cable to carry around.", "Instead, if you\u2019re going to be in the water kayaking or splashing around at the beach, consider a waterproof smartphone case like LifeProof\u2019s Fre, which fits snugly around an iPhone to protect it from water without making it look ugly.", "If you are the type who enjoys drowning out the sounds of nature with music, the $100 Roll from Ultimate Ears, which I recommended last holiday season, continues to be my favorite wireless portable speaker. It has a slim disk shape, making it easy to pack in a travel pouch, and includes a bungee cord for strapping it onto a lawn chair or bench. Plus, it\u2019s waterproof.", "Earlier this year, I wrote a guide on taking your smartphone abroad while traveling, which involved unlocking it and buying foreign SIM cards. Some readers encouraged me to also mention Google\u2019s Project Fi, which is offered in more than 120 countries and charges the same rate no matter where you are: $20 a month for unlimited minutes and text messages and $10 per gigabyte of data.", "In my testing of Google Fi for a few weeks, I found that the service offered robust coverage comparable to that of traditional wireless carriers. However, there are caveats: Google Fi is available only on a small number of Android phones, and in foreign countries, the data speeds are capped. I recommend a Google Fi phone, with prices starting at $199 on Google\u2019s webpage, for people who frequently travel abroad. But for those who seldom go overseas, it is more practical to use a foreign SIM card with your own phone.", "Also when traveling abroad, your smartphone battery is going to be struggling because of all the pictures you take. For iPhones, I recommend Apple\u2019s $99 Smart Battery Case \u2014 it offers enough power to keep your phone running all day. You can also charge it with the Lightning cable included with iPhones, so you will have one fewer power cable to pack.

As a female writer, I sometimes worry too much about how our female characters are represented; I remember rewriting a scene in which Gavin Belson has one of his lackeys present a bulldog to the Hooli board on an office chair and then orders that same lackey to wheel the dog away. Everyone was picturing Patrice, played by the very funny actress Jill Alexander, as the lackey, and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, will that make it seem like Patrice is an assistant, and not an executive like Scott and Rogelio?\u201d Another writer pointed out that Jill would have the funniest reaction, and I realized that by trying to \u201cempower\u201d a female character on the show, I almost cost a female actor a funny bit in the show that she ended up totally nailing.", "Your sister, Ellie, stars on \u201cThe Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d What would a \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d/\u201cSilicon Valley\u201d crossover look like?", "Wow, excellent question.

Though many competitors have shown off some interesting demos, at the moment no rival voice assistant approaches the accuracy and ease of use of an actual human assistant. Siri is hardly behind, and there is still room for it to become the leader. Yet the way Apple approaches Siri is a proxy for the way it plans to approach online services generally.", "Before we get to the limitations, here are the details on what\u2019s new with Siri: First, the voice assistant can now control some third-party apps on your phone. You can send text messages through apps like WhatsApp or Slack using your voice \u2014 in the past, you could do so only with Apple\u2019s own messaging app. Depending on which developers add Siri to their apps, you might also be able to use your voice to call a ride from Uber or Lyft, to pay someone through Venmo or to tell a fitness app to start tracking your workout.", "Siri\u2019s other new trick is Mac compatibility. You can now ask your desktop or laptop to search through your files or email, for instance.", "These are all fine improvements. But I am struck by the deliberate way Apple is rolling them out.

Apple reps told me the third-party integrations they had outlined so far were the start of a new effort \u2014 one that could be expanded to new app types in the future. Still, the lack of music support was a letdown. It\u2019s hard to shake the suspicion that Apple is using Siri to give its own apps a leg up.", "Another problem is that Siri is still hopelessly tied to each Apple device. Siri on your iPhone doesn\u2019t really know anything about Siri on your Mac or Apple TV. On each device, Siri has different capabilities: On your iPhone it can call an Uber, if you have the Uber app installed, but Siri on your Mac can\u2019t. Siri on your Apple TV can search YouTube for clips of Stephen Curry, but Siri on your iPhone can\u2019t.", "For now, this isn\u2019t a big problem \u2014 you will learn what Siri can do on each device and adjust your queries accordingly. But that\u2019s a curious thing to have to do. If Siri is an intelligent assistant, why does she need to be tied to apps you have installed on your device? Why can\u2019t she call Uber from the cloud, regardless of which device you happen to be using?", "The device-centric view gets particularly limiting when you think about asking your assistant complicated questions. For instance, what if you ask, \u201cCan you see if there\u2019s a room at my favorite Seattle hotel for my wedding anniversary weekend \u2014 and can you book it if it\u2019s less than $200 a night?\u201d", "Google, in its demo for Home, a forthcoming voice assistant device meant to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo, seemed to be able to handle such questions. Two start-ups \u2014 Viv, which was founded by members of the team that created the original Siri app that Apple bought in 2010, and SoundHound have also unveiled systems that can tackle such complex queries.", "To handle these questions, an assistant would need to pull information from multiple online services. For instance, booking that Seattle hotel would involve knowing your favorite place to stay, your wedding anniversary date and current hotel prices. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if that question worked only on certain devices or only if you had certain apps installed; ideally, it should work on any device.", "And that would be very useful. One of the frustrations of the era ushered in by the iPhone is app overload \u2014 there are too many apps to download, install and switch between to get anything done. A lot of these apps are of little use: You might tap that hotel-booking app once a year, so why does it have to sit there on your phone?", "Voice interfaces could usher in a new paradigm in computing, one that would break free of the tyranny of apps on devices. They could get a lot done for us without much tapping and switching. Google, Amazon and several start-ups seem to be rushing headlong to build such a system.", "But based on its developer conference, I\u2019m not sure Apple is.

The share price had hovered at $225 at the beginning of 2016; a month later it briefly got close to $100.", "The rapid devaluation has posed more than just a problem for investors. LinkedIn\u2019s employees are paid largely in stock, and therein lies the rub: Around the company\u2019s new 26-story skyscraper that opened in downtown San Francisco in March, as well as the corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., there have been persistent whispers about whether LinkedIn could retain its top talent as the marketplace clobbered their incomes.", "Among Silicon Valley companies, \u201cLinkedIn is among the most aggressive in using share-based compensation \u2014 there is no question about that,\u201d Mark Mahaney, a veteran technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIf the stock had stayed down, it would have seen employee churn.\u201d", "Mr. Weiner \u2014 who took over as LinkedIn\u2019s chief in 2009, succeeding Reid Hoffman, the founder \u2014 has done a tremendous job in the past years building the company\u2019s business, which is primarily about helping people connect to one another for employment and conduct business-oriented social networking. But despite all the headlines about growth and profits, LinkedIn has been a money-losing operation for the last two years.", "You wouldn\u2019t know that if you only glanced at LinkedIn\u2019s news releases. That\u2019s because LinkedIn steers investors to focus on what\u2019s known as its adjusted Ebitda, or non-GAAP earnings. The company purposely strips out the cost of stock-based compensation, which has the effect of turning losses into gains. LinkedIn paid out $510 million in stock-based compensation last year; over the last two years, that stock-based compensation represented a whopping 96 percent of operating income, or 16 percent of revenue, according to Mr. Mahaney. Companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook paid out about 15 percent of operating income, or well under 10 percent of revenue.", "LinkedIn justifies the practice by saying that stock-based compensation \u201cis noncash in nature\u201d and that excluding it from its earnings calculation provides \u201cmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and liquidity.\u201d", "But investors like Warren E. Buffett have been highly critical of the practice. \u201cIt has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual report published this year.

The company certainly deserves credit for building a global network with 430 million users and becoming a household name. But absent this accounting method, uglier headlines would have dragged down the stock price even further, along with the morale of all those employees whose incomes were dependent on it.", "Mr. Mahaney, the RBC analyst, said the use of so much stock-based compensation was a negative signal. \u201cThere are a variety of ways to look at this issue, but our general bias is that the lower the dependence on stock-based compensation, the higher the quality of the P&L,\u201d he wrote in a report in April, using shorthand for the income statement.", "LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and Alibaba, which \u201chave the most dependence on stock-based compensation,\u201d also have results \u201cof relatively lower quality,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said.", "Other stock analysts took note that Microsoft, which includes stock-based compensation in its non-GAAP earnings calculation, made a point on Monday of saying that the combined company would follow Microsoft\u2019s practice.

You merely feel awful because your brain has made a needless withdrawal from your body budget. And the next time you\u2019re in a similar situation, your brain goes through the same process. Again you feel lousy and trapped by your circumstances. Over time, a poorly calibrated body budget can pave the road to illness.", "With higher emotional granularity, however, your brain may construct a more specific emotion, such as righteous indignation, which entails the possibility of specific actions. You might telephone a friend and rant about the water crisis. You might Google \u201clead poisoning\u201d to learn how to better protect your children. You might call your member of Congress and demand change. You are no longer an overwhelmed spectator but an active participant. You have choices. This flexibility ultimately reduces wear and tear on your body (e.g., unnecessary surges of cortisol).", "The good news is that emotional granularity is a skill, and many people can increase theirs by learning new emotion concepts.

Somehow I had gotten an invitation, but I was on the fence about whether to go. I had recently started in a new role, and was feeling pressed for time. In the end, I went, mostly because an engineering lead I was trying to hire was likely to be there and I was hoping to stalk him in his natural habitat.", "When I got there, I recognized a face, then another, and another, and I realized I was walking into a room full of many of the most talented people in digital media in New York, with all sorts of opportunities for stalking talent!

When the demos started, and the ideas began to flow, I was sure there was something special going on.", "Over the next several years I got to know Corey and his program better.

As a newcomer, I\u2019ve been amazed to see how deeply the entrepreneurial spirit runs throughout this company. Collaboration with organizations like Matter is a key component of how we keep our creative fires stoked. You can\u2019t have too much energy, too many good ideas, too many smart people around.", "Similarly, discipline, user focus, design thinking, cross-functional collaboration, risk-taking, passion and determination \u2014 all the characteristics that drive innovation and are so evident in the Matter participants \u2014 are never mastered. Constant reminders, honing, and reinforcement are necessary to keep our practice and our instincts sharp. Working side by side with inspired developers, designers and entrepreneurs is the best way to do that.", "For all these reasons, I\u2019m delighted to have The New York Times collaborating with Matter, and I can\u2019t wait till the Matter NYC demo day in October.

The resulting tapestry is \u00adsimultaneously a tense conspiracy caper, a haunting meditation on loneliness and a brutally cynical examination of modern media.", "With so many layers to juggle, it would be easy for North to fumble her way into a multifaceted mess.

This is probably the most scientifically plausible story in the set. It\u2019s also one of the most didactic, explaining the altered world in a leisurely way that is perhaps meant to evoke the romantic haze Strahan mentions, though instead it just feels heavy-handed. A number of stories in the first half of the collection, like Ken Liu\u2019s \u201cDispatches From the Cradle: The Hermit \u2014 Forty-Eight Hours in the Sea of Massachusetts,\u201d fall into this territory: lovely yet disengaged travelogues of an environment in flux.", "This starts to change with Christopher Rowe\u2019s \u201cBrownsville Station,\u201d the slightly surreal tale of a train that travels along the \u201clinear city\u201d edging the coast between Canc\u00fan and Key West.

Instead of nuanced examinations of the politics of fear, stories like \u201cThe Day the Dead Came to Show and Tell\u201d and \u201cSan Diego 2014: The Last Stand of the California Browncoats\u201d are what Newsflesh wasn\u2019t: just zombie stories. They\u2019re exciting, horrifying. They\u2019re written with the same gripping attention to character and pace, and are just as darkly tongue-in-cheek as the novels (as a story about zombies versus San Diego Comic-Con cosplayers must be). Still, they lack the media analysis and complexity that made the trilogy so refreshing. New readers may come away thinking of this series as merely fun.

Yet there\u2019s also an inescapable \u201cWest Wing\u201d vibe to the book.

Self-funding would require Mr. Trump to put up hundreds of millions of dollars, something he resisted for much of the primary race.", "\u201cIf the Republican Party, and I hope they all come together, because I want them to all come together, but if for any reason, they get a little bit like they don\u2019t want to help out as much, then I\u2019ll fund my own campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to do that.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/arts/design/review-photographys-shifting-identity-in-an-insta-world.html": ["The International Center of Photography is back, and welcome. Two years after losing its Midtown Manhattan quarters, the center has reopened on the Bowery, across from the New Museum. The duplex galleries, on street and basement levels, are, technically, larger than the old ones, though they feel boxy and closed-in, at least for the opening show, \u201cPublic, Private, Secret.\u201d As if to offset this impression, the show gives evidence that the center\u2019s view of photography itself has expanded.", "In its 2014 Triennial, the center made a serious move toward embracing digital media, and now it has fully done so. Photography no longer means pictures printed and framed. It also means images, infinite in number, flowing in real-time data streams and captured on webcams, video blogs, Twitter and Instagram. This institutional shift in emphasis from hard objects to the broad field of visual culture will make old-style connoisseurs crazy, but it is in line with the center\u2019s history.", "It was founded in 1974 largely as a showcase for street photography, war photography and other socially committed and essentially journalistic genres: Content was as important as form. The inclusion of digital media maintains that interest, with the internet now functioning as both boulevard and battlefield, and \u2014 this really is new \u2014 where photographers were once a distinctive and specialized crew, now almost everyone is armed, for better and worse, with picture-taking devices and the means to distribute images.", "The defining of better and worse forms the basis for a stimulating and unsettling exhibition. Its digital orientation is established right at the start with a projected video based on borrowings from social media. The piece, by Natalie Bookchin, is divided into thematic sections, each a visual patchwork of talking heads, mostly of young, English-speaking men and women gathered from online video diaries. In one sequence, all the heads speak of their experience with psychiatric medications, in another with losing jobs.", "Ms. Bookchin\u2019s editing is inventive and revealing. Every time a word or phrase common to all the diaries occurs, all the heads say it in unison, interrupting film\u2019s otherwise random-seeming this-speaker-then-that-speaker flow. The overall effect is twofold: You get a sense of the existence of a digitally connected community of suffering, one with a shared vocabulary and set of emotions. You also begin to wonder, as you do when you overhear public cellphone conversations: How is it possible that so many people are living such clich\u00e9d lives?", "The raw material for a 2012 video by Doug Rickard is also digital, but of a different kind: found images of American crime scenes and police actions uploaded from cellphones and posted on YouTube. Mr. Rickard collages excerpts from various postings into fictional narratives, notable less for their plotlines than for the atmosphere of danger they project. That atmosphere is similar to one generated by news media and the film industry, an adrenalin-fueled mood of fear, suspicion and emergency, encouraging violence.", "In one way or another, much of the show \u2014 assembled by Charlotte Cotton, the center\u2019s first curator in residence, working with Pauline Vermare, associate curator, and Marina Chao, assistant curator \u2014 is built around the basic elements of Mr. Rickard\u2019s work: surveillance crossing into voyeurism, visual fiction standing in for truth. But then, hasn\u2019t photography always had a predatory streak, an eye for existential dirt, an impulse to lie if that will grab attention? Sure, and there are plenty of predigital demonstrations of that here.", "Among them are old French and Mexican mug shots of criminal suspects, and a 1942 shot by the Bowery habitu\u00e9 Arthur Fellig, known as Weegee, of two drunk-and-disorderly swells cowering behind face-hiding hats in a paddy wagon. Far more complicated are four mug-shot-style portraits of Berber or Muslim women taken in 1960 by Marc Garanger in Algeria, when he was working for the French Army. The women, confined to a concentration camp, were forced to unveil for the sittings and stare at the camera with undisguised, level-eyed fury.", "These are images of violation. There are others, several associated with celebrity culture. In a 1971 photograph we see Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis dashing across a lawn in Central Park, apparently fleeing the photographer, Ron Galella, who had been stalking her for years. Two internet-savvy contemporary artists, Ann Hirsch and Marisa Olson, turn the humiliation of losing highly visible competitions \u2014 a reality dating show, an \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d audition \u2014 into triumphs of self-engineered failure. And in a flawless win-win power move, the media star Kim Kardashian assumes the role of auto-stalker, publishing a book consisting entirely of her own selfies.", "I can\u2019t speak for Ms. Kardashian, but many of the show\u2019s younger participants are clearly well aware that they, and we, are being observed, photographed, biometrically tracked and profiled whether we want to be or not, and that this is a problem. And at least one artist, Zach Blas, is doing something about it. He has designed a blobby pink plastic mask to thwart facial recognition scanning, a technology with the potential, possibly already realized, of using racial and sexual stereotyping to isolate groups of social undesirables.", "Racial stereotyping has, of course, a long history and artists have tried all kinds of ways to deal with it. A decade or so ago, the intriguing Chicago-based photographer and filmmaker Barbara DeGenevieve (1947-2014) hired five homeless men, all African-American, to pose nude for her in a hotel room. When she exhibited the results as \u201cThe Panhandler Project,\u201d she took serious critical heat, with many viewers calling the work exploitive. Some will still find it so, though as the mechanics of American economic privilege grow starker, her attempt to confuse roles usually dictated by ethnicity, class and gender looks more and more useful.", "Ms. Cotton includes only a single photograph from Ms. DeGenevieve\u2019s project, and it\u2019s hard to get much from that. But another meditation on race, and specifically on blackness, Martine Syms\u2019s video installation \u201cLessons I-LXVIII,\u201d is the show\u2019s most substantial piece in terms of length. It\u2019s composed in 10-minute units, each made up of randomly sorted 30-second clips related to African-American life, lifted from online videos and visual blogs, including home movies, video diaries, police webcams and advertisements. Many of the fragments are hard to grasp on their own, but together they turn the black presence, still marginalized in mainstream American art and culture, into something substantial, integral and self-sustaining, a whole and sufficient cloth.", "Ms. Syms\u2019s ambitious work, dated 2014-16, brings us again into the digital realm, which can be uneven ground to visit. A set of flat screens streaming real-time data from Twitter and other social media sources keeps the show in the 24/7 now, where it should be. And the information, organized by Mark Ghuneim, an internet entrepreneur, and students from the center\u2019s New Media Narratives program and sometimes presented in the form of online addresses, gives a good sense of the pervasive influence of digital technology on daily life, whether in police surveillance or assignment of pop star status. At the same time, the piece offers few visual rewards, and demands smartphone finger work to access its information.", "And if Ms. Bookchin\u2019s conglomerate snapshot of a video diary culture hints at a condition of passive narcissism as the dominant malady of life inside the digital bubble, Jon Rafman\u2019s short, composite 2014 video \u201cMainsqueeze\u201d is infinitely more damning. Its seven-minute sequence of found Google Street View images drops you into a deep pit of physical and psychological cruelty, and cracks the door on a dark side of the social media age that this exhibition otherwise barely hints at. No wonder 21st-century karma is in such horrendous shape.", "The visual content of this piece is a far cry from the museum quality images usually associated with the center as a collecting institution. And the exhibition itself, with its mirrored walls and jumble of unalike works, has a looseness that most museums, intent on writing clear narratives, would clean up. At this point, though, visual culture \u2014 digital production, including photography \u2014 is so abundant and changing so fast that no clear narrative is possible. Photography fans hoping that the return of the center will mean a return of its vintage collection may have to wait awhile. This institution, so often ahead of the curve, has other, challenging ideas on its mind, and the less it acts like a museum the better."], "https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/morning-agenda-thomas-j-perkins-pioneering-venture-capitalist-dies-at-84/": ["THOMAS J.

Dauman, the chief executive. Mr. Dauman\u2019s opposition is based on claims that Mr. Redstone is not competent, which somehow translate to the actions of National Amusements\u2019 board being illegitimate.", "If Viacom accepts the changes, it will be admitting that National Amusements can act appropriately with regard to Viacom and thus, that Mr. Redstone and National Amusements can remove the board.", "Viacom could try to kick the can down the road, by filing the changes, saying vaguely that they were illegal. Or it could challenge the changes in court. A bylaw requiring 100 percent board approval is unusual, but there is precedent for the validity of this type of bylaw under Delaware law, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. Viacom would most likely argue that the controlling shareholder is overreaching.", "There is also the option of claiming that National Amusements\u2019 amendments are void because of claims of Mr. Redstone\u2019s incompetency. But this would be hard to establish as National Amusements has its own board and is a functioning company.

National Amusements could also invoke the seldom-used summary procedures in the Delaware code for contested elections of directors and procedures to confirm the validity of its appointments.

P. Morgan\u2019s New Haven Railroad tried to buy the Boston and Maine lines. Brandeis hated the thought of what he called \u201ca monster corporation controlling all transportation facilities of New England,\u201d and lobbied fiercely against the merger. Morgan prevailed, \u201cbut it took all the power of the Republican machine and of the bankers\u2019 money to do it,\u201d Brandeis wrote, \u201cand I am well content with the fight made.\u201d", "Brandeis would win many other battles on behalf of his people: consumers, workers, small-business men and other common folk. He rode his success as \u201cthe people\u2019s lawyer\u201d into President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inner circle as an influential economic adviser, and then onto the Supreme Court, where he was the first Jewish justice and a progressive champion.", "The brilliant, crusading Brandeis is the subject of Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s excellent \u201cLouis D. Brandeis: American Prophet.\u201d The book, part of the Yale Jewish Lives series, is not a full biography \u2014 that ground is already well trod \u2014 but rather a concise and sympathetic exploration of Brandeis\u2019s main intellectual causes. It is well titled: Brandeis resembled an Old Testament prophet \u2014 Franklin D. Roosevelt called him \u201cold Isaiah\u201d \u2014 with his highly articulated moral vision and true believer\u2019s zeal. It is also well timed: Mr. Rosen persuasively makes his case that recognizing Brandeis as an \u201cAmerican prophet\u201d \u201cseems more important today than ever.\u201d", "Brandeis was born in Louisville, Ky., in 1856, to immigrant Jewish parents. Like many Southerners \u2014 including Thomas Jefferson, whom he revered \u2014 Brandeis developed a strong sympathy for farmers and state governments, and a mistrust of big government and big business.", "It was not long after Brandeis graduated from Harvard Law School, at the top of his class, and began practicing law in Boston that he developed the first of his intellectual passions. He and his law partner wrote a groundbreaking Harvard Law Review article, \u201cThe Right to Privacy,\u201d which warned that cutting-edge technologies like \u201cinstantaneous photographs\u201d were infringing on what he proposed as a new legal right: \u201cthe right to be let alone.\u201d", "At first, Brandeis represented corporations, but he soon found another of his causes: the plight of workers. He won a major victory in 1908, in Muller v. Oregon, when he persuaded a pro-business Supreme Court to uphold a maximum-hours law for women. Brandeis, who had a reverence for facts and a deep interest in the real-world impact of law, transformed legal advocacy by filing what would later be known as a \u201cBrandeis brief\u201d: one with more facts and sociology than legal precedents.", "Brandeis\u2019s concerns about big corporations went beyond their labor practices: He saw them as antithetical to America\u2019s democratic ideals. In his view, it was the size of these corporations that was the problem \u2014 and this became another cause, a career-long battle against what he called the \u201ccurse of bigness.\u201d Brandeis\u2019s prescription was aggressive trustbusting, and his public advocacy and work for President Wilson helped clear the way for the landmark Clayton Antitrust Act.", "There was one more cause Brandeis was passionate about: Zionism. When he represented striking New York garment workers, he got to know immigrant Jews who had fled the pogroms of Eastern Europe. Hearing their stories firsthand, Brandeis came to believe that the Jews needed a homeland where they could control their own destiny \u2014 and he soon became the leader of the American Zionist movement.", "Mr. Rosen is particularly original on this subject, showing how Brandeis rooted his Zionist thinking in American values of democracy and pluralism \u2014 and emphasizing Brandeis\u2019s insistence that any Jewish state had to proceed in a spirit of equality, with full political rights and economic inclusion for its Arab citizens.", "Wilson appointed Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916, and he was confirmed over the opposition of corporate interests and anti-Semites. On the court, he had many opportunities to give voice to his deeply held beliefs, sometimes in dissent.", "In Whitney v. California, a case about free-speech rights for radicals, Brandeis wrote a concurrence that is often called the most eloquent opinion ever written on the value of freedom of expression. His dissent in Olmstead v. United States, an early wiretapping case, was perhaps his most visionary, warning that \u201cdiscovery and invention have made it possible for the government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\u201d", "Because of his deep distrust of big government, Brandeis was not always a reliable progressive vote on the court, and not all of his decisions have stood the test of time. He joined the majority in striking down a federal law aimed at ending child labor, and later voted to declare three New Deal laws unconstitutional in a single day, delivering a major blow to Roosevelt\u2019s plans for combating the Great Depression. In his deference to state legislatures, Brandeis voted to uphold some highly illiberal state laws, including \u2014 though his reasons for doing so are unclear \u2014 Virginia\u2019s 1924 law authorizing eugenic sterilizations.", "But despite Brandeis\u2019s occasional misfires, his philosophies, as Mr. Rosen convincingly argues, speak powerfully to our times \u2014 in his views on the threat that technology poses to privacy, on the importance of pluralism and equality in the Middle East and, perhaps most of all, on economic matters.", "Today\u2019s polemics about what unfettered capitalism is doing to ordinary Americans \u2014 from Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald J. Trump on the right \u2014 is terrain Brandeis covered, more deeply, with more cogent suggestions for reform. And his warnings about the \u201ccurse of bigness\u201d speak powerfully to an age in which the internet appears structurally inclined to create category-killing behemoths: Google for search, Amazon for retailing and Facebook, it seems, for just about everything else.", "Most of all, what the Gospel of Brandeis offers is a conviction that fact-based analysis and enlightened policy-making can help to set the world right. Brandeis never abandoned his pure faith that, with hard work and due deliberation, all things are possible. After all, he observed at an arbitration proceeding, \u201cmost of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible before they were done.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/technology/software-as-weaponry-in-a-computer-connected-world.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The internet was created nearly 40 years ago by men \u2014 and a few women \u2014 who envisioned an \u201cintergalactic network\u201d where humans could pull data and computing resources from any mainframe in the world and in the process free up their minds from mundane and menial tasks.", "\u201cThe hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled,\u201d wrote Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider, who was known as \u201cLick\u201d and is the man widely remembered as the internet\u2019s Johnny Appleseed.

By the time I first encountered Haring\u2019s work as a teenager, his artistic legacy had been reduced to catchy imagery of colorful, blocky bodies hugging and dancing on T-shirts. But the notebooks showed what nagged at the artist, what motivated him. I saw someone so suspicious of government surveillance that he often wrote in secret code, someone obsessed with the subversive power of gay sex and someone working to merge his skepticism of capitalism with a deep-\u00adrooted desire for fame and commercial appeal.", "I left with an urgent curiosity about what sort of artifacts we would display a few decades from now, for future generations to discover. Our contemporary analogues to the personal notebook now live on the web \u2014 communal, crowdsourced and shared online in real time. Some of the most interesting and vital work I come across exists only in pixels. Tumblr, for example, contains endless warrens of critical theory about trans identity politics and expression, one of the few havens on the web where that sort of discourse exists. Many of the short videos on Vine feel as though they belong to an ever-\u00adevolving, completely new genre of modern folk art. Some of the most clever commentary on pop culture and politics is thriving deep in hashtags on Twitter. Social media is as essential to understanding the preoccupations and temperature of our time as Haring\u2019s notebooks were for his. But preserving materials from the internet is much harder than sealing them under glass.", "Building an archive has always required asking a couple of simple but thorny questions: What will we save and how? Whose stories are the most important and why? In theory, the internet already functions as a kind of archive: Any document, video or photo can in principle remain there indefinitely, available to be viewed by anyone with a connection. But in reality, things disappear constantly. Search engines like Google continually trawl for pages to organize and index for retrieval, but they can\u2019t catch everything. And as the web evolves, it becomes harder to preserve. It is estimated that 75 percent of all websites are inactive, and domains are abandoned every day. Links can rot when sites disappear, images vanish when servers go offline and fluctuations in economic tides and social trends can wipe out entire ecosystems. (Look up a blog post from a decade ago and see how many of the images, media or links still work.) Tumblr and even Twitter may eventually end up ancient internet history because of their financial instability.", "There are scattered efforts to preserve digital history.

In the days that followed, hashtags like #IfTheyGunnedMeDown challenged the narratives presented by the mainstream media and prompted a national dialogue about racial stereotypes and police brutality. Jules teamed up with Ed Summers, a software developer in attendance, and started collecting tweets that included the word \u201cFerguson.\u201d", "As an archivist, Jules was struck by the way Twitter \u2014 and all social media, for that matter \u2014 is permanently altering the way we think about history. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking ahead to how we\u2019ll look back,\u201d Jules says.

Such an abundance presents a logistical challenge (the total number of tweets ever written is nearing half a trillion) as well as an ethical one (will people get to opt out of having ephemeral thoughts entered into the historical record?). But this plethora of new media and materials may function as a totally new type of archive: a multidimensional ledger of events that academics, scholars, researchers and the general public can parse to generate a more prismatic recollection of history.", "In March, I participated in a talk at the Museum of Modern Art about racial and gender disparity among Wikipedia contributors and how it influences the texture of the site.

These days, such omissions will still happen, but we can catch them faster. Oversights that would have taken decades to correct are now resolved in weeks, even hours. We now get a kaleidoscopic view of events as they unfold, often in real time, on our screens and devices.

No way I\u2019m squeezing in another appointment.\u201d", "Ingrid\u2019s eyes glistened. \u201cHave fun in Mexico,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going anywhere if you don\u2019t take care of yourself first.\u201d", "A passionate woman who speaks from the gut, Ingrid is no stranger to setbacks. She had watched her father die in a Colombian hospital, the victim of a carjacking gone awry. Speaking little English, she had fled the violence there to become a doctor in America, cleaning houses to pay her way. She married me knowing all about my disease, a rare, incurable form of thyroid cancer, which had required three neck operations. But she wasn\u2019t about to watch another man she loved die.", "\u201cMake the call,\u201d she said.", "A few days later, an oncologist was urging me to start a drug regimen at his clinic as soon as possible.", "I had a better idea. \u201cJust give me the recipe,\u201d I told him. I would share it with a doctor in Mexico and get treated there.", "Ingrid shot me a scolding look; the doctor frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re making enchiladas,\u201d he said. \u201cThese drugs can have nasty side effects. This is not the time to move to another country.\u201d", "On the ride home, I said to Ingrid: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone understand? Being a foreign correspondent is my dream. It\u2019s like when you moved to America to practice medicine. Dreams are good for your health!\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t have lung spots, and I wasn\u2019t moving to the air pollution capital of Latin America,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take care of yourself, nothing else matters.\u201d", "The next week, I canceled the appointment with the international movers, forfeited my deposit on the apartment in Mexico, and scanned the classified ads for a used car in Brooklyn. I settled back into my position on The A.P.\u2019s international desk, editing articles by reporters in exotic places that reminded me, painfully, of the job I had given up.", "My ordeal had barely begun. With chemotherapy starting in two months, the oncologist suggested I freeze my sperm for later use because the regimen can damage sex cells.", "Ingrid had another idea. We could make a baby now, \u201cthe natural way,\u201d she said.", "I suppressed a laugh. With my career sandbagged and chemotherapy looming, I couldn\u2019t even contemplate becoming a father. I would be nauseated and balding, in no shape to chase after a baby with a leaky diaper.", "Ingrid stood her ground. Thawed-out sperm are notoriously unreliable, she said. She had delivered hundreds of babies in Colombia, and believed bearing a child was a privilege, not to be taken lightly. This could be our last chance.", "I threw up my hands. I could only hope we would fail to conceive in the narrow window before the start of my regimen.", "But wouldn\u2019t you know: Three weeks later, Ingrid waved the positive test strip in my bewildered face, and our marriage entered a new phase. Around the time I underwent my first treatment, Ingrid was hit with morning sickness. Our side effects and symptoms were suddenly on parallel tracks.", "I woke up one morning feeling queasy and achy from my first treatment, listening to the whir of a portable pack pumping the drugs through a steel medical port in my chest. Bile crawled up my throat as I staggered to the bathroom and vomited into the toilet.", "Seconds later, Ingrid burst in, looking as pale as I felt, and vomited too.", "After gargling, she said: \u201cDo me a favor and vomit more softly.

You don\u2019t know how sick I feel.\u201d", "\u201cOh, but I think I do.\u201d In fact, I was that rare husband who knew exactly how sick my pregnant wife felt.", "A week later, our symptoms overlapped again. I discovered a clump of hair in the shower drain and a bald patch on my head. At the same time, Ingrid, her body flooded with hormones, discovered peach fuzz growing in surprising places, around her navel and on her neck. She was wide-eyed with concern.", "I reached into the shower drain and grabbed my hairball: \u201cYou think that\u2019s bad? I have a clump.\u201d", "She touched my scalp, smiling weakly. \u201cWe both have nausea,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re losing hair. I have hair in new places. We both have growths inside us. Don\u2019t you see? Me and you, we\u2019re connected.\u201d", "In no mood to celebrate our newfound solidarity, I drew away.", "\u201cIf your bad hair bothers you, let me shave you,\u201d she said. \u201cLots of sexy men are bald. Bruce Willis. Agassi. No need for your head to look like a bad lawn.\u201d", "I said: \u201cSure, go ahead. But first let me shave your peach fuzz.\u201d", "She turned away: \u201cSo it will grow back as stubble? You\u2019re not helping one bit.\u201d", "Ingrid and her hormones stalked out, sucking the air out of the bathroom. It wasn\u2019t so much that I didn\u2019t sympathize with my wife, but my own misery left me less able to cope with hers.", "Our similarities then dovetailed even more. As we both struggled to hold down food, I lost weight and Ingrid didn\u2019t gain enough. In fact, she was eating even less than me, preferring hot chocolate instead of dinner.", "I pictured our tiny child trapped in her womb, pumped up with sugar. For the first time, I started to worry more about the growth inside of her than the one in me. \u201cIngrid, listen to me,\u201d I said. \u201cThe baby needs to eat. And you\u2019re the only restaurant in town.\u201d", "That night, I dreamed that Ingrid gave birth to a tumor while a surgeon extracted a fetus from my throat. I jerked awake to the glare of the morning sun, feeling famished and nauseated. Pulling a baseball cap over my patchy scalp, I went out to forage for food that wouldn\u2019t make me gag. At a bodega, an idea struck me. I bought a loaf of Bimbo, a crunchy Hispanic-style bread Ingrid once told me she liked, and brought it to her.", "She closed her eyes and took a bite, then blinked as if waking from a dream: \u201cWait until I tell my mother you\u2019re feeding our baby Colombian food.\u201d She crunched some more, reminiscing about how she ate Bimbo as a girl. \u201cAnd the fruits! In Colombia, the papayas are so ripe and sweet.\u201d A tear slipped down her cheek as she rambled on nostalgically.", "\u201cYou\u2019re eating,\u201d I whispered as I also ate a slice, feeling the tension in me dissipate. \u201cMaybe we can get a group rate on lumpectomies,\u201d I joked.", "\u201cPlease don\u2019t call our baby a lump,\u201d she said, cracking a smile.", "As the months to Ingrid\u2019s due date fell away, our baby grew big and strong inside her. Alas, in this, too, my wife and I were on similar paths. Despite the harsh chemotherapy regimen, the spots on my lungs were growing inside of me too, and the doctors seemed powerless to stop them.", "Finally, on a glorious evening in February, Ingrid gave birth by cesarean section to a healthy eight-pound girl, named Sophie, whose screams filled the room as a nurse handed her to me in a tightly wrapped bundle. I handed her to Ingrid, who brought her to her breast. As pale streetlight filtered in, all I heard was suckling.", "Our story could have ended here, with Sophie\u2019s face scrunched against my wife\u2019s milk-swollen bosom. That would have been enough for me.", "But it didn\u2019t end there. I went on medical leave to become a stay-at-home father. I switched from chemo to an experimental drug that, despite a few setbacks and scares, managed to hold my cancer at bay. The three of us moved from Brooklyn to upstate New York, where, come summers, we sow tomato and basil in our garden, and where our chemo baby, now 15, fills our home with art, laughter and piano music.", "Lumps and all, not a bad deal."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/technology/china-tops-list-of-fastest-computers-again.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A new list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers provides more evidence that the once-yawning technology gap between the United States and China is closing.", "China dominates a biannual ranking of the world\u2019s 500 fastest supercomputers, called the Top500, that was published on Monday.

Government support for supercomputing has been slowed by long-running debates on the level of federal spending on basic scientific research, as well as opposition to funding for industrial innovation that is not directly related to national security.", "In the private sector, companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon invested billions of dollars in cloud-computing centers that don\u2019t focus as much on solving scientific problems.", "And last year, the United States blocked the sale of a number of advanced microprocessors to China over concerns they were being used in nuclear weapon development, which most likely accelerated the development of China\u2019s own technology, said Jack Dongarra, a University of Tennessee computer scientist who helped create the list of the world\u2019s fastest computers in 1993.", "The Top500 list is maintained by Dr. Dongarra and Erich Strohmaier, a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Officials at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, said the Chinese government has an ambitious $150 billion program to acquire as well as develop new technologies in various kinds of chips.", "After years of neglect, the United States does appear to be taking the competitive threat seriously, said John Neuffer, president of the S.I.A. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to double down on supercomputing and get ourselves back on track,\u201d he said.", "Last year, the Obama administration began a new effort to develop a so-called \u201cexascale\u201d supercomputer that would be 10 times faster than today\u2019s fastest supercomputers.

The world\u2019s fastest supercomputer in China, which could fill a large warehouse, requires the same electric power needed to run roughly 15,000 homes. An exascale supercomputer will very likely require more than twice that amount of power, or roughly the amount of power produced by the Copper Mountain Solar Facility, the largest producer of solar power in the United States.", "At the same time, even if the United States is able to design an exascale computer within the next decade, the Chinese could get there first. According to Dr. Dongarra, the Chinese government is committed to reaching the exascale goal by the end of this decade.", "Because of funding shortages and technology challenges, \u201cthere has been a delay in getting the exascale launched in the U.S., and as a result, we\u2019re further behind than we should be,\u201d he said.", "The Sunway supercomputer in Wuxi is a marvel of Chinese manufacturing prowess, Dr. Dongorra noted.

The chips are relatively slow individually \u2014 about the speed of the processor in Apple\u2019s iPhone 6.", "The Sunway machine does have its shortcomings. It has older memory-chip technology, meaning it is limited in the speed with which it can move data in and out of each processor when compared with the most powerful American supercomputers. And the new Chinese supercomputer is still based on American-made optical network technology that is used to connect the thousands of microprocessor chips.", "Despite the fact that the Chinese now have the most supercomputers on the list, the United States still dominates the top 20, with 10 machines.

The aphorisms are sometimes lazy, the facts can be sloppy, and the studied cool \u2013 all the while insisting that \u201cI am the uncoolest person you will ever meet\u201d \u2013 can be grating. I also could definitely have done without learning about Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s weakness for \u201cstrenuous fornication\u201d and drunken romps in the Facebook broom closet.", "And yet, somehow, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d manages to be an irresistible and indispensable 360-degree guide to the new technology establishment.", "Hiding underneath the braggadocio and evisceration of professional nemeses lies the beating heart of a formidable teacher. \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is likely to attract headlines and interest because of the prominent names and institutions mercilessly described. This is unfortunate. Mr. Garc\u00eda may apologize for his pedagogical asides, but these actually form the true core of what is a remarkably learned book.", "He schools us in three domains worthy of close study.", "The first half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes us inside the world of venture capital. After leaving \u2013 and litigating with \u2013 one early-stage tech company to start another, Mr. Garc\u00eda sells out to Twitter, only to immediately abandon his co-founders for Facebook. Along the way, we meet the lawyers, angel investors, venture firms and associated institutions \u2013 notably the Y Combinator, which plays an outsize role in securing financing from the most prestigious investors \u2013 that drive this ecosystem.", "The second half of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d takes place at Facebook, and it concerns the handful of dominant companies that have emerged from this start-up culture. These companies (in addition to Facebook, notably Google and Amazon), whose market values start at more than $300 billion, are approaching (or in the case of Apple and Microsoft, managing) middle age. In addition to contrasting their collective ethos with that of the start-up world, \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d touches on the also-rans like Twitter who failed to break into this rarefied plane.", "Beyond the author\u2019s personal story, what connects the two distinct halves of the book is his area of actual domain expertise: advertising. Mr. Garc\u00eda was a Ph.D. student in physics at Berkeley before joining Goldman Sachs to model prices for credit derivatives. He moved to Silicon Valley to perform the same magic in valuing the attention of internet users. And it is the explosion of digital advertising that has fed the emergence of the most recent crop of internet giants. In the course of describing his path from ad-tech start-ups to ad-targeting product manager at Facebook, Mr. Garc\u00eda provides fascinating insights into the nature of the online and offline advertising worlds \u2013 both regarding what has changed and what has stayed stubbornly the same.", "Two aspects in these central lessons make \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d a particularly compelling read, despite its faults. First, Mr. Garc\u00eda is not just a keen observer of corporate and social culture, but a thoughtful business and policy analyst armed with a highly refined detector for pretentious nonsense. Well before the investor Peter Thiel was revealed as the secret backer of the lawsuit that put Gawker into bankruptcy, Mr. Garc\u00eda was writing that \u201cthe tech start-up scene, for all its pretensions of transparency, principled innovation, and a counterculture renouncement of pressed shirts and staid social convention, is actually a surprisingly reactionary crowd.\u201d", "Even where Mr. Garc\u00eda completely mangles the facts \u2013 as he does for instance in describing the mechanics of the Facebook initial public offering \u2013 he manages to draw multiple fresh insights that somehow feel directionally correct. And in contrast to the self-serving verdicts rendered on his allies and enemies, his broader conclusions seem well balanced. The world he inhabited, Mr. Garc\u00eda reflects, \u201cis no worse than traditional industry and politics, but certainly no better either.\u201d", "Which brings us to the second reason \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is a must-read. It matters. Mr. Garc\u00eda is providing tools to honestly deconstruct a corner of the world that has amassed breathtaking cultural, economic and political influence, and not always for the good. Fully 60 percent of Harvard Business School graduates now go to work at companies with fewer than 500 employees. A fuller conversation is required before we rejoice that the invidious hegemony of Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and hedge funds as the resting place for our best and brightest graduates has been replaced with early-stage tech companies.", "At the least, readers of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d will think twice before taking at face value tech leaders\u2019 high-minded arguments for refusing to assist our national security apparatus in fighting terrorist threats. Even in the area of advertising, important social and public policy questions are implicated.", "The greatest danger of \u201cChaos Monkeys\u201d is that it could suffer the same fate as many equally prescient cautionary tales: It is appreciated less as trenchant social criticism and more as a how-to manual. Such is the irresistible pull of Silicon Valley that I fear the manuscript will be pored over mainly for clues to getting a job at Facebook or having a venture selected by the Y Combinator. If that is the case, we all may want to join Mr. Garc\u00eda on his boat and just sail away."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/nytnow/european-union-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-your-friday-evening-briefing.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

In a world in which a phone or computer is rarely more than arm\u2019s length away, are we eliminating introspection at times that may have formerly been conducive to it? And is the depth of that reflection compromised because we have retrained ourselves to seek out the immediate gratification of external stimuli?", "A few neuroscientific studies reveal the extent to which we are dependent on our electronic devices and suggest how, in doing so, we may be impairing our reflective abilities. A 2015 paper in the journal PLOS One measured smartphone use via an app from participants ages 18 to 33 and also asked them to report their estimates.", "If the data is any indication, most of us use our phones more than we think: Participants estimated an average of 37 uses throughout the day (anything that turns on the screen, from hitting snooze to making a call), but the actual number was around 85.

(Participants also underestimated duration of use by about an hour \u2014 the real total was 5.05 hours \u2014 which included phone calls and listening to music when the screen was off.)", "If you are awake for 16 hours, turning on or checking your phone 85 times means doing so about once every 11 minutes (and doesn\u2019t account for internet use on a computer), and 5.05 hours is over 30 percent of the day. What might be the effect on reflection of this compulsive behavior?", "In 2010, researchers led by Dr. Stephen Fleming at the Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging at University College London published a paper in the journal Science in which they correlated introspective ability with the amount of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex. (Introspective ability was defined for the study as the accuracy of measuring one\u2019s own performance on a visual-perception task, a sign of metacognition, or \u201cthinking about thinking.\u201d)", "Using this information about the prefrontal cortex, Brian Maniscalco and Hakwan Lau published a paper in Neuroscience of Consciousness in 2015 that measured introspective ability while subjects were either able to focus on one task or distracted by a difficult second task. Being distracted by the second task didn\u2019t hurt actual performance on the first task, but it did impair the subjects\u2019 ability to be introspective (again, by accurately self-reporting how they did). The finding supports previous widespread evidence that multitasking leads to lower cognitive performance.

This tiny corner is his, too.", "That sort of engagement feels almost antiquated, a product of an older time when place was something close to destiny. That\u2019s no longer the case.

Mr. Hynes\u2019s ubiquity has become a fact of 2010s New York. To follow him on Snapchat \u2014 he was a natural at self-documentation in the medium, right up until the moment this month when his account was hacked, then deleted \u2014 is to see an artist endlessly fascinated with this city\u2019s many crevices.", "A committed cultural citizen, he stands out among the New York musicians of his generation. Mr. Hynes\u2019s modern bohemianism feels like a holdover from an earlier time, more reminiscent of the uptown-downtown cross-pollination of the early 1980s, or how Lou Reed bridged proto-punk and art, or how Warhol\u2019s Factory took in the outcasts from all the city\u2019s scenes and gave them a home.", "His cultural life is broad and fluid, a throwback to when New York culture was less professionalized, more intimate and less segmented. \u201cFreetown Sound\u201d suggests a conversation with the city, navigating a host of styles while weaving in vocal snippets of local characters, from KRS-One to Ta-Nehisi Coates.", "Mr. Hynes moved here from London, where he was born and raised, at 21, already a few years deep into making music (then, as part of the band Test Icicles, and as a solo artist under the alias Lightspeed Champion). \u201cI was reading books about New York, like \u2018Please Kill Me,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the punk history. \u201cI was super-inspired from it. When I came here, I was still always just pulling from the city.\u201d", "A history buff with an itchy Google finger, he owns a bookshelf full of titles about the city, which is his muse and text.

His cohort of collaborators and friends includes musicians, yes, but also dancers, writers, artists and at least one lampshade designer. He plays soccer in public parks and basketball in a court at a West Village public school (in a loose league that was begun many years ago by the Beastie Boys, no less). He hosted a benefit for a Harlem music school at the Apollo Theater. He plays small, intimate shows at bookstores, like one for a book release for the artists Alex Da Corte and Jayson Musson, and provides scores for art installations at the Knockdown Center in Queens and elsewhere.

His preferred watering hole is the Fat Cat, a plain jazz bar in the West Village where he enjoys unwinding at the Ping-Pong table with his musician friends. \u201cIt\u2019s such a hidden gem,\u201d he said. \u201cI like that it\u2019s either old people or students and there\u2019s no real in between. On the weekends sometimes you\u2019ll get, maybe, like an office group.\u201d", "This is Mr. Hynes\u2019s New York, elegant and mundane all at once.

They go out the door and you don\u2019t quite know where they\u2019ve gone, where they\u2019re going, what they\u2019re doing, but it seems cool. It\u2019s half protectiveness, half aspiration.\u201d", "Which is why, when the opportunity presents itself to leave, as it often does, for touring, Mr. Hynes rarely takes the bait. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird for me to take time out of my life,\u201d he said, half-apologetic. For him, New York is home, and nourishment, and purpose.

Here are edited excerpts from a conversation with him.", "In what ways does your fascination with New York come out in your music, especially on this album?", "A lot of the music I make, it\u2019s music for me to listen to on headphones to soundtrack me just walking around.

It\u2019s actually about walking down a street, and me trying to work out what to do, say, if there\u2019s like a young blond girl in front of me, and we\u2019re the only ones on the street, and it\u2019s me trying not to scare her walking \u2014 trying to work out if I should cross the road, if I should walk faster and try to speed past \u2014 but it\u2019s kind of told through this shield.", "So woven into these melodies is a the difficulties of living in a black body in a white society. Did you ever want to make a straightforward agit-pop album?", "There was a large period before the songs that made this album when I was, like, pretty dark musically, but also I think it wasn\u2019t good enough for release. The only other time that happened to me was the week after the Trayvon non-indictment. I made 10 songs I was gonna put out, and I was gonna try to do it under a different name, and then I just didn\u2019t. It was more me just trying to work through things than me releasing to the world.", "What work have you done that\u2019s most political?", "Maybe the first Lightspeed [Champion] album. It dealt with a lot of similar themes, like being black in a particularly white world. At the time no one particularly noticed. If that came out now with that political content, I think people would associate me with it more. The album was mainly about being a weird black kid, 80 percent of it. That is closest lyrically to this one.", "What artists do you feel kinship with on these topics?", "I would say Le1f. Kelela \u2014 the stuff she\u2019s been working on now is really similar. Solange, of course. I really love Elysia Crampton. It\u2019s kind of intense \u2014 there\u2019s no vocals in it, but it still deals with being displaced. She\u2019s transgender and dealing with being herself in this world. But you can feel it. And then there\u2019s people that I look up to, like Kendrick.", "Do you feel those messages, explicit or implicit, are more in tune with this political and social moment?", "It definitely is, though it\u2019s just where I\u2019m at. Other people, if they make an album and things start coming out with similar themes, they start to freak out, but I\u2019m kind of just like stoked on it. It shows I\u2019m not alone in my thinking.

But Disney didn\u2019t have a choice. The Communist Party maintains strict control over media companies.", "The partnership has significant perks for Disney. State-run construction companies cleared a 1,700-acre tract to build the resort, which will ultimately include two additional Disney theme parks and thousands of Disney hotel rooms, analysts say. Authorities have relocated residents, moved graves and closed more than 150 polluting factories. The government built new infrastructure, including a subway line that goes directly to the park\u2019s front gate.", "Officials have also taken unusual steps to protect Disney from piracy in China, a country where copyright infringement is common and the government rarely intervenes. Whether the state can stand by that pledge is uncertain. But early signs are promising. Last November, regulators fined five copycat Disney hotels located near the theme park. Around the same time, nearly 2,000 counterfeit Disney items, including hundreds of Winnie-the-Pooh shirts, were seized in Hangzhou. The government is even sending regulators to Disney for special training to help them better identify counterfeits.", "The partnership is \u201cstructured so that it will work,\u201d said Mr. Iger. \u201cThey have a tremendous amount riding on it.\u201d", "But Disney is stepping into a potential minefield. State leaders are growing more confident about exerting influence over multinationals. The government is pushing to upgrade China\u2019s economy, and it wants state-owned companies to learn from partners like Disney while amassing a large share of the profits.", "Along with its stake in the park, Shendi stands to make a fortune from a 4,000-acre plot of land that it controls around the resort. In other locales, Disney has typically maintained a firm grip on the immediately adjacent real estate. Shendi wants to use such land for hotels, spas and retail, like its new Shanghai Village, a 590,000-square-foot outlet mall, with luxury shops selling Armani, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture and other brands.", "The Shanghai government sees Disney as just one piece of a broader effort to redevelop Pudong, the city\u2019s easternmost region, by creating industrial parks and tourist destinations. Just 30 miles southeast of Disney\u2019s site, the government has promoted Winterland, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest indoor ski resort and entertainment facility. Nearby, Haichang Polar Ocean World promises \u201cperformances\u201d by beluga whales, dolphins, polar bears and arctic wolves.", "\u201cChina wants Shanghai to be this kind of dragon\u2019s head, a showcase city for all the world to see,\u201d said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, an American businessman who has worked with the Shanghai government. \u201cDisney is part of that grand strategy.\u201d", "The partnership structure puts Disney in a complicated spot. Shendi is really a consortium of four powerful government-owned companies: the Shanghai Radio, Film and Television Development Company; Jin Jiang Hotels; Bailian retail shops; and a property developer, the Lujiazui Group. And each of those companies has separate business ties to Disney\u2019s new resort.", "The Jin Jiang Group has a contract to provide tourism services for the park. The Lujiazui Group helped develop the world\u2019s largest Disney Store. The Shanghai Media Group, a division of the development company, is positioned to capture a big share of the park\u2019s television and advertising budget, since it controls the city\u2019s biggest television stations, as well as major newspapers, magazines and radio properties.", "So Disney will have to deal with a bewildering array of state affiliates acting as partners, suppliers and even competitors, making contract negotiations complex and raising thorny conflict-of-interest issues. Shendi, for instance, has set up its own energy company to supply natural gas to the theme park site. And Shanghai Media Group has formed alliances or made investments with Disney competitors like Sony, Warner Bros. and DreamWorks Animation.", "\u201cThe more partners you have, the more potential conflicts,\u201d said Oded Shenkar, a professor of business at Ohio State University and an authority on Chinese joint ventures.", "\u201cEach of those state companies may come with multiple other affiliations,\u201d he added. A multinational must then \u201ccontend with a whole network of relationships and interdependencies they often cannot decipher.\u201d", "When Disney unveiled the website for the Shanghai park in March, the fervor was instantaneous. The site registered five million hits in less than half an hour. Tickets for the first two weeks sold out within hours. Over one weekend in early May, with the opening still a month away, more than 100,000 people visited the resort to peek through the park gates and explore a shopping area that doesn\u2019t require a ticket.", "But criticism has begun, too. Disney has been pilloried in local media for its prices ($1 for a single steamed bun, or about five times the street price). Some initial visitors trampled the public gardens. And Disney has had to deploy uniformed security guards to maintain order at popular rides, where lines during the soft opening stretched up to three hours. Shanghai authorities recently published an etiquette guide.", "\u201cThe frenzy of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the era of blindly following them have passed,\u201d Wang Jianlin, the chairman of Dalian Wanda Group, which operates a chain of Chinese theme parks, said on state television in May.", "Mr. Iger brushed off Mr. Wang\u2019s criticism as \u201cpatently absurd,\u201d and said media reports about food pricing complaints were overblown. \u201cWe made a decision with our quick-service restaurants to go higher-end, and there\u2019s a cost to that,\u201d he said.", "Disney needs to avoid getting lost in translation, an especially difficult proposition in China. It is a deeply American brand trying to break into a country where the government wants to suppress Western ideals.", "Already, Shanghai Disneyland is triggering concerns about American cultural imperialism. At a gathering of China\u2019s political leaders in Beijing in March, an official called for limiting Disney\u2019s expansion and growth.", "\u201cI suggest that we shouldn\u2019t allow too many Disneyland theme parks to be built\u201d in China, said Li Xiusong, the deputy head of culture in the eastern Anhui Province. \u201cIf children follow Western culture when they are little, they will end up liking Western culture when they grow up and be uninterested in Chinese culture.\u201d", "The country\u2019s leaders have also grown more nationalistic in recent years: Everything must serve the state\u2019s interest. The Communist Party is using Disney to bolster the country\u2019s own media and entertainment companies, as well as to improve China\u2019s image abroad. And the Chinese government is a master of control, known for strictly censoring Western media. This spring, with little warning or explanation, Chinese regulators shut down Apple\u2019s digital book service and DisneyLife, a four-month-old subscription-based movie streaming service operated by Alibaba.", "Disney is going to extraordinary lengths to prove its commitment to China and the Communist Party. During a 2010 meeting with China\u2019s propaganda minister, Mr. Iger pledged to use the company\u2019s global platform to \u201cintroduce more about China to the world.\u201d And he has done just that.", "Disney is working with China\u2019s Ministry of Culture to help develop the country\u2019s animation industry and has agreed to work with Shanghai Media Group to make films for global audiences. Notably, Disney partnered with the state to produce \u201cBorn in China,\u201d a film that promises to \u201cshowcase to the world the spectacular wildlife and natural beauty of China,\u201d which a trailer depicts as snuggly baby pandas, snow leopards and lavish aerial shots of pristine mountain ranges.", "\u201cWhen global brands ask me what they need to do to improve their chances in China, I often paraphrase John F. Kennedy: Ask not what China can do for your business, but what your business can do for China,\u201d said John A.

The Broadway version of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d will be performed entirely in Mandarin \u2014 a first.", "Mr. Iger even came up with a new slogan for the Shanghai resort, calling it \u201cauthentically Disney and distinctly Chinese.\u201d He repeats the phrase constantly when talking about the site, and Disney executives in Shanghai have posted it around their offices. It is supposed to be a sign of respect for China and its people.", "\u201cWhat are we doing here that will make this park successful in China?\u201d Mr. Iger said at an investor event in May. \u201cOne of the critical elements was making it distinctly Chinese, making sure that the people who visit this park feel that it\u2019s theirs.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/business/media/youtube-red-buys-step-up-its-first-big-budget-tv-drama.html": ["LOS ANGELES \u2014 YouTube Red, the Google-owned paid streaming service, has acquired its first big-budget, Hollywood-produced television drama, moving it into more direct competition with players like Netflix and traditional cable networks.", "Fittingly, given YouTube\u2019s ambitions, the scripted series will be based on \u201cStep Up,\u201d the Lionsgate-controlled dance movie franchise that started Channing Tatum\u2019s acting career and has taken in more than $650 million at the worldwide box office.

It sounds like the beginning of that kids\u2019 song:", "Ta-ra-ra webssier,", "I know your take-home pay,", "I know the books you\u2019ve read", "And that your dog is dead.", "I see your partner Mort", "Will see you soon in court,", "Your ex-wife seems quite sweet \u2014", "My God, she looks like me.", "Not that I wasn\u2019t planning on Googling the guy myself; I just wouldn\u2019t have been as thorough. I save that level of diligence for after the breakup, when I hope to see him reprinting stories he did 40 years ago for The East Village Other and posting links to melancholy Platters songs at 3 a.m. Prerelationship, I like a little mystery.", "I know I\u2019m in the minority with this one. Googling before a date is now so ingrained in the culture, it\u2019s practically hygienic, like using mouthwash. Not Googling, on the other hand, is like getting into a car with a guy you just met at a party: If they find you floating in the Hudson a few days later, it\u2019s on you.", "Sure, when you Google you may learn that a date has been arrested for drunken driving or is not entirely divorced. But it also removes the delight of surprise. This is especially troublesome on first dates, where it is essential to look cool. I have made a study of this, and I have discovered that people have exactly three cool things each.", "One of my cool things is that I once lived in Paris, working on a book about a French spy who had a child with a Chinese opera singer who turned out to be a man. This is harder than you might think to slip into conversation, but believe me, I manage.", "The coat that woman is wearing reminds me of the time I lived in Paris, in a little apartment in the Sixth. You\u2019d never see a coat like that in Paris \u2026", "If I try that these days, my date already knows that I lived in Paris because he read about it online. I haven\u2019t even finished my drink and I\u2019m down to two cool things, one of which is my car, so I\u2019m not sure it counts. And I know my date\u2019s cool things, like that Gilda Radner used to go to his loft for leftovers and that he introduced Bob Dylan and Norman Mailer. We\u2019ve known each other an hour and we\u2019re already sick of each other\u2019s stories, which isn\u2019t supposed to happen until after we\u2019re married.", "It\u2019s a spoiler, the dating equivalent of somebody telling you that Harry Lime is alive at the beginning of \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d On the other hand, since everybody does it, if a date hasn\u2019t done a cursory search on you it\u2019s also a bit insulting. He\u2019s already standing there at the bar with his cellphone, looking at baseball scores; how hard would it be to say, \u201cSiri, check \u2018Wadler,\u2019 \u2018arrests,\u2019 \u2018New York City\u2019\u201d?", "You know how romance used to be in Greenwich Village, back in the \u201970s? We\u2019d pick each other up in the street. The neighborhoods were more peaceful then because you didn\u2019t have the cellphone screamers. If you wanted to hear someone fight with a partner, you had to go back to your apartment and wait till you had fallen asleep.", "Bars and restaurants were also good places to meet someone because the acoustics were such that we could hear one another. We didn\u2019t have OkCupid to tell us beforehand if someone A) believed in astrology, B) did not believe in astrology but thought it was still kind of fun, or C) covered every electrical device in his home with aluminum foil; we operated on conversation and chemistry. I once met an architect at an all-night burger joint called David\u2019s Pot Belly whom I saw for several months and it was lovely.", "I also once got picked up in the West Village by a city councilman. He was smoother than the scruffy reporters and photographers I usually went for, but charming. We exchanged numbers and I met him for brunch at the Riviera, a sidewalk cafe on Sheridan Square. I have no memory of what we talked about, but not long after we sat down, an attractive, dark-haired woman leaned over the railing and said something to the guy along the lines of \u201cI\u2019d just like you to know that you put me in the hospital with a ruptured gallbladder.\u201d And to me, \u201cYou should know that you\u2019re sitting with a guy who likes to hit women.\u201d", "Then she walked away.", "I was out of that cafe like a shot and raced after her on the street. When I caught up with her she was embarrassed and started apologizing, saying she should have never interfered.", "Are you kidding? I said. What she had done, confronting that creep to protect another woman, took nerve, and I was grateful. It seems to me that we walked together a few blocks; maybe we said we should get together for coffee, but we never did. But sometimes when I\u2019m in Sheridan Square I think about what happened. The shock of the moment when she confronted that guy, his denial to me as I got to my feet, her nerve. The humanness of the exchange.", "Then again, had she not come along, there might have been the very real humanness of an assault.", "There may be something to be said for Googling."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/technology/online-searches-can-identify-cancer-victims-study-finds.html": ["Microsoft scientists have demonstrated that by analyzing large samples of search engine queries they may in some cases be able to identify internet users who are suffering from pancreatic cancer, even before they have received a diagnosis of the disease.", "The scientists said they hoped their work could lead to early detection of cancer. Their study was published on Tuesday in The Journal of Oncology Practice by Dr. Eric Horvitz and Dr. Ryen White, the Microsoft researchers, and John Paparrizos, a Columbia University graduate student.", "\u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018If we heard the whispers of people online, would it provide strong evidence or a clue that something\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Dr. Horvitz said.", "The researchers focused on searches conducted on Bing, Microsoft\u2019s search engine, that indicated someone had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. From there, they worked backward, looking for earlier queries that could have shown that the Bing user was experiencing symptoms before the diagnosis. Those early searches, they believe, can be warning flags.", "While five-year survival rates for pancreatic cancer are extremely low, early detection of the disease can prolong life in a very small percentage of cases. The study suggests that early screening can increase the five-year survival rate of pancreatic patients to 5 to 7 percent, from just 3 percent.", "The researchers reported that they could identify from 5 to 15 percent of pancreatic cases with false positive rates of as low as one in 100,000. The researchers noted that false positives could lead to raised medical costs or create significant anxiety for people who later found out they were not sick.", "The data used by the researchers was anonymized, meaning it did not carry identifying markers like a user name, so the individuals conducting the searches could not be contacted.", "A logical next step would be to figure out what to do with that search information. One possibility would be some sort of health service where users could allow their searches to be collected, allowing scientists to monitor for questions that indicate warning flag symptoms.", "\u201cThe question, \u2018What might we do? Might there be a Cortana for health some day?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Horvitz, in a reference to the company\u2019s speech-oriented online personal assistant software service.", "Although the researchers declined to offer specific details, Dr. White is now the chief technology officer of health intelligence in a recently created Health & Wellness division at Microsoft.", "They acknowledged that health-related data generated from web search histories was still new territory for the medical profession.", "\u201cI think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data,\u201d Dr. Horvitz said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this stimulates quite a bit of interesting conversation.\u201d", "The new research is based on the ability of the Microsoft team to accurately distinguish between web searches that are casual or based on anxiety and those that are genuine searches for specific medical symptoms by people who are experiencing them, he noted.", "Both a computer scientist and a medical doctor by training, Dr. Horvitz said he had been exploring this area in part because of a phone conversation with a close friend who had described symptoms. Based on their conversation, Dr. Horvitz advised him to contact his doctor. He received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and died several months later.", "The availability of vast sets of behavior data based on individual web queries using the search engines offered by companies like Google and Microsoft has for a number of years been seen as a potential indicator of health-related information.", "In 2009, Google published a research paper that explored the potential of early detection of flu epidemics based on statistical analysis of web search logs, though the results of that effort ultimately fell short of what had been hoped.", "More recently, Microsoft researchers have had significant success in finding early evidence of adverse drug reactions from patterns observed in web logs. In 2013, they detected unreported side effects of prescription drugs before they were found by the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s warning system.", "The researchers are exploring evidence related to a range of devastating diseases. They also said that unlike the drug interaction data, which would be of direct value to the F.D.A. as an early alert, it was possible that symptom alert data might be made available as part of a broader online health service that a company like Microsoft might offer."]}

Critics \u2014 generally, though not exclusively, on the political right \u2014 drew a direct line from Point A (\u201cSilent Spring\u201d) to Point B (the DDT ban) to Point C (more deaths), and accused Carson of perpetrating \u201cjunk science.\u201d Some even labeled her one of history\u2019s great villains.", "Their language could be, to put it mildly, superheated, including descriptions of her as a mass murderer.

(The app, which is no longer available for download, opened with a permission form explaining to people that the data they entered would be used for academic research.)", "The app randomly sent requests to people throughout the day, asking them to enter an estimation of their current mood by answering questions and also using grids in which they would place a dot showing whether they felt more stressed or relaxed, depressed or excited, and so on.", "Periodically, people were also asked to assess their satisfaction with life in general.", "After a few weeks, when people were comfortable with the app, they began answering additional questions about whether, in the past 15 minutes, they had been sitting, standing, walking, running, lying down or doing something else.", "They also were asked about their mood at that moment.", "At the same time, during the 17 months of the study, the app gathered data from the activity monitor that is built into almost every smartphone today. In essence, it checked whether someone\u2019s recall of how much he or she had been moving in the past quarter-hour tallied with the numbers from the activity monitor.", "In general, the information provided by users and the data from activity monitors was almost exactly the same.", "Of greater interest to the researchers, people using the app turned out to feel happier when they had been moving in the past quarter-hour than when they had been sitting or lying down, even though most of the time they were not engaged in rigorous activity.", "In fact, most of the physical activity that people reported was gentle walking, with little running, cycling or other more strenuous exercise.", "But the links between moving in any way and feeling happy were consistent for most people throughout the day, according to the data from their apps. It also didn\u2019t matter whether it was a workday or weekend.", "The researchers also found that people who moved more frequently tended to report greater life satisfaction over all than those who reported spending most of their time in a chair.", "In general, the results suggest that \u201cpeople who are generally more active are generally happier and, in the moments when people are more active, they are happier,\u201d says Gillian Sandstrom, a study co-author who was a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge and is now a lecturer in psychology at the University of Essex.", "In other words, moving and happiness were closely linked, both in the short term and longer term.", "Of course, this type of study does not establish causation. It cannot tell us whether being more active actually causes us to become happier or, conversely, whether being happy causes us to move more. It only shows that more activity goes hand-in-hand with greater happiness.", "The study also is limited by its reliance on cellphone data, Dr. Sandstrom says, because it may not have captured information about formal exercise. People often do not carry their phones when they run, cycle or engage in other types of vigorous activity, she and her colleagues point out in the study. So those types of workouts would not be reflected in the app or the phones\u2019 activity monitor, making it impossible to know from this data set whether formal exercise is linked to happiness, for better or worse.", "Still, the size of the study group and the consistency of the findings are compelling, Dr. Sandstrom says.

You\u2019d just grab books off the shelf in the hope that you\u2019d come across what you were looking for.", "When Navigator went live on an internal server on Nov. 2 (it would later be made public), the library suddenly grew a lot less formidable. In fact, it became inviting. We were given keys to all that knowledge. An inscrutable, unfathomable collection could be approached systematically, logically, topically and timely.", "After more than 22 years of service, the Navigator page was retired last Friday.", "When it was created, only a handful of Times employees were using the internet, Mr. Meislin said, generally through personal accounts at services like panix.com and pipeline.com, which had been created by James Gleick, a Times alumnus. Google did not yet exist. In July 1994, Gordon T.

Last July, David Limp, a company executive who works on the product, said in an interview with Fortune that the idea of an all-knowing machine, with access to all the world\u2019s information, had captured his imagination since the first time he saw it on television. It took, he said, a team of 1,000 engineers to write its code, and when the device was finished, Amazon decided to call it Alexa, shorthand for Alexandria, as in the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt. It is designed to work primarily with a suite of wireless speakers, also made by Amazon, called Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.", "The company bills Alexa as a smart personal assistant, one that can play your favorite song or read you a book or recite a recipe as you cook. You can also make purchases through Amazon simply by asking. The possibilities are seemingly endless, because Alexa can learn new \u201cskills\u201d (as Amazon likes to call them) from third-party developers who integrate Alexa into their own products. And developers have leapt at the opportunity to do so: At the beginning of 2016, there were 135 skills designed to work with Alexa, but this year that number increased to more than 7,000. Alexa can now order you an Uber or a pizza, check your bank balance, control your TV, turn your lights on and off and even measure your car\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions. \u201c\u2009\u2018Alexa, buy me coffee\u2019 is just a fraction of what it\u2019s going to be over time,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an internet analyst who covers Amazon for the equities firm Macquarie Securities. \u201cWhat can they improve with the voice activation?

Schachter told me that part of Alexa\u2019s success was luck, in that there were few other shiny consumer offerings on the market this holiday season and the price point was affordable. But something about the future-feel of this device, its ease and convenience, has captivated a mass audience, even the most privacy-conscious among us. Alexa is always listening, ready to be of service. (This has already backfired: When a newscaster relayed a story about a little girl using her Alexa to order a dollhouse, it triggered dozens of Alexas in the homes of people watching the broadcast to also try to order one.)", "Five years ago, few would have guessed that Amazon would already be ahead of the top tech companies vying to be leaders in home automation.

I recently revisited \u201cThe Everything Store,\u201d a 2013 book by Brad Stone about how Bezos transformed the start-up from an online bookstore into the e-commerce behemoth it is today. \u201cBezos\u2019 long-term goal is to sell everything, everywhere,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cHe will attempt to move faster, work his employees harder, make bolder bets and pursue both big inventions and small ones, all to achieve his grand vision for Amazon \u2014 that it be not just an everything store, but ultimately an everything company.\u201d", "The fact that I live in New York, a city that thrives on accessibility, might explain why I was slow to grasp the appeal of Alexa. Here we have bodegas on every corner, most open 24 hours, in case you need to pick up a roll of toilet paper or a bottle of hot sauce in the middle of the night. But most Americans don\u2019t live with the luxury of that immediacy. I didn\u2019t really understand this until the holidays, when I went home to visit my mom in Virginia and we ran out of seltzer. Carbonated water is not an essential item. But in that moment, it would have been easier to quickly tell Alexa to place an order for us and forget about it until it arrived two or three days later, rather than try to remember to pick up a case of Poland Spring the next time someone made the 20-minute drive to the store. That\u2019s the entire enticing promise of Amazon and Alexa: a much more efficient and manageable life, one in which you can outsource mundane tasks while you do something more important, like spend time with your family.", "It\u2019s not hard to imagine that Alexa might be displaced as rivals introduce their own efforts. Facebook is working on an intelligent assistant, called Jarvis (named for the smart computer that helps Tony Stark, or Iron Man, navigate his surroundings), as is Microsoft. There are rumors that Apple is working on a major update for Siri. Google is currently Amazon\u2019s closest competitor. The company has spent decades organizing the world\u2019s information and learning about our habits and preferences in the process, so that it will one day know what we want even before we do.

With Google, you still have to go to Amazon or Walmart.\u201d Amazon is investing in supply trailers, drones and fulfillment centers to develop its own postal service and delivery system. And it\u2019s still pushing its Dash buttons, those small pieces of hardware with one purpose: to order a single item from Amazon, like laundry detergent or dish soap. They seem unnecessary, until you consider them with all of Amazon\u2019s other efforts: It\u2019s not just an everything store, or even an everything company, but an everywhere (and anytime!) store.", "The various products that Amazon is planning to roll out \u2014 including Pantry and Fresh, its grocery service \u2014 can be easily baked into default Alexa services.

Its melody was simple, and it was unsubtle in its melancholy, but there was no denying that it could work as background music for, say, a health insurance commercial.", "Mr. Stobbs didn\u2019t write the music himself, nor did he commission it from a composer. Jukedeck is one of a growing number of companies using artificial intelligence to compose music. Their computers tap tools like artificial neural networks, modeled on the brain, that allow the machines to learn by doing, rather as a child does. So far, at least, these businesses do not seem to be causing much anxiety among musicians.", "\u201cWe see our system as still in its infancy; it\u2019s only learnt a certain amount about music,\u201d Mr. Stobbs said, although he quickly hinted how he hoped Jukedeck\u2019s music could advance: \u201cThere\u2019s no rule of physics that says computers can\u2019t get as good as a human.\u201d", "Having machines write music is not new. In the 1950s, the composer Lejaren Hiller used a computer to produce the \u201cIlliac\u201d Suite for string quartet, the first computer-generated score.", "Since then, countless researchers have pushed that work forward. But several start-ups are now trying to commercialize A.I. music for everything from jingles to potential pop hits. Jukedeck, for instance, is looking to sell tracks to anyone who needs background music for videos, games or commercials. The company charges large businesses just $21.99 to use a track, a fraction of what hiring a musician would cost. Mr. Stobbs wouldn\u2019t reveal how many tracks it has sold, but said that the British division of Coca-Cola pays for a monthly subscription.", "Tech giants are also involved. In June, Google Brain announced Magenta, a project that aims to have computers produce \u201ccompelling and artistic\u201d music, filled with surprises. Its efforts so far do not quite fit the bill.", "In September, DeepMind, the Google-owned British artificial intelligence company, also released results of an experiment it undertook for fun. DeepMind put samples of piano music into its WaveNet system, used to generate audio, such as speech. The system, which was not told anything about how music worked, used the initial audio to synthesize 10-second clips that sound like avant-garde jazz. IBM also has a research project called Watson Beat, which musicians will be able to use to transform their work\u2019s style, making songs sound Middle Eastern, for example, or \u201cspooky.\u201d", "Jukedeck\u2019s beginnings are somewhat surprising for a tech company. Mr. Stobbs and the composer Ed Newton-Rex, both 29, founded it in 2012. They had been choristers at King\u2019s College School in Cambridge, England, and Mr. Newton-Rex went on to study music at the University of Cambridge, where he first learned that artificial intelligence could compose. After graduating from Cambridge, the pair set up a choral boy band (\u201ca terrible idea,\u201d Mr. Stobbs said), and had aspirations to run a record label. But in 2010, Mr. Newton-Rex attended a computer science lecture at Harvard, where his girlfriend was studying. The lecturer made coding sound relatively straightforward, and also made Mr. Newton-Rex recall his earlier studies in A.I. music. He decided to put the two together, and he set about building Jukedeck on the flight home.", "Jukedeck\u2019s system involves feeding hundreds of scores into its artificial neural networks, which then analyze them so they can work out things like the probability of one musical note\u2019s following another, or how chords progress. The networks can eventually produce compositions in a similar style, which are then turned into audio, using an automated production program. It has different networks for different styles, from folk to \u201ccorporate\u201d \u2014 something that sounds like the glossy electronica typically played at business conferences. The company only recently started experimenting with the artificial neural networks for the audio output as well as the composition. This should make tracks sound more natural and varied \u2014 more human, in other words.", "Other companies working on A.I. music tend to involve musicians more directly in the process. The Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris, for example, considers musicians essential to its Flow Machines project, which has received funding from the European Research Council.", "The idea behind the project is to get computers to write pop hits, said Fran\u00e7ois Pachet, the laboratory\u2019s director. \u201cMost people working on A.I. have focused on classical music, but I\u2019ve always been convinced that composing a short, catchy melody is probably the most difficult task,\u201d he said.", "He added: \u201cA compelling song is actually a rare and fragile object. It can only work if all the dimensions are right: the melody, the harmony, the voice, the dress of the singer, the discourse around it \u2014 like, \u2018Why did you write this song?\u2019 No one is able to model all that right now, and I\u2019m interested in that problem.\u201d", "Flow Machines\u2019 main system is a composing tool that works similarly to Jukedeck\u2019s: by getting a computer to analyze scores \u2014 everything from Beatles\u2019 songs to dance hits \u2014 so that it can learn from them and write its own. However, its output is then given to musicians, who are free to use it, change it or throw it away as they like, at no charge. (Negotiations are underway regarding contractual obligations if record labels release any of this music.) Musicians give \u201ca sense of agency,\u201d Mr. Pachet said. \u201cThe systems don\u2019t know why they want to make music. They don\u2019t have any goal, any desire.\u201d", "Around 20 acts have already used the system, Mr. Pachet said, some performing the songs they wrote using it at a recent concert. He is in talks with some well-known groups, like the indie band Phoenix, to try it, he added, and several albums will be released this year.", "Musicians appear to enjoy it. \u201cI could never have written a song like the one I did without it,\u201d said Mathieu Peudupin, a French rock musician who goes by the name Lescop. \u201cIt drove me to a place I would never have gone myself.\u201d He said it was like working with a bandmate, although he ignored most of its suggestions. \u201cBut what singer in the world listens to his bandmates?\u201d he said, laughing.", "Mr. Pachet and Lescop both said they did not think listeners would ever entirely accept computer-generated music. \u201cMusic fans need to fall in love with musicians,\u201d Lescop said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fall in love with a computer.\u201d", "But the founders of Jukedeck are less certain.", "Mr. Newton-Rex sees artificial intelligence changing the way we listen, especially if computers eventually \u201cunderstand music enough to make it respond in real time to, let\u2019s say, a game, or you going for a run,\u201d he said. \u201cRecorded music\u2019s brilliant, but it\u2019s static. If you\u2019re playing a game, Hans Zimmer isn\u2019t sitting with you composing.

But the data were clear and the implications were alarming: Women who were trauma patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital were in considerably greater danger of dying of preventable blood clots than men.", "Why? Because doctors were less likely to provide them with the appropriate blood clot prevention treatment. At Hopkins, as at many hospitals, both men and women were receiving treatment at less than perfect rates, but while 31 percent of male trauma patients were failing to get proper clot prevention, for women, the rate was 45 percent. That means women were nearly 50 percent more likely to miss out on blood clot prevention.", "Blood clots, gelatinous tangles that can travel through the body and block blood flow, kill more people every year than breast cancer, AIDS and car crashes combined. But many of these clots can be avoided \u2014 if doctors prescribe the right preventive measures.", "Haut is a trauma surgeon, not a bias expert, so gender disparities were the last thing on his mind when he and his team put together a computerized checklist that requires doctors to review blood clot prevention for every patient. \u201cOur goal was not to improve care for men or women or whoever, it was to improve the care of everybody,\u201d he said. But what they found was that after the introduction of the checklist, appropriate treatment for everyone spiked. And the gender disparity disappeared.", "In trying to end preventable blood clots, the Hopkins team may have quietly stumbled upon a way to eliminate at least one form of gender bias.", "Gender bias has received significant attention in recent years, and has been scrutinized as a factor in the dearth of female chief executives, the treatment of presidential candidates and the lower pay of Hollywood actresses.", "In health care, gender disparities are especially pernicious. If you are a woman, studies have shown, you are not only less likely to receive blood clot prophylaxis, but you may also receive less intensive treatment for a heart attack. If you are a woman older than 50 who is critically ill, you are at particular risk of failing to receive lifesaving interventions. If you have knee pain, you are less likely to be referred for a knee replacement than a man, and if you have heart failure, it may take longer to get EKGs.", "It\u2019s not clear what causes these differences. While situational factors and variations among patients may explain some of them, broad gender differences in treatment protocols that play out across large numbers of patients suggest a systemic bias. What\u2019s especially difficult in ending such discrimination is that providers may not even realize they\u2019re behaving in biased ways.", "Such implicit bias, as researchers now understand, happens when we unintentionally use stereotypes or associations to make judgments. \u201cPerhaps we take women\u2019s symptoms less seriously, or we interpret them as having an emotional cause as opposed to a physical cause,\u201d said Dr. Christine Kolehmainen, the associate director for women\u2019s health at the Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital in Madison, Wis. Studies bear this out: in one study of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, doctors were more likely to suggest that male patients receive X-rays and more likely to offer female patients tranquilizers and lifestyle advice.", "In the case of blood clot prevention, doctors\u2019 assumptions about women\u2019s risk factors could lead to disparities in treatment. \u201cThere might be stereotypes about women\u2019s biology or environment or occupation that could all play into medical decision-making,\u201d Kolehmainen said.", "Whether unintentional, unconscious or simply based on erroneous assumptions, treatment differentials clearly exist. Interventions like the Hopkins checklist can help correct them.", "The Hopkins checklist is considered a \u201cdecision support tool,\u201d and it works like this: Whenever a provider is admitting a patient to the hospital, a computerized checklist pops up onscreen. It asks if the patient has specific risk factors for blood clots, or for bleeding from blood thinning medication. Then the system offers a recommended treatment.", "Like any checklist, this one serves as a reminder of proper protocol. Championed most notably by Dr. Atul Gawande in \u201cThe Checklist Manifesto,\u201d checklists have been used for decades to improve flight safety, and have in recent years been applied in a wide range of medical settings. In one trial, a checklist reminding health care workers to do things like wash their hands led to a 66 percent drop in infections within 18 months. Results from a study of surgery patients at eight hospitals showed that post-checklist, complications dropped by 35 percent, and death rates dropped by 47 percent. Checklists plug memory holes and put a safety net under human errors. As Gawande wrote, they \u201cremind us of the minimum necessary steps.\u201d", "But implicit gender bias isn\u2019t about forgetting, it\u2019s about making assumptions. And this is where the Hopkins checklist makes a difference. In spelling out the specific criteria for determining a treatment plan and then recommending one, the checklist interrupts bias in two important ways.", "First, it disentangles the thinking that goes into a medical decision. Typically, clinicians aggregate relevant patient information and use their judgment to arrive at the best course of action. The Hopkins checklist disaggregates that decision into its constituent parts. In a sense, the Hopkins checklist puts the decision about blood clot prevention through a prism, separating out and clarifying the sub-decisions the way a prism separates white light into its rainbow colors. In illuminating each step, the checklist interrupts habitual biases, preventing them from corrupting the decision-making process.", "Second, the checklist reduces reliance on human judgment. \u201cThe decision support tool makes it very cut and dry \u2014 the decision isn\u2019t, \u2018Hey, what do you think you should do?\u2019 The decision is \u2014 click, click, click, here\u2019s what the computer says to do,\u201d Haut said.", "There are, of course, limitations to the uses of checklists. One of the biggest is that doctors may resist using them because it can feel like they are being asked to defer to the wisdom of a machine instead of relying on their long training. Of course, checklists cannot replace doctors\u2019 judgment. But they can, in many situations, improve it.", "It all hinges on how such checklists are put in place. While studies of the practice have pointed to remarkable outcomes, real-world results haven\u2019t always measured up. Why? In many cases, the checklists haven\u2019t been used as designed. In a review of 7,000 surgical procedures, researchers at Imperial College London found that while checklists were used 97 percent of the time, they were completed only 62 percent of the time. (An incomplete checklist defeats the purpose.)", "Interviews with more than 100 staff members at 10 British National Health Service hospitals revealed that some providers opt out because they\u2019re not convinced of the checklist\u2019s utility. Others feel they haven\u2019t been adequately consulted, and the checklist is just another irritating dictum from on high. Yet others felt the checklist wasn\u2019t correctly tailored for a specific scenario.", "But, crucially, these checklists were all optional. The Hopkins checklist was mandatory. Clinicians can override its recommendation, but they can\u2019t opt out of participating. \u201cThese passive approaches don\u2019t seem to work,\u201d Haut said. \u201cHanding out laminated cards, education, reminding people \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work as well.\u201d", "If done correctly, however, the checklist approach could reduce biased treatment for myriad patient backgrounds and conditions. (Studies have shown that African-American and Hispanic patients also receive lower quality health care compared with white patients.)", "The checklist principle could be used in other fields as well. Indeed, structuring decision-making in order to root out bias is already gaining traction in business \u2014 companies like Google and Slack have begun to use structured interviews to avoid discrimination in hiring. Instead of allowing interviews to be free-form, guided by the interviewer\u2019s own judgments, these companies use the same interview techniques and questions for each candidate. Just as every Hopkins patient is assessed for the same blood clot risk factors, every job candidate is assessed the same way. This ensures fairer interviews.", "The Hopkins blood clot prevention checklist has been enormously successful \u2014 after the intervention, the incidents of potentially preventable blood clots in medical patients dropped to zero. The checklist is now the standard of care throughout Johns Hopkins Hospital. Any patient who enters the hospital \u2014 for a birth, brain surgery, pneumonia, even psychiatric treatment \u2014 is assessed for blood clot prevention. That means 50,000 patients a year are receiving treatment that isn\u2019t biased by their gender (or race, or any other factor). Hundreds of thousands of patients have benefited since the checklist was put into place in 2008.", "Given the chances of clot-related deaths, that\u2019s dozens more women\u2019s lives saved, and dozens of families who didn\u2019t lose a mother, sister, grandmother or daughter.

Uber decided it was too hard to compete in China, so it sold to its larger competitor there for a 17.5 percent stake in the combined company.

They are also eager to reciprocate when the tables are turned.", "Children high on the insecure anxious end of the spectrum get upset when caregivers leave and may go to them when they return. But these children aren\u2019t easily soothed, usually because the caregiver has proved to be an unreliable source of comfort in the past. They may kick and arch their back as if they are angry. As adults, they tend to obsess about their relationships and may be overly dramatic in order to get attention. They may hound romantic interests instead of taking it slow.", "Insecure avoidant children don\u2019t register distress when their caregivers leave (although their stress hormones and heart rate may be sky high) and they don\u2019t show much interest when caregivers return, because they are used to being ignored or rebuffed. Alternatively, a parent may have smothered them with too much attention. Insecure avoidant adults tend to have trouble with intimacy and are more likely to leave relationships, particularly if they are going well. They may not return calls and resist talking about their feelings.", "Finally, insecure disorganized children and adults display both anxious and avoidant behaviors in an illogical and erratic manner.

According to one recent study, robots are likely to take away parts of tasks, but not entire jobs. People need to learn to work alongside robots.", "Additionally, a big reason to have automated factories in the United States, instead of manufacturing in China, is to have a better grip on quality control and local distribution to major customers. That means jobs in operations management, loading and shipping.

Mr. Trump, who is set to become the nation\u2019s 45th president on Friday, is a master of Twitter, but also in its thrall. Theories of some grand Trump Twitter plot forget that impetuous and aggressive tweeting has been a habit of Mr. Trump\u2019s for years. He famously avoids alcohol; Twitter is his vice. And after eight years of straight-as-an-arrow posts from @BarackObama, equally Twitter-obsessed journalists are transfixed by Mr. Trump\u2019s timeline, too.", "Mr. Trump has always been hooked on recognition.

It\u2019s a remarkable picture of social media restraint for Twitter\u2019s most uninhibited star, and it gives a glimpse at the image Mr. Trump intends to project: devoted family man, tremendous business magnate, friend to Gary Player.", "But Mr. Trump\u2019s dominant posture is reactive, and his real focus is on who follows him. He almost exclusively retweets praise from fans. He tweets about all the credit he deserves (\u201cThank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night\u201d), then waits for more virtual credit to roll in. He brags to journalists about the rate at which likes and retweets hit. He gets high on his own supply.", "Part of the peculiarity of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets is that he tweets like a celebrity, not a politician or a businessman. Even his handle, @realdonaldtrump, suggests his full immersion in the most basic of our celebrity culture. Though he\u2019s preparing to assume the presidency, he tweets like a Hollywood social climber \u2014 he fans celebrity feuds with Graydon Carter (\u201cno talent\u201d) and Meryl Streep (\u201cover-rated\u201d) and posts product endorsements (\u201cBuy L.

As Kim Kardashian once said, the secret to social media dominance is authenticity and consistency. Mr. Trump\u2019s projection of realness relies on him being reliably self-aggrandizing and wildly inappropriate. That may seem like a liability for the leader of the free world, but it\u2019s an asset in the low-culture celebrity roles that have led him to this moment: reality TV boss, Howard Stern guest, pro-wrestling heel.", "Eight years ago, Barack Obama was the social media wonder headed to the White House, and his tech savvy was heralded as a bright light for democracy. The tweets he posts to @POTUS never seem impulsive; they seem made for posterity. Even his jokes are calculated to be minimally offensive and maximally educational. When the NASA rover Curiosity carried Mr. Obama\u2019s signature to the surface of Mars, Mr. Obama responded in the form of a dad joke: \u201cThat is out of this world.\u201d", "If Mr. Obama came to power in a time of great optimism for Twitter, Mr. Trump lords over a waning platform. What was once a hopeful place for global connection and resistance has become a site for coordinating harassment campaigns, connecting with white supremacists and accelerating unverified and sometimes dangerous rumors. Its growth has slumped and its stock price has stagnated.", "But the place suits Mr. Trump\u2019s purposes fine. For the guy who\u2019s all about appearances, Twitter provides the veneer of populist connection without the hassle of accountability. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming press secretary, has suggested that Twitter town halls and Reddit forums may replace some typical presidential press interactions, where he can easily make himself available to anonymous fans instead of the scrutiny of the press. The social media platforms that were once heralded as democratic tools could also be used to undermine democratic norms.", "All of this works because one group is as intoxicated by Twitter as Mr. Trump is: journalists. It\u2019s hard to explain to a normal person \u2014 one of the 79 percent of American adults who don\u2019t use Twitter \u2014 why the platform mesmerizes the news media. Its all-powerful search function means you can conjure material on any kind of news topic \u2014 or just spend your time searching for your own name. Reporters still crave the ego rush of a published byline, but that pales in comparison to the animated feedback loop that Twitter offers. The more time you spend, and the more tweets you send, the bigger your following becomes. But Twitter provides little actual reach \u2014 compared with Facebook or Google, it hardly drives any traffic to articles. It\u2019s like a video game for professional validation.", "Mr. Trump expertly exploits journalists\u2019 unwavering attention to their Twitter feeds, their competitive spirit and their ingrained journalistic conventions \u2014 chiefly, that what the president says is inherently newsworthy. As a developer and reality show star, he lobbied the news media for coverage. Now journalists feel obligated to pay attention to him. Mr. Trump overwhelms the media with boatloads of what was once a rare commodity: access. He creates impressions faster than journalists can check them.

Her arch prose style recalled the anomie of \u201cThe Andy Warhol Diaries,\u201d the deadpan exposition of \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d and the girl-speak pioneered by the staff of Sassy, the teenage magazine edited by Ms. Pratt that was published from 1988 to 1996.", "Ms. Marnell turned the tropes of women\u2019s magazine writing upside down, with stories like \u201cThe Art of Crack-tractiveness: How to Look and Feel Hot on No Sleep,\u201d which offered tips like \u201cBrush your teeth!\u201d along with a how-to guide to real beauty products for fellow partyers who might, like Ms. Marnell, have spent the night in a warehouse, as she wrote, with a \u201cbunch of U.K. dustheads for five straight hours.\u201d", "It was irresistible, and also appalling, and the internet tied itself up in knots debating Ms. Marnell\u2019s honesty, talent, authenticity and narcissism, along with the exploitative and enabling behavior of her many bosses. Naturally, she got a book deal and a half-million dollar advance from Simon & Schuster. That she was able to produce her addiction memoir, \u201cHow to Murder Your Life,\u201d out this week, is a startling feat, given her history of cycling through rehab and psych wards, and her continued prescription drug use. The book is as compelling \u2014 and as problematic \u2014 as her magazine writing: vivid, maddening, heartbreaking, very funny, chaotic and repetitive, as benders are.", "On a recent Tuesday, Ms. Marnell, now 34, welcomed me into her Chinatown apartment, a one-bedroom overlooking the on-ramp to the Manhattan Bridge. The place, which she rented a year and a half ago, was decorated with stacks of addiction memoirs; a sheepskin rug upon which was laid a strand of blue Christmas lights aglow; a gray wool sofa; a few framed Takashi Murakami prints; and a poster of Harry Styles of the pop boy band One Direction.", "Birdlike and delicate-looking, Ms. Marnell wore bell-bottom jeans, a pink tank top and a waist-length wig in candy colors, one of a sizable collection she has amassed since her hair fell out a few years ago, she isn\u2019t quite sure why. She ordered three cups of coffee from a nearby deli, smoked a Marlboro Light very quickly, blowing the smoke out of the sliding glass windows that open to a fire escape, and then poured herself a glass of white wine.", "The following interview has been edited and condensed.", "I\u2019ve just finished reading your book, which is harrowing, so I\u2019m a little shaken.", "Dude, that was four years ago.

That\u2019s really true. People think of addicts as being out of control, and they really are. But I\u2019m also a control freak. I want to control everything with a pill, from my appetite to sleeping.", "Do you feel you\u2019ve been exploited by the magazines you worked for?", "No. Addicts exploit people. I exploited every opportunity. I have my whole life. The thing about addiction, everyone is asking, Don\u2019t you think addiction books are tired? But I think addiction is as human an experience as anything, like heartbreak. It\u2019s like any relationship, a marriage, a divorce, it\u2019s a relationship and it\u2019s human.

But in the same way, as a doctor, he didn\u2019t think twice about having samples of Zoloft in his home office. And at 12 years old I did steal samples of antidepressants and bring them to school and take them in front of my friends because I wanted to be cool. I think I am hard-wired for addiction. My father is a good man, and a good dad, and so ethical and I manipulated him for years. But this is the problem.

It interests me that women paint their face every day. So I was at an event, and I just smeared it.", "On purpose?", "Yes. The reason it\u2019s used over and over is because I never showed up for that many things. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed.

Most concerning is the glaring absence of material from his earlier years in public office, in the 1980s and 1990s, when he served as Alabama\u2019s top federal prosecutor and then as the state\u2019s attorney general. The period includes the biggest political embarrassment of his career: the Senate\u2019s rejection, in 1986, of his nomination to a federal judgeship by President Ronald Reagan. It was only the second time in half a century that the judiciary committee turned down a judicial nominee. Why such an extraordinary move? Because testimony from multiple former colleagues of Mr. Sessions suggested he was racist. In one case, Mr. Sessions referred to the American Civil Liberties Union and the N.A.A.C.P. as \u201cun-American\u201d for \u201ctrying to force civil rights down the throats of people.\u201d (Mr. Sessions made no mention of the failed nomination in his response to the judiciary committee questionnaire, which specifically asks for that information.)", "It\u2019s bad enough that Mr. Sessions is trying to hide from the American people the things he said and did from that era. Even worse, he\u2019s now recasting himself as a civil-rights hero who \u201cpersonally\u201d litigated several major voting rights and desegregation cases \u2014 a myth that Justice Department lawyers who dealt with him at the time have been quick to debunk, saying he \u201chad no substantive involvement in any of them.\u201d", "Despite Mr. Sessions\u2019s insultingly incomplete responses to the committee, the burden remains on him to show he is fit to serve in such an influential post. His failure to do so may not deter Republicans, who appear to care only about getting their friend and colleague confirmed quickly. In contrast, when the Democrats controlled the Senate in 2009, they agreed to delay confirmation hearings for Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Eric Holder Jr.", "This sets up the first big test of Democrats\u2019 willingness to push back against Mr. Trump\u2019s radical cabinet picks. Dianne Feinstein, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, needs to take the lead in ensuring that Americans know as much as possible about the man who would be the nation\u2019s top law-enforcement official. The attorney general is too important an office, and Mr. Sessions\u2019s views are too extreme \u2014 as Republicans themselves saw 30 years ago \u2014 to allow his nomination to sail through without a fight."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/learning/lesson-plans/evaluating-sources-in-a-post-truth-world-ideas-for-teaching-and-learning-about-fake-news.html": ["Back in 2015, when we published our lesson plan Fake News vs. Real News: Determining the Reliability of Sources, we had no way of knowing that, a year later, the Oxford Dictionaries would declare \u201cpost-truth\u201d the 2016 word of the year; that fake news would play a role in the 2016 presidential election; that it would cause real violence; and that the president-elect of the United States would use the term to condemn mainstream media outlets he opposes.", "Back then, to convince teachers that the skill was important, we quoted Peter Adams of the News Literacy Project on the \u201cdigital na\u00efvet\u00e9\u201d of the \u201cdigital natives\u201d we teach.

It was Election Day to choose the leadership of Mexico\u2019s right-wing Partido Acci\u00f3n Nacional, or PAN, and Lagunes, a former federal congresswoman, was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city. The emails seemed harmless, at least at first. One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague. It asked her to download and review a document. Lagunes clicked on the link, but it seemed to be broken, so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again. Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account. Meanwhile, she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies, who claimed that they had received emails from Lagunes\u2019s account that she did not remember sending.", "Now Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o\u2019clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. \u201cI did not send you an email,\u201d he insisted. A consultant with the campaign \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates \u2014 overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked.", "In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla \u2014 a two-hour drive southeast from Mexico City \u2014 were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla\u2019s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico\u2019s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto\u2019s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle\u2019s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state \u2014 including members of his own party \u2014 under control. \u201cIn the beginning, the governor was low-profile and respectful,\u201d Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. \u201cWhen he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats.\u201d", "This race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico\u2019s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor\u2019s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero\u2019s campaign manager said that Cordero\u2019s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. \u201cTheir strategy is clear from the outset,\u201d he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. \u201c\u2009\u2018If I win, good. If not, I was cheated.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "After Lagunes\u2019s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed \u201cthe bunker.\u201d All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers\u2019 names and phone numbers \u2014 widely circulated by email within the campaign \u2014 and begun to intimidate them.", "\u201cThe day before,\u201d the consultant told me, the field network was \u201cmotivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt.\u201d", "According to another worker on Cordero\u2019s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: \u201cWe know who you are. If you don\u2019t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity.\u201d The worker added: \u201cIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime.\u201d", "Madero won the election, with 57 percent of the 162,792 votes cast over all. In Puebla, his margin was substantially larger, roughly 74 percent. Cordero\u2019s team decided not to contest the result. They had suspicions about how they were hacked. But it would be another year before any evidence emerged. Their political enemies, leaked documents seemed to show, had built a spying operation using software made by an Italian firm called Hacking Team \u2014 just one of many private companies that, largely below public notice, have sprung up to aid governments in surveilling the private lives of individual citizens. The industry claims that its products comply with local laws and are used to fight crime and terror. But in many countries around the world, these tools have proved to be equally adept at political espionage.", "On average, an American office worker sends and receives roughly 120 emails per day, a number that grows with each passing year. The ubiquity and utility of email has turned it into a fine-grained record of our day-to-day lives, rich with mundane and potentially embarrassing details, stored in a perpetual archive, accessible from anywhere on earth and protected, in some cases, by nothing more than a single password. In the case of Violeta Lagunes, her email login represented a point of vulnerability, a seam where the digital walls protecting her campaign were at the mercy of her human judgment \u2014 specifically, whether she could determine if a message from an apparently reputable source was real or fake. Nearly two years later, John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, was faced with a similar judgment call. An email warned him that someone in Ukraine had tried to access his Gmail account and asked him to click on a button and reset his password. His senior adviser forwarded the email to one of the campaign\u2019s technology experts. \u201cThis is a legitimate email,\u201d he replied, in what the expert later would clarify was a simple typing error on his part; he meant to say it was not legitimate. \u201cThe gmail one is REAL,\u201d the senior adviser wrote to Podesta and another aide.", "And so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as \u201cspear phishing.\u201d It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices, credit-card bills and confidential memos; it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Amazon \u2014 and even access to company servers and internet domains.", "The Podesta and Lagunes episodes are far from the only cases in which hackers have used information from stolen emails as a weapon against an entire institution. The 2009 \u201cClimategate\u201d incident, which exposed troves of emails from prominent climate researchers, began when hackers remotely broke into servers at a British university with the help of illicitly obtained passwords. The 2014 hack of internal Sony files, which American officials attributed to the North Korean government, began with a series of spear-phishing emails that attackers then used to dig deeper into Sony\u2019s servers. Each hack yielded the most private thoughts and deeds from the members of each respective organization: their blunt insults, their quashed dissents, their half-baked plans, their smarmy flattery, all chronicled in time down to the hundredth of the second when the author clicked \u201csend.\u201d In an earlier era, the hackers might have had to engage in riskier behavior, like bribery or burglary. Now, in many cases, all they had to do was send along a link.", "The White House, C.I.A. and F.B.I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta\u2019s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A subscription-based website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling so-called ethical malware, including Milan-based Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls; a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a 41-country pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. \u201cThe technology is morally neutral,\u201d says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. \u201cThe same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to keep track of whomever they don\u2019t like.\u201d", "Hacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R.C.S., can be licensed for as little as $200,000 a year \u2014 well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target\u2019s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N.S.A.\u2019s best-known programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R.C.S. acquires it at the source, right off a target\u2019s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a Watergate-style break-in.", "The United States government is almost certainly the world\u2019s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal law-enforcement agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F.B.I., beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F.B.I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700,000; the D.E.A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia.", "Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world\u2019s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United States-designated state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the three-year relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F.S.B., one of Russia\u2019s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451,000 euros to license the Remote Control System.", "Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit \u201cgross human-rights abuses\u201d and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team\u2019s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. \u201cWe sell to official, governmental LEAs\u201d \u2014 law-enforcement agencies \u2014 \u201cand security agencies ONLY,\u201d Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. \u201cIf one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,\u201d one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. \u201cHacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor.\u201d", "When asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it \u201cdoes not comment on confidential business dealings.\u201d Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because \u201cthe Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime\u201d and Sudan \u201cbecause of concerns about the country\u2019s ability to use the system in accordance with the H.T. contract.\u201d) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client.", "Until recently, most of what was known about the world of private surveillance companies was a matter of hearsay and speculation. Industry players kept a low profile, operating discreetly from rented offices and meeting potential customers in person a few times a year at carefully screened trade shows. This is why it was so notable when, in July 2015, an unusual tweet appeared in Hacking Team\u2019s Twitter feed. \u201cSince we have nothing to hide,\u201d it read, \u201cwe\u2019re publishing all our emails, files and source code.\u201d Then came another tweet, with links to a downloadable file called Hacked Team. The file was huge, 420 gigabytes of material scraped from Hacking Team\u2019s internal servers. Inside were 33 folders containing the company\u2019s contracts, payroll documents, invoices, legal memos, customer-support records and a five-year cache of email correspondence from the chief executive on down.", "Hacking Team had itself been hacked. WikiLeaks pounced on the breach and quickly uploaded the emails into a searchable database. Anyone with an internet connection could now read the chief executive joking about how his company was in the business of selling \u201cthe evilest technology on earth.\u201d You could browse Hacking Team\u2019s source code, including one line using \u201cbomb_blueprints.pdf\u201d as a placeholder for files that might be found on a target\u2019s device. On Reddit, an online peanut gallery formed around the time-wasting online habits of one Hacking Team engineer and his own notably weak passwords \u2014 HTPassword!, P4ssword, Passw0rd.", "But the most damaging exposures in the leak by far were Hacking Team\u2019s client list and the names of some of the clients\u2019 targets. In South Korea, newspapers focused on evidence suggesting that Hacking Team\u2019s software had helped the nation\u2019s intelligence service rig an election; after the leak, one agent who had reportedly used the system there committed suicide. In Ecuador, a magazine found an email with seven phone numbers that the government appeared to have targeted with the R.C.S. Three belonged to lawmakers; a fourth to the mayor of Quito; all four were members of the opposition party.", "With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former television-news anchor, he exudes square-jawed credibility. \u201cIf you disagree with someone on the internet,\u201d he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to have a public-policy debate. Just go destroy them.\u201d", "A couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team\u2019s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company\u2019s software were Rabe; Philippe Vinci, a company vice president; and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target\u2019s computer: images from built-in cameras, sound from built-in mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called \u201cline of events\u201d and \u201cline of actions,\u201d assembled the information into chronological order.", "Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or \u201cbad guy,\u201d turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania.", "There are three methods, Scarafile explained, for getting the Remote Control System onto a target\u2019s device. Customers can gain physical access to the device and then infect it with a USB stick or memory card. They can beam the R.C.S. in over a Wi-Fi network. Or they can send the customer an email and get him to click on an infected attachment \u2014 usually a file from a brand-name program like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Scarafile did not mention a fourth method, one described by Hacking Team\u2019s critics and referred to in its internal emails: the installation of the R.C.S. through a more elaborate process called \u201cnetwork injection,\u201d which is said to involve pinpointing the target\u2019s exact location on the internet, observing the person as he orders up, say, a YouTube cat video, and then serving up a doctored version of the same page, one with the desired cat video playing in the foreground \u2014 YouTube logo and all \u2014 as the R.C.S. discreetly rolls in past the digital gates.", "Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an \u201cagent,\u201d then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team\u2019s product to spy on him.", "For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as \u201ca bit of social engineering.\u201d Using the customer\u2019s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target\u2019s computer and double-clicked on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said, \u201cthis system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System.\u201d It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out.", "On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named \u201cJimmy Page ... head of the terrorist cell.\u201d Using Jimmy Page\u2019s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page\u2019s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page\u2019s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page\u2019s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to \u201ckill David Vincenzetti.\u201d R.C.S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work.", "\u201cI don\u2019t like the words \u2018inject\u2019 and \u2018infect,\u2019\u2009\u201d Vinci, the vice president, said. \u201cR.C.S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?\u201d", "Rabe had told me that Vincenzetti was \u201ca fighter,\u201d and his combative side was apparent from a collage of magazine clippings and printouts taped to the wall beside his desk \u2014 a sort of mood board, like those used in the advertising industry to gather inspiration before the unveiling of a new brand. Vincenzetti\u2019s mood board, though, wasn\u2019t about sneakers or cola. It was about the global struggle for power, which he seemed to envision as one big conflict, a battle between the good guys and the bad guys. On the good side was a photo of the bell that aspiring Navy SEALs can ring should they want to quit the program during Hell Week, and a quote from another entrepreneur that \u201cbusiness is war.\u201d On the bad side, Vincenzetti had taped up a satellite image showing one of the hottest zones of international tension, the artificial islands rising in the South China Sea, a line of terrestrial pawns advancing China\u2019s sphere of influence. Beside it was a chart about Iran, depicting how the country could continue to advance its nuclear program despite the recent American-led deal.", "\u201cI think the Iran deal is just terrible,\u201d Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, \u201cOh, it\u2019s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful.\u201d", "\u201cThat is not an official company position,\u201d Rabe interjected.", "Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type \u2014 a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small, heavy-lidded eyes can make him seem sleepily blas\u00e9. On the morning we met at Hacking Team\u2019s offices, he wore jeans, a navy-blue cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water.", "\u201cIf I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is a door, and there are two windows.\u201d He pressed his hands against the glass panes. \u201cThe perimeter is the first thing you must secure,\u201d he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. \u201cIf you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively.\u201d", "In the mid-1980s, Vincenzetti\u2019s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a Pac-Man clone, a Tron lightcycle-style game and a text-based adventure game. As a computer-science student at the University of Milan in the \u201990s, he became fascinated by cryptography; he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university\u2019s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when \u201ceverything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker.\u201d", "Vincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other high-level criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with offensive-hacking vendors, part of an emerging arms race over consumer-grade encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team\u2019s first non-European client, signed on in 2008. The company\u2019s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring.", "By then, Hacking Team had entered a growth phase, its business driven in part by demand among third-world governments for first-world surveillance tools. According to two former employees, the company held talks with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s chief security officer, who wanted to build a countrywide bulk-collection scheme that could be embedded in every Libyan cellphone. (Rabe would not confirm or deny that this meeting occurred, and added: \u201cThe company often receives requests to provide services that it does not have available or would sell.\u201d) The United Nations, which prohibits the export of \u201celectronic weaponry\u201d to Sudan, has investigated Hacking Team\u2019s activities there. Nineteen members of the Italian Parliament signed a petition raising the question of whether the Egyptian government might have used the R.C.S. to track Giulio Regeni, a 28-year-old Italian student who appears to have been under government surveillance and whose mutilated body turned up on the side of a road in Egypt last year. Hacking Team\u2019s software has not been connected to the case, but the company has done business with the current Egyptian regime. As part of the controversy, the Italian government temporarily revoked Hacking Team\u2019s global export license, so that for several months the company had to file a separate application for each of its customers outside the European Union. (When I brought up the Regeni case with Rabe, he called the dead student \u201cthis Italian national who got himself killed in Egypt.\u201d He cited Hacking Team\u2019s official policy \u2014 the company neither knows nor desires to know the identities of the people its customers choose to target. \u201cThere is no evidence that Hacking Team\u2019s software had anything to do with Regeni\u2019s demise,\u201d Rabe said.)", "All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and human-rights groups, looking for \u201cobjective evidence or credible concerns\u201d that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team\u2019s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with election-related content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team support-staff members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded \u201cexploit,\u201d turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers \u201care not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,\u201d i.e., a support technician, \u201cwould have seen these files and known what was going on. ... I think that\u2019s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident.\u201d", "Hacking Team\u2019s most persistent critic is Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. Before the Hacked Team leak, Citizen Lab documented cases in which Hacking Team software turned up on the devices of activists in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, as well as an Ethiopian-American journalist in Alexandria, Va. Ronald Deibert, Citizen Lab\u2019s director, told me that Hacking Team \u201cis a company that appears to have no internal controls on abuse of its products.\u201d When I asked Vincenzetti about this, he said that Citizen Lab was motivated by money, noting that the group won a million-dollar grant a week after publishing a report on Hacking Team\u2019s sales to Ethiopia. \u201cTheir identity,\u201d he said, \u201cis: \u2018I am the defender of free speech, I am the defender of liberty and democracy.\u2019 O.K. So am I. So is every rational guy.\u201d If Citizen Lab really cared about good and evil, he said, it would be fighting China and Iran.", "Almost immediately after the Hacked Team documents went online, they were being pored over by R3D, a Mexico City-based civil-liberties group. Luis Fernando Garc\u00eda, R3D\u2019s director, says that intimidation and online surveillance have increased under Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency, and he took notice when Citizen Lab, in 2014, released a report that traced a chain of servers associated with Hacking Team that routed data through Hong Kong, London, Amsterdam and Atlanta before terminating somewhere inside Mexico. Exactly who was on the receiving end of the traffic and what they were doing with it was unknown at the time, but now R3D\u2019s team recognized that this could be their chance to find out.", "Shortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government \u2014 that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast \u2014 had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor\u2019s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small online-news collective there. The site\u2019s name translates to \u201cB Side,\u201d as in the back of a hit single \u2014 symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold.", "Lado B\u2019s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla\u2019s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle\u2019s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple \u201csecurity arches,\u201d highway-spanning structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and X-rays, and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the Puebla-state website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a public-records request about them, the government\u2019s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle\u2019s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic break-ins of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims\u2019 laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians.", "As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team\u2019s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account \u2014 soporteuiamx@gmail.com \u2014 that also appears in many of Hacking Team\u2019s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client\u2019s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor.", "Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. \u201cBefore, we had been talking about ghosts,\u201d Aroche told me. \u201cNow, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors.\u201d", "More than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from Puebla\u2019s colonial days. The only suggestion of Lado B\u2019s presence was a small sticker on the window. Inside, Aroche was thumbing through an envelope of documents that he had wrung out of the state government. Two redacted contracts signed by Puebla officials showed an arrangement between the state government and a company called Sym Servicios Integrales, which Aroche\u2019s reporting had identified as an intermediary for Hacking Team. The details of what had been purchased were redacted. \u201cThese contracts demonstrate that the Puebla government had a commercial relationship with this company,\u201d Aroche said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re a little bit stained \u2014 I dropped some coffee on them.\u201d (Sym Servicios Integrales says it \u201cnever sold H.T. technology to the state of Puebla.\u201d)", "In a brief written statement from Sagrario Conde Valerio, a spokeswoman, the government of Puebla denied allegations of spying and claimed that \u201cno relationship exists nor has ever existed between the government of Puebla and the company \u2018Hacking Team.\u2019\u2009\u201d The government declined to respond further to a list of questions.", "But a former official from Moreno Valle\u2019s administration claimed to me that more than $1 million was being diverted from the state budget each year to fund the political-espionage unit. Documents from the Hacked Team archive indicate that Hacking Team received an order from the government of Puebla for 415,000 euros in the spring of 2013, and that Hacking Team booked hotel rooms for three of its associates who traveled to Puebla in May of that year.", "Some of the R.C.S. training, I was told, took place in a green building on a residential street. When I visited the purported site this fall, lettering above the door said that the building was once a school. Now it had bars across the door and mirrored windows. Neighbors told me it had been abandoned for several months. \u201cPeople would come and go,\u201d one woman said. \u201cThey were very secretive. They would drop off equipment, take away equipment. Then one day, about a year ago, they came and took everything away and left.\u201d Another neighbor said that he often saw a state-police car parked in front of the house and a man with a limp entering and leaving \u2014 a former Mexican intelligence agent, according to someone who was present during the Hacking Team training.", "Mexico is Hacking Team\u2019s biggest export market, accounting for nearly six million euros in sales, according to leaked documents. Ostensibly, the Remote Control System is intended for fighting criminals and drug traffickers there. (\u201cThere have been reports that the software was used in the apprehension of Chapo Guzman,\u201d Rabe told me, referring to the Mexican drug lord. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm it.\u201d) The files indicate that at least seven other Mexican state governments were Hacking Team clients, but because they did not use email to the same extent as Puebla, their activities are harder to track. Multiple former Hacking Team employees told me that abuses of the software were not limited to Puebla. One former employee described having the system set up inside a mayor\u2019s office.", "Katitza Rodr\u00edguez, international-rights director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Mexican law allows for interception of communication, like the wiretapping of phone lines, but it does not grant precise legal authority to use new, powerful invasive tools like those created by Hacking Team. And she argues that it is much more dangerous in Mexico than in other Western countries, where checks and balances are stronger. \u201cThis is much more intrusive than the interception of a phone call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not only listening; they are taking over your laptop. Mexico needs to have a full debate in Congress about what legal safeguards are needed for this kind of surveillance or if the government should be using it at all.\u201d", "The Hacked Team files indicate that in mid-2015, Hacking Team opened an American subsidiary and leased office space in Reston, Va., a 20-minute drive from the C.I.A.\u2019s headquarters. The company drew up a \u201cU.S. action plan,\u201d calling for a significant North American expansion, with new hires and rounds of pitches to the Department of Justice, the United States military and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Hacking Team was also targeting another potentially lucrative market: American state and local governments. It pitched the R.C.S. to law-enforcement agencies in San Bernardino, Calif.; Washington; New York; Fort Lauderdale; and Orlando. In a risk assessment commissioned by the company, lawyers advised that such sales were probably legal, so long as the product was provided \u201cat a distance\u201d from actual investigations and used \u201cin the normal course of government operations.\u201d", "American expansion by companies like Hacking Team may not face much resistance from the federal government, which is becoming more accepting of electronic surveillance as part of normal police work. Last year, the Justice Department successfully changed the rules of criminal procedure, making it easier for federal agents to hack into multiple computers with a single warrant. Senator Steve Daines of Montana, who tried to block the change, complained that it gives \u201cunlimited power for unlimited hacking.\u201d In a 2014 address, now referred to in cybersecurity circles as his \u201cGoing Dark\u201d speech, the F.B.I.\u2019s director, James Comey, argued that the encryption built into Apple products posed a threat to public safety \u2014 enabling not only terrorism but also drug trafficking, child abuse and hit-and-runs. Instead of \u201ca safe that can\u2019t be cracked,\u201d Comey wanted technology companies to lend him the combination. \u201cThe law hasn\u2019t kept pace with technology, and this disconnect has created a significant public-safety problem,\u201d Comey said. \u201cWe call it \u2018going dark.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "As the United States government has argued for weaker protections around personal communications, American businesses have been spreading more powerful surveillance tools around the world. Many foreign law-enforcement agencies already buy electronic-surveillance products from SS8 \u2014 a company backed by the storied venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers \u2014 as well as from the Harris Corporation, a $13 billion company based in Florida and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 25 American police departments have used Harris\u2019s Stingray device, which mimics cellphone towers and can intercept cellphone calls within 200 meters. All known sales of Stingrays to local law enforcement have been authorized by the F.B.I., which has since fought in court to keep those sales secret. In Baltimore alone, Stingrays have been used more than 4,000 times, in routine drug investigations. Much less is known about another Harris product, the advanced Hailstorm, which is also sold to local police departments. Hailstorm is reportedly capable of implanting malware that can take control of a targeted phone, much like Hacking Team\u2019s R.C.S.", "The Hacked Team documents that offer the most revealing view of the company\u2019s ethos happen to be the most public ones. For years, as often as two or three times a day, Vincenzetti sent mass emails to hundreds of his business contacts. The recipients included numerous members of the United States military and intelligence community, as well as government employees from the city of Cincinnati and the Internal Revenue Service. In these messages, Vincenzetti often addresses this audience collectively as \u201cgents.\u201d The news he cites is a reminder of how the geopolitical winds have been blowing in favor of Hacking Team and other self-described allies of law and order. In Vincenzetti\u2019s world, the system is always, as George Tenet famously said about pre-Sept. 11 intelligence, \u201cblinking red\u201d: the imploding Middle East; a restive, nuclear-armed Russia; battalions of ISIS-trained jihadis roaming around Europe with their encrypted thumb drives and dark-web expertise. Against this backdrop of ever-increasing danger, concerns about human rights are na\u00efve at best.", "Vincenzetti\u2019s emails vividly exploit this sense of danger and alarm. He writes about shadowy gangs of Iranian hackers using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag to inject malware into French laptops. He celebrates the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, a.k.a. the Dread Pirate Roberts, creator of the Silk Road website. After the arrests of two Uzbek men in Brooklyn for telling informants that they wanted to join up with ISIS, Vincenzetti writes of \u201ca very serious terrorist plot on American soil foiled.\u201d", "He went on to tap out this sales pitch:", "The following day, he gave a few more hints:", "The tone of Vincenzetti\u2019s sales patter was strangely upbeat, especially considering his dire forecasts. It was almost as if he were in the business of selling microwave ovens or sandwiches, not tools through which the private lives of criminals (and whoever else) could be fully laid bare.", "Vincenzetti\u2019s unstated equation \u2014 privacy is secrecy, and secrecy is terrorism \u2014 is less controversial than it might appear.

Andrew M. Cuomo, who promised it would \u201csupercharge\u201d economic development \u2014 had produced just 408 jobs in its first two years, even as its marketing price tag rose past $53 million.", "By fall, Start-Up was under outright attack, as state legislators held a hearing to ask why there had been so little return on the state\u2019s investment.

Instead of allowing businesses of any size to apply, the program will now be open only to what most people would define as start-ups \u2014 small companies in their formative stages \u2014 in a move aimed at encouraging the next Google or Facebook to hatch in New York State.", "Currently, businesses are required to create at least one new job each year to remain in the program, which exempts companies operating in certain tax-free zones from all taxes for up to a decade; under the new proposal, the requirement would fall to creating one new job in the first five years the company is in the program.", "Empire State Development, the state agency that oversees the program as well as the governor\u2019s other economic development efforts, will be required to update the public on the initiative, as well as a related program known as Empire Jobs, once a year.", "Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not budged from his support for Start-Up, and the state insisted this week that the program would produce more than 4,000 new jobs over the next several years. State officials say the lower requirement for yearly job creation should allow companies to focus on growing rather than on hitting specific job targets, and argue that the companies will generate so little revenue at first that any taxes the state would pass up in exchange would be negligible.", "\u201dThis program remains in place and the proposed adjustments, which are based on feedback from businesses, will help it reach its full potential,\u201d Jason Conwall, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to the model \u2014 innovative academia-business partnerships coupled with performance-based, tax-free incentives.\u201d", "The program will still require young businesses to move to tax-free zones, most of them near universities, in the hope that academic centers, with their students, research and equipment, will help seed economic growth. Under the new proposal, companies that add enough jobs during the tax-free period can qualify for even more tax benefits in later years under a sibling program called Excelsior Jobs, which officials hope will induce successful companies to stay in New York as they grow.", "The proposed changes to Start-Up were first noted by the Empire Center for Public Policy, a fiscally conservative watchdog group that has repeatedly blasted the program as too lightweight to bear any comparison to the hype Mr. Cuomo showered on it.", "\u201cIt was never the scale to be a really transformative program,\u201d said E.

Instead, he said, he wants to change the world.", "When he took a sabbatical from Stanford six years ago and pondered what big problem he could help solve, he zeroed in on the idea of reducing the consumption of meat.", "Never mind the business of killing billions of animals for food.

Back at Momofuku Nishi, Mr. Motz delivered his verdict.", "\u201cNo, I\u2019m very sorry, but this does not taste like a hamburger,\u201d he said. \u201cIt tastes like a fabrication of beef, not a real animal.\u201d", "Mr. Motz wasn\u2019t totally dismissive. The Impossible Burger almost looked the part, and the patty had a pleasurably salty crust. But it lacked the distinctively greasy mouth feel of a real burger, and the flavor was, in Mr. Motz\u2019s opinion, bland. Not bad compared with a Gardenburger, he said, but not like the real thing either.", "\u201cThis is a big step in the right direction for the veggie burger,\u201d Mr. Motz said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t burped yet.

Roughly 15 months ago, a state judge declared a mistrial in an earlier criminal trial stemming from the collapse of the once-prominent Manhattan law firm in 2012. In that trial, three defendants were on trial. But soon after the mistrial, prosecutors in Manhattan struck a deal with Steven H. Davis, the firm\u2019s former chairman, in which he went along with a deferred prosecution agreement that will result in the dismissal of all criminal charges against him if he complies with terms. That means the trial is down to two defendants: Stephen DiCarmine, Dewey\u2019s former executive director, and Joel Sanders, its former chief financial officer. Prosecutors contend that the men misled investors in a debt offering about the financial strength of the law firm during the financial crisis.

It was 2006, and she was in the lowest reading group in her class. She had been in that group since arriving two years earlier, speaking no English, in Gainesville, a city of 38,000 just northeast of Atlanta\u2019s booming outer suburbs. But being at the bottom went against everything she believed about herself. \u201cI wanted to be with the smart kids,\u201d she recalls. Starting the year before, in second grade, she read every volume of the \u201cMagic Tree House\u201d books in her elementary-school library, a series about two ordinary siblings who climb into their backyard treehouse and time-travel to Pompeii, the Wild West, the ice age, feudal Japan and beyond. \u201cI absolutely loved them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like going on adventures all over the world.\u201d", "It was also the opposite of her own life. Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn\u2019t caring for the children \u2014 there would eventually be seven of them \u2014 and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for after-school lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. \u201cI\u2019d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I\u2019ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,\u201d Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. \u201cI tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,\u201d her mother told me. \u201cIf you have the opportunity to be good, it\u2019s very important to take it.\u201d Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A\u2019s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. \u201cThey rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That\u2019s when I said: \u2018I can make it.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Indira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running long-distance races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. \u201cI wanted to think,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d stay after practice and run and run and run.\u201d", "Indira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn\u2019t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats \u2014 before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn\u2019t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore?", "Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family\u2019s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver\u2019s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver\u2019s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car.", "A police officer arrived and asked for Indira\u2019s mother\u2019s license. When she said she did not have one \u2014 a state crime \u2014 she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira\u2019s mother turned to her and began to cry. \u201cIndira, I don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take me.\u201d Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. \u201cWhen she was being handcuffed, I said: \u2018Mom, everything is going to be O.K.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Indira\u2019s mother was held in Gainesville\u2019s Hall County jail for three days, but that wasn\u2019t the most frightening part for the family. Hall is one of four counties in Georgia that have a formal agreement to report arrests of undocumented immigrants to the Department of Homeland Security, which means that infractions as minor as a burned-out bulb above a license plate can spiral into deportation proceedings. Indira\u2019s mother says that her charge of driving without a license ultimately led to a referral to immigration court and a deportation order instructing her to leave the country within 30 days. She stayed, slipping into the shadows. Every day since, Indira says, she and her siblings have feared that their mother would be deported. It would take only one more traffic stop.", "\u201cThat woke me up,\u201d Indira says. \u201cUntil then, I thought the world was happy.\u201d In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. \u201cIt must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day.\u201d", "Indira has wanted to be a doctor for almost as long as she can remember. When she was 10, her family was shopping for groceries at Sam\u2019s Club, and she spotted a large book about human anatomy. She became so excited about it that her parents bought it for her birthday, even though it was well above her reading level \u2014 and their price range. She began working her way through it, mesmerized, and when she got stuck, her mother would explain whatever had stumped her.", "She was determined to go to college and medical school and fulfill her parents\u2019 interrupted dream. In her junior year, Indira began researching college options. She would be a strong applicant. She was consistently at or near the top of her class; she was on the high-school track and soccer teams; she volunteered over 1,000 hours a year at the local hospital, a record in the history of the teen-volunteer program; and she led her school\u2019s chapter of the Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), which encouraged Latino students \u2014 who made up just over half the district\u2019s population \u2014 to stay in school and graduate.", "She was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them out-of-state tuition at all others \u2014 triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and work-study jobs \u2014 the most common forms of assistance for low-income students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. \u201cThere were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,\u201d she said. \u201cI questioned myself if it was all worth the effort.\u201d All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it.", "At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta\u2019s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20,000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched full-ride private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10,000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the out-of-state tuition rate.", "Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family.", "Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream.US, which was offering undocumented students full four-year scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream.US. \u201cI saw \u2018Congratulations,\u2019\u2009\u201d she remembers, \u201cand I read no more.\u201d", "In late August, Indira made the 11-hour drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus \u2014 a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover\u2019s historic capital area \u2014 she found 33 other \u201copportunity scholars,\u201d just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D.S.U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor.", "In their first month on campus, the opportunity scholars were invited to a welcoming ceremony in the school\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center with Gov. Jack Markell; the Democratic senator Tom Carper; Donald Graham, a founder of TheDream.US; and D.S.U.\u2019s president, Harry Williams. \u201cThis is not just an opportunity for you; it is an opportunity for the state of Delaware,\u201d Markell told them. \u201cIt is sad to see your own home state reject such talent and potential.\u201d He pronounced himself \u201cthrilled that you\u2019re here.\u201d It was the first time many of the students could recall being welcomed anywhere. \u201cWe felt rejection our whole lives from our own states,\u201d Indira said. \u201cWe were here only three weeks, and we already met the governor and the senator. It felt like saying \u2018Haha!\u2019 to Georgia.\u201d", "Of the 34 opportunity scholars enrolled at D.S.U., 28 are from Mexico and one each is from Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru, Gabon, Gambia and Trinidad and Tobago. Their families are a composite portrait of the economic forces that have drawn undocumented immigrants to the nation\u2019s small towns and metropolitan heartland. Their parents work in poultry plants, on factory lines, in warehouses, on construction sites, in restaurants; they clean and paint houses and schools, tend gardens. \u201cThey make everything look perfect for the tourists,\u201d Yulma Lopez, who left Mexico at age 3, said of her parents\u2019 work for a landscaping company in Charleston, S.C. Almost all their parents work illegally, but many pay income taxes, having obtained federal tax-identification numbers. And some, including Indira\u2019s father, have secured temporary federal permission to work and drive lawfully.", "While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3.9 G.P.A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious state-supported boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one low-wage position to the next \u2014 server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant; retail sales consultant for Sprint; customer-service agent for Marriott; pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship; she applied immediately.", "All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an Obama-administration executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a two-year renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver\u2019s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was \u201cliving the American dream.\u201d With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth.", "The starting point for all of their dreams was education, and the quest for it has been central to the experience of undocumented young people since long before Indira and her classmates were born. In the late 1970s, when undocumented immigrants had yet to move in large numbers beyond border states, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to ban them from public schools or charge them tuition. In a landmark decision in Plyler v. Doe in 1982, a narrowly divided Supreme Court struck down the law, finding that undocumented children had a constitutional right to free K-through-12 public education. The opinion blamed a dysfunctional immigration system for creating the crisis by failing to keep out undocumented immigrants or provide them a path to citizenship. \u201cAlready disadvantaged as a result of poverty, lack of English-speaking ability and undeniable racial prejudices, these children, without an education, will become permanently locked into the lowest socioeconomic class,\u201d Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority, quoting the district-court opinion. The case also introduced the argument that undocumented children were legally blameless, unlike their parents: \u201cThe classification at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for education afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents,\u201d Justice Lewis Powell wrote in a concurring opinion.", "Undocumented children poured into the nation\u2019s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2.1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force.", "In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay in-state college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. \u201cSomething magical happened when those kids told their stories,\u201d says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. \u201cIt was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children\u2019s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats.\u201d The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay in-state tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump \u2014 Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas.", "In many of those states, however, the once-bipartisan issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of in-state tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump\u2019s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay in-state tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma \u2014 or Massachusetts, for that matter \u2014 should have the same right. \u201cHow much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?\u201d Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring class-action lawsuits against in-state tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases.", "The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for law-abiding families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing \u201camnesty\u201d for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama \u2014 including sit-ins and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices \u2014 to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken on-the-books jobs, received driver\u2019s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. \u201cDACAmented,\u201d many have called themselves.", "Even in states where they pay in-state tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately low-income and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass.", "In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream.US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4,000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family; Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan; Bill and Melinda Gates; the hedge-fund executive William Ackman; and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream.US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them in-state tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the opportunity-scholarship program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly in-state tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State \u2014 a total of $80,000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to pre-empt political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent.", "Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D.S.U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,\u201d wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. \u201cThere are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first.\u201d And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of African-American students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships.", "By then, Trump had mobilized anti-immigrant anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists\u201d \u2014 and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it \u201cillegal amnesty.\u201d Both vows became instant applause lines.", "Indira declared her major in biological sciences at the beginning of the semester and started a demanding pre-med curriculum with six classes, including biology and chemistry, both requiring labs. Her parents had insisted she not take a job, in order to devote herself to education, freeing up four hours a night that she had spent working in high school. With that extra time, she found the academic challenges manageable. Much harder was living apart from her close-knit family for the first time in her life.", "Her mother texted her daily. \u201cGood morning, hija,\u201d she wrote one recent morning, using the Spanish word for daughter. \u201cMay God bless you today in school. Please be kind to everyone.\u201d That night, over FaceTime, Indira talked with two of her younger sisters, who like her were born in Mexico and are undocumented. One, a junior in high school, is already on a quest for college scholarships. She and Indira came up with potential essay ideas and discussed her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Then Indira helped the other, a freshman who is the smartest of all the family\u2019s children, Indira says, with physics homework. On weekends, she FaceTimes with her four youngest siblings \u2014 a sixth grader, a fourth grader, a third grader and a first grader \u2014 all of whom were born in Georgia and are citizens.", "Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite criminal-justice major with long black hair, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. \u201cWhenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,\u201d she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga.

I didn\u2019t have anyone to come home to.\u201d In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm\u2019s second-floor lounge. \u201cAll right, you guys, we\u2019re going to be here for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThat part of our lives \u2014 being undocumented \u2014 is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories.\u201d Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another\u2019s space.", "Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N.C., a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to live the life we\u2019re living now,\u201d she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald\u2019s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: \u201cI hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work.\u201d", "Indira told the harrowing story that led to her own family\u2019s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents\u2019 clinic, and robbed them of everything \u2014 money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn\u2019t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father\u2019s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother\u2019s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother\u2019s sister has been kidnapped twice \u2014 most recently this past November \u2014 and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms.", "Weeks after the robbery, Indira\u2019s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father\u2019s brother worked in construction \u2014 one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family\u2019s safety. \u201cI no longer saw my future, but I saw my children\u2019s future,\u201d her father said to me.", "Antonio Patino, a computer-science major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga., when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio\u2019s sense of belonging in America. \u201cI felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like a hole inside me.\u201d He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents\u2019 safety at random moments during his days at D.S.U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. \u201cLike I\u2019m now the parent and they\u2019re the child, and I\u2019m worried for them,\u201d he told me. \u201cNot being there, all these what-ifs swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?\u201d Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: \u201cI went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn\u2019t help them.\u201d", "A number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind., and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. \u201cShe\u2019s the strongest person I\u2019ll ever know,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my role model.

It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with non-Dreamers at D.S.U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D.S.U., and he said without hesitation: \u201cI got a scholarship.\u201d", "\u201cWhat for?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m undocumented,\u201d Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt.", "\u201cO.K., man, that\u2019s cool,\u201d the student said.", "After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the dead-end options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn\u2019t yet see. Now this all made sense. \u201cThis pain \u2014 it pushes us,\u201d Estephany said. \u201cIt\u2019s motivation. It has made me who I am.

Indira was wearing a Harvard sweatshirt that a classmate bought for her when their high-school A.P.-history class visited Boston. (Indira couldn\u2019t afford to go.) \u201cI\u2019m going to get there one day,\u201d she said with a confident smile. Most of the other students didn\u2019t arrive until class was about to begin \u2014 or later \u2014 and there was little competition for the front rows.", "A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in computational-thinking class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another computer-science major, sat front and center with an African-American classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A\u2019s in the class.", "The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D.S.U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, \u201cPatterns for College Writing,\u201d against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. \u201cIt\u2019s just a quiz,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want to keep my A.\u201d", "\u201cI deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,\u201d says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this happen because it\u2019s my only option.\u2019\u2009\u201d Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream.US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year; research shows that only 66 percent of low-income college students nationally return after one year. \u201cThis is a low-income population with retention rates like Harvard\u2019s,\u201d Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream.US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid.", "One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D.S.U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. \u201cWhen I\u2019m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, \u2018I\u2019m working for that person,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said.

Over Columbus Day weekend, she visited Washington for the first time with her roommate, Karen Baltazar, who is from Lawrenceville, Ga., and also wants to be a doctor. At the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, Indira stood underneath Roosevelt\u2019s Four Freedoms \u2014 freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear \u2014 her arms raised high above her head, as if exulting in the message.

Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65,000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year \u2014 and thousands who drop out \u2014 simply can\u2019t muster it. In a recent book, \u201cLives in Limbo,\u201d Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard\u2019s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of \u201cthe deeper and more far-reaching consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder.\u201d", "At least some of the opportunity scholars\u2019 optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn\u2019t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans\u2019 jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. \u201cThe only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,\u201d Jose Reyes Rios, the computer-science major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September.", "On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the flat-screen TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone\u2019s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now \u2014 to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. \u201cWe will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,\u201d Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents\u2019 daily activities \u2014 driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver\u2019s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed.", "By 1 a.m., Indira became too distressed to concentrate.

That\u2019s crazy. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here \u2014 for our kids.

She felt weary in the aftermath of the election, but when she had this epiphany, she said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t tired anymore. I had that drive, that hunger to just come out on top. I was angry.

Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA.

Trump\u2019s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds.", "This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So, happy New Year.", "Let\u2019s start with some stats. In 2017, the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016, they are half of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies, when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends \u2014 mobile phones, social networks, the web, the cloud, retail and logistics, and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs.", "Meanwhile, the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech \u2014 on autos, health care, retail, transportation, entertainment and finance.", "The Five aren\u2019t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple\u2019s sales were flat last year, and after a monster 2016, Alphabet\u2019s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren\u2019t entirely safe from competition from start-ups, and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot.", "Still, at the moment, thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a long-term outlook, the Five sure do look insulated from competition from start-ups; today\u2019s most valuable tech upstarts, like Airbnb, Uber and Snap, could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five.", "What has changed is public perception. For years, most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight, as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft, which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s, and Amazon, which got under people\u2019s skin for, among other things, making books cheaper and more widely accessible, thereby hurting bookstores.", "But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you\u2019re supposed to in America \u2014 by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren\u2019t considered that bad. They weren\u2019t causing environmental disasters. They weren\u2019t selling cigarettes. They weren\u2019t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five\u2019s growing invincibility last year, the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn\u2019t I called them the Fabulous Five?", "Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt; as technology wormed deeper into our lives, it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with.", "Silicon Valley grew cloistered, missing people\u2019s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist\u2019s iPhone, many in tech sided with the company, but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in.", "During the long presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner, Jeff Bezos, was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos\u2019s main company, Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump, but the industry\u2019s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public.", "For years, most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised \u2014 entertainment giants, cable and phone companies, and the news media, among others.", "\u201cDuring the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters, in general the U.S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters,\u201d said Julius Genachowski, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm.", "That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years, and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them.", "During Mr. Genachowski\u2019s term at the F.C.C., and then again during the term of his successor, Tom Wheeler, the commission passed rules favoring \u201cnetwork neutrality,\u201d which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies.", "But as Mr. Genachowski noted, as the disrupters grow, the dynamic often shifts. \u201cThe next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents, and then you see two things \u2014 battles between incumbents and other incumbents, and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents,\u201d he said.", "That\u2019s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves, and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments, who will look to both sides of the ledger \u2014 their benefits to society as well as their potential costs \u2014 when deciding how to police them.", "But there\u2019s a twist: With the Five, unlike in previous eras of tech, it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today\u2019s start-ups. The battles for dominance in cloud services, artificial intelligence and data mining, voice-activated assistants, self-driving cars, virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five.", "That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more; and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power, things could be fabulous, or frightful."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/fake-news-hillary-clinton-cameron-harris.html": ["ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 It was early fall, and Donald J.

But Snap may have gone too far.", "The details of Snap\u2019s share-class structure may show a slightly more nuanced picture when they are eventually disclosed. The company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission confidentially, with the goal of having its shares traded as soon as March, The New York Times reported in November. The filing will be disclosed sometime before the company begins pitching its share offering. Until then, we won\u2019t know for sure how lacking in power Snap shareholders will be.", "Still, a total disenfranchisement of public shareholders has been a long time coming among technology companies.", "When Apple and Microsoft went public decades ago they had the traditional corporate structure of one share, one vote. Google started the trend of making public shareholders lesser citizens in 2004, when it issued to public shareholders shares having one vote while the founders and insiders held shares with 10 votes.", "That has become the norm among new tech companies, as Facebook, Zynga and Groupon (among others) followed, as well as nontech companies such as Shake Shack. The typical structure was to give 10 votes per share to the Class A stock held by the founders and one vote to the public, though some companies went even further: Zynga\u2019s class A had 70 votes per share. (Twitter, however, was a noticeable exception and instead adopted a more traditional one-share, one-vote structure.)", "But Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google, as well as other tech founders, soon discovered a problem. Even with all of those high-vote shares, they might lose control if they sold their stock to fund their charities or other ventures. As a result, Google, Zillow and even Under Armour have created no-vote shares to issue to employees and for future offerings.", "This is having your cake and eating it, too.", "Facebook is trying to put into effect a similar no-vote share structure, as is IAC/InterActive Corporation, though those two companies have been met with resistance and litigation from shareholders challenging this move.", "Snap could go public with a Google-like structure and then issue out no-vote shares later. But why deal with all those pesky shareholders who may challenge such a conversion?", "Instead, Snap is apparently going to make sure that the public has no vote and hence never the opportunity to have a say in the company\u2019s governance. While public shareholders will be totally disenfranchised, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are reportedly going to have 70 percent of the total vote despite owning only 40 percent of Snap.", "The discrepancy is not bad compared with other companies. At Facebook, for example, Mark Zuckerberg currently casts 53.8 percent of Facebook\u2019s votes while owning 15 percent of the company.", "Snap\u2019s rationale for wanting its co-founders to have this power has not been explained. But from news media reports and otherwise, we can figure out the gist. Snap is likely to argue that Mr. Spiegel, 26, is a visionary who knows how to sell to teenagers and 20-somethings. He is the one who can lead the company to join the superpower ranks of Facebook and Google, justifying Snap\u2019s valuation of over $20 billion.", "Indeed, that appears to be why Snapchat changed its name to Snap, so it could mimic the big boys like Google and be an umbrella company for other innovative and presumably lucrative products. Mr. Spiegel, the argument goes, needs total control over the company to ensure that this ambitious vision is executed.", "There are warning signs that the hype over Snap\u2019s initial public offering is going to be extreme. Already the company is indicating that it will focus not on revenues or profits, but on alternative metrics like user engagement.", "We\u2019ve seen these gimmicks before. Groupon and Zynga were big users of these alternatives, for which I coined the names Grouponomics and Zyngametrics.", "Yet is there any doubt that Snap\u2019s initial public offering will be a stunning success? After all, how can you miss out on the Next Big Thing, like, say, Myspace, Zynga, Groupon or perhaps Theranos? Oh, Snap.", "Sarcasm aside, few big social media players come to market, so investors will be sure to gobble up Snap shares.", "And risks and governance problems will be ignored in the rush not to miss out. The euphoria over Snap is noticeable even among banks, which are providing the company with a loan of $1.4 billion \u2014 more than Snap\u2019s entire expected 2017 revenue. So much for sober and prudent banking.", "When you think about it, this emphasis on vision in technology is tiresome. It drives money to companies but often seems hype to build up the egos of founders who often get lucky. I mean, were messages that disappear \u201cvisionary\u201d five years ago?", "Couldn\u2019t it be easier to say that instead of a visionary, Mr. Spiegel will be a multibillionaire with total control of a company and a track record of only a few years?", "Without picking on Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, this type of corporate power concentration in one or two people has too much chance of going wrong \u2014 especially someone who might be around for 70 years and is running a company with so much uncertainty in its future. Their vision may change or just go bad, but shareholders who own part of the company are stuck as are the employees and consumers of the company who then are kept in this scenario.", "And studies show that in the end these companies destroy value more than they create.", "Even Google was criticized for overspending on investment, something shareholder pressure pushed back on and caused the company to change. Shareholders can provide some measure of check on these issues, but Snap would be saying: We won\u2019t care.", "Defenders of such a class-share structure point to the ability to look at the long term while arguing that the market will price any governance defects. Shareholders will pay less for Snap\u2019s shares because of these risks.", "This assumes a rational market, but it is hard not to see that people may be discounting the risks in the rush to buy the next hot tech stock. And while there may be real benefits to this structure in preserving a singular mission, given the early trajectory of Snap, it seems too risky.", "Perhaps the supporters are right. But the real test of this structure will come if the institutional investment firms who have the greatest influence in the stock market, like Vanguard and BlackRock, idly stand by.", "For them, this test is a last stand: If they do not do something, it will highlight that in some ways their talk about shareholder power is sometimes cheap. Indeed, T. Rowe Price, which is already a private investor in Snap, is reportedly going to oppose Snap\u2019s no-vote corporate governance, stating that \u201cwe want our clients to have the vote they deserve.\u201d", "But I doubt that the institutions will do much more than complain, instead leaving Snap with corporate governance that mimics its disappearing messages, leaving nothing there."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/business/google-waymo-self-driving-minivan-fiat-chrysler.html": ["DETROIT \u2014 There are shiny new sport utility vehicles, brawny pickups and sleek sedans. But the unlikely star of the annual Detroit auto show is an odd-looking minivan capable of driving itself.", "The van, designed by Google, grabbed the spotlight on Sunday, the first day of press previews at the show. The vehicle\u2019s introduction highlighted the industry\u2019s fascination with autonomous driving vehicles, as well as the rising sway of the technology industry in the auto business.", "Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, spun off its driverless car project last month.

But it is also equipped with the self-driving sensors and vision systems developed by Waymo, some of which protrude from its body.", "That combination is telling. The van was built by the Detroit automaker Fiat Chrysler, making it the first heavyweight collaboration between a major automaker and one of Silicon Valley\u2019s elite. And it shows how Waymo, widely considered the leader in autonomous driving technology, hopes to sell its self-driving systems to car companies unwilling to bear all the costs of developing vehicles.", "Some automakers, like General Motors and Ford Motor, have committed to creating their own driverless cars. Both companies recently announced plans to build their first fully autonomous vehicles at factories in Michigan.", "But Google is intent on offering another option to automakers by creating a ready-made package of self-driving equipment that can be integrated into mainstream vehicles.", "The chief executive of Waymo, John Krafcik, said on Sunday that the company had sharply reduced the cost of producing the radars and other high-tech components needed to achieve fully autonomous driving.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve brought all of our self-driving sensors in-house,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said. \u201cIt\u2019s all designed and built from the ground up by Waymo, with every part manufactured with one goal in mind: to safely handle the complex task of full autonomy.\u201d", "By doing so, Waymo is positioning itself as a mega-supplier to the industry, and a turnkey solution to transforming conventional cars into driverless models.", "In the past, industry analysts were doubtful that automakers would work closely with tech companies, which were perceived as potential competitors in their core business of making and selling new vehicles.", "\u201cThe auto industry has to date expressed a collective wariness to allow players like Alphabet too close to the data generated by today\u2019s car platform,\u201d Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a recent research report.", "The collaboration between Waymo and Fiat Chrysler has broken new ground and whetted the interest of other automakers. Last month, Honda said it was in talks with Waymo \u201cto integrate its self-driving technology into Honda vehicles.\u201d", "Other automakers, however, are choosing to keep their self-driving research private. G.M., for example, has acquired outside tech companies to bolster its own engineering teams, and it recently announced plans to manufacture self-driving versions of its new all-electric Chevrolet Bolt at a plant in suburban Detroit.", "Ford Motor is also pressing ahead with efforts to introduce a new fully autonomous vehicle by 2021, and other carmakers are on similar paths, although some of their efforts are focused only on adding driver-assist features that control some of a vehicle\u2019s functions, rather than developing cars that do not require a human driver to operate.", "Hanging over the industry is the potential for new federal regulations addressing whether a self-driving car needs a steering wheel and pedals to operate on public roads. While the Obama administration has consistently supported the move toward autonomous cars, it is not clear whether President-elect Donald J. Trump will adopt similar policies.", "One company that is hedging its bets is Fiat Chrysler, which is smaller and less profitable than its rivals G.M. and Ford. Rather than spend billions on autonomous driving projects, it opened its doors to Waymo to convert a hybrid-electric Chrysler Pacifica minivan into a self-driving vehicle.", "\u201cStrategic collaborations such as this one are vital to promoting a culture of innovation, safety and technology,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive.", "The result on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit was a minivan adorned with swooping plastic scoops that contained sophisticated sensors and radars installed by Waymo.", "The van does have a steering wheel, primarily because some states, such as California, require one during testing on public roads and highways.", "But Mr. Krafcik, Waymo\u2019s chief executive, said the vehicle was \u201ccapable of getting you door to door without a person at the wheel\u201d and represented major improvements in the costs associated with self-driving systems.", "He said that when Google began working on autonomous vehicles in 2009, a sophisticated sensor system using lasers could cost as much as $75,000 from an outside supplier. By manufacturing the components internally, the company has cut the cost by 90 percent.", "\u201cThis is a big step in making this technology affordable and more accessible to millions of people,\u201d Mr. Krafcik said.", "For its part, Fiat Chrysler modified the electrical systems and other components of 100 minivans built at a Canadian assembly plant and then delivered the vehicles to Waymo to add its proprietary self-driving equipment.", "The vehicles have already undergone testing at the automaker\u2019s track in Michigan, and Waymo plans to start driving them on public roads in Arizona and California this month.", "Mr. Krafcik did not provide a forecast for when Waymo\u2019s self-driving technology would be available for sale directly to automakers or ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.

The practice is too expensive and unwieldy to become widespread in Sweden anytime soon.", "The two-year trial, which took place in the southern city of Gothenburg, centered on a municipal retirement home where workers were switched to a six-hour day, from eight hours, with no pay cut. Seventeen new nursing positions were created to make up for the loss of time, at a cost of around 700,000 euros, or $738,000, a year.", "Although it was small, the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work, namely whether investing in a better work-life balance for employees, and treating workers well rather than squeezing them, benefits the bottom line for companies and economies.", "\u201cThe trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day,\u201d said Daniel Bernmar, the leader of the Left party on Gothenburg\u2019s City Council, which had pushed for the experiment. \u201cThey include healthier staff, a better work environment and lower unemployment.\u201d", "But the high price tag, and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday, was likely to discourage widespread support for taking the concept nationwide.", "\u201cThe government is avoiding talking about the issue,\u201d Mr. Bernmar said. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in looking at the bigger picture.\u201d", "While a growing number of countries and companies are studying the concept of employee happiness, the idea of improving it through shorter work hours has by no means gained broad traction. In Gothenburg, the City Council\u2019s conservative opposition parties derided the experiment as a utopian folly and sought to kill it, citing high costs for taxpayers and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace. The current government is also not backing a shorter workweek.", "Even the handful of progressive political groups aligned with Mr. Bernmar\u2019s Left party have not made a six-hour workday in Sweden a priority in their platforms. Nor have large Swedish companies, including multinationals active around the world, embraced the idea. Other Swedish towns that previously conducted limited experiments with a shorter public-sector workweek eventually abandoned the concept, citing high costs and flawed implementation.", "A similar model in France has been controversial for more than 15 years, ever since a Socialist government made a 35-hour workweek mandatory.", "Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a conservative politician who is considered the front-runner to become France\u2019s new president in elections this May, has vowed to kill it if he wins. Companies of all sizes in France have complained repeatedly that the short workweek requirement has damaged competitiveness and generated billions in additional costs. French unions defend the measure as protecting workers from employers who might otherwise return to more onerous workplace conditions.", "Still, some large companies are beginning to explore the argument that happy workers may make better, more productive employees.", "Amazon, Google and Deloitte recently began experiments to compress the 40-hour week into four days for some employees. Amazon, which has come under fire for encouraging employees to work long hours, announced last summer that it would test a 30-hour workweek for a small group of employees and managers, giving them 75 percent of their current pay but leaving them with the same benefits as other workers.", "In the experiment at the Gothenburg retirement home, employees reported working with greater efficiency and energy when their hours were cut to six from eight a day. They called in sick 15 percent less than before and perceived their health to have improved at least 20 percent, according to a preliminary review issued last year.", "At a nearby municipal retirement home, where a control trial left working conditions unchanged, employees reported increased blood pressure and said they perceived no improvement in their health, peace of mind or alertness, the review showed. A final report is scheduled to be released in March.", "The program increased Gothenburg\u2019s costs by 22 percent, mostly to pay for new employees. But around 10 percent was offset by reduced costs to the state from people being taken off the unemployment rolls and paying taxes into the system, rather than receiving state subsidies, Mr. Bernmar said.", "Modest experiments are moving ahead in a handful of small towns in Sweden, mostly in the public health care sector, to see if the results from Gothenburg can be duplicated. This year, four additional Swedish municipalities are expected to start research programs.", "A small but growing number of private Swedish companies, mainly technology start-ups, are also dabbling with the concept, following the lead of some established companies, including a Toyota service center in Gothenburg that has successfully operated on a six-hour day for more than a decade.", "The bigger issue, Mr. Bernmar argues, is whether policy makers are willing to explore a connection between human happiness and health and productivity. Despite arguments that governments have no business in setting happiness as a public policy goal, leaders in several countries, including Italy, Japan and Qatar, are increasingly paying attention to the concept.", "The question, Mr. Bernmar added, was \u201cshould we work to live, not live to work?\u201d"]}

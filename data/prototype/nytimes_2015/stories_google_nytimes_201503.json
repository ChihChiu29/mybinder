This is my life.\u201d", "In 2013, the literary agent Mollie Glick saw a feature on Ms. McKenzie in Seventeen magazine, and asked her if she was interested in writing a novel based on her show. Ms. Glick paired Ms. McKenzie with a young adult novelist, Alyssa B. Sheinmel, who wrote three sample chapters and an outline. A book deal quickly followed. Last spring, Weinstein bought a partial manuscript at auction \u2014 in a low-six-figure, two-book deal \u2014 and separately optioned screen rights.

Harry J. Wilson, a former member of the auto industry crisis task force led by Steven Rattner, gave it a helping hand. A few weeks ago, Mr. Wilson announced a campaign to press G.M. to buy back $8 billion worth of stock, leading four hedge funds with a total stake of about 2 percent in the automaker. As part of this, Mr. Wilson was nominated to run for a board seat.", "Because G.M. was bankrupt only a few years ago, it seems a bit foolhardy for the company to willingly part with billions of dollars of hard-earned cash.

The call to return cash is based on the fact that United States companies are extraordinarily profitable and are building cash mountains when interest rates are at record lows. With limited ability to earn decent returns, activists have pushed hard for companies to return the cash to shareholders.", "Companies that want to return money to shareholders have a choice: They can pay a dividend or buy back shares. In the former case, the calculus is easy. Assuming that there are no big tax issues, a dividend is just a return of cash to shareholders. But buybacks do more by taking shares out of the market. A buyback does not create wealth; theoretically, the cash disappears with the shares. But it does increase earnings per share and usually lifts the stock price, giving the remaining shareholders a bigger piece of the upside.", "Buybacks make sense if a company\u2019s management thinks its shares are underpriced and thus thinks it is getting a bargain.

The activists know that the companies are feeling defensive. Even though Mr. Wilson\u2019s group owned just 2 percent of the company, a contest would have been difficult and expensive.

In good times, it is easy to get too comfortable. Technology companies like Google and Microsoft are stockpiling foreign cash. Others are racing to buy back shares at high valuations. But the good times inevitably end, this time most likely led by the activist stampede.", "The haste in which G.M. rushed to comply to Mr. Wilson\u2019s demands, and they and other companies shed cash rather than fight, shows that the activist tide pushing the stock buyback may have gone too far.

And visitors can navigate to works in far-flung galleries as they would with Google Maps \u2014 no small convenience in the labyrinthine halls of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.", "The technology \u201cprovides visitors with an effortless, rich mechanism that allows them to opt in or opt out for as much as they want to know,\u201d said Elizabeth E. Barker, director of the Boston Athenaeum, which will begin using beacons in time for a show on the Marquis de Lafayette in June. Graphic panels can now be moved online, she added, affording a less cluttered encounter between patron and art.", "More important, beacons allow for an alternative to the old convention of top-down exhibitions, in which curators and other experts impart a single authoritative view. Visitors may now post a lively mix of reactions, reviews and rebuttals to exhibitions and individual works, just as readers do in online newspaper comment fields and restaurantgoers do on Yelp.", "The result is a cross between curating and crowdsourcing, a two-way conversation. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to be a professional curator to have a voice that matters,\u201d said Robert Stein, deputy director of the Dallas Museum of Art, which has experimented with a variety of location-aware technologies but is not currently using beacons.", "Elizabeth Merritt, founding director of the Center for the Future of Museums, an arm of the American Alliance of Museums, pointed out that remarks written in virtual comment fields could relate shows to current issues in a way that curators usually cannot.", "\u201cThe time required to compose and print graphic labels makes it impossible to be of-the-moment,\u201d she said, adding that an exhibition on race riots might prompt visitors to relate them to the recent unrest in Ferguson, Mo. \u201cNow you have the historical echo,\u201d Ms. Merritt said.", "Apple and other companies started beacon technology two years ago with retail use in mind, but cultural institutions have latched onto the possibilities. Most major museums, including the Guggenheim and the Met, are in various stages of testing and installation \u2014 no small job. Coverage requires hundreds of puck-size transmitters. For the Boston Athenaeum, the cost is the equivalent of \u201cthrowing one gala fund-raiser,\u201d Dr. Barker said.", "Inevitably, some museums, the Frick Collection in New York and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston among them, will choose to maintain galleries as places of quiet contemplation undisturbed by the jangle of phone alerts. \u201cWe all want to preserve the gallery as an escape,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cWe have to make beacons part of an elegant experience. If we fail, then the public gets annoyed.\u201d", "The benefits of audience data may be too great to resist. For one thing, beacons allow museums to send personalized messages based on visitors\u2019 past behavior.", "Nobody knows if the guests\u2019 collective likes and dislikes will influence curatorial decisions. \u201cDoes a museum deliver what the market appears to ask for?\u201d asked Susie Wilkening, who, as senior consultant at Reach Advisors, specializes in audience research for museums. \u201cDo they ignore areas that don\u2019t test well?\u201d", "Add to these hypotheticals the possibility of exchanging data with a company like Google, which would afford museums a depth of knowledge about patrons\u2019 preferences. \u201cThese are the issues museums are now discussing,\u201d Ms. Wilkening said.", "As with many aspects of modern life, patrons who opt for beacon apps willingly trade a measure of privacy for the benefit of a more personalized interaction with art.", "\u201cMy sense is that beacons aren\u2019t a life raft,\u201d Dr. Barker said, \u201cbut a bridge to the next generation of museum users.\u201d"], "https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/morning-agenda-u-s-banks-pass-fed-tests/": ["U.S. BANKS PASS FED EXAM | The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that all the large United States banks passed its so-called stress tests, which aim to assess whether they can weather a financial storm, DealBook\u2019s Peter Eavis writes.

They might never get to profitability on the new stuff.\u201d", "In 2013, Kodak sold 1,100 patents related to digital image capture to a group of 12 companies, including Apple, Samsung and Facebook, for $527 million. Kodak retained the same access to the patents as the bidders, should it wish to compete in, say, photography once again. And it kept about 7,000 other patents, largely connected to the chemistry and physics of creating images, which the market sees as having relatively little value.", "Commercial film is a dwindling business. The 11.4 billion linear feet of film Kodak manufactured as late as 2007, enough to circle the earth about 88 times, has shrunk 96 percent. Last July, just three months after he took over, Mr. Clarke moved to retain part of the past. Supported by directors such as Quentin Tarantino and J. J. Abrams, he reached an agreement with major Hollywood studios to continue buying Kodak movie film for several years. The deal was formalized in February.", "\u201cIt\u2019s still an important business for us. We had to make sure we had a way to sustain that,\u201d said Mr. Clarke. \u201cIt would have been 300 more jobs lost, another factory shut. Besides, we want to keep it open, because that\u2019s where we\u2019ll produce the touch screens.\u201d", "More important to Mr. Clarke are the ways the past, in terms of both intellectual property and Kodak\u2019s manufacturing processes, can be adapted. After initial preparation in the commercial film building, a short drive from R&D, the touch screens get their silver crosshatches by exposure to light. That process resembles the way images appear on film, and it uses machines that resemble giant versions of a camera and darkroom.", "The kind of printing at which Kodak excels can spin out newspapers at a blinding rate, or create customized beer boxes with team logos for big games. The digital imaging roots are in things like coatings, stretching as far back as Kodak\u2019s business developing people\u2019s mailed-in snapshots. The ink particles for superhigh-resolution printing are as small as one one-thousandth the width of a human hair. Those come out of the failed and expensive venture into consumer printing.", "Mr. Clarke says the culture George Eastman created is a problematic legacy.

It employs 340,000 people, roughly the population of Honolulu.", "Mr. Buffett gave his best go at explaining this seeming contradiction in his latest letter to shareholders released this past weekend, in effect a guide to why he has been able to build such a vast corporate empire and a $72 billion personal net worth. It lays out two theories of why Berkshire has been so successful. But those two theories have radically different implications for how the company will fare after the 84-year-old Buffett\u2019s retirement or death.", "It helps to understand why finance economists don\u2019t much like the idea of conglomerates in the first place. Back in the 1960s, a popular strategy was to buy up random industrial companies and use accounting tricks to create the illusion of growth even when the underlying performance of the acquired companies was no better, and often worse, than it had been when they were run separately.", "It\u2019s easy to look at Berkshire Hathaway over the last couple of generations and see a version of the same thing. Mr. Buffett has bought enough seemingly random companies over the years that the combined entity defies any simple description (In short: A giant insurance company plus a giant railroad plus a giant electric utility plus a giant stock portfolio along with various and sundry investments, including in private jet travel, mobile homes, men's and women\u2019s underwear, and dairy-based desserts. Oh, and half of Heinz ketchup).", "Finance theory would say that there is no real reason for all those unrelated businesses to be underneath the same corporate umbrella. The company is an extreme example of decentralization, with Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s corporate headquarters in Omaha employing only 25 people to oversee this vast empire. All meaningful operational responsibility remains with executives who run all those portfolio companies.", "Why shouldn\u2019t they each exist on their own, or as part of a larger company with a narrower focus? Here\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s explanation:", "\u201cOne of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds,\u201d he writes. \u201cNevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital,\u201d for example the reluctance of a C.E.O. in a declining business to shut down factories and return capital to shareholders to be reinvested elsewhere, or the tax and transaction costs for investors who wish to shift money from one sector to another.", "\u201cAt Berkshire, we can \u2014 without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs \u2014 move huge sums from businesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise. Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject to pressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That\u2019s important: If horses had controlled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.\u201d", "In effect, Mr. Buffett is arguing that he and the vice chairman, Charlie Munger, and their 25-person team in Omaha are better at deciding the appropriate allocation of capital among different potential investments than the entire infrastructure of the modern financial system \u2014 banks, stock and bond markets, buyout funds and so on \u2014 that are supposed to do just that.", "The key advantages that Berkshire may have, in other words, are that the company decides how to allocate capital with neither the self-interested decision-making of many operating executives (most people don\u2019t want to dismantle the company they lead, after all, even if its business prospects have collapsed), nor the high fees and short-term perspective of private equity and other buyout artists.", "If you believe Mr. Buffett, Berkshire is able to achieve the analytical rigor of the latter mixed with the long-term perspective of the former.", "But there\u2019s a bit more to his success than just being really good at capital allocation. There are surely thousands of people who can match Mr. Buffett\u2019s talent for evaluating the prospects of a business and deciding which should get more investment and which less. But most of them won\u2019t end up with a $72 billion net worth and 340,000 employees.", "Mr. Buffett acknowledges a second reason for his company\u2019s success: \u201cWe are now the home of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.\u201d In other words, if you are a family looking to cash out of a business but want to leave the company intact and keep longtime employees in place to run it, selling to Berkshire Hathaway looks mighty attractive. But there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re going to have to accept less money than a private equity firm or a strategic acquirer would offer.", "The unique art of Mr. Buffett and Berkshire, as Matt Levine writes at Bloomberg View, is in the ability to \u201cbe rigorous while seeming sentimental, to drive a hard bargain by looking like a teddy bear.\u201d In effect, he is able to get favorable deals on his acquisition because of a reputation built over a lifetime for buying good companies and more or less leaving them alone.", "That\u2019s the giant question for the future of this enormous company.

Collaboration also demands another factor in modern workplaces, what Mr. Butterfield calls transparency.", "\u201cThat can be a loaded political term, but we just mean being able to see into different parts of the organization, which turns out to be important,\u201d Mr. Butterfield said.", "Though it is possible to speak privately in Slack, by default everything you say is visible to everyone else at your company, even people in other departments \u2014 a system that Mr. Butterfield argues allows for greater collaboration across different parts of a company. Most discussions in Slack are also archived and made searchable.", "As a result, over time, the chats build up into a corpus of deep historical knowledge.

Because Slack usually comes into a company that is already using email, some workers may resent it for being just another thing to check.

Chinese Internet regulators would have to shut down such services, including those run by Amazon and Microsoft, to stop these censorship-evading tools.", "Some analysts have argued that the economic cost of blocking these services is too high and that the number of users of censorship-evading tools is too low to prompt such intervention by censors. This month, however, unidentified hackers targeted GreatFire.org\u2019s service in an unprecedented distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack, flooding the service with billions of requests an hour and setting off concerns that the patience of China\u2019s Internet censors had run out.", "Adam Fisk is the lead developer of Lantern, a censorship-evading tool that became available in 2013 and is largely financed by the United States State Department. The software allows users in countries where the web is not censored to share part of their Internet traffic with users in countries with censorship, such as Iran and China. The software has been installed 135,000 times so far, Mr. Fisk said, allowing unrestricted transfers of 150 terabytes of data every month.", "Mr. Fisk, 39, was also a developer of LimeWire, a once-popular network that relied on peer-to-peer technology for file sharing. It was shut down in 2011 after a judge ordered most of its services disabled amid accusations of facilitating music piracy. In an interview, he discussed how Lantern works and how it has reacted to the new measures by Chinese Internet regulators.", "How many people use Lantern in China and the rest of the world?", "Over all, Lantern use is still relatively low. It\u2019s about 10,000 weekly active users in the world. In China, it\u2019s about 6,000 or 7,000 weekly active [users].", "Who would use Lantern in China?", "We intentionally know very little about our users, but we know that people like [the Chinese artist] Ai Weiwei have used it, tweeted about it. The goal behind Lantern is to be free and easy to use, a service that works really well, so that anyone can use it. In terms of where we\u2019re at now, it\u2019s still the intellectual elite that tends to be more active on the Internet and tends to be more informed about the tools that are out there.", "What measures have Chinese Internet regulators taken to strengthen the Great Firewall since you started Lantern?", "The biggest change has been the most recent V.P.N. blocking. To me, that blocking is fascinating in the sense that the ways V.P.N.s are blockable are obvious and trivial. So I think the reason they hadn\u2019t been blocked earlier was that the only people who can access V.P.N.s are people who have foreign credit cards.", "Technically, that block was really fairly obvious. One of the reasons that Lantern exists is that things like V.P.N.s are easy to block. The V.P.N. blocking didn\u2019t affect Lantern.", "But you used Gmail and Gchat before they were blocked, right?", "We didn\u2019t use Gchat to tunnel traffic. It was really more to kickstart the network. If you have a friend who lives in an uncensored region, you can access the Internet through that friend, or a friend of that friend. That\u2019s really the reason we used Gchat. We tunnel to it, because it\u2019s blocked.", "When you tunnel traffic, you operate through cloud services or peers. Do you expect that the rise of services like Lantern and GreatFire will result in more attempts to block cloud services?", "This might be one I can\u2019t answer.", "Let me rephrase the question. Collateral freedom tools such as Lantern operate on cloud services. These cloud services are extremely important for Chinese businesses and shutting them down would cause economic damage. Do you think those who are regulating the Great Firewall are aware of this?", "I definitely think they are aware of it, and it really reflects the interconnectedness of the global economy. And for me, the big danger \u2014 both for China and the Internet as a whole \u2014 is the Balkanization that we are starting to see. The question in my mind is the degree to which the Balkanization is damaging to the Chinese economy. I don\u2019t know if anyone has looked at that. But, if so, many services not being available or in danger of not being available would have a significant impact for innovation. Some of the best technology companies in the world have been affected.", "Where do you see that Balkanization of the Internet heading? Do you think concerns over the economic damage will prevail and keep the Internet free?", "There is an overlap in interest between [Chinese] government officials and people in the industry. Hopefully, the interconnectedness of the global economy is strong enough and vital enough that we see a move away from Balkanization.", "What are you currently working on?", "We are working on fleshing out the peer-to-peer approach. It relies on global interconnectedness, not of businesses but of people. It\u2019s using real-life social networks to build this backbone of information exchange about ways to access the open Internet.", "One other big focus is speed. Also we are looking at mobile. We are releasing this Twitter app called Firetweet, which is basically a Twitter client in censored regions. So you don\u2019t really know it\u2019s Lantern running in the back end, but it just works in censored regions.", "Is there a chance that censors can infiltrate your networks?", "We really assume that censors are going to penetrate the peer-to-peer network and are going to run as peers. So we just focus on providing access. We don\u2019t do much to prevent monitoring. Censors can actually see which websites you are accessing, but \u2014 because traffic is encrypted \u2014 they cannot see what you are doing on these websites.", "What we are more concerned about is censors actually blocking Lantern through infiltration. The way our algorithms work makes it very difficult to do that. They would need to penetrate the Lantern social network on a massive scale.", "Do you see the collateral freedom community moving away from cloud services to peer-to-peer?", "I don\u2019t see that happening. We are the only ones working on that that I know of. The peer-to-peer network can perform really well, but making it perform consistently is a challenge. It comes down to the location of peers. If we have people accessing in China, we have to make sure they have access through peers in Tokyo and not in Iceland.", "And in the wider community?", "That\u2019s a big open question. If cloud-based centralized services start getting blocked more and more, it\u2019s unclear what the next step is."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/fashion/weddings/sarah-cooper-and-jeffrey-palm.html": ["Sarah Anne Cooper and Jeffrey de Blanc Palm were married Wednesday at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau by Angel L.

After several setbacks, and with just days to spare before he had to catch his return flight to Sweden, Knausgaard met the photographer Peter van Agtmael in Cleveland, and the two of them drove to Detroit.", "O\nne joy of life in the north comes after a winter storm, when the sky, freed of its burden, has paled, and the glow of the unseen sun is everywhere reflected by the snow, so that all things stand out sharp and clear. That I should experience this in Detroit, once the center of the world\u2019s auto industry, came as a surprise. But I felt it as soon as I woke up. The light in the room was different, and when I drew open the curtains and looked out at the street, where a woman bundled up in heavy clothing was walking slowly along with a shopping bag in each hand, I felt the old, familiar promise it held of a new beginning.", "\u201cOh, God,\u201d Peter said, lifting the back of his hand to his eyes as he stepped outside.", "I wanted to suggest that I drive, but the car was an automatic, which I wasn\u2019t used to, and I was reluctant to reveal my incompetence by asking for instructions.", "We got into the S.U.V., and Peter started the engine and entered the GPS coordinates. The plan was to head north for Cheboygan and spend the night there. Soon we were out on the highway, smoking in our seats as Peter zigzagged slowly between the heavy, slow-moving semitrailers, the cabs of which resembled elaborate little houses. Ever since I landed in Cleveland the previous day, the landscape had been the same, a sort of centerless, semi-\u00adurban sprawl of highways, subdivisions, shopping malls, warehouses, gas stations and factories. If the Vikings really had left their settlements up in Newfoundland and explored the continent by following the rivers and lakes westward, as the Kensington Runestone\u2019s presence in Minnesota suggested, it was in a world completely different from the one we drove through. I tried to imagine it, tuning out the sounds of the highway, the speed of the car, the concrete and the steel, but the place I then envisioned, a landscape untouched by man, was far too romantic to be true. The pre-Columbian Americans also had cities, they had roads, and some historians say that, at least before the diseases carried by Columbus and his successors wiped them out, there were more people here than in Europe. The really remarkable thing about the Vikings therefore wasn\u2019t that they discovered America, but that they left it, almost without a trace.", "What if Columbus had done the same?", "I thought: What if the authorities in Europe at the end of the 15th century, when Columbus informed them of what he had seen and experienced, decided to leave America alone? Not to conquer it, not to colonize it, not to exploit it?", "It is inconceivable.", "If there is something to be gained, if it is gainable, no power on earth can restrain the forces that seek to gain it. To leave a profit or a territory or any kind of resource, even a scientific discovery, unexploited is deeply alien to human nature.", "But if we imagine, contrary to everything we know about human nature, that Europeans living in the 16th century had said simply, \u201cLet\u2019s leave the New World in peace, out of respect for the people there and their way of life,\u201d what would the continent look like now?", "\u201cDo you mind if we stop here for a sec?\u201d Peter said, nodding toward a shopping center in the middle of a vast, snow-flecked parking lot. \u201cI need some shoelaces.\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d I said.", "\u201cThen you\u2019ll get to see a typical American big-box store into the bargain,\u201d he said, turning into the lot and driving slowly along the glinting row of cars to find a parking space.", "The store, a Target, was like a great hall, the ceiling had to be at least 50 feet high, and the various sections offering all kinds of merchandise went on for what seemed like a full city block. It seemed almost obscene to buy something so trifling as shoelaces in this gigantic box. None of this would have been here, I thought. Not the mall, not the parking lot, not the cars. Another culture with another future would have defined the continent.", "Peter paid, and we went back to the car, got in and drove out onto the highway. Leaving America and yet keeping it under watch would have turned the continent into a kind of vast human nature reserve, the people there following their own path of development, without knowing they were under observation.", "What an awful thought. And nearly inconceivable. Not only is it alien to human nature to leave a profit unexploited, but discovering, inventing or knowing something without passing that knowledge on is alien to us, too.", "We passed Flint, and the landscape began to change. The road narrowed, there were fewer buildings, the amount of snow kept increasing and the empty spaces it covered expanded. Woods appeared and disappeared. The sky was clear blue, the sun shone, the spruce trees, loaded with ice, glinted in the sunlight.", "Unlawful smoking in a rental car can be challenging, at least when it\u2019s cold outside. Now the outside temperature was maybe 10 degrees, and the urge to smoke had to be continually weighed against the discomfort of cold air from the open window. Then there was the ash. Using the ashtray in the car was out of the question, so I had to knock off the ash against the edge of the open window, which wasn\u2019t all that easy, because the force of the wind frequently tore the entire burning cherry away from my cigarette, so that I kept having to light it. The worst part was getting rid of the butt. If I just held it over the edge of the open window and let go, it could just as easily blow back into the car. This happened several times, with the butt typically flying onto my trousers or the creases of my jacket, forcing me to hunt frantically for it before it set fire to something.", "Those cigarettes occasioned a lot of fiddling and fumbling.", "The landscape stayed the same all morning, groves upon groves of trees casting their shadows across the snow-covered roadway, broken up by open fields or little towns that were seldom more than single rows of sunlit houses on either side of the road. I looked for a cafe or a diner, because I wanted to experience something American, and figured I should just get it over with, find some Americans and actually talk to them. That\u2019s what Geert Mak did in his book about America: He had breakfast at a rural diner and chatted up the locals, who talked to him about the golden past and the hopeless future. But all the cafes and restaurants, of which each town seemed to have exactly one, were closed.", "I flicked a half-smoked cigarette out the window. It flew back in and landed between the seat and the door, presumably still burning. I looked down, couldn\u2019t see anything and started fumbling around for it with my fingers.", "\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Peter said.", "\u201cI lost my cigarette,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s still lit. I can\u2019t reach it.\u201d", "\u201cO.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop here.\u201d", "He turned into the parking lot in front of a gas station with the indicators blinking and stopped the car. I got out, opened the back door, bent down and peered under the seat. I still couldn\u2019t see anything.", "\u201cTry moving the seat forward?\u201d", "\u201cHow do I do that?\u201d", "\u201cYou push that button there.\u201d", "\u201cWhich button? That one?\u201d", "I pushed the button, but all that happened was that the back of the seat inclined slowly forward.", "\u201cThis is, without a doubt, the most exciting thing that has happened so far on this trip,\u201d Peter said.", "\u201cI wish the whole car would just explode,\u201d I said. \u201cAt least I\u2019d have something to write about.\u201d", "\u201cDid you find it?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Peter opened his door and came around my side. He slid the button in the proper direction, and the seat began to glide slowly forward. There it was. The cigarette had burned out and was lying safely on a rubber mat.", "When we continued north, I felt depressed. What Peter had said, about the burning cigarette being the most exciting thing to happen so far on our trip, was actually true. If this had been just any old trip, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. But I was supposed to write something about this trip, and not only that, I was supposed to use this trip to grasp something essential about the U.S., perceive something with my foreign gaze that Americans couldn\u2019t see for themselves. Instead, I saw nothing. I experienced nothing.", "When my mother\u2019s father, Johannes, came to the United States in the early 1980s to visit his brother, Magnus, who had emigrated more than 50 years before, it was the greatest voyage of his life. Until he died, he told stories from that journey. Everything had been meaningful. On the flight, there was a men\u2019s chorus, Johannes told people. They got drunk and sat there caroling. It was an experience. At the airport, he was picked up in an open-top 1960s Cadillac. That was an experience. To see Magnus\u2019s farm, which, compared to my grandfather\u2019s tiny smallholding, was gigantic \u2014 that was an experience. My two cousins went with Johannes on the trip, and they told me how he sat up in the living room at night, all alone, watching TV. He didn\u2019t speak any English and couldn\u2019t understand a word the people on the TV said, but still he sat there late into the night, zapping his way through all the channels, hypnotized by America and all things American.", "I told Peter.", "He looked at me.", "\u201cYou have relatives here? Where do they live?\u201d", "I shrugged.", "\u201cI don\u2019t really know. But I think they\u2019re in Minnesota.\u201d", "\u201cBut there\u2019s your story right there!

The Vikings, the Norwegian immigration, your trip to the U.S. .\u2009.\u2009. \u201d", "He was right.", "I felt the sun rise in my mind. Suddenly everything seemed easy and full of light.", "I opened the window as far as it would go, stretched out my arm and dropped the cigarette; the wind caught it, and it spun out of sight. When I closed the window again, I glimpsed something blue between the trees. A moment later, the landscape opened up, and I looked straight ahead at a vast lake, covered in ice near the shore, pale blue farther out, filled with sunlight.", "My eyes teared up, not because the sight was so beautiful, but because the beauty was so sudden.", "Then we were in among the trees again.", "\u201cDid you see that?\u201d I said. \u201cThe lake?\u201d", "\u201cShould we stop?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, let\u2019s stop.\u201d", "We drove back, parked the car and got out.", "The water lay motionless; far away on the horizon, its pale blue merged seamlessly with the hazy blue of the sky.", "A green island lay in the distance. For some reason it seemed to be floating above the water. It could be that the water around it was frozen, and the white of the ice was blending with the haze, making it appear as if the island hung suspended between lake and sky.", "Peter stood next to me with his camera lowered.", "\u201cIt\u2019s too beautiful to take a photo, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said.", "\u201cYes,\u201d he said.", "To the northwest, a massive cloud formation hung immobile in the sky, as perfectly white as the snow beneath our feet.", "Not a soul, not a sound, just this vast light.", "We walked back across the creaking snow, shivering with cold. In front of the car, I picked up my courage and asked Peter if I could take a turn at driving.", "\u201cSure,\u201d he said.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to show me how the automatic transmission works, O.K.?\u201d", "\u201cOf course.\u201d", "The car leapt backward as I reversed it without the restraining influence of a clutch and again when I put it into drive and turned onto the empty road. But soon I got used to the automatic shifting of gears and was driving a car in the U.S. for the first time, while Peter sat next to me taking photos through the window every time something caught his interest.", "I received a text message from my mother with my cousin\u2019s phone number in Norway. She thought my cousin might be Facebook friends with one of Magnus\u2019s grandchildren.", "At dusk, when the light falling on the snow still had only the merest tinge of blue, we pulled over to look at an enormous concrete statue of Jesus that stood right next to the road, between the groves of trees. It must have been at least 15 feet tall. In one outstretched hand, he held a globe. All his limbs were out of proportion, and his face was so crudely made that the statue seemed the embodiment of a child\u2019s drawing.", "To the left of it, there was a house, and to the right, a fenced-in yard. Beyond the fence stood a giant dinosaur. I went over to have a look. A sign on the locked gate proclaimed this exhibit to be the finest in the world. Several other hulking prehistoric creatures stood there motionless in the snow.", "When I turned around and looked back at the house, I saw a little girl and a woman in her 30s, probably the girl\u2019s mother, standing in the window staring at us.", "What kind of a place was this?", "The history of art was little more than the history of man\u2019s attempts to represent the sacred, from the animals in the first cave paintings to the dolphin frescos at Knossos, from the medieval icons to the hyperrealist angels of the baroque, from Turner\u2019s heavenly light to van Gogh\u2019s rain-swept villages. Art elevates us by intensifying and densifying the world. Of course, this is true only of good art; the least trace of anything awkward or amateurish, and we remain in our unelevated state, our reality of blushing, stumbling, idiotic misunderstandings and blunders. That the artists of the past century have abandoned the search for the sacred does not change what came before; it only tells us that they no longer consider the sacred to be a significant subject of investigation, that the vertical axis has been replaced by the horizontal, so that art no longer lifts us up, but turns us in.", "The statue of Jesus was obviously not the work of a modern caricaturist or intellectual, toying with the fundamentally childish nature of faith. It had been made, I assumed, in a sincere attempt to represent what is finest and most important in the world. Over the course of the past two days, I had seen many images of Jesus, all of them cartoonish stereotypes, yet they must have been genuine expressions of something many people considered deeply significant. The contrast with, say, Russia, was striking: Had I been driving there, I would have come across a very different caliber of representations of Christ, given the nation\u2019s many monasteries, churches and thousand-year-old tradition of icon painting. Throw Dostoyevsky into the bargain, and Russian Orthodox Christianity becomes something you could spend your entire life studying, because it seems so close \u2014 with its notions of guilt, grace and redemption \u2014 to the enigma of existence itself, touching the core of what it is to be human.", "How do you compare that to a billboard with a line drawing of a good-natured, bearded man and a phone number to dial for salvation?", "I gloated a little over that thought as we drove north through the empty, darkening woods, until it struck me how wrong I was. The depth of American religion lay not in visual art, not in representation but, obviously, in music. I had some gospel records at home; some of the recordings were from the 1920s, and their raw force, their fervor, heartfelt and ecstatic at the same time, was like a fire, brutal yet beautiful, no less exquisite than a Russian Orthodox icon.", "One time in Brooklyn, after a reading, I heard music coming from a place farther up the street, and I went up there and poked my head in, and what I saw, a gospel choir all in white, singing and swaying, was as alien, mysterious, cultlike and compelling as any Russian Orthodox Church service.", "The religion of American music was neither contemplative nor brooding, not something you sat listening to alone. It was something you experienced, here and now, together with others.", "We arrived in Cheboygan around 9 p.m. The houses along the main street glimmered in the dark, and the snow softened every contour, covering the roofs and sidewalks in plump heaps. It seemed like a pleasant, well-functioning town, considerably larger than the others we had passed since Flint but still small. We parked outside a pub that Peter found on his cellphone. The night was starlit and freezing cold, and what I could glimpse of the pub\u2019s interior, through windows festooned in snow, had a warm and cozy glow.", "Inside, the place was packed. We found a table, took off our coats, looked at the menu. Around us, people laughed and talked. A TV hung on every wall, each with different images flitting soundlessly across its screen. Nearly every place we went had TVs on the walls, and they were always on. I never saw anyone actually watching them, beyond an occasional glance up at the screen. Why were they there?", "The waitress came over. I had made up my mind to try meatloaf, which sounded very American to my ears, and a pale lager.", "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d", "I repeated it.", "She stared hesitantly, almost despondently, at me.", "Peter intervened to help us out. The waitress gathered up the menus and disappeared.", "The same thing happened nearly every time I had ordered something in the past week. The waiter or waitress would look questioningly at me and ask me to repeat myself. Every exchange of information was piecemeal, chopped into bits, full of misunderstandings and repetitions. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t speak English, it was that I stood on the outside of the flow that made things glide along easily and without friction, where everything said and done was as expected. I was in command of the content, but not of the form, and form is always the most important aspect of human communication. I experienced the same thing when I moved from Norway to Sweden, all those suddenly blank stares and silent nods, which meant either that someone didn\u2019t understand what I was saying or that what I was saying was preposterous. In those early years, every time I met people from Norway, I felt relief. They only had to say a few sentences, and at once I could place them geographically and socially and address them accordingly. When I was still living in Norway, I wasn\u2019t even aware that this kind of knowledge existed, it was entirely intuitive and obvious, just part of what being Norwegian entailed, and my easy access to this whole subconscious mountain of implicit knowledge and shared references was probably what it meant to have a national identity.", "Once, I mentioned this to a Swedish woman. She looked indignantly at me. \u201cBut those are just prejudices!\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re judging people before you\u2019ve even spoken to them! It\u2019s much better not to know all those things, so that you can make up your own opinion about them. We\u2019re individuals, not representatives of a culture!\u201d", "That is the most Swedish thing anyone has ever said to me.", "What is culture, if not a set of prejudices? A set of unformulated and unconscious rules and ways of behavior that every member of a given society nonetheless immediately recognizes and accepts?", "Nowhere in the world has shared culture been a more imperative requirement than in America. More than 300 million people live here, and they had descended over the course of a very few generations from a huge number of disparate cultures, with different histories, ways of behavior, worldviews and experiential backgrounds. All of them, sooner or later, had been required to relinquish their old culture and enter the new one. That must be why the most striking thing about the United States was its sameness, that every place had the same hotels, the same restaurants, the same stores. And that must be why every American movie was made after the same template and why, in this sense, every movie expressed the same thing. And that must be why all these TVs were hanging on the walls, unwatched; they created an immediate sense of belonging, a feeling of home.", "Even though I grew up with American music and films and read about American politicians and celebrities practically all my life, I was still an outsider. I didn\u2019t understand all these TV sets with their bright smiles.", "The waitress brought our beers.", "\u201cI love your accent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d", "\u201cNorway,\u201d I mumbled.", "\u201cWow,\u201d she said.", "\u201cDon\u2019t you love my accent?\u201d Peter said.", "\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d", "\u201cMaryland.\u201d", "\u201cWell. .\u2009.\u2009.\u201d", "They laughed, and she disappeared into the kitchen again.", "I got up around 5 the next morning and brewed a cup of coffee, which I drank standing on the terrace outside my hotel room in the cold while I smoked and looked down at the black river flowing below; in the darkness, I could faintly glimpse its course between snowy banks.", "I was supposed to give a speech in a few days, so I had to finish it during this trip, hence the early morning.", "But it was impossible to write. I couldn\u2019t even manage the first sentence.", "Still, I kept trying for a couple of hours. It was so cold that I sat with the bedcovers draped over my shoulders. Finally, I gave up, went into the bathroom and ran a bath. The shower enclosure was of the same mysterious origin as the one I saw in Newfoundland, with the wall and tub cast in one mold and no joint to explain how it had gotten into the room.", "But oh, did it feel good to be submerged in hot water.", "In the bedroom, my cellphone gave a beep.", "The message was from my cousin in Norway. Magnus\u2019s grandchildren were named Mark and Matthew Hatloy. Matthew lived in Florida, and Mark lived near Grafton, N.D. My cousin would try to find their phone numbers and email addresses in the next few hours and get back to me.", "I plotted the route to Grafton on Google Maps. The drive would take about 13 hours. So we could arrive late tomorrow evening, talk to Mark for a couple of hours, drive down to Alexandria the next day for a quick look at the Viking runestone and on to the airport in Minneapolis that afternoon.", "I got dressed and went out on the terrace for another cigarette. The sun had begun to rise, and now the opaque river water was clearly visible against the white banks. The great currents appeared to be only a few inches deep, as if they were flowing over flat, black rock.", "There was a yearning in it, I thought. Black water coursing through a landscape of snow.", "Then I thought of Mark and Matthew. I knew nothing about them, except that they were about the same age as me, that we had the same great-grandparents and that they, unlike me, had grown up in the U.S. We were second cousins, fairly close relations.", "When I got back inside, I Googled them. It felt strange to see their name, Hatloy, on American websites; my mother and her whole family were named Hatl\u00f8y.", "But there was hardly any information about the Hatloys. Mark\u2019s name came up only in connection with a company in North Dakota that sold agricultural products. So presumably that\u2019s what he did for a living.", "The same page featured ads for services that could provide all kinds of information about people: where they lived, what schools they had gone to, what jobs they had, if they had ever been convicted of a crime or spent time in jail.", "I typed in \u201cMark Hatloy\u201d and hit enter.", "The website began suggesting documents at a furious pace, the screen filled up with green columns, new resources with new data, and each time one was completed, another sprang up.", "It didn\u2019t feel good.", "His life was none of my business.", "On the other hand, all this must be publicly accessible information in the U.S.", "The website finished its search. To access the information, I had to pay a certain sum. I took my credit card out of my back pocket, put it on the bed in front of me and began to type in the digits. Then I canceled the transaction, put the card back, shut down my laptop and went over to the main building for breakfast.", "When we left Cheboygan, a little after noon on my third day in the United States, the wind and snow had started up again. The landscape was completely empty and deserted. We drove through endless woods, occasionally broken up on one side by a lake that would quickly vanish. The sky cleared, the sun came out, the contours sharpened. I saw a sign advertising a lumberjack show, which I\u2019d already seen on the wall outside the men\u2019s room in the Cheboygan pub, and I saw plastic sculptures of fish and elk a dozen feet tall outside lodges and eateries. In some places, snowmobiles whizzed by, on tracks in the woods or on the snow banks along the road. We were in an America that I hadn\u2019t known existed, that I had never seen in pictures or heard anyone mention.", "In the afternoon we stopped at a pizza place in a small town by a frozen lake. My cousin back home had sent me Mark\u2019s contact information, and while we waited for our food, I sent Mark an email. It bounced back immediately. The address was no longer in use.", "Oh, no. I would have to call him.", "The woods on the other side of the lake stood motionless and green-black by the white edge of the water. The sky, still blue, was growing hazier by the minute and would soon reach the point when the first light of the stars far away in the cosmos suddenly pierces the heavens.", "It had to be close to zero degrees.", "We drove west all evening. The murmuring heater, the even hum of the engine and the compact darkness outside had a hypnotic effect. It was as if we were no longer in this world, at least I felt that way, and I told Peter things I had never told anyone. He sat without moving in his seat as I talked. Normally, it took me years to trust people. Peter, I trusted after a few hours. I had no idea why, but I believed everything my intuition told me; no knowledge seemed more accurate. Then Peter took over from me and spoke about his own life while I sat there quietly, looking at the light of the headlamps slicing through the dark and occasionally flashing back at us from a road sign. There were hardly any other cars on the road. It was five degrees outside. The stars glittered above us. The sight was so beguiling that we finally stopped and got out. It was completely and utterly still. Looking up at the sky, which was veiled by hazy bands of clustered stars, was like staring into eternity.", "Soon we drove on through the woods. After a few hours, the landscape suddenly opened up, and there, far ahead, a city appeared, floating in the darkness. At its center stood what appeared to be several enormous towers, with red, blinking lights running up and down their sides. We stared at them, mesmerized. They looked like something out of the future, something that didn\u2019t exist yet. What were they? Skyscrapers?", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the town?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cDuluth,\u201d Peter said.", "\u201cNever heard of it,\u201d I said.", "\u201cBob Dylan grew up here,\u201d he said.", "\u201cReally? Here?\u201d", "Duluth, in Minnesota, is in fact a twin city with Superior, right across the state border in Wisconsin. Together they look down on Lake Superior. We drove into an industrial harbor area in Duluth, where the red lights of the mysterious towers on the hill above disappeared from our sight. Peter pulled over to look for a good bar on his cellphone, and we ended up across an inlet in Superior, at a place called Izzy\u2019s BBQ Lounge and Grill.", "After spending the entire day in the car, with little but woods and lakes to look at, it was a shock to the senses to open the door and enter a bar full of people, lights, movement and music. We each ordered a beer and a Jack Daniel\u2019s and sat down at a table. The place was filled almost exclusively with people in their 20s. And it was a karaoke bar. A big man with a red beard went up on stage, and, when the song started playing \u2014 it sounded like something by Kid Rock \u2014 he grabbed the microphone and let out a couple of rhythmic roars. When he started singing, it was superb, he was really good. Enlivened by it all, the heat, the crowd, the music, the whiskey and the delicious beer, I opened my backpack and took out my notebook, opened it and started to write.", "\u201cHa ha ha! You mean you\u2019re actually going to take notes?\u201d Peter was incredulous. \u201cYou haven\u2019t written a single note during the whole trip, and now you want to do it here?\u201d", "I laughed along with him. It struck me that this was the first time I had laughed in the U.S. This was great!", "Peter ordered chicken wings and some more drinks. I watched a rodeo on TV while he was gone. It seemed as if everyone knew one another. All of them, without exception, wore black. A lot of hooded sweatshirts, a lot of black jeans, a lot of boots. It seemed as if the \u201990s had never ended in here.", "An older black man, Izzy himself, as we quickly learned, came over to our table and asked if everything was O.K. Peter talked to him for a while, told him who we were, asked about the place.", "After the fourth round of beer and whiskey, we started playing darts. Peter explained that I had to throw the darts in an arc, up a little first, aim over the target. If there is one thing I can\u2019t stand, one thing I really loathe, it\u2019s when people tell me what to do. So I threw the darts straight ahead, even though I quickly realized that I was going to get clobbered by Peter, who tossed the darts lightly and almost daintily into the air, so that they struck the red inner circle.", "While we stood there throwing darts, one of the bartenders came over to us, a black woman in her 20s.", "\u201cIs it true that you\u2019re from Norway?\u201d she asked.", "I nodded.", "\u201cI\u2019m Norwegian, too!\u201d she said.", "\u201cReally?\u201d I said.", "\u201cYeah, my great-grandmother was from Norway. But I\u2019ve never been there. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re from Norway!\u201d", "She was beaming with enthusiasm and joy. I questioned her a little, and it turned out she was Izzy\u2019s daughter, Sharita Turner \u2014 she was 22 and getting her master\u2019s degree in chemical biology. She didn\u2019t know much about her great-grandmother\u2019s life in Norway, but she called her mother while she stood there, and explained the situation: Someone from Norway\u2019s here! Where was it that great-grandmother came from? When did she come here?", "Her name was Johannah Johnson, it turned out, and she came to the U.S. in 1868.", "Sharita asked me what Norway was like. I said it was about the same as here. She asked me what I was doing here, I told her that I was writing an article about Norway and Norwegianness in the U.S., that I\u2019d been to see the Viking settlements in Newfoundland and was now in Minnesota to write about the great Norwegian immigration here.", "\u201cSo us meeting you here is incredibly weird,\u201d I said.", "\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really wild,\u201d she said.", "Peter took a photo of her, and then one of her, her father and her half sister.", "\u201cIsn\u2019t it incredible?\u201d I said to Peter. \u201cThat the first Norwegian I meet in the U.S. is black?\u201d", "\u201cPeople are going to think you\u2019ve put an enormous amount of effort into researching this article, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.", "When I woke up the next morning, I had an anxiety attack. I lay there for a long time, staring out at the empty room. The last thing I could remember was that I had gotten into an elevator. I had no recollection of seeing the room before. Everything was terrible, everything was diseased and I was a ridiculous, laughable character. Oh, God, what an idiot I was.", "I had talked.", "To total strangers, I had babbled away. With no dignity whatsoever, happy and enthusiastic over every little thing. I had given compliments! My eyes had filled up with tears at my own human warmth and goodness.", "Oh, Jesus, was I an idiot.", "With an act of will I swung my feet to the floor, sat there for a few minutes, then got dressed with a new act of will and went down to the breakfast room.", "There was no way around it now. I would have to call Mark.", "Might as well get it over with, I thought, and went outside into the street. I took out my cellphone, dialed the number.", "\u201cHello?\u201d", "\u201cIs this Mark Hatloy?\u201d", "\u201cYes, it is.\u201d", "I introduced myself, told him we were related, I was writing an article about Norway in the U.S., could I come for a visit?", "\u201cWhen were you thinking?\u201d", "\u201cThis afternoon?\u201d", "Peter wanted to see Bob Dylan\u2019s childhood home, so we drove there first; it was just a few blocks away, up a steep hill behind the hotel. It looked exactly like all the other houses in the neighborhood, a small wooden duplex with a grassy patch in front. There was no sign indicating that Bob Dylan grew up here, nor was there a statue of him. That seemed appropriate, for in contrast to the other 1960s artists who were still alive, there was nothing about Bob Dylan to remind one of a statue, nothing about his music or his role had become rigid or clearly defined, no final form enclosed him. In fact, it was as if he weren\u2019t really a person at all, but had somehow dissolved into his music. His old songs were constantly in motion, and the new songs emerged from the same stream. As he traveled around, permanently on tour, you couldn\u2019t tell what came from him and what belonged to the American song tradition; he was just playing the music. On \u201cThe Basement Tapes,\u201d you can hear how he discovers this mode for the first time, how he begins to live in the music, as he keeps tossing out one tune after the other, song after song, some of it fantastic, some of it junk, some of it interesting, some of it nonsense, and it doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest, for the whole point is the lightness; that all demands for perfection and completion, for flawlessness, have been suspended; and the motion.", "All writers, artists and musicians know the feeling: when you disappear into what you are doing, lose yourself in it and are no longer aware that you exist, while at the same time the feeling of existing is profound and total and what you make is never better. Work created in this state really shouldn\u2019t be published in the artist\u2019s name, because it has been created precisely by the artist\u2019s nonpersonal, nonindividual, selfless side. Bob Dylan is the master of the selfless self, the king of the not-one\u2019s-one, a deeply paradoxical figure who lived and breathed the music of this deeply paradoxical country.", "\u201cI know it\u2019s idiotic,\u201d Peter said, \u201cbut could you take a photo of me in front of his house?\u201d", "Afterward, Peter wanted to take some more photos of Duluth and Superior, and I drove slowly over the long bridges that connected them above the port area while he took shot after shot through the open window. The sky was gray, the concrete was gray, the snow that pressed against the side of the road was gray, and the landscape that spread out beneath us, full of warehouses, cranes, silos, fences, access roads and quays, and beyond, enormous factories spewing out smoke \u2014 all of this was gray, too. I couldn\u2019t believe this was the same magical place we had seen the previous evening, when we emerged from the dark woods and saw those enormous, blinking red towers stretching toward the sky.", "In the daylight, we now saw that they were not towers, not skyscrapers, but simply a row of slender antennas, the very plainest kind, for transmitting radio, phone or TV signals.", "On the other side of Duluth, the road continued through the wooded Minnesota landscape, the blazing sunlight filtering through the treetops creating ceaseless, shadowy patterns on the snow-covered asphalt. I had told Mark we would arrive around 5 p.m., but it soon became obvious that we would never get there on time. I tried texting him, but the message didn\u2019t go through, probably because there was no money left on my phone account. Peter offered to call him, and I accepted gladly.", "When he hung up, Peter said that Mark sounded like the archetypal American. I asked him what he meant. He shrugged, it was nothing specific, just the way he spoke.", "I considered the strangeness of that: That everything Norwegian, all that was particular to the west coast of Norway and to the Hatl\u00f8y family, had been completely obliterated in just two generations in the U.S. If it had been my grandfather Johannes who had emigrated instead of his younger brother Magnus, I could have been the one sitting there, up in North Dakota, an American waiting for my Norwegian relative who was roughly the same age as me and to my surprise had announced his arrival this very Sunday.", "I told Peter. He laughed and said he had never met anyone less American than me.", "Magnus Hatl\u00f8y was a Norwegian when he emigrated to the United States in 1926. When I saw him for the first time, more than 50 years later, his name was Magnus Hatloy, and he was an American. Some years ago, I was sent copies of several letters from my mother\u2019s family, among them some from Magnus\u2019s first years in the new country. He had no education, no money; he left home with no clear plans or prospects, going alone by ship to New York. Everything must have seemed uncertain and precarious to him. He went northwest, to Grafton, where he did odd jobs and saved money to buy his own land. The first years were rough. In one letter from 1929 he writes that he has been cheated out of $400. He had spent two summers working for a man by the name of John Hopperstad, who, it turned out, went bankrupt and was unable to pay his wages.", "When Magnus wrote this, he was working on a farm. He wanted to quit, but times were so hard that there was no other work to be had. He wrote home that he was attending \u201ccorrespondence school\u201d to become a railway man and hoped he would be hired in the spring. He also wrote that he hadn\u2019t seen Martha, the Norwegian girl he met on the Atlantic passage, for eight months, but she sent him a letter twice a week.", "In the summer of 1932, times were still bad. Now, Martha wrote home. She was working as a domestic servant for a rich family in Oak Park, outside Chicago.", "In fact, within a year Magnus and Martha would be married and have their first child, David. They lived in two rooms with no furniture of their own, but they had bought a radio, Martha wrote, and it lightened up the place.", "David was my mother\u2019s cousin, and it was his son we were now on our way to see, presumably on the same farm where Magnus and Martha lived until they died.", "Late in the afternoon, the landscape began to change, for the first time in three days. It happened gradually and almost imperceptibly. A snow-covered field might appear among the trees to the right, a snow-covered meadow among the trees to the left. There was more open land, and eventually the clumps of trees became the exception, and farms appeared, with big barns and towering silos. Soon the plains stretched out endlessly on both sides, an utterly flat, utterly white landscape. The sun burned soundlessly in the lofty blue sky. It was enormous, and I glanced at it now and then. I had never seen the sun that big.", "A factory appeared in the distance, its white smoke a long ribbon across the blue sky, immobile as a photograph. Nothing moved except the little cars speeding along the highway. As if burdened by light, the sun slowly sank toward the horizon. The blue of the sky, which all that day had been open and full of light, seemed to contract, as if the light were being sucked out of it.", "We crossed an old iron bridge and entered North Dakota. In the little border town we turned right, and for the next few miles we had the sun at our backs, until it finally sank out of sight and the darkness back east rose like water in a tank, from the ground up into the sky, where the stars appeared one after the other. For long periods, the darkness extended unbroken to both sides, occasionally perforated by small clusters of lights from solitary farm buildings or homes.", "It felt as if we were driving into the depths of something.", "Around 7 p.m., we drove up to Mark\u2019s house. It lay by itself far out on an empty plain, surrounded by darkness. When we got out, the cold seemed to grab hold of my cheeks, digging its claws into them.", "The door opened, a man came out.", "\u201cKarl Ove?\u201d he said.", "\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said and went over to him.", "\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said.", "\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cIncredibly nice of you to receive us on such short notice.\u201d", "\u201cYou were lucky,\u201d he said, \u201cthat much I can say. Come on in!\u201d", "The house was big, spacious and appeared to have been recently built. There were children\u2019s drawings hanging in the kitchen and photos of a boy and a girl. The TV was on in the living room, tuned to a football game.", "\u201cWould you like something to drink? Coffee? Beer?\u201d", "\u201cMaybe a coffee,\u201d I said. \u201cOr wait, no, a beer, if you have any.\u201d", "He opened the fridge, took out a Bud Light and handed it to me. There was something familiar about his facial features, but I was unable to place them more precisely or trace them back to a particular person he resembled.", "This was the first American home I had visited. Everything was well ordered; the long kitchen counter, a slab of something that looked like granite, was practically empty, and so was the kitchen table. That gave the place an air of bachelor life, a sense that the kitchen had been built for many people, but was being used by only one.", "\u201cNice place you\u2019ve got,\u201d I said.", "\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI built it myself.\u201d", "\u201cDid you? That\u2019s impressive.\u201d", "\u201cCome here, I\u2019ll show you something.\u201d", "We went over to a painting on the wall, a small farmhouse with a barn next to it.", "\u201cThis house belonged to grandfather and grandmother. I tore it down and built a new one in the same place. But I left the barn standing.\u201d", "He told me that they built the first house the way they built them in Norway. It had been so plain that Martha protested. It didn\u2019t help that the barn was both bigger and more elaborate.", "\u201cThe old house was full of Norwegian stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cRunners and tablecloths, that kind of thing. I packed everything away in boxes, didn\u2019t have the heart to throw it out.\u201d", "\u201cDo you think they missed Norway?\u201d", "\u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m sure they did. For instance, they would sit in the kitchen listening to Norwegian news on the radio when I was a kid, I remember.\u201d", "We sat down on the sofa in the living room. A book with pictures of airplanes on the cover lay open on the coffee table, next to a magazine about flying.", "\u201cNow explain to me exactly who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cWho you\u2019re the son of.\u201d", "I told him that my grandfather had four children: Kjellaug, Sissel, Ingunn and Kjartan, and that I was Sissel\u2019s son.", "\u201cI named my son after Kjartan,\u201d he said. \u201cSpelled the American way, of course. Charton.\u201d", "\u201cMy uncle will be pleased to hear that,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s a poet. A very good poet.\u201d", "\u201cI met him when I was there. But he wasn\u2019t a poet then, was he?\u201d", "\u201cHe worked at a shipyard for many years.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s right! As a plumber?\u201d", "\u201cRight. He was a communist. So he chose to become a proletarian, out of solidarity with the people.\u201d", "Mark told me what he knew about his grandparents\u2019 first years in the new country. In 1932, they moved to Minneapolis, where Magnus drove fuel trucks. It wasn\u2019t until 1947 that they bought this plot of land. Both of their children moved away as soon as they were old enough, and they never came back. Mark grew up in Wisconsin, but when he went back to college in Grand Forks to become a mechanical engineer at age 25, he moved in with his grandfather, whose farm was just an hour away from campus, at first with no thought of staying on after he graduated. When Mark had the idea that he could eventually take over the farm, Magnus laid down harsh terms; at first he had to rent it, at the going rate. But the life out here suited him, and in addition to farming his own land, he also began to manufacture farm equipment. As the oil business boomed, he expanded into drilling equipment. Now he traveled all around the world, negotiating contracts and at the same time buying more land and expanding the farm, which had grown from 160 acres in Magnus\u2019s day to more than 1,800 acres today. He owned two planes, a small one for pleasure and a bigger one for business, and he had his own runway on the property.", "The best parts of his life, he said, apart from his children, were the summer mornings when he climbed into his plane, rose into the sky and flew over this landscape, green and lush and drenched in the light of the rising sun.", "After a while I went out to smoke, and Mark joined me, lighting my cigarette with his lighter before he lit his own. The dark stretched out endlessly before us.", "\u201cWhen it blows around here, it blows like no other place on earth,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you imagine what it was like for the first immigrants who came here? They practically lived in a hole in the ground. And the blizzards can go on for weeks. Six weeks, my grandparents were snowed in here once.\u201d", "He looked at me.", "\u201cThey must have been fleeing from something, the people who came here. That\u2019s what I often think. Something must have driven them out.\u201d", "\u201cPoverty,\u201d I said.", "He nodded.", "\u201cYour grandfather was pretty wide-eyed when he came over here and saw this farm,\u201d Mark said. \u201cNot just because it was big, but because it\u2019s so flat.\u201d", "\u201cHe was a very sociable man,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was someone people crowded around at weddings and parties, because of the stories he told.\u201d", "\u201cMagnus was like that, too. I still meet people who remember him when I travel around. He sold silos. So when they see my name, they tell me they bought their silo from Hatloy.\u201d", "Grandfather, who had sat here in the evenings watching TV without understanding a single word one hot summer 30 years ago, had something American about him, that\u2019s what I had always felt. Not just his pronounced sociability, the fact that he talked to everybody, but also his restlessness and all the projects he started up, hoping they would make him rich, like when he started breeding mink on his farm. Toward the end of his life, he often spoke with admiration of the neighbors who started farming salmon in the fjord; it had turned them into millionaires and, though he didn\u2019t say so, it was clear that he wished it had been he who had taken the risk and realized the profit. His advice to us for the future was to go into oil.", "Nothing would have pleased him more than to learn that Magnus\u2019s grandson had become a rich man in America. If he had lived to see it, it would have been one of the stories he told.", "We decided to have dinner together in Grand Forks, then Peter and I would go on to Fargo and spend the night there, so we could get to Alexandria in time and see the museum there the next morning.", "I rode with Mark in his huge Chevy S.U.V. He told me about his family, his children, his brother, his life, in a forthright and confiding manner, which was incompatible with one of my roles, that of a writer commissioned to write an article for an American magazine, but not with the other, that we were family.", "It felt odd, getting so close to a man whom I had met for the first time a few hours ago, who was so American in everything he said and did. And yet somehow I felt as if I knew him. Why the feeling of intimacy? Because our grandfathers were brothers?", "There was nothing about the house or about him, neither the way he dressed nor his behavior, to indicate that he was particularly wealthy. When he talked about his Norwegian heritage, what he emphasized was the work ethic. He worked constantly. He had the farm, which he ran himself with hired help in the spring and summer; he had the company, where he was still involved in sales and product design; and in recent years he had also built the new house.", "The Protestant work ethic here was very familiar to me. Johannes hadn\u2019t had it, and probably not Magnus either; they had been cheerful men with more dreams than they had will to realize them, at least my grandfather. My mother\u2019s mother had the work ethic, and she had passed it on to my mother, who had just retired, and who missed her job in the same way, as she put it, a cow misses its pen.", "That, too, is something I have inherited. I can\u2019t be unoccupied, I can\u2019t take a vacation, I can\u2019t relax; even reading a book, which is actually part of my job, makes me feel guilty. It\u2019s not work, it\u2019s enjoyment. At the same time, and this is obvious, what lies behind this need to be occupied is not just a moral sensibility; working all the time is also a way to simplify life, to parry its demands, especially the demand to be happy.", "We parted outside the restaurant a few hours later, and Peter and I went on to Fargo. In the darkness, the road ahead of us seemed to be perpetually curving downward in the light of the headlamps, as if we were driving down an endless slope; it was an optical illusion, maybe because I was so tired, but I was unable to shake it off.", "We spent the night at a cheap motel and drove on early next morning, through a world so cold and frozen that the few movements we saw beyond the windows seemed to run counter to nature. Alexandria turned out to be a small and quiet town surrounded by farms and flat fields. Back home, thinking ahead to this trip, I imagined Alexandria as a bustling place, densely built and concentrated around its main streets, whereas in reality it was just the opposite, spread out and open and deserted. For some reason, I pictured the museum in the Modernist style, a daring if fairly small building, with the Kensington Runestone standing alone behind glass in an elegant room with a black stone floor. The museum we parked in front of that afternoon looked very different; it could have been a post office or small warehouse. And a gigantic statue, which we now stared at open-mouthed, set in a small park on the other side of the road, was as remote from the Le Corbusier- and Giacometti-esque style that I had unconsciously attributed to the museum as it was possible to get: With its conspicuous wings jutting from the helmet, yellow hair, bulging muscles and fiery red cape, it looked like a big joke.", "The museum director, Jim Bergquist, a small, bearded man with glasses, wearing a Marius knit sweater like the one every child in Norway wore when I was growing up, met us at the door. Bergquist was friendly and talkative, with an above-normal interest in Norway, where he had roots, and pronounced every Norwegian place name with careful diction. After introducing us to the museum staff, he offered us coffee and cake. Then, still holding the white plastic cup in my hand, I followed him into the room containing the museum objects.", "There it was. The Kensington Runestone.", "It was maybe 30 inches tall and was placed inside a display case.", "I knew the Vikings were my ancestors, but to me, they belonged to the world of the imagination, and that is why setting foot in Newfoundland, in the place where they had once gone ashore on this continent, was so shocking. That is what they had been after, the people who carved these runes into the stone: the power that a physical and material presence bestows on immaterial history.", "But the sight of this stone didn\u2019t awaken anything within me.", "Was it me? Had I closed my mind to the depth of history? Or was it the stone?", "I walked around it a few times, noticing that the inscription ran on, around one side. The runic inscriptions I had seen earlier, back home, were all short and pithy, whereas this was practically a novella.", "The inscription on the other side dated the stone to 1362, more than 300 years after the Vikings first set foot in Newfoundland. Maybe that was why it was different.", "On the wall were placards telling the story of the stone: the inscription, the English translation, the circumstances surrounding its discovery in the 1890s, a map showing the documented Viking settlements in Newfoundland, with arrows pointing along the rivers and waterways they might have followed all the way to Minnesota.", "Bergquist, the museum director, spoke about the stone as if it were authentic. As if 30 Vikings \u2014 22 Norwegians and eight Goths \u2014 had actually come here in the 14th century and, after being attacked by Native Americans, carved their short narrative into this stone.", "But did it matter whether it was authentic or not?", "Hadn\u2019t this country been built on the promise of avoiding this very question?", "Now Bergquist guided us to the rest of the museum. One room hosted many objects from the early-settler era, nearly all of them of Scandinavian origin; things I recognized from home, all the rustic antiques with Norwegian rosemaling. There were artifacts acquired from the Ojibwe and Dakota tribes who had settled here. Peter looked at one placard, which described the events of the Dakota War of 1862, when several bands of Dakota took up arms against settlers, and eventually against the U.S. Army. They lost, of course. There wasn\u2019t much about Native Americans here, and Peter wondered why the museum\u2019s curators had decided to focus on this violent episode. \u201cWere these guys really even the aggressors?\u201d he asked. It was a good question; Peter noticed a lot of things I had missed on this trip. When I looked up the war later, I found that the Native Americans revolted in reaction to a series of treaty violations, and after they lost, 38 of them were hanged on a single day, still the biggest mass execution in the nation\u2019s history.", "We continued into a small room with items from the Civil War and the two world wars, then we went out in the back, where someone had relocated an old general store, a log cabin and a one-room schoolhouse. Beyond them was another hall with a three-quarter replica of a Viking ship, a huge steam tractor and an array of other farm machinery.", "In short, it was a museum that covered the entire history of America.", "The striking thing was how modest it all was, how insignificant the objects that were meant to represent the country\u2019s entire momentous history turned out to be. How clumsily the paintings illustrating the various epochs were made. How awkward the overarching Viking theme was, from the winged helmet of the giant statue outside that beckoned to visitors, to the attempts to substantiate the theory that the Vikings actually came here, before any other Europeans, in the 14th century.", "Yes, there was something homespun and makeshift and, frankly, childish about the whole thing.", "And I loved it.", "I loved it not only because I had finally seen something in the United States that Humbert and Lolita could have seen \u2014 a fabulous entry for Nabokov\u2019s catalog of American monuments, wonders and reconstructions \u2014 but also because it struck me that the image of reality that this particular reconstruction presented was, in a curious way, absolutely true.", "It was liberating to see how small and insignificant each separate part of this history was, compared with our notions about its grandness. It felt liberating, because that is what the world is really like, full of insignificant trifles that we use to blunder on as best we can, one by one, whether we happen to be 19th-century immigrants building a log cabin in some forest glade, cold and miserable, longing to sit motionless for a few hours in front of the fire; or a local museum director in a Norwegian children\u2019s sweater; or a crafty Swede, carving runes into a stone and burying it in a field in an attempt to change world history.

Josh and his wife, Cornelia (Naomi Watts), befriend Jamie and Darby, a 25-year-old married couple who open a portal into a new, cool parallel universe. It\u2019s still New York, but it\u2019s totally different. There are \u201cstreet beach\u201d parties and ayahuasca ceremonies, artisanal restaurants and thrift shops.

Josh and Cornelia, who decided not to have children after a series of miscarriages, seem to have more in common with Jamie and Darby in any case. And also more to learn from them.

When no one can remember the word \u201cmarzipan,\u201d Josh pulls out his phone to Google it, but Jamie and Darby stop him. \u201cLet\u2019s just not know,\u201d Jamie says.", "Is that wisdom or willful ignorance? Either way, Mr. Baumbach is, as usual, a piquant observer of the manners and morals of the various demographic subsets of the white, urban lower-upper-middle class. He is without peer among screenwriters as a composer of incisive, non-punchline-driven comic dialogue, and unrivaled among directors as a choreographer of fraught social encounters.", "He is also, like many a child of his era, obsessed with the finer points of pop-cultural taste. \u201cI remember when this song was just supposed to be bad,\u201d Josh marvels when Jamie, with apparent sincerity, plays \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d for inspiration. Josh\u2019s relationship with music and movies is based on sorting and rating, whereas his new bro seems to take everything as equivalent, without regard for categories like high and low, or even good and bad. Josh and Jamie are equally objects of gentle satire (which sharpens as the movie goes on), but Mr. Baumbach also honors both of their sensibilities, compulsively combining and repurposing the detritus of the recent past in the hope that some kind of meaning will emerge from it.", "The most brilliant example of this lies not in the plot or the d\u00e9cor but the casting. In addition to Mr. Horovitz \u2014 some of us know him better as Ad-Rock \u2014 \u201cWhile We\u2019re Young\u201d features Peter Yarrow as a curmudgeonly left-wing intellectual.

If you were born during the Johnson or Nixon administrations and drifted from a progressive nursery school toward a liberal arts college, that\u2019s pretty much the story of your life right there.", "Or maybe not quite. I have some problems with this movie, not all of which can be ascribed to the usual narcissism of small differences. But first it\u2019s important to acknowledge the acuity of Mr. Baumbach\u2019s insight and his overall generosity of spirit. Generosity, as it happens, is the film\u2019s key ethical principle. It\u2019s the quality Josh most admires in Jamie and Darby and finds most lacking in himself. A documentary filmmaker who has spent most of a decade working on a sprawling, incomplete project on \u201cpower in America,\u201d Josh marvels at his young friends\u2019 apparent indifference to success, at their open, eager embrace of experience. He and Cornelia seem crabbed and cautious by comparison.", "There is another generational specter haunting them, Josh in particular. He finds himself squeezed on one side by Jamie, an aspiring documentarian guilelessly seeking a mentor, and on the other by Cornelia\u2019s father, Leslie (Charles Grodin), a beloved old lion of the heroic cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 era. Leslie\u2019s name is invoked alongside those of Frederick Wiseman, D. A. Pennebaker and the Maysles brothers, and he stands for an honest, rugged, socially conscious brand of filmmaking that both Jamie and Josh admire. But while Leslie could believe in an ideal of truth in cinema and Jamie can just go out and shoot great stuff, Josh finds himself tangled up in overthinking and qualification. Pitching his unfinished masterpiece to a hedge-fund friend of Jamie\u2019s, Josh is unable to say exactly what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about so many complicated things, including \u201cthe very possibility of making this film.\u201d", "Of course. And this film, Mr. Baumbach\u2019s movie, mostly brings a light touch and a forgiving gloss to its own self-consciousness. It is not afraid to be implicated in the confusion \u2014 in the self-involvement, the anxiety, the pettiness \u2014 it depicts. But there are also areas where it feels soft and compromised, where the subtlety and clarity of Mr. Baumbach\u2019s vision seem to desert him. The last section, while it has a few fine, farcical moments, goes astray in trying to recapture flagging comic momentum and slides toward chaotic Greenbergian hostility. The inevitable complications in what had seemed to be a perfect friendship are not quite credible, and the movie seems uncertain how to handle them.", "These tonal and procedural fumblings expose a more serious blind spot. Josh, Jamie and Leslie are all vividly drawn and intricately shaded characters, but Darby and Cornelia, in spite of Ms. Seyfried\u2019s quickness and Ms. Watts\u2019s incomparable emotional range, are blurry and sketchy in comparison. They have a lesser share in the story.", "Ambition in this movie, as in Judd Apatow\u2019s somewhat similar \u201cThis Is 40,\u201d is a guy thing. Men make movies. Women make ice cream or babies, or help the men make their movies. The frustrations and identity crises that plague poor Josh \u2014 his rivalries with older and younger men, his failure to live up to his early promise \u2014 are large and central. Whatever analogous problems Cornelia might have are circumscribed and peripheral, and exist entirely in terms of her relationships with the men in her life.", "At times the movie seems aware of the limitations of its own perspective, and struggles against them. Fletcher is a stay-at-home dad; Darby experiences a feminist awakening, though nobody quite calls it that. But in spite of those moments, and in spite of the happy, good-humored companionship that exists between Josh and Cornelia, Mr. Baumbach never quite grants the women in the movie equal access to their own lives, or to the audience\u2019s empathy. His title turns out to be doubly ironic: We\u2019re not really young, and we\u2019re not really \u201cwe.\u201d", "\u201cWhile We\u2019re Young\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

That transaction \u2012 a so-called inversion, in which AbbVie would have moved its corporate residence abroad \u2012 was driven in large part by a desire to lower its taxes.

The prosaic routine of paperwork somehow diminished her sense of accomplishment. Not even the seller was present to hear what she yearned to say.", "She was only buying a Cape Cod on a small patch of lawn in a blue-collar neighborhood in New Jersey. Yet she and her two daughters had already named the place \u201cPalais de Triomphe,\u201d palace of triumph. The house symbolized her liberation from an arranged marriage, threats of violence at the hands of her estranged husband, and indeed the entire insular community of stringently Orthodox Jews among whom she had spent her entire life.", "In that moment of emancipation, Ms. Reiss also felt the sudden, unbidden summons of obligation. \u201cThe house meant that I\u2019ve gotten to the other side,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI wanted to do something to give back. I wanted to use my pain to help others in the same situation. And, selfishly, I thought that would help me heal.\u201d", "Four years later, on a blustery morning early this month, Ms. Reiss, 40, stood in a classroom at Rutgers University in Newark telling her story to three dozen lawyers. She spoke with well-practiced pacing and emphasis \u2014 childhood in Brooklyn, coerced betrothal in her teens to a man she barely knew, and then the harassment and stalking and death threats, all of it documented in court papers. Finally, there was college and therapy and, after 15 years of marriage, divorce.", "Ms. Reiss spoke with a very specific purpose. The lawyers were attending a continuing education course sponsored by Unchained at Last, the nonprofit group that she founded four years ago to help women extricate themselves from arranged marriages. Her hope was that some of the lawyers would be moved to represent Unchained at Last\u2019s clients without charge.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a moral imperative,\u201d said Katherine Francis, a corporate lawyer from the Trenton area, after Ms. Reiss\u2019s presentation. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even planned to be here, but you know how you start a Google search and wander? And all of a sudden I saw this class and thought, \u2018Hmm, there\u2019s the universe talking.\u2019 \u201d", "Unchained at Last operates in the contested crossroad between the modern secular concept of marriage for love between consenting adults and longstanding ethnic or communal customs of arranged marriage. Religion does not require such marriage, but is very often invoked to provide moral justification for it. And the laws of certain faiths, Orthodox Judaism in particular, give a husband the sole right to grant a divorce.", "A reliable estimate of arranged marriages is difficult because the definition is inexact. But the Tahirih Justice Center, an advocacy group for immigrant women, reported that about 3,000 cases of \u201cforced marriage\u201d took place in the United States from 2009 through 2011.", "Almost all of the 90 women whom Unchained at Last has helped had been pressured into marriage by their religious community: Orthodox Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Mormon, Unification Church. Most lived in the New York area, though one was in Arizona. The women\u2019s nations of origin stretch through Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.", "On a basic level, Unchained at Last provides legal services because most of the women\u2019s cases involve divorce and child custody litigation, and some extend into immigration status and restraining orders against a violent spouse. Because the clients\u2019 situations can be so catastrophic \u2014 forced at gunpoint to accept a marriage, raped by a husband, essentially imprisoned within the home as a domestic servant \u2014 Unchained at Last also provides mentoring, access to therapy and cash stipends for everything from basic clothing to English as a second language class.", "Ms. Reiss\u2019s earliest collaborator was Shehnaz Abdeljaber, a Rutgers classmate of Palestinian Muslim ancestry. In their barrier-crossing friendship, the women discovered a common bond. Ms. Abdeljaber had been pushed by her parents into an engagement to a young man from her extended family whom she had never met. Though she managed to break off the engagement, the broader issue intrigued her.", "\u201cFrom the day I met Fraidy, I knew she was going to be part of my life,\u201d Ms. Abdeljaber wrote in an email. \u201cLittle did I know that we weren\u2019t going to be just friends. We became sisters, family and partners with her vision.\u201d", "In early 2011, Unchained at Last incorporated in New Jersey. Ms. Abdeljaber became the first president of the group\u2019s board, which also included a Hindu woman, Kavitha Rajagopalan.", "The annual budget back then came to barely $20,000, most of it from Ms. Reiss\u2019s pocket. By now, Unchained at Last has a $3.4 million budget, with about $200,000 in donations from individuals and foundations and $3.2 million in free services from participating lawyers. In her own life, Ms. Reiss has become an atheist, and, after several years as a journalist, she became a private investigator.", "Most clients find the group through word-of-mouth. At the outset, Ms. Reiss said, the organization struggled to find enough volunteer lawyers. Child-custody litigation is particularly difficult. Religious communities have been successful at times in turning out large numbers to paint Unchained\u2019s client as an \u201cunfit mother\u201d because she has left the theological corral.", "That has not deterred Ms. Reiss. Unchained at Last successfully lobbied in the New Jersey State Legislature last year for a law easing crime victims\u2019 access to court records. This week, Ms. Reiss took part in an initial planning session held by the White House Council on Women and Girls to develop a national policy on forced marriage.", "Even in its more sophisticated form, though, Unchained at Last has retained the personal touch of what the Rev. Henri Nouwen, writing about ministry, called the \u201cwounded healer.\u201d Ditty Weiss, for one, experienced it.", "After 10 years in an abusive marriage, Ms. Weiss decided to risk leaving both her husband and their fervently Orthodox community. The only problem was that she had no idea who could help her. In a sort of desperate whim, Ms. Weiss sent an email to Deborah Feldman, the author of an acclaimed memoir, \u201cUnorthodox,\u201d about her rejection of the Satmar Hasidic sect in which she had grown up.", "Ms. Feldman steered Ms. Weiss to Ms. Reiss, who soon lined up two volunteer lawyers from a prominent Manhattan firm. When Ms. Weiss needed cancer surgery, Ms. Reiss babysat for her children. And as Ms. Weiss underwent chemotherapy, Unchained at Last gave her money to hire an au pair and a buy a used car.", "\u201cI cannot even describe,\u201d Ms. Weiss recalled, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to have an angel sweep down and kiss you on the forehead and then hold your hand and tell you, \u2018I\u2019m not letting go until you\u2019re O.K.\u2019 \u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/03/10/inside-the-kleiner-perkins-trial-reporters-notebook/": ["During the dot-com boom, reporters could actually gain access to the big stars.

He is worth $3.5 billion, and did not appear too thrilled to be in court. Kleiner might have largely missed investing in the social media boom, but understood that every tweet about it during this trial could weaken its mystique. Mr. Doerr conveyed his boyish enthusiasm for all things tech, but probably did not help his case when his lawyer asked him what companies led by women he had funded during the time in question, and he had trouble bringing any to mind (his lawyer rescued him with a list).", "The Superior Court judge, Harold Kahn, shares with the valley a lack of formality. He does not demand that everyone rise when he enters. He lets the jurors ask questions, a somewhat new courtroom tactic. He makes jokes. But the court generally eschews the high-tech products of the valley. Exhibits are handed around in thick binders, not iPads. The judge has a microphone but I still can\u2019t hear him half the time. There is wireless, but hardly any jacks for the journalists to plug into.", "Somewhat surprisingly, the courtroom is rarely more than half full, even on Monday morning when Ms. Pao began her long-awaited testimony. When you can follow the events through the voluminous coverage, there might be no need to be in the audience yourself.", "So far, at least, the trial reveals a world in which even the entry-level people make bundles of money but otherwise have the same squabbles over credit and who is getting ahead that are found in any office. The jury members \u2014 including a prison nurse and a teacher\u2019s aide \u2014 seem unusually attentive, and their questions cut through the rhetoric.

The rest were acquired posthumously by the Yosemite Park Company, a local hotel operator, which stashed them in a sawmill attic. That building burned down, too, in 1943, taking the negatives with it.", "To the extent that he is remembered at all, Fiske is best known as the man who introduced the photographer Ansel Adams, Yosemite\u2019s most iconic chronicler, to the park. As a child, Adams was captivated by \u2018\u2018In the Heart of the Sierras,\u2019\u2019 an 1888 book that featured Fiske\u2019s Yosemite photographs, and he persuaded his parents to vacation there in 1916.

Implementing strict feeding and sleeping schedules and nurturing an intimacy that extends to secret breast-\u00adfeeding, she emerges a far more graceful mother than Nina.

Not only does she spend every day with her daughter; her stricken mother is also making a surprising recovery, which Maria attributes to her own care of Bonacieux. Yet rather than do all she can to protect this delicate operation, Maria hastens its demise \u2014 and both the shrewdness and the suspense that propelled the earlier chapters are lost. As the Prices turn on each other and Maria berates herself for ruining the \u201cperfect family for her daughter,\u201d her admission rings hollow.

Its steady tone of understated realism serves the story well right up until Maria\u2019s volatile emotions come into play, when the reportorial voice seems less understated than ill suited, overly analytical and clipped. If Maria\u2019s decisions are believable, her motivations feel merely summarized, and I was left with the sense I had been told her story without quite living it. I didn\u2019t question Maria giving up her baby, missing her baby or inserting herself into the Prices\u2019 lives.

For some industry observers and market analysts, Facebook\u2019s reliance on money from other app companies looks like the making of an unsustainable monoculture \u2014 not a lasting business, but something spun up in the heady froth of a venture capital smoothie.", "\u201cThere are now a number of revenue streams that are being driven by venture dollars,\u201d Bill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist who has been warning of a tech bubble, said recently in an onstage interview at South by Southwest in Austin, Tex. \u201cFacebook and a little bit of Twitter\u2019s revenues are now coming heavily from mobile downloads. These are ads for, like, Game of War with Kate Upton. Those ads are now an increasing percentage of their revenue, and they\u2019re being spent by these excessive venture dollars.\u201d", "The notion that Facebook and other social networks will suffer most deeply when the bubble bursts sounds plausible because it rehashes the last tech boom and bust, when advertising revenue run-ups at huge web portals (remember those?) turned out to be funded mainly by venture capital investments. In 2001, revenue at Yahoo \u2014 the largest portal, and something like the Facebook of its time \u2014 plummeted by almost $400 million when start-ups stopped spending during the bust. Yahoo has never recovered its former glory. Could Facebook face the same fate?", "Probably not \u2014 or not yet, at least. On closer inspection, the theory that Facebook\u2019s growth depends on unsustainable venture capital is mostly overblown, another strain of Facebook Second Guessing Syndrome. It\u2019s a story that misses important facts about Facebook\u2019s advertising business. For one thing, as Facebook\u2019s executives have repeatedly pointed out, ads from app companies make up a small percentage of the company\u2019s overall business. Most of the social network\u2019s revenue comes from video ads and ads for large brands.", "The theory also misses two other points. Not all these ads are coming from unproved start-ups. And the ads are set to be adopted more widely because they actually work.", "According to several app makers and observers of the industry, the ads are tremendously effective at leading paying customers to new apps. It\u2019s the effort to reach these paying customers \u2014 and not venture funding \u2014 that is often the reason for all the money pouring into ads for apps.", "App-pushing ads are known in the industry as app-install ads. They appear in your Facebook News Feed or Twitter stream and encourage you to download apps from companies that make mobile games and e-commerce and travel services; they also come from big brands like Target and Chase. When you tap the ad, you are sent to Apple or Google\u2019s app store. Facebook and Twitter are paid for each click according to prices set by an online bidding process.", "According to Cathy Boyle, an analyst at eMarketer, a research firm that studies the online advertising business, the market for app-install ads is growing rapidly. Ms. Boyle estimates that in the United States, app companies spent $1.67 billion on install ads in 2014. She expects that number to grow 80 percent this year, to about $3 billion. The market for app-install ads is growing faster than just about any other digital advertising category, Ms. Boyle said, but it is still relatively small. In 2015, these ads will account for about 10 percent of the American mobile ad market, according to eMarketer.", "Facebook and Twitter would not specify the proportion of their revenue from app ads, but both have described it as far from the majority of their business. \u201cWe talk about our mobile ad business growing \u2014 mobile app ads are a small part of that, growing in line with our total business,\u201d said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, in a call with investors in October.", "One reason spending on these ads is growing is that the ads solve a problem faced both by businesses that make apps and by users who want apps: App stores are becoming ever more crowded, and it is increasingly difficult for new apps to find an audience. In this way, apps for ads on social networks perform the same function as the highly successful ads for websites that Google runs alongside its search results \u2014 they show people something that they might click on and pay for, based on a combination of users\u2019 interests and a business\u2019s willingness to pay.", "App ads are also like search ads in that they are highly measurable. Marketers can target specific types of customers whom they want to present with an ad for a certain app, and they can also track exactly how much money they make from customers they get through an app ad. By contrast, the advertising boom that doomed the portal industry was not built on measurable ads. Those were mostly web banner ads, whose effectiveness has always been something of a leap of faith.", "Acquiring new customers through app ads is \u201c100 percent based on data,\u201d said Bernard Kim, senior vice president for social and mobile publishing at the video game developer Electronic Arts. \u201cWe have the ability to track the players that we get through these networks very carefully, and we know what the profitability looks like on a player, so these ads are a very effective tool for us to bring in the players that we want to engage with our titles.\u201d", "Skeptics remain. One tech investor who has been critical of these ads pointed out that start-ups are often very bad at calculating the long-term value of new customers. This miscalculation often causes them to overspend on marketing. Several recent venture-funded flops, including Groupon and Fab.com, were tripped up by huge marketing spending that did not lead to lucrative long-term customers.", "If today\u2019s money-burning, venture-funded app companies \u2014 Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and many more \u2014 are also overestimating the value of new customers, could they wake up one day to find they\u2019re spending too much on app ads?", "Facebook does not think so. In an interview, Andrew Bosworth, the company\u2019s vice president for advertising, argued that start-ups today were more disciplined than in the recent past, with many analyzing not just how much they\u2019re spending to get new users but also whether those people are actually buying stuff. \u201cThat\u2019s been the big shift. The big V.C.-backed Fab.coms of the world spent on acquisition but couldn\u2019t actually convert,\u201d he said. But when today\u2019s start-ups look at these ads, \u201cThey\u2019re asking, \u2018Can you put a dollar in and get two dollars out?\u2019 If you can, you spend, and if you can\u2019t, you don\u2019t.\u201d", "Sure, Mr. Bosworth\u2019s argument is a variation of \u201cthis time is different,\u201d which is the stock defense during every boom. But he added that Facebook wasn\u2019t counting on app ads for its long-term survival. \u201cI think this will be a stable ongoing market,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will plateau at some point in terms of share, as smartphone growth plateaus.

To get potatoes into the hands of as many Muscovites as possible and thus create the impression of agricultural bounty, a B.E.S.M. mainframe \u2014 Large Electronically Computing Machine, in English \u2014 churned through 75,000 variables, subject to 563 constraints. Spufford spells out why optimization and computers grew up together: \u201cThis problem is out of reach of fingers and slide rules. But thanks to computers, thanks to the B.E.S.M.\u2019s inhuman patience at iterating approximate answers over and over again, it is a problem that can be solved.\u201d", "The Large Electronically Computing Machine, with its remarkable capacity for optimizing, was the direct precursor of our own data-amassing and refining machines. B.E.S.M., after all, was built on the math of Leonid Kantorovich, the economist and Nobel Laureate who is widely considered the father of linear programming. Not long after that, in the United States, George Dantzig made complementary discoveries in linear programming and developed the simplex algorithm. In 1973 Dantzig founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory at Stanford, which is now about a 12-minute drive from the Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. \u2014 America\u2019s leading producer of data, algorithms and optimization.", "The Apple Watch, which arrived on March 9 to the sort of popular rubbernecking that new machinery occasioned in the 1930s, is a Very Small Electronically Computing Machine with some prodigious optimizing chops. After time keeping, the watch\u2019s chief feature is \u201cfitness tracking\u201d: It clocks and stores physiological data with the aim of getting you to observe and change your habits of sloth and gluttony. Evidently I wasn\u2019t the only one whose thoughts turned to 20th-century despotism: The entrepreneur Anil Dash quipped on Twitter, albeit stretching the truth, \u201cNot since I.B.M. sold mainframes to the Nazis has a high-tech company embraced medical data at this scale.\u201d", "And yet what attracts me to the Apple Watch are my own totalitarian tendencies. I would keep very, very close tabs on the data my body produces. How much I eat. How much I sleep. How much I exercise and accomplish.

That lets you charge the device from either side, which is nice when you\u2019re traveling and don\u2019t know where the power outlet will be. But it also lets you attach external devices and charge at the same time.", "The new connection standard is interesting all on its own. Google says it supports fast charging, so the Pixel can gain two hours of juice from being plugged in for just 15 minutes. USB Type-C plugs are reversible, so you can\u2019t insert them the wrong way, which means they last longer than previous connectors, which tend to get damaged from repeatedly being shoved in the wrong way. And the new USB connector has higher power capacity than previous-generation USB connectors, so it can be used to charge devices big and small.", "That means that if, as Apple, Google and many other companies are hoping, USB Type-C eventually becomes standard across the industry, you could use the same charger to power any phone, any tablet and even any laptop. That would be a huge improvement. While most non-Apple phones use standard micro-USB cables to charge, laptop chargers come in every shape, size and expensive-to-replace variation.", "So at the end of the day, Google doesn\u2019t really care if you buy a Pixel.

But Mr. Schachter races in a Mazda Miata tuned for the track. He recently received a certification that will allow him to participate in higher-end competitions. He also sometimes drives around in a McLaren that cost him several hundred thousand dollars.

Racecars now carry something like an automotive Fitbit, sophisticated sensors that precisely measure just about everything that\u2019s happening on the track, from G-force to where drivers are braking and accelerating. All this data can be tracked and analyzed, turning racing into a sport of empiricism as much as of instinct.", "\u201cThe car gives very good feedback,\u201d Mr. Schachter said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing better there\u2019s a clear, easy number that shows you.\u201d", "At some point during every conversation I had with a tech guy who is interested in racing, there would come an awkward moment in which he would ask me not to paint him as an extravagant, sexist cretin. Mr. Schachter told me, \u201cTry to tone down the rich guy hobby thing.\u201d", "Mr. Bonforte said that many of his friends preferred to stay silent about racing because \u201cthe things that make us smell like the 1 percent, we\u2019re very nervous about.\u201d He added that while he has invited several women to come to the track, none had accepted his offer. The rise of a new boys\u2019 club in Silicon Valley \u2014 one that was apparently leading to new deals and other business prizes \u2014 was \u201ca totally valid concern,\u201d he said, though he did not have any obvious ideas for addressing it. Mr. Buckler, meanwhile, believes that there\u2019s nothing about racing that should put women off. He has hired a woman, Christina Nielsen, for his professional team, and he argued that as the sport grew in popularity, more women would become interested.", "On price, the racers gingerly pointed out that while driving sports cars can be expensive, it\u2019s less extravagant than many assume.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be cavalier about the cost,\u201d said Mr. Bonforte, whose Porsche Cayman carries a sales price of more than $50,000. \u201cThere are some people who really get into this and spend a fair amount of money. But I started doing this when I had little money. And honestly, if I were into golf, I would spend five times more.\u201d", "Mr. Schachter pointed out that the most popular car for racing enthusiasts is a Mazda Miata, older models of which sell for less than $5,000. Renting a car for a day on the track costs a few hundred.", "Stan Chudnovsky, the head of product management on Facebook\u2019s messaging app, pointed to another way that racing could be cheap: Renting a fast car for a day on the racetrack can sate one\u2019s desire to buy one for the garage. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the guy who actually buys a Ferrari, and then everyone is looking at you like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you did that,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Chudnovsky said. \u201cAt the same time, you don\u2019t want to not know what it is to drive one.

According to AARP, some 8,000 Americans a day will turn 65 for the next two decades or so. Combine that with high divorce rates, the passing of the World War II generation and a mortgage debt-fueled financial crisis that people are still recovering from, and a result is more estate sales.", "Estate sale companies typically keep 25 to 50 percent of the proceeds from sales, based on the number of items offered. For that, they handle the staging of the event at a client\u2019s house, including online promotion, hiring workers to conduct the sale, setting prices (usually nonnegotiable) and cleaning up before and after.", "If the lot for sale is especially large or valuable, some companies may recommend an auction, although allowing buyers to bid instead of paying a fixed price can be risky, industry people said.", "The competition among companies is stiff enough, in fact, that many have started to expand their business models to include ancillary services. Caring Transitions of Greater Southeast Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, for example, offers its clients a full range of options: moving company referrals, resettlement assistance and help with how to downsize.", "\u201cWe take people from the moment that they want to sell, and lead them through packing, space consulting and the clean-out process,\u201d said the company\u2019s co-owner, Paula Houston-Allen. \u201cWe want to help them set up easily somewhere else and make sure that their former home is move-in ready.\u201d", "Ms. Houston-Allen, a former doctoral candidate in sociology, is perhaps more attuned than many to the industry\u2019s demographic future.

My current broadband service is slow and it takes forever to download a movie. I want to upgrade to a faster level, but it gets expensive. How much speed do I need to stream a Netflix movie without stalling, make a video call or download a digital rental in less time than it takes to watch it?", "A. When calculating your speed needs, take into account all the online activities you wish to do (streaming, downloading, gaming, videoconferencing and so on) and check the minimum connection rates needed for each. You can usually find the recommendations listed on the websites of the companies and services you use. Video-related activities typically require more network speed and bandwidth than things like audio streaming or basic web browsing.", "For example, Netflix recommends a connection of at least three megabits per second for streaming video in standard definition and a connection of five megabits per second for watching high-definition content without stuttering or buffering. (If you are shopping for a new broadband company based on your video-streaming needs, Netflix posts its own speed rankings of Internet service providers each month on its blog.) As with streaming, file download speeds can suffer from general Internet and server congestion, but a connection at 25 megabits per second can let you download a six-gigabyte movie file in less than 20 minutes.", "Microsoft\u2019s Skype video-calling service recommends a connection of 1.5 megabits per second for high-definition video calls, and a Google Hangouts support page suggests a connection speed of 2.6 megabits per second as the \u201cideal bandwidth for the best experience.\u201d The support sites of most online video games should also list the minimum broadband connection speeds among the requirements for processor, memory and other hardware factors. If you plan to post photos or videos of your own online, a plan that offers decent data upload speeds will make you wait less for that as well.", "Once you have gathered your findings on the connection speeds for your preferred online services, check the packages available from local ISPs offering cable, satellite, fiber optic or DSL broadband. For instance, if you primarily want smooth streams of high-definition movies from Netflix, get a service plan that offers at least the recommended five-megabits-per-second connection. The number of people using the broadband connection at one time should also be factored in, so you may want to get a faster plan if the household includes online gamers as well as movie buffs.", "As Internet service providers have built up their broadband networks over the years, they have been able to increase their offerings to appeal to a wider range of customer needs and budgets, so you may see four or five service plans offered; maximum speeds for downloads and uploads should be listed for each tier of service. This past January, the Federal Communications Commission updated its 2010 benchmark for \u201cbroadband\u201d from a download speed of four megabits per second to 25 megabits per second, so the labels and types of plans offered by the ISPs may shift again in the future."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/technology/personaltech/troubleshooting-android-in-safe-mode.html": ["Q.

People have all sorts of reasons to love or hate her, and even love to hate her for reasons they sometimes can\u2019t articulate. The most evident case for Graham\u2019s importance is the volume of chatter eddying around her name. Tune all of that out and the deeper reasons for her lasting reputation grow louder. Graham\u2019s great body of work, summarized in \u201cFrom the New World,\u201d her new career-spanning selected poems (one can understand why active poets resist the tombstone of a \u201ccollected\u201d volume), has so much in it, more of life and of the world than that of almost any other poet now writing.

But only Graham has synthesized all of the available strains \u2014 the ageless tradition of poetic contemplation; the half-century trend toward self-revelation; the mischievous, self-conscious cynicism about the very proposition of meaningful language \u2014 into a style that reflects the real world back, gives powerful moral commentary and makes our hair stand a bit on end because something real glows in each of her poems. Graham is to post-1980 poetry what Bob Dylan is to post-1960 rock: She changed her art form, moved it forward, made it able to absorb and express more than it could before. It permanently bears her mark.", "The title of what is probably Graham\u2019s best-known poem, \u201cThe Way Things Work,\u201d slides right into its first line: \u201cis by admitting / or opening away.\u201d How remarkable to ride the crest of Graham\u2019s reasoning \u2014 this is one of the great pleasures of reading her. In lines like these, she performs one of poetry\u2019s fundamental tasks, showing how poems lead to the meanings between words, to the things we can\u2019t quite say but still need to express. What, exactly, does it mean that something is \u201cadmitting / or opening away\u201d? Admitting what? Away from where? But those are the wrong questions. What Graham is doing here, following Dickinson, Whitman and Stevens, is envisioning abstractions in action, showing the activity of the mind as though with the eyes \u2014 like Ashbery, but with feeling. She delineates the difference between \u201cBlue / moving through blue\u201d and \u201cblue through purple,\u201d as she says later in that poem. Recite those lines to yourself the next time you watch the sunset and see if it doesn\u2019t look better.", "For Graham, consciousness and conscience are intertwined. To be aware of something is to have some responsibility for it. For instance, this collection\u2019s title poem revolves around a scene from the Holocaust. Graham wishes she didn\u2019t have to face the unbearable image of \u201cthe girl who didn\u2019t die / in the gas chamber, who came back out asking / for her mother.\u201d Of course she craves an easier way out, more pleasant poetry: \u201cGod knows I too want the poem to continue, / want the silky swerve into shapeliness / and then the click shut.\u201d But once such an image has entered her consciousness, there\u2019s no way out for her but through.", "This is why Graham\u2019s poems can sometimes be long and exhausting. She follows her thoughts all the way to, and then beyond, their conclusions. Sometimes the poems end with an urgent sense of vibrating disturbance, with the knowledge that something is wrong in the world and must be corrected. Other poems find their way to a kind of awe, glimpsing \u201cwhere the mind opened out / into the sheer drop of its intelligence.\u201d", "Of course, Graham risks alienating her readers by going above their heads or too far into her own. At times, especially in the long, many-sectioned poems of the late 1990s and early aughts, Graham can seem almost incomprehensible (as too many critics have too smugly asserted too similarly). Yet this is a symptom of artistic courage and growth: Graham has been fearless about her own artistic development. She\u2019s gone wherever the poems have led her, and after her most hermetic period comes her most public. In the last three books \u2014 \u201cOverlord,\u201d \u201cSea Change\u201d and \u201cPlace\u201d \u2014 Graham has embraced the role of protest poet, raging against the culture of war and continuing environmental degradation. She has also woven into these poems some of her most moving personal statements.", "\u201cLapse,\u201d a late poem of memory and motherhood, is one of these. In it, she remembers pushing her now-grown daughter in a swing, and finds herself recalling a wish for her child that could also be her wish for everyone: \u201cthat you be spared / from anything at all, from everything, and of course also its opposite, / that everything happen to you in large sheets of experience.\u201d Only Graham, to my ear at least, is capable of so capacious an expression of our fundamentally contradictory nature: We want everything and its opposite, all and nothing, but we must settle, everywhere but in our imaginations (for which poems are metaphors), for something in between. Graham is one of our great poets.

Nextdoor restricts communication to only those people who live close to one another; users are required to verify their identity and home address upon signing up.", "Consider Nextdoor a modern, more attractive version of a community email list service or Yahoo Groups, the popular message board. Users can post neighborhood news, offer items for sale, ask for help finding lost pets or organize a block party.", "Nextdoor also works with about 650 local government agencies that can send out citywide alerts on things like utility shutdowns in specific areas, crime alerts or emergency-preparedness tips.", "That network, in Nextdoor\u2019s telling, creates trust between users, who will put more stock in one another\u2019s comments and \u2014 more important for the company\u2019s bottom line \u2014 in recommendations for local services and businesses.", "Of the five million messages exchanged each day on Nextdoor, Mr. Tolia said, the network\u2019s users send more than one million recommending services to one another. Around 80 percent of those posts are discussions about local service providers and businesses.", "The goal, the company says, is to begin to extract data from those conversations to produce recommendations. People on the service could then search for things like the best local tutors, a handyman or housecleaning services.", "That is where Nextdoor sees a business opportunity.", "The company is still in the early days of testing how it could make money from the recommendations. It may use those recommendations to help sell ads to the companies being recommended.", "But it is also experimenting with on-demand services, similar to other start-ups like Uber, the car-sharing service, or Instacart, which lets users order grocery delivery online. Nextdoor could, for example, offer users the ability to book a highly recommended plumber or tutor directly from its network, and then take a cut of the fee for the service.", "The company says that this approach could even unlock an entirely new market of people who offer local services \u2014 like dog walkers or babysitters \u2014 but have never before advertised online.", "That is different from other networks, including Facebook, which primarily makes money by showing users ads tailored to their personal profiles, or Twitter, which offers interest-based advertisements. Both networks place ads inside a person\u2019s content stream, between the myriad photos and status updates that flow through the feed.", "\u201cWhen people use Nextdoor, they\u2019re not looking to post a cat pic, they\u2019re looking for services, looking to sell things,\u201d said Bill Gurley, a partner in the venture capital firm Benchmark, which is invested in Nextdoor. \u201cFrom an advertising standpoint, context matters.\u201d", "The path to local advertising is well worn. AOL\u2019s grand experiment to break into local communities was Patch, a network of hundreds of hyper-local news sites that focused on issues specific to a small geographic area. The effort was seen as a grand failure; AOL sold Patch in 2014 after hemorrhaging more than $200 million trying to get it off the ground.", "Foursquare, the social recommendations start-up, also sells ads to local businesses who want to attract new, digitally knowledgeable customers. Last month, a Foursquare executive said the company has seen triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth, though he declined to state any exact numbers. Facebook has only recently started selling locally focused ads to small businesses.", "And then there are companies like Yelp and Google, both of which offer scores of recommendations based on user searches and ratings.", "Nextdoor\u2019s philosophy is that a recommendation from someone in your community carries more weight than, say, a Yelp review from someone you may not know on the Internet, or an algorithmically determined Google advertisement.", "And the on-demand approach is markedly different from older methods of culling dollars from local businesses, usually through traditional advertising avenues.", "\u201cThe power of social networks is that they\u2019re a bottoms-up phenomenon,\u201d said David Sze, a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners and a Nextdoor board member. \u201cYou provide this social utility, and users start talking about commerce and local services on their own.\u201d", "Search advertising, like Google\u2019s, will continue to dominate online ad spending over the next five years, according to a report from Forrester Research, which expects digital advertising to top $103 billion over the next five years.

That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them.", "Let me explain why.

You can Google it.", "Absent a dramatic change, we know for sure that any deal with Iran will include two major concessions to Iran.", "The first major concession would leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure, providing it with a short breakout time to the bomb. Breakout time is the time it takes to amass enough weapons-grade uranium or plutonium for a nuclear bomb.", "According to the deal, not a single nuclear facility would be demolished. Thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium would be left spinning. Thousands more would be temporarily disconnected, but not destroyed.", "Because Iran\u2019s nuclear program would be left largely intact, Iran\u2019s breakout time would be very short \u2014 about a year by U.S. assessment, even shorter by Israel\u2019s.", "And if \u2014 if Iran\u2019s work on advanced centrifuges, faster and faster centrifuges, is not stopped, that breakout time could still be shorter, a lot shorter.", "True, certain restrictions would be imposed on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and Iran\u2019s adherence to those restrictions would be supervised by international inspectors. But here\u2019s the problem. You see, inspectors document violations; they don\u2019t stop them.", "Inspectors knew when North Korea broke to the bomb, but that didn\u2019t stop anything. North Korea turned off the cameras, kicked out the inspectors. Within a few years, it got the bomb.", "Now, we\u2019re warned that within five years North Korea could have an arsenal of 100 nuclear bombs.", "Like North Korea, Iran, too, has defied international inspectors. It\u2019s done that on at least three separate occasions \u2014 2005, 2006, 2010. Like North Korea, Iran broke the locks, shut off the cameras.", "Now, I know this is not gonna come a shock \u2014 as a shock to any of you, but Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of hide-and-cheat with them.", "The U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said again yesterday that Iran still refuses to come clean about its military nuclear program. Iran was also caught \u2014 caught twice, not once, twice \u2014 operating secret nuclear facilities in Natanz and Qom, facilities that inspectors didn\u2019t even know existed.", "Right now, Iran could be hiding nuclear facilities that we don\u2019t know about, the U.S. and Israel. As the former head of inspections for the IAEA said in 2013, he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s no undeclared installation today in Iran, it will be the first time in 20 years that it doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted. And that\u2019s why the first major concession is a source of great concern. It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and relies on inspectors to prevent a breakout. That concession creates a real danger that Iran could get to the bomb by violating the deal.", "But the second major concession creates an even greater danger that Iran could get to the bomb by keeping the deal. Because virtually all the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program will automatically expire in about a decade.", "Now, a decade may seem like a long time in political life, but it\u2019s the blink of an eye in the life of a nation. It\u2019s a blink of an eye in the life of our children. We all have a responsibility to consider what will happen when Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities are virtually unrestricted and all the sanctions will have been lifted. Iran would then be free to build a huge nuclear capacity that could product many, many nuclear bombs.", "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader says that openly. He says, Iran plans to have 190,000 centrifuges, not 6,000 or even the 19,000 that Iran has today, but 10 times that amount \u2014 190,000 centrifuges enriching uranium. With this massive capacity, Iran could make the fuel for an entire nuclear arsenal and this in a matter of weeks, once it makes that decision.", "My long-time friend, John Kerry, Secretary of State, confirmed last week that Iran could legitimately possess that massive centrifuge capacity when the deal expires.", "Now I want you to think about that. The foremost sponsor of global terrorism could be weeks away from having enough enriched uranium for an entire arsenal of nuclear weapons and this with full international legitimacy.", "And by the way, if Iran\u2019s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile program is not part of the deal, and so far, Iran refuses to even put it on the negotiating table. Well, Iran could have the means to deliver that nuclear arsenal to the far-reach corners of the Earth, including to every part of the United States.", "So you see, my friends, this deal has two major concessions: one, leaving Iran with a vast nuclear program and two, lifting the restrictions on that program in about a decade. That\u2019s why this deal is so bad. It doesn\u2019t block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb; it paves Iran\u2019s path to the bomb.", "So why would anyone make this deal? Because they hope that Iran will change for the better in the coming years, or they believe that the alternative to this deal is worse?", "Well, I disagree. I don\u2019t believe that Iran\u2019s radical regime will change for the better after this deal. This regime has been in power for 36 years, and its voracious appetite for aggression grows with each passing year. This deal would whet appetite \u2014 would only whet Iran\u2019s appetite for more.", "Would Iran be less aggressive when sanctions are removed and its economy is stronger? If Iran is gobbling up four countries right now while it\u2019s under sanctions, how many more countries will Iran devour when sanctions are lifted? Would Iran fund less terrorism when it has mountains of cash with which to fund more terrorism?", "Why should Iran\u2019s radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both world\u2019s: aggression abroad, prosperity at home?", "This is a question that everyone asks in our region. Israel\u2019s neighbors \u2014 Iran\u2019s neighbors know that Iran will become even more aggressive and sponsor even more terrorism when its economy is unshackled and it\u2019s been given a clear path to the bomb.", "And many of these neighbors say they\u2019ll respond by racing to get nuclear weapons of their own. So this deal won\u2019t change Iran for the better; it will only change the Middle East for the worse. A deal that\u2019s supposed to prevent nuclear proliferation would instead spark a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous part of the planet.", "This deal won\u2019t be a farewell to arms. It would be a farewell to arms control. And the Middle East would soon be crisscrossed by nuclear tripwires. A region where small skirmishes can trigger big wars would turn into a nuclear tinderbox.", "If anyone thinks \u2014 if anyone thinks this deal kicks the can down the road, think again. When we get down that road, we\u2019ll face a much more dangerous Iran, a Middle East littered with nuclear bombs and a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare.", "Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve come here today to tell you we don\u2019t have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don\u2019t have to gamble with our future and with our children\u2019s future.", "We can insist that restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world.(APPLAUSE)", "Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things. First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second...", "(APPLAUSE)", "Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Thank you.", "If the world powers are not prepared to insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal is signed, at the very least they should insist that Iran change its behavior before a deal expires.", "(APPLAUSE)", "If Iran changes its behavior, the restrictions would be lifted. If Iran doesn\u2019t change its behavior, the restrictions should not be lifted.", "(APPLAUSE)", "If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country.(APPLAUSE)", "My friends, what about the argument that there\u2019s no alternative to this deal, that Iran\u2019s nuclear know-how cannot be erased, that its nuclear program is so advanced that the best we can do is delay the inevitable, which is essentially what the proposed deal seeks to do?", "Well, nuclear know-how without nuclear infrastructure doesn\u2019t get you very much. A racecar driver without a car can\u2019t drive. A pilot without a plan can\u2019t fly. Without thousands of centrifuges, tons of enriched uranium or heavy water facilities, Iran can\u2019t make nuclear weapons.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Iran\u2019s nuclear program can be rolled back well-beyond the current proposal by insisting on a better deal and keeping up the pressure on a very vulnerable regime, especially given the recent collapse in the price of oil.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Now, if Iran threatens to walk away from the table \u2014 and this often happens in a Persian bazaar \u2014 call their bluff. They\u2019ll be back, because they need the deal a lot more than you do.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And by maintaining the pressure on Iran and on those who do business with Iran, you have the power to make them need it even more.", "My friends, for over a year, we\u2019ve been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well, this is a bad deal. It\u2019s a very bad deal. We\u2019re better off without it.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Now we\u2019re being told that the only alternative to this bad deal is war. That\u2019s just not true.", "The alternative to this bad deal is a much better deal.", "(APPLAUSE)", "A better deal that doesn\u2019t leave Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure and such a short breakout time. A better deal that keeps the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in place until Iran\u2019s aggression ends.", "(APPLAUSE)", "A better deal that won\u2019t give Iran an easy path to the bomb. A better deal that Israel and its neighbors may not like, but with which we could live, literally. And no country...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... no country has a greater stake \u2014 no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat.", "Ladies and gentlemen, history has placed us at a fateful crossroads.

And even buttoned-up Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock are teaching meditation on the job.", "The aims of such programs are eclectic. Some, such as Aetna\u2019s, are intended to improve overall well-being; others to increase focus and productivity. Most of the programs \u2014 from yoga sessions for factory workers to guided meditations for executives \u2014 aim to make employees more present-minded, less prone to make rash decisions and generally nicer people to work with.", "Adoption of these unconventional practices in the workplace coincides with growing interest among the American public. More than 21 million people now practice yoga, double the number from a decade ago, according to the National Institutes of Health. Nearly as many meditate, according to the N.I.H.", "But not everyone believes that meditation and yoga are appropriate in the workplace. A recent article in The Harvard Business Review cautioned that \u201cmindfulness is close to taking on cult status in the business world,\u201d and it enumerated ways that a meditative disposition could backfire in the office. Stress can be a useful prompt to engage in critical thinking, noted the author, David Brendel, and is not something to retreat from through meditation. And even as Aetna and others chart what they say are the health benefits of mindfulness and yoga, not all researchers are convinced.", "\u201cThe public enthusiasm for complementary health practices \u2014 and meditation in particular \u2014 is outpacing the scientific research,\u201d said Willoughby Britton, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, who is studying the potential negative side effects of meditation. \u201cWidespread implementation is premature.\u201d", "Mr. Bertolini has heard the critics, and takes pains not to impose yoga or meditation on any employees. (There are no incentives for workers to take the classes.) But he can\u2019t help but champion both causes. They helped him come back from the abyss.", "On Feb. 18, 2004, Mr. Bertolini almost died. Then a rising star at Aetna but not yet chief executive, he was skiing with his family in Killington, Vt., when he lost control. His body ricocheted off a tree and over a ledge, sending him careering 30 feet down a ravine.", "Mr. Bertolini was motionless when his daughter found him. At the intensive care unit, a priest administered last rites. Five of the vertebrae in his neck had fractured. A tangle of nerves connected to his left arm had been detached from his spinal cord.", "In a swift recovery that baffled doctors, Mr. Bertolini pulled through and was able to leave the hospital after 12 days. (Since then, he has had four surgeries.) Less than a month after the accident, he made a presentation at an Aetna investor conference, walking with a cane, his left arm in a brace.", "But Mr. Bertolini wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cPrior to my accident I used to run four miles every morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked hard and played hard.\u201d Afterward, he could barely get through the day. His left arm, now useless, was in sustained, agonizing pain. \u201cIt was as if somebody were burning my arm with a torch all day long, and to this day it feels this way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never stopped.\u201d", "To manage the pain, Bertolini followed doctor\u2019s orders. He took OxyContin. He took Vicodin. He took fentanyl. The drugs barely helped. After a year of unsatisfactory results with conventional treatments, Bertolini went looking for alternative remedies, including yoga. Each morning, the vigorous stretching became a welcome replacement for his daily runs.", "Soon he grew enamored with yoga\u2019s intellectual and cultural history, and before long he began practicing mindfulness meditation, too. With mindfulness, Mr. Bertolini found that difficult thoughts and emotions became easier to manage. \u201cMeditation is not about thinking about nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about accepting what you think, giving reverence to it and letting it go. It\u2019s losing the attachment to it. Same thing with pain.\u201d", "Eventually, his regimen of yoga and meditation allowed him to return to work with renewed vigor. When he became chief executive of Aetna, he took over a company that now has about $58 billion in annual revenue and more than 23.5 million members.", "Once chief executive, Mr. Bertolini was emboldened. If yoga and mindfulness had helped him, why shouldn\u2019t they help his employees, and even Aetna\u2019s millions of customers? So he decided to use his company as a laboratory.", "He started gradually, leading brief meditations in meetings with his executive team. Some rolled their eyes, but others appreciated it. Then he approached Dr. Lonny Reisman, Aetna\u2019s chief medical officer at the time, and proposed offering yoga and mindfulness classes to employees.", "Dr. Reisman saw that the practices had helped his boss recover, but he was not convinced. \u201cBecause you\u2019re doing yoga, everyone has to do yoga?\u201d Dr. Reisman shot back, as recalled by Mr. Bertolini.", "Mr. Bertolini appealed to Dr. Reisman as a scientist. They would measure workers\u2019 stress levels by tracking heart rate variability and cortisol levels, common measures of anxiety. And they would team with the Integrative Medicine Program at Duke University, which does research into the efficacy of alternative treatments.", "To develop the curriculum, Aetna enlisted the American Viniyoga Institute, which advocates a form of yoga that involves breathing techniques and gentle poses. And to develop the meditation program, Aetna turned to eMindful, a company based in Vero Beach, Fla., that takes its inspiration from the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn, a molecular biologist who has helped popularize mindfulness in recent decades.", "Soon Mr. Bertolini\u2019s experiment was underway, with 239 employees volunteering. One-third practiced Viniyoga, one-third took a mindfulness class, and the rest were assessed as a control group. At the end of three months, the data came in, and executives were astounded. All employees who stuck with either the yoga or the mindfulness reported significant reduction in perceived stress and sleep difficulties. And while self-reports of lowered stress are not always reliable, the study also found that physical measures of heart rate variability and cortisol levels had both decreased. \u201cThe biostatisticians were beside themselves,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said.", "Even Dr. Reisman, who has since left Aetna to start a new company, came around. \u201cAs a physician, I don\u2019t believe anything until it\u2019s proven,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for people coping with stress, there was a beneficial effect in participating in these programs.\u201d", "The results of the study were published in The Journal of Occupational Health Psychology in 2012. Soon Aetna expanded the programs, offering them to thousands of employees around the country.", "Employees have generally embraced the courses, but some doubters remain. \u201cWhen I talk about mindfulness to folks at work, they look at me funny,\u201d said Christine Beaird, an Aetna project manager in Dallas, who took one of the classes and found it helpful. \u201cThey think it\u2019s this whole Zen, Tantra Buddhist thing.\u201d", "When Mr. Bertolini reviewed Aetna\u2019s financial performance for 2012, he noticed something surprising: Health care costs had fallen. For the year, paid medical claims per employee were down 7.3 percent. That amounted to about $9 million in savings. The next year, health care costs rose 5.7 percent, but have remained about 3 percent lower than they were before yoga and meditation were introduced at the company.", "Mr. Bertolini doesn\u2019t attribute all those cost savings to yoga and meditation alone. Other wellness initiatives, including a weight loss program and new health screenings, had also been ramping up during this period. But he says he believes they made an impact. \u201cIt was a culmination of a set of programs that led to a steady decrease in health care costs,\u201d Mr. Bertolini said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s all just yoga and mindfulness, but they helped.\u201d", "The productivity gains \u2014 measured with a questionnaire that assesses employees\u2019 ability to stay on task \u2014 were also sustained. As Mr. Bertolini discussed the impact of his programs in his office, he gestured freely with his right hand and used it to toss logs into the hearth, where a fire warmed the room. His left arm was limp, however, the legacy of his skiing injury. Though he is still in pain, and would occasionally grimace, Mr. Bertolini said that because of his mindfulness practice, he wasn\u2019t suffering.", "In January, Mr. Bertolini traveled to Jacksonville, Fla., where Aetna has a big office. Sitting onstage in a hotel ballroom filled with employees, his Sanskrit amulet visible to all, he announced that Aetna was increasing its minimum wage in the United States to $16 an hour, from $12. Thousands of customer service and claims administration workers around the country would get raises, and Aetna would also reduce their out-of-pocket health care costs. ", "\u201cIf we can create a healthier you, we can create a healthier world and healthier company,\u201d Mr. Bertolini told the audience. Some employees choked up when they heard the news.", "Mr. Bertolini grew up in a working-class family in Detroit, and now makes many millions of dollars a year. He owns a large house in West Hartford and a pied-\u00e0-terre overlooking Central Park in New York. After he read \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d raising the minimum wage was an easy decision, he said, and will also help Aetna reduce turnover. Walmart has since raised wages for its lowest-paid workers, too, as have other retailers like T. J. Maxx and Marshalls.", "But Mr. Bertolini said that without his experience with yoga and meditation, he might not have been inspired to act on his impulse. \u201cIt\u2019s made me question what I do and how I look at the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s made me consider my influence and how I treat people.\u201d", "It was just the latest phase of Mr. Bertolini\u2019s grand experiment. Offering yoga and mindfulness to his employees was the first step. Selling those services as products was another. Raising the minimum wage was a logical next move.

When you apply for a tourist visa affects how long it takes to be approved (though some countries have restrictions as to how far in advance you can apply). Russia\u2019s high season, for instance, is June through August, so you will wait longer and pay more if you do not apply a couple of months in advance, Ms. Caragol said. Or say you want to go to Brazil. Now is a good time to apply for that visa, she said, because you are likely to receive it in two or three weeks. Trying to get a visa for Brazil in January or February as its carnival approaches, on the other hand, is an exercise in futility. \u201cBrazil will sometimes say it takes two months to get a visa,\u201d she said.

The Republican Party is conservative and populist, and Mr. Bush is hardly a perfect fit for the primary electorate. Forty-two percent of voters say they could not see themselves supporting him.

And many candidates \u2014 like Mr. Walker and Mr. Rubio \u2014 will be better positioned to exploit whatever reservations about Mr. Bush remain."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/books/review/neil-gaimans-trigger-warning.html": ["If there is any contemporary cognate to the kind of literary celebrity once enjoyed, in a vastly different cultural setting, by Charles Dickens or Leo Tolstoy, it is surely found in Neil Gaiman. A wildly popular tale-spinner as well as a writer of considerable gifts and transcendent ambition, Gaiman has been embraced by critics even as he has amassed a Kardashian-\u00adscale Twitter following. He has written novels for children and comic books for adults (advancing both forms in the process), and vice versa.", "Gaiman relates to his fans easily and without pretension, perhaps because he enthusiastically embraces fandom himself: His new collection of stories and poems, \u201cTrigger Warning,\u201d features an extra\u00adcanonical Sherlock Holmes adventure that finally explains why the great detective takes up beekeeping in his retirement and a terrifying tale of a boundary\u00adless, time-devouring entity set in the universe of the venerable BBC science fiction series \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d Both of them, in classic Gaiman style, are lovingly steeped in established fictional worlds while artfully nudging them into unexplored territory.", "Gaiman is a Dickens fan too, and has called attention to his own Dickensian qualities, not least with his thoroughly enjoyable reading of \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d at the New York Public Library in 2013, which he performed dressed as the great Victorian novelist and using a copy of the story personally annotated by Dickens for a pair of New York readings in 1867. But if we seek to situate Gaiman in literary history, the differences come into focus. As a writer he belongs to a tradition that runs alongside Dickens\u2019s naturalistic and melodramatic social fiction, but surfaces within it only on occasion.", "That tradition, of course, is the fantastic, the fairy tale and ghost story, the modern resurgence of myth and magic. Gaiman certainly has 19th-century forebears, but they are Dickens\u2019s disreputable contemporaries, Wilkie Collins or Bram Stoker or Sheridan Le Fanu, more than Dickens himself. Gaiman\u2019s literary grandparents, we might say, are Lewis Carroll and Mary Shelley, and Gaiman\u2019s ascendancy symbolizes the fact that the genres they pioneered \u2014 which were condescended to or sneered at for generations \u2014 have now conquered the culture.", "One of the most enjoyable pieces of writing in \u201cTrigger Warning,\u201d which assembles a range of previously published material from the past seven or eight years, along with a new story that revisits the world of Gaiman\u2019s best-selling novel \u201cAmerican Gods,\u201d is the author\u2019s introduction, delivered in the chatty, generous and digressive style familiar to readers of his blog. He supplies contextual anecdotes for every story or poem in the book, apologizes (unnecessarily) for its inherent shagginess and lack of thematic clarity, and expends rather too much effort explicating his title, a puckish reference to the Internet-spawned notion that all potentially provocative material should be flagged in advance, lest it engage latent trauma in its audience.", "\u201cI wonder, Are fictions safe places?\u201d Gaiman writes. \u201cAnd then I ask myself, Should they be safe places?\u201d He means to suggest that his fiction may indeed prove disturbing and that we\u2019re on our own, but that last part isn\u2019t quite true. We have a guide. In practice, Gaiman\u2019s writing answers the introduction\u2019s questions both in the negative and in the affirmative. In his fictional worlds, reality is frequently subject to disturbing or hilarious slippage: A moonlight stroll in search of a defunct local attraction shifts without warning into a Shirley Jackson-style murderous ritual (\u201cA Lunar Labyrinth\u201d); a talkative woman in a small-town pub turns out to be a spectral jilted lover with a gruesome secret to reveal (in \u201cBlack Dog,\u201d a new adventure of Shadow Moon, the hero of \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d); a teenage girl\u2019s addiction to tanning lotion may result in the creation of a shimmering orange entity known as \u201cHer Immanence,\u201d or to her sister as \u201cthe Great Oompa-Loompa.\u201d (That story, \u201cOrange,\u201d is skillfully constructed as a litany of unsatisfying answers to official questions.)", "But on a deeper level, there is an ordered and comforting quality to Gaiman\u2019s fiction, and not only because he possesses an unfailing sense of poetic justice and a Dickensian zest for punishing the arrogant, the proud and the wicked. More than that, Gaiman is such a powerful and evocative writer that almost everything he churns out serves to justify the aforementioned cultural triumph of fantasy literature over realism and modernism.", "Gaiman\u2019s attention to craft, passion for language and profound respect for the mythological roots of what is now called \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d come through even in his abbreviated prose fragments, barely long enough to be considered stories. In about three pages, \u201cDown to a Sunless Sea\u201d delivers a memorably ghoulish fable founded on the archetypal image of a woman by the shore, waiting for a man who has not come home. \u201cA Calendar of Tales,\u201d a set of 12 short-short stories inspired by tweets from Gaiman\u2019s readers about the months of the year, includes a miniature sci-fi action epic that feels like a treatment for a Tom Cruise film, a feminist pirate saga and a tender, romantic reworking of the genie-in-a-bottle story in which no wishes are granted.", "Woven throughout Gaiman\u2019s introduction is a series of tributes to his writerly mentors and role models, none of whom ever escaped the prison-house of genre literature and all of whom were less famous at the apex of their careers than he is now. Science fiction buffs will already know Arthur C. Clarke, Harlan Ellison and Gene Wolfe (or at least they should), but Gaiman may send his readers scrambling to Google or the public library in search of Clark Ashton Smith and Jack Vance. There is nothing in \u201cTrigger Warning\u201d lovelier or more lyrical than \u201cThe Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury,\u201d written as a birthday present for the great American science fiction writer not long before his death, at 91, in 2012. Like so much of Gaiman\u2019s fiction, it is a story of love and loss and cultural memory and the hidden connections between unremembered things, and also a story about the importance of stories. This passage is a tapestry of Bradbury references, the first thread being his prescient dystopian novel \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d:", "\u201cAnd the people who would burn the words, the people who would take the books from the shelves, the firemen and the ignorant, the ones afraid of tales and words and dreams and Hallowe\u2019en and people who have tattooed themselves with stories and Boys! You Can Grow Mushrooms in Your Cellar! and as long as your words which are people which are days which are my life, as long as your words survive, then you lived and you mattered and you changed the world and I cannot remember your name.\u201d", "In a story like \u201c \u2018The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains . . . ,\u2019 \u201d on the other hand, the metafictional self-awareness often present in Gaiman\u2019s work evaporates entirely. There he transports us into a primordial fairy tale that feels harder than rock and older than Celtic Europe, told by a dwarf who has persuaded a sinister tall man to guide him to a remote island cave, where you can gather all the gold you can carry, but must of course leave something behind. (Such a cave is said to be found on the Isle of Skye, Gaiman reports.) Like all the best writers of fiction \u2014 like Dickens, for instance \u2014 Gaiman draws power not just from his storytelling gifts but also from his ability to work the crowd. He\u2019s like a conjurer who shows us how the magic trick is worked, joins us in laughing at its transparency and simplicity, and makes us believe in it anyway. There are no real monsters, he assures us, only half-forgotten fears we have clad in ill-fitting masks (in one of these stories, a paper Maggie Thatcher mask). All the while we wait eagerly for Gaiman to pull off the masks, so we can see the familiar glitter of their eyes.", "TRIGGER WARNING\nShort Fictions and Disturbances\nBy Neil Gaiman\n310 pp. William Morrow/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/technology/personaltech/turning-off-the-android-texting-nanny.html": ["Q.

In the case of its new flagship Galaxy S phones, announced Sunday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Samsung has created phones that unquestionably borrow on the most appealing elements of the iPhone. But they also stand out with their own impressive design twists.", "The Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge have been redesigned all in glass, dumping the removable plastic back cover that many complained felt cheap. The phone\u2019s interface is simpler, there\u2019s a greater emphasis on the camera and the fingerprint sensor, and Samsung announced that mobile payments would soon come to the phones in force.", "Sounds a little like an iPhone 6, right? But the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are no mere clones, and the S6 Edge in particular brings a new style that actually makes the iPhone look conventional by comparison.", "Samsung also announced a new version of its virtual reality headset, the Gear VR, to complement its new phones.", "That phone features a curved screen that wraps down along each side of the phone for a sort of infinity pool effect. Samsung introduced the idea of the curved display with its Note Edge, released last year.", "At the time, it was more a proof of concept than anything, and indeed, the curved sides don\u2019t add significant functionality. There\u2019s an alarm clock mode \u2014 a low-power display that shows the time and date on the curved edge, which is nice on a desk or by the side of the bed. You can add a list of contact shortcuts to the side screen as well, and since the display is curved on both sides, it can be customized for righties or lefties.", "But the curved screen doesn\u2019t really demand much extra functionality, because it\u2019s just so nice to look at. With the Galaxy S6 and the S6 Edge lined up next to each other, the S6 almost disappears \u2014 you can\u2019t keep your eyes off the Edge.", "That\u2019s not to take away from the S6, which gets its own design-oriented overhaul. Both phones are noticeably thinner and a bit lighter than the previous models, and the glass bodies are made of Corning Gorilla Glass 4. The S6 has a much thinner bezel than the S5, which also helps enhance the look of its screen.", "Samsung told me the phones should be durable enough to withstand a casual drop, although it will release a line of cases \u2014 including a translucent back case \u2014 for extra protection.", "The translucent cases are designed to show off the phones\u2019 colors. Each model will be available in black sapphire, white and a sort of pale gold that I found much too flashy. But the S6 can be had in a rich blue, and the S6 Edge in a truly lovely emerald green, and both of those colors make the phones look more like jewelry than electronics. They are extremely fancy \u2014 and the prices are likely to match.", "In another convergence with the iPhone, the Galaxy S phones now come in three storage configurations: 32, 64 and 128 gigabytes. As a result, Samsung has eliminated the SD card slot, so you can\u2019t expand your own internal storage \u2014 and it also means three price points. Samsung wouldn\u2019t specify pricing, but told me the 32GB model was expected to start at the same price as the previous Galaxy S5.", "That was about $200 with a new contract for most people. If iPhone pricing is our guide, the 128-gigabyte model could cost as much as $400 with a new contract. The cheapest iPhone 6, however, has just 16GB of storage with no expandable memory, so the low-end Galaxy S6 may prove a better value.", "Samsung argued that not many people actually used SD cards to expand the storage in their phones, but the lack of options may frustrate some. And the all-glass design also takes away another big benefit of Samsung phones: the ability to swap out the battery. Samsung phone users often carry spares, and since battery life degrades over time, a decaying internal battery could mean you may have to replace the phone sooner.", "In terms of specs, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are top of the line, with a new 64-bit processor, and increased and also more powerful internal memory. Samsung said it believes its active-matrix organic LED display boasts the world\u2019s highest resolution (a claim that is hard to verify before other devices have been announced), and added that it is 20 percent brighter than the Galaxy S5.", "To take advantage of that high-resolution screen, Samsung also announced a new version of its Gear VR virtual reality headset. The Gear VR works by plugging your phone \u2014 previously only the Note 4 was compatible \u2014 into the VR goggles and using the screen as the virtual reality display. The new model will allow the S6 to fit in the goggles, and the higher-resolution screen should reduce what\u2019s known as the \u201cscreen door effect\u201d where you can see space between individual pixels while watching virtual reality video.", "The company also emphasized camera improvements. The 16 megapixel rear camera now has an improved lens and full-time optical image stabilization to make it perform faster and capture brighter, sharper images. The front camera goes from 2 megapixels to 5 megapixels, and there\u2019s a new feature called fast-tracking auto focus that promises to make it easier to get in-focus shots of a moving subject.", "In a particularly welcome change, you can now double-tap the home button on the phone to quickly launch the camera from any app or if the phone is locked.", "The phones support wireless charging, using Samsung\u2019s own accessories or most of the mats that you sometimes see in places like Starbucks. And the fingerprint sensor has been improved; instead of having to swipe down to unlock the phone, you simply hold your finger or thumb on the sensor (yes, like on the iPhone).", "That fingerprint sensor will eventually power Samsung\u2019s other big announcement: mobile payments, arriving on the S6 and S6 Edge, but not until summer. The feature is called (what else?) Samsung Pay, and will be based on the technology Samsung acquired in February when it bought the mobile wallet company LoopPay.", "Samsung Pay, when it\u2019s released, may be usable at more locations than Apple Pay or even Google Wallet, because the technology it uses for mobile payments can work over near-field communication (NFC) like Apple Pay, but can also mimic a traditional magnetic stripe card swipe.", "That means Samsung Pay could theoretically be accepted at more stores \u2014 including those that haven\u2019t yet upgraded their terminals to either NFC or the new chip-and-PIN terminals that will eventually do away with the card swipe. The company has teamed up with American Express, Visa, and MasterCard, and is working with major banks to get them to accept its payment system. Other details were sparse.", "Samsung has recently struggled to keep buyers interested in its steady stream of new Galaxy models. The S5, for example, didn\u2019t seem to add much over the S4.

The living room couch in front of the television now functions as a site for in-depth learning.", "Many factors underlie the ascent of such learning products. An aging population has leisure time and money to spend. Digital distribution lets content creators focus on smaller audiences with more specialized interests, and it gives users access to these products anywhere and anytime. The proliferation of media that results has in turn created a market for live events like TED Talks, the music and multimedia gathering SXSW and the Comic-Con fan conventions, all of which offer lectures and symposiums that can turn up online later.", "As long-established companies and personalities look for new sources of revenue in a rapidly shifting media market, they turn to educational offerings as well.", "\u201cI think like everyone else, we\u2019re looking for new opportunities that bring in revenue and keep in line with our mission,\u201d says Linda St. Thomas, chief spokeswoman for the Smithsonian Institution.", "To this end, the Smithsonian has begun offering classes through the Great Courses line, as have National Geographic, the Culinary Institute of America and the Mayo Clinic.

Research in numerous countries reveals that children of involved fathers are healthier, happier and less likely to have behavioral problems. They are also more likely to succeed in school and, later, in their careers. A powerful study led by the University of British Columbia psychologist Alyssa Croft showed that when fathers shouldered an equal share of housework, their daughters were less likely to limit their aspirations to stereotypically female occupations.

Twenty-five percent of United Statesgross domestic product growth since 1970 is attributed to the increase in women entering the paid work force. Today, economists estimate that raising women\u2019s participation in the work force to the same level as men could raise G.D.P. by another 5 percent in the United States \u2014 and by 9 percent in Japan and 34 percent in Egypt. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what can be accomplished when we use 50 percent of our human capacity,\u201d writes the investor Warren Buffett. \u201cIf you visualize what 100 percent can do, you\u2019ll join me as an unbridled optimist about America\u2019s future.\u201d", "To make gender parity a reality, we need to change the way we advocate for it.

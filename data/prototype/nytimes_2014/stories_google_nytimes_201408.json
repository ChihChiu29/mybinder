Professor Hancock was a co-author of the Facebook study in which the social network quietly manipulated the news feeds of nearly 700,000 people to learn how the changes affected their emotions. When the research was published in June, the outrage was immediate.", "Now Professor Hancock and other university and corporate researchers are grappling with how to create ethical guidelines for this kind of research. In his first interview since the Facebook study was made public, Professor Hancock said he would help develop such guidelines by leading a series of discussions among academics, corporate researchers and government agencies like the National Science Foundation.", "\u201cAs part of moving forward on this, we\u2019ve got to engage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a giant societal conversation that needs to take place.\u201d", "Scholars from M.I.T. and Stanford University are planning panels and conferences on the topic, and several academic journals are working on special issues devoted to ethics.", "Microsoft Research, a quasi-independent arm of the software company, is a prominent voice in the conversation.

The brainchild of a company data scientist, Adam D.\u2009I. Kramer, but designed and analyzed with help from Professor Hancock and another academic researcher, Jamie E. Guillory, it was intended to shed light on how emotions spread through large populations. Facebook deliberately changed the number of positive and negative posts in the subjects\u2019 news feeds over a week in January 2012, then looked at how the changes affected the emotional tone of the users\u2019 subsequent Facebook posts.", "In another well-known experiment, Facebook sent voting reminders to 61 million American users on Election Day in 2010. Some users also saw a list of their friends who said they had already voted, and the researchers found that the specific social nudge prompted more of those people to go to the polls. The study prompted some to suggest that Facebook had the power to sway election results.", "Such testing raises fundamental questions. What types of experiments are so intrusive that they need prior consent or prompt disclosure after the fact? How do companies make sure that customers have a clear understanding of how their personal information might be used? Who even decides what the rules should be?", "Existing federal rules governing research on human subjects, intended for medical research, generally require consent from those studied unless the potential for harm is minimal.

They found that it took 50 percent more mailings to get a callback for a black name. A white name yielded as much benefit as eight years of experience, according to the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.", "These doctors, principals, prosecutors and recruiters probably believe in equality and are unaware that they are discriminating. So any national conversation about race must be a vivisection of challenges far broader and deeper than we might like to think.", "Joshua Correll of the University of Colorado at Boulder has used an online shooter video game to try to measure these unconscious attitudes (you can play the game yourself). The player takes on the role of a police officer who is confronted with a series of images of white or black men variously holding guns or innocent objects such as wallets or cellphones. The aim is to shoot anyone with a gun while holstering your weapon in other cases.", "Ordinary players (often university undergraduates) routinely shoot more quickly at black men than at white men, and are more likely to mistakenly shoot an unarmed black man than an unarmed white man.", "I\u2019m typical. The first time I took the test, years ago, I shot armed blacks in an average of 0.679 seconds while waiting slightly longer \u2014 0.694 seconds \u2014 to shoot armed whites. I also holstered more quickly when confronted with unarmed whites than with unarmed blacks.", "In effect, we have a more impulsive trigger finger when confronted by black men and are more cautious with whites. This is true of black players as well, apparently because they absorb the same cultural values as everyone else: Correll has found no statistically significant difference between the play of blacks and that of whites in the shooting game.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole culture that promotes this idea of aggressive young black men,\u201d Correll notes. \u201cIn our minds, young black men are associated with danger.\u201d", "Further evidence for these unconscious attitudes toward race come from implicit association tests, a window into how our unconscious minds work. You can take them online at https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/.", "One finding is that we unconsciously associate \u201cAmerican\u201d with \u201cwhite.\u201d Thus, in 2008, some California college students \u2014 many who were supporting Barack Obama for president \u2014 unconsciously treated Obama as more foreign than Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. Likewise, Americans may be factually aware that Lucy Liu is an American actress and Kate Winslet is British, but the tests indicated that Americans considered Liu as more foreign than Winslet.", "Yet we needn\u2019t surrender to our most atavistic impulses. Prejudice is not immutable, and over all the progress in America on race is remarkable. In 1958, 4 percent of Americans approved of black-white marriages; today, 87 percent do.", "There\u2019s some evidence that training, metrics and policies can suppress biases or curb their impact. In law enforcement, more cameras \u2014 police car cams and body cams \u2014 create accountability and may improve behavior. When Rialto, Calif., introduced body cams on police officers, there was an 88 percent decline in complaints filed about police by members of the public.", "Yet an uncomfortable starting point is to understand that racial stereotyping remains ubiquitous, and that the challenge is not a small number of twisted white supremacists but something infinitely more subtle and complex: People who believe in equality but who act in ways that perpetuate bias and inequality."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/fashion/team-sports-are-taking-over-kids-lives.html": ["When my daughters were young, they had a book we all loved called \u201cJump into January.\u201d Every month was illustrated with a search-and-find painting filled with seasonal items.

His new book of geology-informed photographs, \u201cEarthArt: Colors of the Earth\u201d (the title page renders \u201cEarthArt\u201d as EARTH), ravishes the eye with combinations of pattern and riotous colors from around the world, in coffee-table size.", "The photographs \u2014 few smaller than 10 inches square and some much larger \u2014 span the rainbow, from the blood-red of a volcano tunnel in Kilauea, Hawaii, to the violet-fissured slate in Namib-Naukluft National Park, Namibia. No human traces are visible in these images, about 90 percent of them aerial and many taken over uninhabited, nearly inaccessible regions.", "Angelika Jung-H\u00fcttl, a geologist who has worked with Mr. Edmaier for 15 years, writes that Earth is the most colorful body in the universe (as far as we know, one should add). But it was not always that way. For half its life, it was variously molten, gray-black, blue and white, she writes; its current solid shades of red, yellow and brown result from the kind of chemical rock weathering that became possible only about two billion years ago, when the atmosphere was being enriched with free oxygen (presumably from blue-green cyanobacteria) that reacted to iron in the grayish-black crust. Green land plants came along about 500 million years ago and have been around for just one-ninth of the earth\u2019s history.", "The book also has a section on the sometimes bizarre history of color theory, by Stella Paul, an educator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The photographs are grouped by color, and Dr. Jung-H\u00fcttl introduces each color with an explanation of the various ways Earth produces it. For each image, she tells how the color got there.", "The reasons are not always obvious. The purple slate in Namibia, for instance, contains traces of iron and manganese, surrounded by a rusty iron crust from the desert\u2019s evaporating moisture. Glacier ice, she points out, is blue when tightly packed and the air bubbles have been mostly squeezed out; hence the ethereal blue of the Franz Josef Glacier on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, where it surrounds a meltwater lake.", "The waters around the Great Barrier Reef are so blue partly because the mangroves on Australia\u2019s east coast hold back the mud in river runoff. In an estuary in southern Iceland, acidic swamp water has released iron compounds from the volcanic rock and flushed them into a river as it crosses a marshland, turning the delta bright orange.", "White salt pans in the brownish Chalbi Desert of northern Kenya resemble the head in Munch\u2019s painting \u201cThe Scream.\u201d When the crusts of salt lakes suddenly turn red, it indicates the presence of halophilic bacteria, which thrive in saline conditions.", "In case readers are wondering if they can do just as well finding aerial views like these with Google Satellite, this reviewer tried. Only one or two of the 160 color images, photographs of glacial edges in Iceland, were remotely comparable on Google; the rest could not be found or were washed-out and dull compared with the book\u2019s lavish color and detailed patterns.", "Mr. Edmaier gets his images the hard way, arranging expeditions to remote areas and hiring local airplane and helicopter pilots to take him over just the right spots at low altitude, often again and again, until the conditions are just right. The dark of Crater Lake in Oregon is split by a pale yellow stream of summer pollen. Sprays of fossil coral in what was once red mud in an Austrian quarry look like a van Gogh landscape. At the boulder-strewn edge of the Erta Ale volcano in Ethiopia, the viewer peers into red hellfire surrounded by Stygian blackness.", "Hemingway didn\u2019t routinely tell his readers what typewriter he used, and Mr. Edmaier provides no information in the book about his equipment or techniques. In response to a query, he said he exclusively used Hasselblad cameras, employed absolutely no filters and did not digitally alter his images.

By mid-September, Planet Labs will have about 40 satellites, each weighing about nine pounds and the size of a shoe box, in a polar orbit over the planet.

After that, the company figures it can deliver a nearly complete photo mosaic of almost all of the planet, every 24 hours.", "There is also much to what he says, however. In terms of physical transformation, images of modern China, like the areas around the Beijing airport or the coal mines in Shanxi Province, barely show any natural contours, or even the rounding of age on human structures. Seemingly everything is new or under construction. In a \u201cbefore and after\u201d image, a dam in Brazil has over the last year lost much of its water, and the nearby coffee crop has declined.", "Even seemingly natural events on these grids, each 11 kilometers by 16 kilometers (about 7 miles by 10 miles), show the human hand. The red of a salt flat at the bottom of San Francisco Bay is concentrated from being penned in, and the water is evaporating. A far tip of Norway seems like rugged mountains, but from the left-hand side of the image there is the angular taming of a road, and a growing farm area.", "\u201cHumans are having such an impact now,\u201d Mr. Marshall said, \u201cone in four of our Earth images shows agriculture.

Throw in trends like collaboration and big data analysis, and all those bits of data become more dynamic than something in a file cabinet. They are fluid and being entered and retrieved from many points.", "Managing all that data should be a good business.", "The problem for everyone is price.

It has made further price cuts on other types of storage since then.

Cornell Tech is determined to do the opposite. Those responsible for building the campus of the future will not pretend to know what the future holds. They only hope they are building something malleable enough to handle it.", "Cornell and Technion joined forces in December 2011 when New York City officials selected them to build an applied-science graduate school on Manhattan\u2019s Roosevelt Island.

But behind the scenes Cornell Tech\u2019s soaring rhetoric is beginning to take the shape of hard commitments.", "This summer Cornell Tech finalized the construction design for its first academic building. It has also made crucial decisions about its information technology infrastructure and begun experimenting with classroom technologies. Earlier this year the institution released a video detailing the first phase of the project, which will include a residential tower, a \u201ccolocation building\u201d for industry partners, and the first academic building. Rubber, in other words, is meeting road, and it starts with what Mr. Huttenlocher calls the \u201chardscape.\u201d", "That includes the floor plan for the first academic building, which was finalized two months ago. The second, third and fourth stories of the five-level structure are stunningly undefined, dominated by large, uninterrupted spaces. Classrooms? Faculty offices? The building will have little of the former and none of the latter. Instead there are \u201coffice zones,\u201d which will be filled with workstations; those seeking some form of enclosure can enter a \u201chuddle room,\u201d \u201cswing space,\u201d \u201ccollab\u201d rooms or a \u201chub lounge.\u201d The entrepreneurial patois, conspicuous as it sounds, reflects an attempt to break down traditional academic boundaries.", "\u201cWe want this building to support and encourage collaboration across very different groups of people who might normally be siloed in different places across a university,\u201d Mr. Huttenlocher said. \u201cThat\u2019s a goal that we don\u2019t see changing over a 75-year time frame.\u201d", "Mr. Huttenlocher says he is getting some resistance from faculty members regarding the absence of offices. \u201cMy goal as the dean is to create an environment where it will be very open-plan like this. Does every faculty member agree with that view? No,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll be successful in that cultural change or not.\u201d", "Less contentious but equally intriguing is the technology integrated into the building design. David Wilts, an I.T. specialist with the design firm Arup and a consultant on the project, said Cornell Tech was attempting to create what he called the \u201choly grail\u201d of building-management systems, the so-called smart building. \u201cThe idea of a smart building has been around theoretically for decades,\u201d Mr. Wilts said. \u201cIt was first really talked about in great detail in the \u201970s, but only in the last five years has the technology price point dropped low enough.\u201d", "The concept is to have a structure where all the building-maintenance functions \u2014 such as heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and fire safety \u2014 are fully automated and share data with one another on a common network. For example, the light fixtures in Cornell Tech\u2019s first academic building will have sensors capable of reading room occupancy, and the light-sensor data will feed into an I.T. network that also controls the heating, cooling and scheduling systems. If a room still is not occupied, say, 10 minutes after the time for which it was reserved, the lights will dim, the air-conditioning will shut off, and the room will be reclassified as \u201cavailable\u201d on a room-scheduling app.", "Mr. Wilts believes that kind of interchange on a network spanning the campus will open eyes. \u201cPeople talk about getting every building system onto a network. That doesn\u2019t really accomplish anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat really accomplishes things is getting the data to actually be exchanged between all of these different systems and applications.\u201d", "The exact specifications of the building-management system are not yet certain. Unlike the physical plant, the fixtures that make up this smart-building network will need replacing about every decade, the team at Cornell Tech anticipates. How then to create something that works in 2017 but is flexible enough to accommodate the technologies of future decades? Mr. Wilts says the key \u201cis to use as many open standards and protocols as possible. If you\u2019re using open protocols and open languages, devices then become interchangeable.\u201d He points to the scheduling system, which was designed to accommodate a specific calendar and email program but has been recalibrated to become \u201cgeneric.\u201d", "The long-term effectiveness of this network will rely on the agility and reliability of the I.T. infrastructure. And on that front, the school is making perhaps its most notable gamble: It will not build a data center. \u201cWe fundamentally do not have a data center,\u201d said Scott Yoest, the I.T. director. \u201cWe don\u2019t even think that way.\u201d", "Data centers, which house large numbers of servers, cost money. They are bulky and suck down energy. They have also been a staple of college campuses for decades, providing the computing power and local storage necessary to accommodate research and daily use. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing for me after 25 years in I.T. higher ed to think of a campus without a data center,\u201d Mr. Yoest said. \u201cI stumbled on it for about the first three months.\u201d", "The idea of building a campus without a data center was Mr. Huttenlocher\u2019s. He and Mr. Yoest had what the latter called a \u201cheart to heart\u201d about the decision in 2012. The decision has obvious appeal given the quantum leaps in cloud computing, much of it driven by commercial vendors. Why build your own data storage when industry leaders can do the heavy lifting for you? It is a notion that I.T. professionals involved in academics say they have been mulling over for a while.", "\u201cI guarantee there is no one in higher ed more reliable than Google,\u201d said Sharif Nijim, enterprise application architect at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cYou can\u2019t compete with that scale. You can\u2019t compete with that salary paradigm. You\u2019re not going to attract that kind of talent. Take advantage of the fact that other people are landing that talent.\u201d He said that if he could build a campus from scratch today, he would forgo a data center.", "\u2018You\u2019re not saddled with all the detritus that\u2019s built up over time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s your biggest advantage.\u201d", "But the decision comes with risks, especially at an applied-sciences institution where data demands should be higher than at, say, a liberal-arts campus. The embedded assumption is that cloud computing will improve fast enough to accommodate a growing graduate institution.", "In its embrace of technological progress, the data-center decision encapsulates much of the Cornell Tech mind-set. It also exposes the risk of flirting with what Mr. Huttenlocher calls the \u201cbleeding edge.\u201d In other words, it is great to be at the technological forefront, until the technology does not work.And at present, there is a whole lot of technology that does not work for Cornell Tech. Its temporary campus inside Google\u2019s New York headquarters houses all sorts of experimental playthings. One room has three different videoconferencing systems, setting up a sort of natural selection based on whichever gets the most use.

The class took place in the fall of 2004 and what strikes me about it now is how primitive it was by today\u2019s technological standards. Indeed, the entire class consisted of the students sitting in a circle, staring at a speakerphone, and engaging in a dialogue about global health with a guest on the other end of the line. Fortunately for us, the guest was Dr. Paul Farmer, a path-breaking physician who co-founded the organization Partners in Health and who is the subject of a book the class had read, \u201cMountains Beyond Mountains.\u201d For forty minutes, the students peppered Farmer with questions about Haiti, about how to best use one\u2019s talents to address global health issues, and about how he had worked with Republicans and Democrats to ramp up global health funding.", "As soon as we hung up, it was immediately apparent that the talk had lit a fire under the students: they not only wanted to track down the books and films that Farmer had referenced, but they also wanted to form a global health club. I returned home that night and told my wife, \u201cI need to find a way to do this more often.\u201d Over the past ten years, I have pursued having students study complex global issues in depth and then engage in discussions with a range of experts. The good news is that teaching about global issues through the use of technology and expert speakers is far easier than one might expect, it has great appeal for teenagers, and it frequently leads to learning that extends far beyond the classroom.", "Thanks to the Internet, exposing students to global issues and to experts who work on them has never been easier. When I started my career, finding articles and videos on international issues was an arduous process that required hours of sleuthing and juggling VCR tapes; today it is possible with just a single computer to find and within minutes share information about even the most underreported international news stories. So, for example, if my class wanted to know more about the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, we could accomplish the following within a single period: find articles about it online, locate websites to track the disease\u2019s spread, set up Google Alerts to keep us abreast of the latest news, and reach out to experts in public health, journalism, history and government who could help us to understand the issue in greater depth. Since staging a dialogue with Paul Farmer a decade ago, we have been fortunate to arrange dozens of meetings or Skype calls with a wide range of experts that includes Muhammad Yunus, Jim Yong Kim, Laura Bush, Colin Powell, Jeffrey Sachs, Noam Chomsky, Bill Frist, Dan Ariely, Paul Collier, Alan Mulally, Christy Turlington, Adam Hochschild, Peter Singer and many more.\n\nLearning about global issues through the use of technology and expert speakers appeals to teenagers for two reasons. First, it\u2019s not \u201cbusy work.\u201d When students know that they are reading chapters from a macroeconomics text so that they can prepare for a wide-ranging dialogue with Jeffrey Sachs, they are eager to prepare as thoroughly as possible. Students appreciate that when they speak with an expert, they are able to ask critical questions and engage in an intellectual give-and-take with someone who (usually) treats their questions and opinions with respect. In fact, this goal of critically examining the issues and approaches that we are studying is one that is modeled by the experts with whom we speak. So, for example, my students spoke with Sachs and heard his ideas about why foreign aid can provide the big push that lifts nations out of poverty, and we also spoke with one of Sachs\u2019 most vocal critics, Nina Munk, whose book \u201cThe Idealist\u201d maintains that much of Sachs\u2019 efforts have failed. Similarly, my students met with World Bank President Jim Yong Kim on the same day that they went to a lecture by one of the Bank\u2019s harshest critics, William Easterly.", "Truth be told, my students have attended talks by Nicholas Kristof and met with the anthropologist Kathryn Mathers who began a piece by declaring, \u201cI do not want to write about Nicholas Kristof. The sheer banality of his representations of Africa paralyzes me.\u201d When students are exposed to these sorts of fierce disagreements, they, too, want to engage. In fact, one of the great pleasures of my job is watching students enter into critical, passionate discussions about the material we are studying \u2014 a feat that would not occur if they felt that what we were doing was \u201cbusy work.\u201d", "The second and perhaps more fundamental reason this approach to teaching about global issues works so well is because it taps into teenagers\u2019 acute sense of justice. It is the rare high school student who fails to feel angry when she learns about the violence in Syria or the lack of access to cheap, life-saving drugs in many parts of the world. Unlike so many adults who assume that they are powerless to impact these situations, my students believe that they can play a role in righting these wrongs. While the desire to become involved quickly can pose several dangers as many of us saw in the wake of \u201cKony 2012,\u201d this desire can also be an enormous asset for teachers. In my experience, when students feel morally stirred by an issue and want to impact it, they are willing to go to tremendous lengths to understand the issue in all of its complexity.", "This past year when my students learned about the struggles associated with the post-earthquake reconstruction of Haiti, they felt angry but, more importantly, they knew that unless they had a deep grasp of the response to the earthquake and Haiti\u2019s history prior to 2010, their anger could not be channeled constructively. Once our class had taken the time and effort to learn this history, each student researched an issue essential to the reconstruction of Haiti. On their own, they read widely, wrote critically and arranged their own interviews with experts. They conducted phone and Skype conversations with engineers from Georgia Tech, reporters from The Washington Post, police who have trained officers in Haiti and lawyers who are suing the United Nations regarding the cholera epidemic. At the end of the unit, the students hosted a forum in which they educated more than 350 members of our town\u2019s community about the reconstruction process. Watching these students channel their sense of justice about Haiti\u2019s reconstruction into a constructive form of action that engaged so many people was deeply satisfying, but what I find even more sustaining is that for many of these students \u2014 as has been true of students in previous global issues classes \u2014 the work that they did for class marks only the beginning of their engagement with global issues.", "By far, the most satisfying element of teaching about global issues is that it has led to clear gains outside my classroom. Students have formed a Global Poverty Reading Group that meets outside of school and reads texts that most students would not encounter until college. Through the global health club, students have raised more than $125,000 for global health nongovernmental organizations whose work they admire. They have presented research at the Haitian Studies Association conference in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Many students who had not previously taken many honors or AP courses have realized that they are capable of succeeding in those courses. This was especially true of a class that I taught last year that had the highest number of racial minorities of any honors class in our school and that had the opportunity to meet with many experts, including World Bank President Jim Yong Kim. These and other students leave high school with a clear desire to work on international issues in the future; in fact, many of them have already started this work by going on gap years, interning for organizations involved in international development, and learning about gender inequality in the field.", "Given that the goal has been to get students excited and engaged on global issues, I would consider this work to be successful regardless of whether these students\u2019 occupational plans change.", "Having said that, it is encouraging to see that so many former students in their mid-20s pursue careers that are directly influenced by their high school global issues experiences. Last month, I had lunch with Ashish Premkumar, who was in the room when Paul Farmer spoke to us in 2004. Although he is only 26, Ashish has worked in Zambia, Lebanon and South Africa, graduated from medical school, and begun his medical residency at University of California, San Francisco, in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Ashish traces his interest in this work to the experience of being 15 and speaking with Farmer, but notes that Farmer gave him more than mere inspiration when they reconnected five years later. While an undergraduate at Boston University, Ashish had the opportunity to introduce Farmer at a campus event and the two spoke about Ashish\u2019s plans to work abroad as a physician and medical anthropologist. Struck by Ashish\u2019s abiding passion for global health, Farmer offered to guide Ashish through the residency application process and wrote letters of recommendation on his behalf. While Ashish\u2019s experience with Farmer is undoubtedly a bit out of the ordinary, it illustrates the larger point that when high school students are exposed to global issues and experts, the impact can be transformative.", "Matt Cone is a global studies teacher at Carrboro High School in Carrboro, N.C.

Uber\u2019s network of drivers in San Francisco doesn\u2019t help it become a market leader in Austin; it has to create and defend its network everywhere.

The rich are flown in on private planes, then picked up at the Burning Man airport, driven to their camp and served like kings and queens for a week.

He specifically mentions medical support jobs, building trades and some clerical jobs that require decision-making rather than typing and filing.", "In the paper, Mr. Autor presents data showing that these middle-skill jobs have indeed been under pressure over the last few decades, with much stronger growth in the number of both very basic low-paying jobs and the most advanced jobs for skilled professionals. It is a hollowing-out of the American work force, in effect, with fewer jobs for technicians and factory workers and the middle-class wages that come with them.", "But while acknowledging the trend in the past, Mr. Autor argues there\u2019s not much reason to expect it to continue in the future.", "\u201cI expect that a significant stratum of middle-skill, non-college jobs combining specific vocational skills with foundational middle skills \u2014 literacy, numeracy, adaptability, problem-solving and common sense \u2014 will persist in the coming decades.\u201d He argues that it is hard to blame computerization for jobs that have disappeared over the last decade in that much of the shift happened after capital investment in information technology fell following the collapse of the dot-com bubble.", "Undergirding Mr. Autor\u2019s optimism is the fact that mankind has consistently feared that technology will replace its jobs, and consistently been wrong. At the dawn of the 20th century, he notes, 41 percent of the American work force worked in agriculture, a number that fell to 2 percent by 2000.

Although the matching has Big Brother overtones, Facebook says it takes pains to protect user privacy, using a complex process to make individual profiles anonymous before matching them.", "At the meeting, Mr. Rodrigues argued that MegaRed\u2019s money would be best spent going after a narrow group of consumers. Tapping into Datalogix\u2019s database of retail purchases, MegaRed wanted to find not just current fish oil users but other people worried about their hearts. Called \u201clookalikes,\u201d they are signaled by their purchases of products like canned salmon, oatmeal, Cheerios, health supplements, aspirin and blood pressure monitors, as well as by liking Facebook pages on heart-related topics.", "The Facebook folks countered that such specific targeting would be very expensive. Under Facebook\u2019s auction system, advertisers compete for limited slots in the users\u2019 news feeds; the more targeted the pitch, the higher the cost for reaching each 1,000 people. With only a small pool of targets, R.B. would be competing with other brands that wanted to reach those same people, forcing it to pay more to be the advertiser that won the slot.", "Also, Mr. Prescott argued, the emotional campaign for MegaRed might very well draw in people whose potential interest in fish oil was not readily apparent. MegaRed should show ads to every American woman 45 and older and see who was interested in each one, then place those ads in the feeds of people in the same demographic buckets, he said.", "Kyle Benedetti, who at the time was director of sales for SocialCode, an ad management platform working with R.B. and Facebook, said, \u201cWe can tell you within the first 15 minutes of a post whether it\u2019s a good post or a bad post.\u201d", "In Mr. Faracci\u2019s experience, that ability to shift a Facebook campaign quickly based on immediate feedback was the platform\u2019s biggest strength.", "Mr. Rodrigues was more skeptical. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether Facebook is the right tool,\u201d he said.", "\u201cLet us take these inputs and see how big these audiences are,\u201d Mr. Schnabel urged.

That was better than R.B.\u2019s historical return from TV ads, which the company measures once every year or two.", "MegaRed also gained more than a percentage point of market share, with 9.2 percent of the dollar value of the heart-health market, based on R.B.\u2019s analysis of IRI shopper data through Feb. 23. R.B. was also running TV ads, handing out samples and doing in-store marketing at the same time, but the company says the Facebook campaign contributed to the gains.", "The campaign\u2019s performance turned Mr. Rodrigues into a Facebook fan, and MegaRed is now running video ads on the social network.", "\u201cWe need to be where the consumer is,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cAnd if on top of that, I get a bigger return on my investment, that\u2019s even better.\u201d", "Still, television will continue to get most of the marketing budget, both for MegaRed and for other R.B. brands. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to stop TV,\u201d Mr. Faracci said. \u201cIt has a massive role to play.

Huvafen Fushi claims, for instance, to have the largest wine cellar in the Indian Ocean, a climate-controlled chamber boasting bottles of Roman\u00e9e-Conti that sell for nearly $30,000.

Working with a team of local partners, Mr. Corbin built 30 rooms with coral stone walls and palm thatch roofs. There were brackish water showers and barbecues on the beach. When it was first established, Kurumba was reachable only by dhoni, a type of native open-air vessel with an outboard motor.", "From this modest start, the tourist business in the Maldives has rapidly expanded to the point that there are now more than 100 resorts, 30 or so of which define themselves as deluxe and offer amenities like lime-and-ginger salt scrubs and private starlight dinners on the beach. Four or five additional resorts are going up each year. The clientele is mainly European \u2014 British and Italian \u2014 though the number of Chinese visitors is on the rise.", "The Maldivian economy, formerly based on fishing, would probably not exist without the tourist trade, which, according to official statistics, provided the government with almost half of its revenues last year. The travel boom has continued despite the election last November of President Abdulla Yameen, an Islamist whose platform, now enacted, included a plan to institute the death penalty \u2014 even for children \u2014 under Shariah law.", "As I soon discovered, it was not entirely correct that visitors to the Maldives are not exposed to, or affected by, the country\u2019s Islamic culture. In 2007, for example, 12 foreign tourists \u2014 from England, China and Japan \u2014 were wounded after Muslim extremists set off a bomb in Sultan Park near Mal\u00e9\u2019s main mosque. Three years later, a YouTube video emerged of a British couple unwittingly insulted while renewing their wedding vows at the Vilu Reef Beach & Spa Resort.

One day, on our sunny deck at the Naladhu resort, I came across a story describing how a Sri Lankan man arrested on terrorism charges in India in April had been planning additional attacks on locations in the Maldives. I also found another, perhaps less daunting, piece about Abraham Naim, a famous Maldivian drag queen, who had fled the Maldives to New Zealand where he now performs a cross-dressing show designed to highlight \u201cthe injustices faced by gay Muslims\u201d in his homeland.", "A few days later, I went to the spa at the third resort we stayed at, the Holiday Inn on Kandooma Fushi island, to ask about prices for the facial Cheyne wanted. After quoting me her rates, the spa attendant jokingly suggested that we ought to act fast \u2014 a couple of years ago, she added, the government had shut the spa down, bending to demands from an Islamic opposition group.", "It\u2019s important to mention that never once during our trip did Cheyne or I feel awkward or unsafe. Far from it: We swam on our own on empty beaches; there were carefree walks alone beneath the palm fronds. The things that I had read about were not unsettling in any immediate way, but rather offered glimpses of what was taking place, apparently unseen, in portions of the country not designed for tourists.", "Still, by the end of the visit, I felt I needed to explore what the Maldives had to offer beyond the pampered bubble of resorts, and so one afternoon I arranged a trip to the undeveloped island of Guraidhoo. Guraidhoo, with its unpaved streets and leashless dogs, is home to about 2,000 ordinary Maldivians \u2014 most of whom, it seemed, were on the beach in hammocks on the day that I arrived. My guide, Imran Janeen, was pleased to show me Guraidhoo\u2019s hospital and its dilapidated shipbuilding yard where 20 shirtless men were toiling on a huge wooden yacht that had, I was told, been under construction for the last two years. I asked Imran about religion in Guraidhoo \u2014 if Islam was strictly practiced. He told me that there were three mosques on the island, which is only 40 acres. Then again, he said, there were also seven guesthouses, eight or nine restaurants (depending on the season) and \u2014 astonishingly \u2014 50 souvenir shops.", "After I was led into what seemed like a dozen of these shops, Imran and I stopped into the Peach Tree, a side-street restaurant serving Indian cuisine.

He drafted a Washington Post opinion column about 12333 by hand to avoid introducing any classified information on an insecure computer, and submitted it for prepublication government review.", "But he said he felt compelled to speak out.

The results from other services that assemble knowledge bases, Bing and Wolfram Alpha, were similar.", "But things that are readily understood by humans \u2014 that apples taste sweet and have a crunchy texture in the mouth when chewed, for example \u2014 are a challenge for the algorithms that generate digital databases.", "\u201cCurrent knowledge bases are full of facts,\u201d Mr. Etzioni observed, \u201cbut they are surprisingly knowledge poor.\u201d", "The \u201cbig\u201d in big data tends to get all the attention, Mr. Etzioni said, but thorny problems often reside in a seemingly simple sentence or two. He showed the sentence: \u201cThe large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam.\u201d He asked, What was made of Styrofoam? The large ball? Or the table? The table, humans will invariably answer. But the question is a conundrum for a software program, Mr. Etzioni explained, because the correct answer involves both grammar and background knowledge. And the latter is something humans acquire through experience of the world.", "Computers can\u2019t experience the world as humans do. And Mr. Etzioni is skeptical of the progress that will be possible with \u201cdeep learning,\u201d an artificial intelligence technique that uses the structure of the human brain as metaphorical inspiration for computer systems that process huge amounts of data.", "Instead, at the Allen Institute, financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Mr. Etzioni is leading a growing team of 30 researchers that is working on systems that move from data to knowledge to theories, and then can reason. The test, he said, is: \u201cDoes it combine things it knows to draw conclusions?\u201d This is the step from correlation, probabilities and prediction to a computer system that can understand, in its way. That seems a steep climb of the semantic ladder of meaning. \u201cWe are trying to build these semantic models,\u201d Mr. Etzioni noted.", "Mr. Etzioni\u2019s presentation was titled, \u201cThe Battle for the Future of Data Mining.\u201d But other computer scientists see the big data approach and the quest for understanding described by Mr. Etzioni as less a battle than different yet complementary paths, heading in the same broad direction. The long-range promise, they say, is technology that becomes a layer of data-driven artificial intelligence that resides on top of both the physical and digital worlds, helping people to make faster and smarter decisions as a kind of clever software assistant.", "Mr. Etzioni, other scientists say, makes a good point, but the current enthusiasm for big data methods is understandable. \u201cThe dramatic successes of big data have caused everyone to rush over to that side of the boat,\u201d said Edward Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington, who is on the board of the Allen Institute.", "And the correlation and prediction of data science has certainly been good to Mr. Etzioni, whose talents include being a successful entrepreneur.

Ebay purchased Decide in 2013.", "The keynote speaker on Tuesday morning, Eric Horvitz, a computer scientist at Microsoft Research, emphasized all that can be done with big data tools. His talk was titled, \u201cData, Predictions, and Decisions in Support of People and Society.\u201d In his presentation, Mr. Horvitz described several projects he and his team were working on. One involves using patient, treatment and historical data to predict which hospital patients are most at risk of being readmitted within 30 days, and suggest follow-up monitoring. Studies show that 20 percent of Medicare patients return to the hospital within 30 days at an estimated cost of $17.5 billion a year, in addition to the toll in human suffering.", "Later, in a hallway conversation, a university computer scientist asked Mr. Horvitz about whether the software draws conclusions about the causes of hospital re-admissions. You can construct plausible explanations from the data, Mr. Horvitz replied. \u201cBut we don\u2019t care,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course, we care in general and work to understand the mechanisms underlying outcomes. But it doesn\u2019t matter to the effectiveness of the technology.\u201d", "In an interview, Mr. Horvitz, who is an academic adviser to the Allen Institute, agreed with Mr. Etzioni that the long-range goal is computer systems that can reason rather than merely recognize patterns and correlations and make predictions. But Mr. Horvitz chose a different emphasis. \u201cI think we can have a huge impact in so many fields, in the shorter term, along the way to deeper machine intelligences.\u201d Mr. Horvitz said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-sister-acts.html": ["IN an age of villainy, war and inequality, it makes sense that we need superheroes.

One is great, one has some issues. To be specific:", "The Temperley film, titled \u201cWhite Magic,\u201d runs 1 minute and 49 seconds, and was made in conjunction with Net-a-Porter, where you buy the stuff, and Cinematique, which has made something of a specialty out of creating shoppable video.

Adam Tanner\u2019s ostensible objective is to reveal big secrets about how Las Vegas casinos, notably those owned by Caesars Entertainment, collect and use data that customers drop when they visit, just as they drop money. Surely, there\u2019s something sexier about this than there is about the way Amazon analyzes you based on your purchases. Surely there\u2019s something about gambling that makes it different from surfing the web. Not exactly. Mr. Tanner, a fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard and a former Reuters bureau chief, spends a lot of time covering familiar ground. And not all of it is in Nevada. He starts at Harvard Business School, where Gary Loveman joined the faculty at 29 and became known for an article about the financial value of customer satisfaction. As part of his job, he trained executives from Harrah\u2019s, the casino giant. A few years later, he left academia to become Harrah\u2019s chief operating officer and moved to Las Vegas. He may have been the only guy in town who used words like \u201cstochastic\u201d and \u201cvitiate\u201d in conversation.", "Harrah and Caesars have since melded into Caesars Entertainment, and Mr. Loveman is one of Mr. Tanner\u2019s primary sources. Mr. Loveman\u2019s development of a loyalty program for Caesars\u2019 best customers has been a success, but it hardly seems revelatory, at least as Mr. Tanner describes it. They get coupons and trips and a special lounge and reduced prices at buffets; they get free chips as an incentive to show up frequently. Caesars knows a lot about them. The biggest issue this book addresses is how and when that information should be used.", "A lot of \u201cWhat Stays in Vegas\u201d is about the data digging or online advertising outfits that might sell Caesars information about its customers. These businesses span a wide spectrum, from super-sleazy to merely profit-motivated. At the \u201ccreepy\u201d end of things (this word comes up fairly often, with good reason) are blackmail sites like Instant Checkmate, which has sent out messages like this: \u201cRISK ALERT: Very Negative Information Was Added To Your Online File (See what it was).\u201d", "Then there is bustedmugshots.com, which posts mug shots to amuse and entertain an online audience, no matter how much harm this inflicts on the people in the pictures. Kyle Prall, who started the site, has no trouble justifying its ethics to Mr. Tanner (\u201cIt\u2019s a public record: It belongs to the public\u201d) even though Mr. Prall is a felon.", "What does this have to do with Las Vegas? Not much, though Mr. Tanner finds a way to cycle back to Caesars at the end of each chapter somehow. Among his better digressions is discovering that some Internet sites post pictures of attractive management teams that don\u2019t really exist. When he tried to contact the attractive spokeswoman for Instant Checkmate, whose name was given as Kristen Bright, he discovered that workers at the company had never seen her.", "Through some fancy footwork possible only in the Internet age, and with the hired help of a background data broker site, he did a Google image search on her face, traced it to a picture on a blog, learned that she was named Ann and located her through a job she\u2019d held. Not surprisingly, she knew nothing about how her photo had been used. \u201cGeez, if they would have asked, I could have sold a better photo!\u201d she said.", "Again, no Vegas connection here. And there\u2019s no news in Mr. Tanner\u2019s overriding thought that the Internet\u2019s destruction of privacy is dangerous, unmonitored and everywhere. The casino business seems innocent and squeaky-clean compared with many of the other things discussed here. For one thing, until recently, it relied on cash, which is cumbersome, untraceable and not a useful data source at all. Now that gamblers in Nevada can use prepaid cash cards, places like Caesars know more about what they eat, how much they spend, and whether they\u2019ve bought souvenir T-shirts from \u201cThe Hangover\u201d movies \u2014 shot at Caesars Palace and now a theme for its slot machines, \u201cin an example of life imitating art.\u201d", "Among the more alarming points brought up here is that data analysis can extrapolate far more about things like sexual orientation and health conditions than it used to. Mr. Tanner demonstrates how easy it is to find a person\u2019s medical records with only a birth date and a ZIP code. As for sexual orientation, thank social networking sites for that: The \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook are fodder for Vegas data crunchers, who think that a man who likes Britney Spears is more apt to be gay than one who likes Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Mr. Loveman, now chairman, chief executive and president of Caesars, has had to face ethical decisions about how much personal probing his business should do in order to remain competitive and where the invasion of privacy begins.", "At the end of the book, Mr. Tanner emphasizes the point that data is valuable, and that we should know what we\u2019re giving away. That issue has already been brilliantly explored by Jaron Lanier in \u201cWho Owns the Future?,\u201d a book not included in this one\u2019s somewhat dated bibliography. (Actual entries: David Ogilvy\u2019s 1997 autobiography and Vance Packard\u2019s 1957 \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders.\u201d) But Mr. Tanner does include a helpful appendix listing specific ways to guard your privacy, block the sale of private information, encrypt personal documents and more. Here\u2019s a radical one: If you\u2019d like to make a purchase that\u2019s no one\u2019s business, just go to the store.

Police departments and their equipment suppliers are outfitting their officers with on-body cameras that promise to eliminate the photographic void we saw in Ferguson.

Though police unions were once ardently against these systems, much of the resistance has faded. In a few small studies, on-body cameras have been shown to significantly reduce both complaints against officers as well as episodes in which officers use force. Consequently, they often pay for themselves by reducing the cost of litigation.", "\u201cWhen we first introduced this a few years ago, there was skepticism,\u201d said Rick Smith, the chief executive of Taser International, whose Axon line of body cameras has been purchased by more than 1,200 police agencies in the United States. \u201cNow every police officer knows that they\u2019re being recorded by someone on a smartphone \u2014 and every police chief I talk to says it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when, they\u2019ll be using on-body cameras.\u201d", "In 2012, Taser began selling its most advanced body camera, the Axon Flex, which can be clipped to an officer\u2019s sunglasses, hat, helmet or epaulets. The Flex, which sells for $599 a unit, captures a wide-angle view that is close to what an officer sees while on patrol. Other cameras, including those made by Vievu, Taser\u2019s largest competitor, clip to an officer\u2019s shirt or belt. Because on-body cameras also capture high-fidelity audio, watching their videos offers a strangely intimate view of police work, as if you\u2019re playing a video game.", "Throughout an officer\u2019s shift, Taser\u2019s camera is constantly recording what it sees. But most of its images are kept in a 30-second buffer, after which they\u2019re discarded. The unit begins saving longer segments of video \u2014 and begins capturing audio \u2014 only when an officer double-taps a control switch.", "The 30-second buffer is a way of allowing officers to essentially record events that began in the past. \u201cSay the officer sees someone run a red light \u2014 obviously the officer didn\u2019t know that was going to happen,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cBut once he starts recording, we go back and grab that 30 seconds before that.\u201d", "The buffer includes just video, not audio, which is saved after the officer hits Record. The video-only buffer is meant to protect officers\u2019 privacy.", "Taser\u2019s Axon cameras are paired with the company\u2019s online storage service, Evidence.com, for which police departments pay a monthly fee of $15 to $55 per officer, depending on how much storage space they use.", "At the end of each shift, an officer plugs the camera into a charging dock, and all videos are uploaded to Evidence.com. Police departments determine how long videos are retained; often retention times are related to the statute of limitations for the episodes the videos depict. Departments also set policies on who can watch the videos, and Evidence.com keeps an audit trail of all views.", "One question about the deployment of on-body cameras concerns which encounters should be recorded, and when. Scott Greenwood, a civil rights lawyer who focuses on police misconduct and who also consults with police departments considering deploying camera systems, recommends that police adopt a policy requiring officers to record nearly all contacts with people.", "\u201cIt\u2019s most protective of the officer, of the members of the public, and of the agency if you record all of them and don\u2019t allow officers discretion to decide which things to record and which not to record,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Greenwood said he has seen instances in which officers have deliberately tried to obscure a camera\u2019s field of view before approaching a civilian. As a result, he encourages departments to construe an officer\u2019s failure to record an encounter in which misconduct is later claimed as a negative strike in any proceedings against the officer. To ensure civilian privacy, Mr. Greenwood suggests that police departments exempt some videos captured in private homes from public records requests.", "But not all of these guidelines are being adopted. In Mesa, Ariz., where the police department now has about 160 cameras, a pilot test showed that when officers were given the discretion to record, many decided not to do so. Now the department has a mandatory recording rule, according to Mesa\u2019s chief, Frank Milstead. Fort Worth, which plans to have 600 cameras deployed by the end of the year, does not require recording in most instances, though officers are encouraged to capture encounters with people.", "Chief Milstead, of Mesa, said that in addition to reducing complaints, the cameras have been helpful in interviewing witnesses and suspects after a crime. \u201cWhen you get them on video, they\u2019re locked into a story that you can play back in court,\u201d Chief Milstead said.", "Cameras have also helped train new police and confront problem officers. \u201cWe had a lawsuit we just settled, where you could see the officer was about to go toward this woman, and just then the camera turns off,\u201d said Michael Chitwood, the chief of police in Daytona Beach, Fla. \u201cWhen the camera comes back on, her front teeth are knocked out.\u201d", "The officer claimed that the camera malfunctioned, but a forensic examination by Taser concluded that the camera was working perfectly.", "\u201cWe settled the lawsuit because of that question, Why would you want the camera off?\u201d Chief Chitwood said. \u201cYou turn the camera off because you knew you were going to knock her teeth out.\u201d The officer later resigned.", "By shedding light on such encounters, Taser argues that cameras can do more than simply resolve individual disputes. \u201cThis helps us address the whole relationship between a police department and their community,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWhen that relationship gets off, really bad things happen.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/opinion/china-harasses-us-tech-companies.html": ["China has opened what appear to be politically motivated antitrust investigations into American technology companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm.

This leaves us developers one choice: concurrent execution of code. The recent growth in popularity of functional programming is well deserved. As things become more asynchronous, the functional model really fits well. Being able to sequence, chain and transform asynchronous operations can be considered a must.

Ultimately, though, the magnitude of warming we experience will not be determined by emissions in any one year, but by cumulative CO2 emissions. Thus, climate scientists and energy-economic modelers have developed hundreds of plausible scenarios of future emissions and used them to identify emissions pathways that might achieve climate policy goals. Such scenarios are powerful tools for connecting emissions and warming to trajectories of population growth, economic development, and energy use. However, these trajectories are constrained by tremendous socio-economic inertia (e.g., existing energy, transport and built infrastructures) that limits the rate at which CO2 emissions can be reduced and climate change avoided.", "In 2010, Davis et al [background] quantified an important component of socio-economic inertia by estimating the future emissions expected from all existing fossil fuel-burning infrastructure worldwide, naming these \u2018committed\u2019 emissions. That paper provided a single data point (commitments as of 2009), but lacked the context perhaps most important to policymakers: how these committed emissions have changed over time. Here we provide that context. We show that, despite international efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, total remaining commitments in the global power sector have not declined in a single year since 1950 and are in fact growing rapidly (by an average of 4% per year 2000\u20132012).", "The annual \u2018commitment accounting\u2019 that we demonstrate here offers policymakers an opportunity to evaluate historical trends and to quantify the long-term consequences of current actions in a new way.", "Environmental Research Web has posted \u201cWhy our carbon-dioxide emissions are like credit-card debt,\u201d which explains how it grew out of earlier work by Davis and others (Davis, Caldeira and Matthews, Science, 2010).

The way we\u2019ve been tracking carbon-dioxide emissions reinforces this remoteness: the annual emissions we monitor are small relative to the cumulative emissions that will cause large temperature increases.

That challenge has been largely ignored, with the policy focus placed on emissions and emissions reduction and the political will to reduce them, without due regard to the current limits on alternative low carbon energy technologies. The failure to address the Hoffert et al energy technology question is reflected in the fact that since 2000 (and including 2013) the share of global energy consumption accounted for by fossil fuels has remained essentially constant at 86.5-87.0%. (Here I use BP Energy Statistics.) globally, the \u201cprogress\u201d made with non-hydro renewables is offset by a decline in energy from nuclear power plants.

The implication is that there is a serious tradeoff between constraining cumulative global CO2 emissions and meeting the needs of developing countries for increased electrification services.  Truth is, the CO2 commitment from new generating capacity in the poorest countries will be small, even if they build mostly coal.  But building mostly coal is not the only path they or other countries need to follow to expand electrification services.  When the world\u2019s wealthiest countries begin to take climate protection seriously, there are ways in which any incremental costs of pursuing a low-carbon electrification path in poorer countries can be shared based on all countries\u2019 strategic interests in avoiding a disrupted climate.", "Steve Davis, one of the paper authors, added this:", "Dave is right to point out that the largest commitments we\u2019ve quantified are only distantly related to meeting the energy needs of the underserved.

But my comment addresses the huge energy demands as people move beyond the very poorest. Think here of the many countries, especially the populous ones, that are industrializing and urbanizing. They inevitably will require a lot of energy, if for no other reason than that materials for construction (steel, cement, flat glass, aluminum, copper) are hugely energy intensive \u2014 with energy intensities an order of magnitude higher than that for most other manufactured goods. Think too about the demand for appliances including air conditioning as people move into the middle class. These are key factors in the rise in energy demand and the observed increase in fossil fuel generating capacity.", "I also take issue with Dave\u2019s suggestion of good alternatives to fossil fuel generated energy. With the possible exception of nuclear energy, which to date has faced numerous hurdles, there certainly aren\u2019t on anything like the scale required.

Unfortunately, the dominant frameworks used for understanding the energy access challenge \u2014 including those of the UN and IEA \u2014 are pretty clearly unacceptable. There are two main problems. The first is an almost exclusive focus on basic household electricity access, often in remote areas, without attendant attention to urbanizing populations, industrializing economies, etc. The second is the scale of ambition. As most on this thread will know, energy access is defined at 250-500kWh/year. This compares to the average German consumption of over 7000kWh/yr. With German levels of consumption, a planet of 9-10 billion in midcentury would require three times as much energy as the world does today.", "If we don\u2019t start with this very basic, fundamental point, then we\u2019re not really having a discussion about energy development or climate change.

No one has yet conceived of a feasible energy development strategy \u2014 to power cities, industries, major infrastructure, etc \u2014 with renewables or nuclear as the dominant energy sources. Fortunately, a lot of the much-needed work on delivering truly scalable and affordable zero-carbon alternative is being done in the developing world itself.

But non-hydro renewables (NHRs) and all hydro accounted for only 5.7%, 28% and 19%, respectively, of primary energy consumption in 2013 in these three countries. If only NHRs are considered the percentages would be much lower.", "2. Globally, NHRs accounted for 2.2% of primary energy consumption in 2013\u2014up from 0.5% in 2000. If all hydro is added in the share in 2013 rises to 8.9%.", "3. All of the gain in share of NHRs share since 2000, was offset by the decline in share of nuclear.", "4. Lovins claims regarding the contribution of NHRs to electricity consumption in China in 2013 must contend with the fact that the NHRs increased by only 9.4 million million tonnes of oil equivalent (mTOE) between 2012-2013 compared to 100 mTOE for fossil fuels.", "As indicated in an earlier intervention, low carbon energy has not made any inroads into the 86.5-87% dominant share of fossil fuels in global energy consumption since 2000. What NHRs have gained has been at the expense of nuclear", "I would note that Alex Trembath\u2019s useful intervention to this discussion provides insight into why we can expect global energy consumption will continue to grow, and tangentially why so much of that energy will be supplied by fossil fuels without an major breakthroughs in energy technology.", "Trembath built on Green\u2019s comment:", "Indeed, Professor Green, the numbers for even 2013 are not nearly as optimistic as Dr. Lovins suggests. Over 2012, 2013 consumption of different energy sources rose by the following amounts, measured in Mtoe (note these are primary energy, not only electricity):", "Oil: 46.1", "Gas: 34.1", "Coal: 103.0", "Nuclear: 3.3", "Hydro: 22.2", "Wind: 24.0", "Solar: 6.9", "(Source: BP 2014)", "There really ought to be a collegial rule against discussing energy consumption trends without mentioning capacity factor, which explain why 68% of capacity added in 2013 was renewable but a much smaller minority of added generation was renewable. Capacity factor of course also explains why renewables excluding large hydro (and excluding CHP) account for almost twice the installed capacity of global nuclear, yet nuclear in 2013 still generated about 20% more electricity than all those sources combined. These graphs are taken from RMI\u2019s Micropower Database; the first is capacity and the second is generation:", "Of course we see here also how essential including cogeneration (typically combined heat and power using natural gas) is for drawing such optimistic conclusions about micro generation.", "I\u2019m also not sure along what metric Dr. Lovins finds that \u201c globally and nationally, renewables excluding big hydro have scaled at least as fast as nuclear power ever did.\u201d As this analysis by my colleagues shows, the best cases of nuclear have outpaced the best cases of nuclear when the metric is added generation divided by national population:", "Of course some of the fastest energy, not carbon, transitions have been with natural gas. The UK went from 0% natural gas for electricity in 1990 to 40% in 2000. The US deployed over 250 GW of natural gas generation capacity in the last 20 years, and here\u2019s what our own energy transition has looked like:", "Certain subsidized and unsubsidized renewables projects can come in at low cost, and we should celebrate these and learn from their successes. But while Dr. Lovins cites 7c/kWh as a best case for solar, the EIA still finds average LCOE of solar at 13c/kWh, higher than advanced nuclear and, of course, higher than natural gas. Wind does appear to have reached an all time low, settling in 4-6c/kWh unsubsidized, as the recent LBNL report showed. However, it must be remembered that these technologies\u2019 value to the grid decreases, and integration cost increases, with higher penetration. This is from the work of Lawrence Berkeley National Labs:", "This dynamic is evident in Germany, where wholesale power prices are being depressed by must-dispatch, low-marginal cost renewables, but balancing this intermittency is causing retail power prices to rise, both from increasing FIT commitments, and increasingly with costs like capacity payments for baseload power stations and curtailment payments for excess renewables. Here\u2019s the results of a review of increasing integration costs from variable renewables:", "On the efficiency side of things, we and others have long requested that RMI better incorporate rebound effects into modeling future energy consumption patterns. For instance. In Reinventing Fire (RF), Lovins et al cite 2 studies finding transportation sector rebounds at 3 and 22 percent, but ultimately exclude transportation rebounds from their analysis (Sorrell 2007\u2019s survey and the European Commission\u2019s review find transpo rebound between 10 and 30 percent; Gavankar and Geyer 2010 identify long-term rebounds between 20 and 65 percent). RF uses 10 and 5 percent rebound for heating and cooling respectively, while Sorrell 2007 finds 10-30 percent for heating and 1-26 percent for cooling. RF rejects the idea of rebounds effects in industrial processes, while Saunders finds rebound in energy intensive industries like primary metals, utilities, manufacturing, and agriculture to be in the range of 20-35 percent. The IPCC and the IEA have recently begun to incorporate rebound effects into their analyses, largely at the behest of organizations like Breakthrough, UKERC, the European Commission, and vocal scholars like Harry Saunders, Steve Sorrell, Joyashree Roy, Dorothy Maxwell, and Karen Turner.", "I think it\u2019s clear from the above that the world still continues to rely primarily on fossil fuels for development and that even the richest economies are far from achieving significant scaling of renewables (or nuclear) for major decarbonization. Where renewables have scaled, they have brought national electricity prices right up with them. This is especially true for solar PV, where in Germany and Spain FIT payments have caused serious energy policy turmoil, and in the US, where net metering policies have caused public utility backlash against PV deployment in states like Arizona and California (a result of utilities being forced to pay 15-30ckWh for PV electricity instead of purchasing on the wholesale markets for 4-6c/kWh).", "To return to the point of Andy\u2019s original prompt. Renewables are expanding and their costs are declining, but isolated and contextless success stories don\u2019t help us understand the true scale of both the climate and energy development challenges. Drs. Davis and Socolow\u2019s intervention with the new paper is extremely helpful because it aims to reveal the scale of the challenge. While renewables continue to develop worldwide \u2014 and while countries as varied as US, UK, China, South Korea, Turkey, UAE, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Jordan, etc continue to develop nuclear \u2014 fossil still reigns. Now the deployment of fossil and coal generation in regions like sub-Saharan Africa is very likely a net positive for humanity, since a lack of modern electricity systems is largely what makes those locales most vulnerable to climate and other impacts in the first place. But again, if decarbonization of the global economy is the ultimate goal, then I think it\u2019s clear we still need answers to the cost and scalability of nuclear and renewables both large and small.", "At this point Rob Socolow, one of the paper authors, sought to be sure readers caught the main intent of the paper:", "It would be nice to flag what Steve Davis and I have contributed which we think is new.", "We are calling attention to a systematic neglect of capital investment decisions in the reporting rules related to climate change, relative to current emissions.", "We introduce a concept, \u201ccommitted emissions,\u201d and a methodology to quantify the carbon implications of capital investments.", "We show quantitatively that, for the global power sector in any recent year, two quantities are comparable: 1) current emissions that year from all power plants, and 2) \u201ccommitted emissions\u201d from plants that went on line that year \u2013 emissions that can be expected from these plants in the future (when we assume a 40 year lifetime).", "We take the concept of remaining committed emissions developed in Steve\u2019s 2010 paper with Caldeira and Matthews and work out the trajectory of that value for the global power sector each year over the past 60 years (the earlier paper reported the value for only a single recent year). We find that this index has never fallen, is over 300 GtO2 today and was 200 GtCO2 as recently as Year 2000.", "We recommend that \u201ccommitted emissions\u201d be incorporated prominently into energy analysis, scenario making, and climate policy.", "Burt Richter, the physics Nobelist and author of \u201cBeyond Smoke and Mirrors: Climate Change and Energy in the 21st Century,\u201d added this comment:", "Sorry to jump in late, but I have been away. I think of world energy demand as follows:", "Energy = (population) x (per capita income) x (energy/GDP)", "We know population is going up (UN mid-level projection is about 9.5 billion by 2050 and 10.5 by 2100), and the poor want to get rich while the rich don\u2019t want to get poor, so the only way to work on global energy demand is the last term which is really energy efficiency. If you want to worry about emissions, add another term (emission per unit energy) which is where clean energy comes in. I use \u201cclean\u201d rather than \u201crenewables\u201d because renewables is a term designed to exclude nuclear, big hydro, and large scale efficiency efforts. Taken with most projections for growth energy demand will be up by nearly a factor of 4 by 2100.", "What kind of energy is the question? The most recent authoritative numbers for the world that I can find are from the IEA and credit big hydro and combustibles with significant contributions to the total, while wind and solar are quite small. As for Amory\u2019s numbers, Denmark is insignificant of the world scale and is connected to the Scandinavian power grid so has lots of back up. Germany is not so connected and so already is having trouble with the stability of its grid. In discussions with Amory in the past I have always found it useful to ask for references for his numbers.", "As to the world\u2019s poorest countries, they contribute negligibly to emissions and to demand. Let them start up development in any way they can.", "Then came input from Nathan Myhrvold, who is best known for his time in research at Microsoft and as an inventor and investor, but has been an author on some relevant energy papers:", "Burt\u2019s outlook is one that I share.", "If you think of energy usage from a \u201crich world\u201d perspective where there is low growth in demand you can imagine the 21st century challenge to be one where we replace existing fossil fuel energy with clean (in Burt\u2019s sense) energy.", "But the reality is that the currently poor world is getting richer so by 2100 we need way more primary energy. Today\u2019s entire infrastructure will be only ~25% of the picture. The ~4X increase will be in the developing world which will put a huge premium on cost.", "As Burt asks, what will that be?

All of this long-lived infrastructure represents an enormous investment that won\u2019t be easy to walk away from.", "The idea behind the new paper my co-author Rob Socolow and I have written is that it\u2019s possible to estimate future GHG emissions that are locked-in by all the existing fossil infrastructure, what we call \u201ccommitted emissions.\u201d Our paper demonstrates the concept of this commitment accounting by quantifying the CO2 emissions that are expected to come from now-existing power plants.", "Rather than tallying up CO2 emissions from power plants in the year they come out of the plant\u2019s smokestacks, we assume a typical plant lifetime of 40 years and allocate the lifetime emissions of each power plant to the year it was built.", "What we found is that the currently existing power plants around the world\u2014unless they are retired early or retrofitted so that their emissions are captured\u2013can be anticipated to emit roughly 300 billion tons of CO2 in the future.

Worse, most of the energy in our gas tanks is being wasted by the inefficient internal combustion engine.", "Then there are the roads, which consume vast stretches of land to accommodate very few cars.

Autonomous cars would be safer, too, perhaps saving tens of thousands of lives a year if they replace most of the human-driven transportation system.", "It\u2019s when you put electric engines, ride-sharing and self-driving vehicles together that Mr. Heck and Mr. Rogers see the biggest payoff.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a big incentive for a state like California to say, \u2018Our car pool lanes are now sharing, autonomous lanes,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Heck said. \u201cYou could even exempt them from the speed limit.\u201d", "That would create something like an autonomous car-sharing \u201ctrain\u201d in which electric vehicles would platoon down suburban commuter corridors, shipping people off to work, delivering packages or transferring us between high-speed public transportation lines.", "This all sounds plausible.

If men also demanded more flexibility to take care of family (not just babies, but also aging parents), then perhaps employers would be less likely to discriminate against women of childbearing age. Even more, research has shown that in countries where men are more involved at home, women are freed up to achieve more at work.", "Sweden and Germany, for instance, offered specific incentives to push men to take paternity leave. \u201cIt starts to change the norms, to say even if you\u2019re a very serious worker, taking some time off around the birth of your child is kind of a normal thing to do,\u201d Mr. Ruhm said.", "European-style paid leave seems highly unlikely in the United States \u2013 policies that make some American parents gaze across the Atlantic with envy make their employers cringe \u2013 but there is growing support for some sort of paid leave.

Speaking in a conference call with reporters, he said that when he was asked to permanently leave his job at Google, \u201cthere was really not any way I could say no to that.\u201d", "White House officials said Mr. Dickerson would become the deputy chief information officer of the federal government and the administrator of the United States Digital Services Team, a small group of technology experts whose job will be to fix the government\u2019s websites.", "Initially, he will lead a small team that will try to help the information technology teams at various agencies produce better websites that people actually want to use. Steve VanRoekel, the federal chief information officer for electronic government, noted the happy experiences people often have when they spend their mornings on Facebook, Amazon or Expedia. \u201cThey may not have the same experience spending their afternoon on government websites,\u201d he said in the conference call.", "Mr. Dickerson said the goal of his new team was to change that. In addition to announcing his hiring, the White House also released a draft \u201cplaybook\u201d that agency technology officers can use to bolster their websites and computer systems. The playbook is drawn in part from what he did at the Department of Health and Human Services last year.", "Fixing what ails most government sites, Mr. Dickerson said, is not unlike the task that he faced in the winter of 2013 when he arrived in Columbia, Md., the nerve center of HealthCare.gov.", "Inside the building where government workers and contractors were watching the health care site melt down, Mr. Dickerson was shocked: The government had none of the modern tools to track, second by second, visitors to the website. And it had no way to figure out why the site was crashing.", "Mr. Dickerson, who was part of the team that helped keep Google\u2019s servers running smoothly, moved quickly to give his new team the ability to find the bottlenecks. Within days, the office in Maryland had big flat-screen TVs on the walls, each one showing the data flowing across the HealthCare.gov servers.", "\u201cIt\u2019s easy just to order a bunch of machines and install them, and we\u2019re doing all that stuff,\u201d Mr. Dickerson told a reporter at the time. \u201cBut you have to find exactly where is the choke point, and it\u2019s a very compacted system.\u201d", "Mr. Dickerson compared his job to that of a traffic engineer who tries to identify bottlenecks in order to add capacity where it is needed and make things easier for drivers.", "\u201cYou can add lanes to the freeway, but maybe that makes commute times better, and maybe it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said last November. \u201cIf everybody backs up on the on-ramp, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s very much like that, but harder, because you can\u2019t see with your eyes where all the cars are stopped.\u201d", "Officials said Mr. Dickerson\u2019s team would start small, in part because of the need to use money already allocated to the government\u2019s technology budget. There is $3 million in the current budget to use for that purpose, officials said, and $13 million has been requested for next year. The administration hopes to hire as many as 25 people.", "In an interview on Monday, Mr. Dickerson said his team would intervene in situations in which websites needed acute attention and quick triage to make them work effectively. But he also said he would try to anticipate problems that might emerge and make fixes.", "\u201cWe\u2019re also trying to get in front of these things more in the future,\u201d he said, \u201cto make the strike team less necessary in the future.\u201d", "Asked whether he thought the rest of the government\u2019s web technology was as lacking as HealthCare.gov was, Mr. Dickerson dodged the question, saying it was just his first day on the job. But he said he was expecting to apply the same types of approaches across the government. \u201cHow to make progress, I\u2019m more confident about that part,\u201d he said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/28/arts/a-decade-of-letting-the-consumer-have-a-say-online.html": ["Yelp will mark its 10th anniversary next month, but it\u2019s already been a year of celebration for the online review company based in San Francisco. Last month, Yelp announced its first-ever quarterly profit. The site now holds 61 million user reviews and its number of monthly visitors has grown to 138 million, nearly double the number from 2012. Now available in 28 countries, the service continues to expand, adding Chile, Japan, Mexico and Argentina just this year.", "While people can review everything on Yelp from nail salons to federal penitentiaries to the website itself \u2014 users give Yelp two and half out of five stars \u2014 the largest category by far covers restaurants. Recently the website introduced a new tool, Yelp Trends, which can be used to track the rise and fall of food crazes in 98 cities around the world. The tool, similar to Google Trends, graphs the popularity of words in Yelp reviews over time. \u201cBecause we were exploring such a huge set of information, we didn\u2019t know what we would find,\u201d said Eric Singley, the company vice president of consumer and mobile products. \u201cBut it turned out to be really, really interesting.\u201d", "One can see how Paris has fallen hard for burgers, how curry in London consistently outperforms fish and chips, how coffee styles from Spain (cortado) and Australia (flat white) are catching on in New York. \u201cMy favorite is the great donut-cronut-cupcake race,\u201d Mr. Singley added, a reference to the neck-and-neck position of cupcakes and donuts in Los Angeles, and the appearance there, last year, of cronuts, a kind of croissant donut hybrid pastry, which spiked in the fall before trailing off.", "Yelp Trends seems better at putting a food craze in perspective than in revealing a new one. Take what Mr. Singley referred to as the \u201chockey-stick growth\u201d of kale, in New York: despite the best efforts of recipe columnists and farmers market enthusiasts, kale has never approached the seasonal highs of pumpkin, which Yelp users write about incessantly as autumn approaches.", "It\u2019s not only the vagaries of taste and fashion that affect food trends. Foie gras understandably flat-lined in California after the food was banned from the state in 2012."]}

On Wednesday, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s boldest bid yet emerged: an $80 billion takeover offer for Time Warner Inc., which would be the biggest media deal in more than a decade. Time Warner has rebuffed his offer and no talks are underway. But Mr. Murdoch is known for getting what he wants \u2012 even when companies have first said no \u2012 and people briefed on the matter said he is unlikely to walk away anytime soon.", "Mr. Murdoch\u2019s pursuit is likely to set off a wave of takeover battles elsewhere in the industry as others race to keep up with the media mogul. \u201cMr. Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox is seeking to create a colossus in the television and film industries at a time when both face pressure from the growing power of cable companies like Comcast and online video giants like Google,\u201d Mr. Sorkin and Mr. de la Merced write. Combining the two companies would bring under one roof some of the leading sources of content, including HBO and Fox Broadcasting. Notably, the deal would not include CNN, which 21st Century Fox plans to sell in any deal to assuage concerns from antitrust regulators.", "", "SIZE MATTERS | Looming large over all of the big media deals this year \u2012 both Comcast and AT&T are pursuing enormous takeovers \u2012 is the competitive threat from Silicon Valley, with its technology behemoths like Facebook, Google and Amazon. \u201cThe giant market capitalizations and market power residing in Silicon Valley have rippled into the rest of the economy,\u201d David Carr writes in the Media Equation column. \u201cThe people behind this sudden surge of proposed media mergers say they are only going on steroids to avoid getting sand kicked in their face by even bigger bullies in the technology world.\u201d But beyond bigness, Mr. Carr adds, \u201cthere is no compelling logic driving a merger of Time Warner and 21st Century Fox.\u201d", "", "COMBINING HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS | In the bid, Mr. Murdoch is said to have made clear that his 21st Century Fox and Time Warner\u2019s Warner Bros., two of Hollywood\u2019s six major studios, would be managed jointly, but kept essentially separate, Michael Cieply, Brooks Barnes and Bill Carter write in The New York Times. \u201cBut business history and market pressures in both the movie and television industries make it almost inevitable that studio overhead would be cut, back-office operations would be combined, and jobs would be eliminated if a merger happens.\u201d", "", "BEHIND THE BID | While the offer from 21st Century Fox may have been unsolicited and even unwanted, it nevertheless represented a validation of Jeff Bewkes\u2019s stewardship of the company, Jonathan Mahler and Emily Steel write in The New York Times. Since Mr. Bewkes took over as chief executive of Time Warner in 2008, he has carried out an ambitious turnaround strategy, methodically shedding Time Warner\u2019s noncore assets to transform the company from a sprawling media conglomerate into a pure entertainment entity.", "Over the years, Mr. Bewkes has unloaded Time Warner Cable, AOL and, most recently, the publisher Time Inc., whose spinoff was completed last month. Wall Street has cheered his approach, but there are questions about whether it was Mr. Bewkes\u2019s intention all along to make Time Warner an acquisition target. (To allay takeover concerns on Wednesday, Mr. Bewkes sent a short recorded video of himself to his employees, emphasizing that Time Warner had rejected 21st Century Fox\u2019s bid.)", "", "From Bloomberg View | Susan Crawford writes: \u201cIn 2010, Gary Shteyngart\u2019s \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story\u201d amused readers with its futuristic depiction of people traveling via UnitedContinentalDeltamerican and banking with AlliedWasteCVSCitigroupCredit. In Shteyngart\u2019s imagination, only two television channels provided all \u201cMedia\u201d: Fox Liberty-Prime and Fox Liberty-Ultra. The merger of Time Warner Inc. and 21st Century Fox, apparently suggested by Rupert Murdoch last month, shows Shteyngart was only barely ahead of his time.\u201d", "", "BANK OF AMERICA SETTLEMENT TALKS HIT SNAG | After months of negotiations, a possible settlement between Bank of America and the Justice Department is in jeopardy over a disagreement on the bank\u2019s liability for the suspected mortgage misdeeds of its Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch units, Michael Corkery writes in DealBook. On Tuesday, the bank\u2019s lawyers met in Washington with prosecutors from the Justice Department, but the two sides remain far from reaching a deal. Federal prosecutors are said to have left the meeting planning to move ahead with a suit.", "A major sticking point in the talks with the Justice Department is how much the bank should be penalized for mortgage securities sold by Countrywide. The bank has argued that in devising a penalty, prosecutors should take into account that Bank of America tried to back out of its purchase of Merrill, but felt pressured by regulators to go through with the acquisition in the depths of the financial crisis. The two sides are also far apart on money. The Justice Department had been seeking as much as $17 billion, but the bank is offering roughly $12 billion.", "Legal costs also dominated Bank of America\u2019s second-quarter results on Wednesday, when the bank reported profit of $2.3 billion, dragged down 43 percent from the period a year earlier partly by $4 billion in legal expenses.

On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew sent letters to the top members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee, urging Congress to take immediate action through broad corporate tax reform to halt the rush of companies abroad. Absent that, Mr. Lew encouraged congressional leaders to act before more companies made similar moves.", "In his letter, Mr. Lew built on a proposal by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, that would essentially ban inversions, with an effective date of May of this year. Such a proposal would eliminate the tax benefits of any inversion deals that had not been completed by that date, which could potentially affect numerous announced transaction. Even deals announced before May could be affected because they have not yet closed.

Users get a free terabyte of storage, one of the most generous space allotments of any comparable photo and video solution. And Flickr has extensive privacy controls that include who can see and share your photos, who can mark you as being in a photo, who can view your Exif data (which includes the make and model of the camera used to take the photo) and whether or not you want your profile or your photos to be hidden from searches on Flickr and third-party sites. On occasion the site acts wonky (a photo won\u2019t upload or the editing tool doesn\u2019t materialize), but by and large it works well, and creating albums and adding descriptions and tags to photos is intuitive. So is searching your photo library for keywords you attach to them. You can download your images in multiple resolutions, from 150 x 150 pixels square to the original high-resolution photo. There are the usual editing tools that allow you to adjust sharpness and saturation, but also cutesy digital stickers (propeller hat, 3-D glasses) that you can slap onto your nearest and dearest.

How convenient, I might think: Wouldn\u2019t many business owners love to make their old product less useful whenever they released a newer one? When you sell the device and control the operating system, that\u2019s an option.", "This particular conspiracy theory has its adherents. But it is especially eccentric for an economist to entertain because economics argues that this type of strategy may not be as good for the bottom line as it sounds. (Catherine Rampell gave a terrific rundown of the economic arguments around planned-obsolescence and Apple conspiracy theories last October on the Economix blog of The New York Times.)", "Apple would not comment on such theories. But there are two simple reasons that planned obsolescence might not maximize profits. First, the legal risk. Second, competition and consumer rationality should combine to thwart this strategy. All a competitor needs to do is to offer a smartphone that doesn\u2019t become a brick as quickly, and more people should buy it.", "But these are theoretical arguments. And my experience, though constituting a sample size of one, is empirical.", "Generally, my students know enough to ignore my grumbling. But in this instance, Laura Trucco, a Ph.D. student in economics at Harvard, followed a hunch. She wanted to see whether my experience was unique. But how? When people become frustrated with a slow phone, she reasoned, they search Google to figure out what to do about it. So, in theory, data on how often people search for \u201ciPhone slow,\u201d as provided by Google Trends, can measure the frustration globally. (Data for only the United States show similar results.)", "Because this data is available weekly, she was able to cross-reference these searches against release dates of new phones. The charts show the results, which are, to say the least, striking. In the top chart, there are six distinct spikes, and they correspond to releases of new iPhones.", "At a minimum, this shows that my experience is not unique. Yes, phones feel slower over time as they hold more software and as our expectations of speed increase. But the spikes show that the feeling doesn\u2019t grow gradually; it comes on suddenly in the days after a new phone is released.", "Yet that\u2019s all it shows: People suddenly feel that their phone is slowing down. It doesn\u2019t show that our iPhones actually became slower. Imagine that someone points out a buzzing sound in your office. Until then, you hadn\u2019t noticed it. But now you can\u2019t hear anything else. Perhaps this is the digital equivalent of that experience: Hearing about a new release makes you contemplate getting a new and faster phone. And you suddenly notice how slow your old phone is.", "To test if this is the reason, we can use an important difference between Apple and Google Android. In Apple\u2019s case, the company sells the device and makes the operating system. In principle, this creates the motive (to sell more devices) and the means (control over the operating systems) to slow down the old phone.", "Google has the means (it controls the Android operating system), but not the motive because it doesn\u2019t make money directly from selling new hardware. Conversely, Samsung or other sellers of Android phones have the motive but not the means.", "If the perception that your phone is slower is attributable to the psychological effect of hearing about a new release, it should be there for both Android and Apple phones. A new phone of either kind should make you focus on your existing one. The conspiracy theory, however, should apply only to one platform.", "The second chart shows searches for \u201cSamsung Galaxy slow.\u201d In this chart, there are no noticeable spikes or anything correlated to the release of new Galaxy phones. Try other types of Android phones, and, similarly, there are no new spikes. This is suggestive, though it\u2019s important to note that new releases of Apple products inevitably draw much more media attention than those of other phones.", "Still, if attention on new devices is what makes old ones feel slow, why are the spikes on Apple product release dates, and not when the company announces the new products? In 2008, for example, the iPhone3G was announced a full month before its release. There was a spike at the release, but not at the announcement.", "This data has an even more benign explanation. Every major iPhone release coincides with a major new operating system release. Though Apple would not comment on the matter, one could speculate \u2014 and many have \u2014 that a new operating system, optimized for new phones, would slow down older phones. This could also explain the Samsung-iPhone difference: Because only 18 percent of Android users have the latest operating systems on their phones, whereas 90 percent of iPhone users do, any slowdown from a new operating system would be naturally bigger for iPhones.", "The important distinction is of intent. In the benign explanation, a slowdown of old phones is not a specific goal, but merely a side effect of optimizing the operating system for newer hardware. Data on search frequency would not allow us to infer intent. No matter how suggestive, this data alone doesn\u2019t allow you to determine conclusively whether my phone is actually slower and, if so, why.", "In this way, the whole exercise perfectly encapsulates the advantages and limitations of \u201cbig data.\u201d First, 20 years ago, determining whether many people experienced a slowdown would have required an expensive survey to sample just a few hundred consumers. Now, data from Google Trends, if used correctly, allows us to see what hundreds of millions of users are searching for, and, in theory, what they are feeling or thinking. Twitter, Instagram and Facebook all create what is evocatively called the \u201cdigital exhaust,\u201d allowing us to uncover macro patterns like this one.", "Second, these new kinds of data create an intimacy between the individual and the collective. Even for our most idiosyncratic feelings, such data can help us see that we aren\u2019t alone. In minutes, I could see that many shared my frustration. Even if you\u2019ve never gathered the data yourself, you\u2019ve probably sensed something similar when Google\u2019s autocomplete feature automatically suggests the next few words you are going to type: \u201cOh, lots of people want to know that, too?\u201d", "Finally, we see a big limitation: This data reveals only correlations, not conclusions. We are left with at least two different interpretations of the sudden spike in \u201ciPhone slow\u201d queries, one conspiratorial and one benign. It is tempting to say, \u201cSee, this is why big data is useless.\u201d But that is too trite. Correlations are what motivate us to look further. If all that big data does \u2014 and it surely does more \u2014 is to point out interesting correlations whose fundamental reasons we unpack in other ways, that already has immense value.", "And if those correlations allow conspiracy theorists to become that much more smug, that\u2019s a small price to pay."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/twitter-like-other-big-tech-companies-comes-up-short-on-diversity/": ["The technology industry continues to provide evidence that it is not terribly diverse.", "Twitter released a statistical breakdown of the genders and ethnic backgrounds of employees on Wednesday afternoon.

After Carpenter burst onto the West Coast literary scene in 1966, with his gritty first novel, \u201cHard Rain Falling\u201d (reissued in 2009 by New York Review Books), he became an unofficial adviser to fellow Bay Area writers trying to ride Jack Kerouac\u2019s coattails. Never a hippie celebrity like Richard Brautigan or a living legend like Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Carpenter was a straight man to the more illustrious neo-Beat and -Dada artists of the era.

After graduating from Portland State College and earning a master\u2019s degree in creative writing from San Francisco State, he struggled to become a bankable writer, turning out some dozen books and a number of screenplays.

And since his suicide in 1995, Carpenter\u2019s stock has only risen; he\u2019s just a Blake Bailey biography away from being enshrined in the New Canon.", "Now at last, with the publication of \u201cFridays at Enrico\u2019s\u201d \u2014 a manuscript rescued and ably finished by the novelist Jonathan Lethem \u2014 Carpenter hits the bull\u2019s-eye.

The gang included Evan S. Connell Jr., Curt Gentry (who wrote \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d with Vincent Bugliosi) and Brautigan. Although there is enough kidney-killing craziness in \u201cFridays at Enrico\u2019s\u201d to impress Charles Bukowski, this sober-minded novel is ultimately more concerned with the existential struggle of writers desperate to get published, earn some cash and seize fame.

Despite their supreme dysfunction \u2014 adultery, lousy parenting, inebriated logic, back-stabbing \u2014 they all have a bent appeal.", "Many real-life figures also turn up, lending the novel an air of authenticity. There is, in fact, enough Beat name-dropping to make even Ann Charters and Joyce Johnson blush. \u201cIn 20 minutes or so she mentioned Jack Kerouac, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, William Burroughs and Gregory Corso,\u201d Carpenter writes wryly of one character. \u201cApparently she knew them all, was one of the supporting figures of the Beat movement, which she discussed eagerly and incessantly, while Dick bought her round after round of beer.\u201d", "Along with Enrico\u2019s itself, Carpenter pays homage to other bistros, greasy spoons, night schools and coffeehouses like those in Beat lore.

On another historical level, Carpenter illuminates how the second-wave Beats were the last fireworks before Fortune 500 corporations took over the Bay Area and Google replaced Kerouac as God. In the 21st century, Carpenter\u2019s world of clacking typewriters, carbon copies and thoughtful rejection slips has gone the way of the dodo. The City Lights bookstore now uses theft-prevention devices, while Silicon Valley has replaced Haight-Ashbury as the happening place.", "According to William Hjortsberg\u2019s exhaustive 2012 biography of Brautigan, \u201cJubilee Hitchhiker,\u201d Carpenter was devastated by his friend\u2019s 1984 suicide (a .44 Magnum to the mouth).

It is a worrisome development for Google that could spin out an investigation into its search engine and advertising business for many years to come in Europe, where attitudes to American technology giants have hardened as concerns about their market power and use of private information have mushroomed.", "\u201cThe political demands in Europe for scalps from Google is enormous, including in the area of antitrust enforcement,\u201d said Nicolas Petit, a law professor at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium.", "Mr. Almunia is expected to make a final decision on the Google case in September. He could still complete the provisional deal he announced in February and ignore the flurry of new complaints that have landed on his desk in recent months. But a more aggressive decision by Mr. Almunia, derailing that proposed settlement, would be far from a complete surprise.", "Without a settlement, Google could be fined up to 10 percent of its nearly $6 billion in annual global sales. Fines have never gone that high, but such penalties look set to rise.", "Asked about opposition to the settlement, including from consumer groups and even Mr. Almunia\u2019s colleagues, Google pointed to a comment by a senior executive welcoming the provisional deal. The company had \u201coffered to make significant changes to the way Google operates in Europe,\u201d Kent Walker, Google\u2019s general counsel, said in February after the settlement announcement.", "For months, rivals of Google \u2014 including longstanding complainants like Microsoft \u2014 and those not associated with Microsoft\u2019s campaign, like Yelp, an American company that lets people find and review local services like restaurants, plumbers or pharmacies \u2014 have complained that the current deal will do very little to make the online search market more competitive.", "Publishing companies like Lagard\u00e8re Active in France and Axel Springer in Germany also have weighed in against the proposed settlement. The case has even become an issue in how to decide the makeup of the next European Commission, the bureaucracy that enforces Europe\u2019s antitrust policy.", "Looming over Mr. Almunia are hearings that his successor will face at the European Parliament. Many lawmakers want tougher action against Google rather than a five-year deal that would forestall scrutiny of important areas of Google\u2019s business until the end of the decade. That could add to pressure on Mr. Almunia to abandon the settlement and allow his successor to make a decision.", "Ramon Tremosa i Balcells, a member of the Parliament from Catalonia who sits on the Parliament\u2019s powerful economics and monetary affairs committee, said his message to Mr. Almunia\u2019s successor on the case was: \u201cYou cannot close this for some years.\u201d", "The \u201cfast evolution\u201d in search, particularly in mobile search, obliged Mr. Almunia\u2019s successor \u201cto get answers now to the worries that European enterprises and Yelp from the United States are also raising in this case,\u201d he said.", "An important factor pushing Mr. Almunia to consider reversing course involves perceived shortcomings of a proposed settlement that, at its heart, was intended to give rivals more prominence on the search page. Google has already gone much further with its concessions in Europe than in a similar case where the Federal Trade Commission in the United States decided early last year that the company had not broken antitrust laws.", "But according to a summary of a study testing the deal that Yelp showed a variety of European Commission officials beginning in March, and that was made available this week by a person who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because the information still was not public, the so-called display remedy would do very little to address a crucial problem identified by Mr. Almunia during his investigation: Google\u2019s ability to give its services preferential treatment.", "Yelp said it first responded to investigative inquiries from the European Commission in early 2011, making the company a longstanding participant in the proceedings. In the examples from Yelp\u2019s evidence shared with the commission this year, the current deal would still steer about half of users\u2019 clicks to areas of a search page managed by Google Plus Local, a direct Yelp competitor, while less than 2 percent of clicks would go to the system proposed by Mr. Almunia, according to the Yelp study.", "And according to Yelp\u2019s formal complaint, filed May 27, consumers would still be highly unlikely to get better information on what they are looking for as a result of the settlement.", "Google was making \u201cit more difficult to find and access information located on competitive properties like Yelp even when those properties feature information that is more relevant to consumers than Google\u2019s own,\u201d the complaint said.", "To solve the issue, Yelp called on the regulators to pressure Google to use the results from Yelp or others like TripAdvisor to power Google\u2019s specialized search products, like Google Plus Local, when those results do a better job of helping users pinpoint local services on maps and listings.", "In its private meetings with the commission during the spring, Yelp showed that a search powered by Google\u2019s own organic product, rather than Google Plus Local, determined that TripAdvisor would return options for seven hotels with 3,192 user reviews for the query \u201chotels Bilbao Spain.\u201d", "By comparison, Google Plus Local would return seven hotels but with just 113 reviews."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/consumers-appear-uncertain-about-connected-cars/": ["LONDON \u2013 Many of the world\u2019s largest tech companies are pursuing the automotive sector as new area for growth.", "Yet while the likes of Apple and Google have introduced operating systems specifically for cars, many people don\u2019t appear to be interested in downloading applications and keeping up to speed with social networks while they drive, according to a research by the Spanish telecom giant Telef\u00f3nica of people in the United States, Britain, Germany, Spain and Brazil.", "Instead, the company said, people are most interested in emergency alert systems and notices about maintenance for their cars.

Google, for example, offers a tool to help its users deal with the problem.

But on visits home, they would meet in a pub. And the talk often turned to food.", "\u201cAt university,\u201d Mr. Spafford said, \u201cwe were all eating complete rubbish. With one exception: Ben.\u201d", "So Mr. Ebbrell, who at the time was studying culinary arts management at University College Birmingham, started sharing cheap and easy recipes with his friends using the backs of beer coasters.", "Those recipes grew into a self-published cookbook, and, in May 2010, the four started the Sorted Food YouTube channel. \u201cIt became an obvious way of sharing the recipes with more of our friends because it\u2019s a platform we kind of naturally had in our pockets anyway,\u201d Mr. Ebbrell said.", "Then the videos started gaining traction beyond their circle of friends. \u201cIt began by \u2018Wow, we\u2019ve got a hundred views,'\u200a\u200a\u201d Mr. Ebbrell recalled. \u201cBut we\u2019ve only got 40 friends on Facebook, so who are these other 60 people?\u201d", "That following quickly grew.", "\u201cMy dream as a child was to be a chef, to create my own recipes and cook in a restaurant for 50 to 60 people a day,\u201d Mr. Ebbrell said. \u201cWhat we are doing now is exactly the same, but it\u2019s not just 50 or 60 people, it\u2019s hundreds of thousands from all around the world.\u201d", "And those users often play an active role. With the video for chocolate cake in a mug, for example, many comments raised questions about the instant coffee powder listed as one of the ingredients.", "\u201cI don\u2019t like coffee. So can I just leave out?\u201d asked one user, Lauren Burnett. Sorted Food responded, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine without it.\u201d", "But others offered their own suggestions. A user named Vic Chaotic said he had replaced the coffee with a tablespoon of Nutella, and the cake \u201cwas absolutely decadent.\u201d Another, BeaSan95, had a different suggestion: \u201cI also added some rum instead of the coffee, so good!\u201d", "Sorted Food is part of the YouTube Partners program, in which operators of the channels share advertising revenue with Google. The program features more than a million creators from over 30 countries.", "In addition to ad revenue, Sorted Food relies on partnerships with companies like Tesco, the British supermarket chain, which recently sponsored a Sorted Food trip to Ireland to explore the production of chocolate. Another partner, Kenwood, the appliance maker, supplies the group with equipment in exchange for product placement in the videos.", "So what next for Sorted Food? A cooking show on television?", "Mr. Spafford and Mr. Ebbrell say that is unlikely.", "\u201cWe are yet to find a way that TV would work for us,\u201d Mr. Spafford said. \u201cWith YouTube we have complete control of what we put out, when we put it out and what we edit. It\u2019s also much more interactive.\u201d", "Mr. Ebbrell recalls approaching television companies a few years ago to pitch ideas. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t convinced by YouTube,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has come full circle now. We are now being approached by TV companies, but we are not prepared to give up what we do for TV.\u201d", "Instead, the partners are seeking growth opportunities through their Sorted Food iPhone and iPad apps, which they introduced this month. Meant to mimic social networks like Facebook, the app lets users create profiles, upload recipes, repost cooking videos and follow other users.", "Since its July 1 debut, the app has been downloaded more than 35,000 times, according to Sorted Food, and was featured as \u201cBest New App\u201d on Apple\u2019s App Store in 16 countries. A redesigned Sorted Food website, offering those same functions, is to be introduced in the coming weeks.", "\u201cThis is a great opportunity to create a global cooking community,\u201d Mr. Spafford said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the personal food journey that you can share with others.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/24/opinion/nicholas-kristof-idiots-guide-to-inequality-piketty-capital.html": ["We may now have a new \u201cmost unread best seller of all time.\u201d", "Data from Amazon Kindles suggests that that honor may go to Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d which reached No. 1 on the best-seller list this year. Jordan Ellenberg, a professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Piketty\u2019s book seems to eclipse its rivals in losing readers: All five of the passages that readers on Kindle have highlighted most are in the first 26 pages of a tome that runs 685 pages.", "The rush to purchase Piketty\u2019s book suggested that Americans must have wanted to understand inequality. The apparent rush to put it down suggests that, well, we\u2019re human.", "So let me satisfy this demand with my own \u201cIdiot\u2019s Guide to Inequality.\u201d Here are five points:", "First, economic inequality has worsened significantly in the United States and some other countries. The richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. Oxfam estimates that the richest 85 people in the world own as much wealth as the bottom half of humanity.", "The situation might be tolerable if a rising tide were lifting all boats. But it\u2019s lifting mostly the yachts. In 2010, 93 percent of the additional income created in America went to the top 1 percent.", "Second, inequality in America is destabilizing. Some inequality is essential to create incentives, but we seem to have reached the point where inequality actually becomes an impediment to economic growth.", "Certainly, the nation grew more quickly in periods when we were more equal, including in the golden decades after World War II when growth was strong and inequality actually diminished. Likewise, a major research paper from the International Monetary Fund in April found that more equitable societies tend to enjoy more rapid economic growth.", "Indeed, even Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, warns that \u201ctoo much ... has gone to too few\u201d and that inequality in America is now \u201cvery destabilizing.\u201d", "Inequality causes problems by creating fissures in societies, leaving those at the bottom feeling marginalized or disenfranchised. That has been a classic problem in \u201cbanana republic\u201d countries in Latin America, and the United States now has a Gini coefficient (a standard measure of inequality) approaching some traditionally poor and dysfunctional Latin countries.", "Third, disparities reflect not just the invisible hand of the market but also manipulation of markets. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, wrote a terrific book two years ago, \u201cThe Price of Inequality,\u201d which is a shorter and easier read than Piketty\u2019s book. In it, he notes: \u201cMuch of America\u2019s inequality is the result of market distortions, with incentives directed not at creating new wealth but at taking it from others.\u201d", "For example, financiers are wealthy partly because they\u2019re highly educated and hardworking \u2014 and also because they\u2019ve successfully lobbied for the carried interest tax loophole that lets their pay be taxed at much lower rates than other people\u2019s.", "Likewise, if you\u2019re a pharmaceutical executive, one way to create profits is to generate new products. Another is to lobby Congress to bar the government\u2019s Medicare program from bargaining for drug prices. That amounts to a $50 billion annual gift to pharmaceutical companies.", "Fourth, inequality doesn\u2019t necessarily even benefit the rich as much as we think. At some point, extra incomes don\u2019t go to sate desires but to attempt to buy status through \u201cpositional goods\u201d \u2014 like the hottest car on the block.", "The problem is that there can only be one hottest car on the block. So the lawyer who buys a Porsche is foiled by the C.E.O. who buys a Ferrari, who in turn is foiled by the hedge fund manager who buys a Lamborghini. This arms race leaves these desires unsated; there\u2019s still only one at the top of the heap.", "Fifth, progressives probably talk too much about \u201cinequality\u201d and not enough about \u201copportunity.\u201d Some voters are turned off by tirades about inequality because they say it connotes envy of the rich; there is more consensus on bringing everyone to the same starting line.", "Unfortunately, equal opportunity is now a mirage. Indeed, researchers find that there is less economic mobility in America than in class-conscious Europe.", "We know some of the tools, including job incentives and better schools, that can reduce this opportunity gap. But the United States is one of the few advanced countries that spends less educating the average poor child than the average rich one. As an escalator of mobility, the American education system is broken.", "There\u2019s still a great deal we don\u2019t understand about inequality.

The official statements were fairly anodyne \u2014 Presidents Xi and Park agreed on the \u201cneed of six-party talks,\u201d as opposed to laying out concrete steps for how to get those talks restarted. Xi affirmed Park\u2019s commitment to improving inter-Korean relations, but did not call on Kim Jong-un to do more. Xi repeated China\u2019s standard goal of seeking denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, still not even daring to call it \u201cNorth Korean denuclearization.\u201d Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who accompanied Xi, has on numerous occasions over the past year issued a thinly veiled warning to Pyongyang that Beijing will not tolerate anyone \u201ccausing chaos on our doorstep,\u201d but the visit to Seoul was noticeably absent of any such language.\n\nThe symbolism of Xi alighting in Seoul and addressing his \u201cold friend\u201d Park was probably enough in and of itself to send a message to Kim. Perhaps a traditional idiom Xi used, that sometimes \u201ca good neighbor is better than a distant cousin\u201d, was an oblique reference to the fact that he is happier so far with his neighbors in the South than his communist cousins in the North. But still, we saw no evidence of Xi and Park developing a joint action plan for dealing with Pyongyang. One senses that North Korean denuclearization was covered relatively swiftly in their discussions, and was not the focal point of the summit.", "There was, at least, one ironic twist to the North Korean denuclearization issue, which was the opportunity to hear China criticizing someone else for being too soft on sanctions enforcement. Responding to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s fresh announcement that Japan would start selectively lifting sanctions in return for North Korea reopening the investigation into the fate of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s, Xi and Park warned against \u201cmishandling\u201d sanctions.", "Do you think it is likely that Mr. Xi will make some gesture to North Korea in the coming period in order not to have Kim Jong-un too angry, and to make it appear that he is way out on a limb with South Korea?", "Just prior to President Park\u2019s initial state visit to Beijing last June, Xi received a high-level envoy from Kim Jong-un. This time around, although a relatively senior D.P.R.K. official did recently visit Beijing, the two sides made no public effort to dampen the symbolic blow of Xi\u2019s visit to Seoul with an exchange of emissaries in advance. In the wake of Xi\u2019s trip, however, China-North Korea relations are likely to lumber along, rather than go into some kind of free fall.", "The key factor could be that Kim Jong-un has not been ready to visit Beijing \u2014 security concerns alone might prevent him from leaving the country. But more than that, the symbolism of running off to pay obeisance to Xi in Beijing would not play well domestically in North Korea, where there is resentment and anxiety over China\u2019s preponderant economic and diplomatic influence.", "Kim\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, did not visit China until six years after taking power after the death of his own father in 1994. It could well take Kim as long to make his maiden voyage.", "The history questions with Japan played quite a role in the summit meeting. Does South Korea feel that the United States ignores these questions, and allows Japan to \u201cget away\u201d with bad behavior? Should the United States do more diplomatically to lessen the tensions between its main but estranged Asian allies?", "History is the third rail of northeast Asian politics, and from a South Korean perspective the problem is only getting worse with time. Ironically, President Park\u2019s father and Prime Minister Abe\u2019s grandfather were the key players in normalizing relations between their countries in 1965. It was highly controversial at the time and remains so to this day. When Park and Abe captured high office, there was reason to hope they could complete the work of their ancestors and achieve a second normalization. But instead, Abe is almost universally condemned in Korea for undermining the delicate post-war reconciliation, and Park refuses to hold a bilateral summit with him.", "Naturally Seoul hopes Washington can intervene more forcefully to rein Abe in. However, Japan remains the Pentagon\u2019s \u201caircraft carrier\u201d in East Asia, and plays a central role in the United States\u2019 effort to remain the dominant Pacific power. South Korea is part of that carrier group, to be sure, but not the flagship. So there is a sense here that security trumps history. American officials hold their noses when Abe takes a revisionist stance like visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, but don\u2019t appear to put up much of a fight. On his recent visit to the region, for example, President Obama spoke eloquently about the need for Japan to honestly confront the legacy of wartime sexual slavery, but he gave these remarks in Seoul, rather than doing so while in Tokyo where they could have had real impact.", "South Korea\u2019s doubts that Japan\u2019s leadership has fully renounced and repented for their decades of colonial rule in Korea is the fundamental constraint on closer trilateral security cooperation between the U.S. and its two key allies in East Asia. If the U.S. genuinely desires enhanced trilateral security cooperation, then it will have to take a more proactive role on the root issues of mistrust and misunderstanding that bedevil the South Korea-Japan relationship.", "The blossoming ties between China and South Korea\u2019s leaders underline this central role that historical understanding is playing in the region. Xi and Park have jointly unveiled new historical monuments to celebrate Korean patriots who fought against Japan in China, and on this visit to Seoul Xi suggested joint commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II next year \u2014 or as Chinese and Koreans know it, the War of Anti-Japanese Resistance. If the United States were playing a more forceful role in challenging Abe on history, would the South Koreans be bonding so much with China on the issue?", "President Xi made a very strong speech to students at Seoul National University, stressing the commonality between South Korea and China, and of course using the anti-Japanese theme as a common bond. Do you think Mr. Xi succeeded in presenting China in a new way so that 10 years from now those students, who will be the young leaders of South Korea, will think less of the U.S., and more of China?", "The central theme of Xi\u2019s speech at Seoul National University was Sino-Korean friendship, rooted in thousands of years of a connected cultural heritage, and now being reclaimed despite the political differences of communist China and democratic South Korea. He invoked a common historical enemy \u2014 Japanese imperialism \u2014 not only in its early 20th century guise, but also by referencing the large-scale Japanese invasion of Korea in the 1590s, when China\u2019s ruling Ming dynasty sent troops to come to Korea\u2019s defense. Xi\u2019s many classical allusions combined with patriotic language should resonate among younger Koreans, who are drawn to traditional culture while thoroughly modern when it comes to things like nationalism", "Xi also worked hard in his speech to emphasize China\u2019s benign intentions on the Korean Peninsula and globally. If he tried to give such an address in Hanoi or Manila the audience might jeer him off stage, but in Seoul, Xi\u2019s polished image of a peaceful, cooperative, even humble China \u2014 a friendly neighbor critical to Korea\u2019s economic and security future \u2014 works. \u201cChina wants to be South Korea\u2019s friend,\u201d Xi promised.", "Younger South Koreans \u2014 most of my students at Yonsei University, for example \u2014 will not uncritically accept Xi\u2019s rhetoric about friendship with China, but neither will they dismiss it out of hand. Xi and his wife project a genuine fondness for things Korean, as well as for Madame Park. The \u201cKorean wave\u201d is still going strong among the Chinese public \u2014 when Xi\u2019s wife said her husband as a young man resembled heartthrob Kim Soo-hyun from the hit television drama, \u201cMy Love From the Stars,\u201d the allusion should play well both in Korea and back home. If Xi can sustain this charm offensive for the decade he is likely to be in charge, Park\u2019s comment that Xi\u2019s visit marked a historic turning point in China-South Korea relations may prove correct after all."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/business/media/in-modern-media-realm-big-mergers-are-a-bulwark-against-rivals.html": ["When the news broke on Wednesday that 21st Century Fox, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s huge media and entertainment company, made an $80 billion offer to buy Time Warner Inc., another big media conglomerate, it seemed like a seismic jolt in the business landscape.

You could take a picture of two people, one in the foreground and one in the background, and later switch the focus between the two subjects as if you were directing an art house horror movie.", "Mr. Ng\u2019s idea, digital light-field photography, became an instant sensation in Silicon Valley, attracting tens of millions of dollars from some of the industry\u2019s leading investment firms. In 2012, Mr. Ng\u2019s firm, Lytro, introduced its first light-field camera to positive reviews. When the $399 camera went on sale online, many customers bought it sight unseen.", "Then the company\u2019s fortunes began to fizzle. Lytro\u2019s first camera suffered several drawbacks that made it unsuited to everyday use. Its display was tiny, its software was dodgy, and many users found it difficult to compose shots that made full use of its focus-shifting capabilities. Lytro was also blindsided by the significant improvement in smartphone cameras and the rise of social photography apps like Instagram, which have together decimated the market for small point-and-shoot cameras. Indeed, some of today\u2019s high-end phones \u2014 like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S5 \u2014 can mimic Lytro\u2019s refocusing trick.", "This week, Lytro will begin shipping a new camera, the Illum, a big, $1,499 model aimed at serious photographers. I\u2019ve been using the Illum for a few days, and I found that like Lytro\u2019s first camera, the new one is a marvel of imaging technology that is also hampered by some quirks.", "The Illum is a nice device for people interested in carefully composing creative shots that would benefit from the camera\u2019s ability to shift focus or perspective. While it is possible to take some incredible shots with the Illum, the camera takes some getting used to, and it is not for everyone \u2014 probably not even for most professional photographers.", "Yet despite its narrow audience, the Illum is still an interesting device because the technology inside it could well have far-reaching implications for photography. If the device sells well and paves the way for Lytro\u2019s long-term prosperity, the company\u2019s light-field technology could change the way we make movies, improve medical imaging devices, and radically reduce the price of most professional cameras and lenses.", "But all that is a big if. Along with Nest (which was acquired by Google this year), Jawbone, Oculus (now owned by Facebook), Sonos and Pebble, Lytro is part of a resurgence in start-ups whose primary aim is to manufacture physical products.

That\u2019s because hardware is just hard.\u201d", "You can divide the tech industry into two main denominations: companies that make code and companies that make devices. For much of the last three decades, software \u2014 making code \u2014 has been the more attractive part of the industry because software has magical business properties. A company can write code once and make copies for almost no additional cost, which translates into huge profits and novel business models (like advertising or subscriptions). Because software can be updated from afar, it is also more forgiving than hardware; if you make a mistake in your app, you can just send out an update.", "Software can also create businesses driven by so-called network effects. The more people that use your software, the more useful it becomes for other users, which leads to incredible growth \u2014 look at Microsoft\u2019s Windows, Google\u2019s search engine, Facebook and the Android operating system, each of which has more than a billion users.", "But in the late 1990s, around the time Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the calculus began to shift. The rise of the Asian manufacturing industry allowed American hardware start-ups to reduce manufacturing costs through outsourcing. Mr. Jobs also showed that when a company designed all of the components in a device, it could create radically innovative products for which customers would pay a huge premium.", "You could argue that Apple is an exception in the hardware business. Most other device companies don\u2019t make much of a profit, and even those that do, like Samsung, constantly struggle to maintain their margins.

The fast processor enables one of the camera\u2019s best features, a system that shows you, in real time, which region of your photo can be refocused. On Lytro\u2019s old camera, you just had to wing it.", "Yet the Illum also demonstrates the perilous economics of the hardware business. Planning for the Illum began years ago. If the camera is a dud with users, or afflicted by a bad bug like what has happened with certain Nest and Jawbone products, Lytro\u2019s future could be cloudy. \u201cIt makes for a white-knuckled experience,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said.", "Still, Lytro says the Illum isn\u2019t the final embodiment of its technology, but rather one more step along the path toward demonstrating the possibilities of its new kind of photography.", "In a traditional digital camera, a sensor collects just two data points about the light that hits it: its color and its brightness. A light-field camera can capture much more data, including information about the direction in which rays of light are traveling through a scene.", "This directional data allows a light-field camera to improve performance and cut costs compared with other cameras. For instance, the Illum includes a lens with an extremely wide zoom range \u2014 it can shoot from a focal length of 30 millimeters to 250 millimeters \u2014 but its maximum aperture remains constant (at f/2.0) over that range.", "On a traditional camera, it is just about impossible to find a single lens with such a wide range and a constant aperture. The ones that comes closest, like Canon\u2019s f/2.8 lens with a 70-200mm zoom range, have smaller ranges and smaller apertures, and they are much more expensive. The Canon lens sells for $2,499.", "According to Mr. Horowitz, Lytro\u2019s presales of the Illum have already been brisk.", "\u201cBased on what they\u2019ve sold already, it\u2019s likely to put us close to break-even for the year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in general, there\u2019s always this problem with a hardware company. If you build a product that doesn\u2019t sell, it\u2019s a big problem.

My husband looks from the screen to me, and I can see in his eyes that he finally understands what I have instinctively known for years \u2014 that all of our ambitions, world travels and spiritual practices never brought us this close to the mystery.", "My longing for a baby didn\u2019t kick in until my husband and I married when I was 36. My faith in him combined with the stability of marriage helped me overcome my twin fears of motherhood \u2014 suffocation and failure. I knew he\u2019d never much wanted kids, but I stubbornly kept hoping he\u2019d come around, like so many other men I\u2019d heard and read of who started out ambivalent and ended up utterly in love with their children.", "He didn\u2019t come around. Instead of a sonogram there was a vasectomy, then an open marriage, and finally a divorce.", "The grief of the empty womb is electric with fury, a live wire that could spark anytime. At the grocery store, at the post office, upon the first glimpse of a pregnant belly or stroller, a voice in my head roared, \u201cWhy am I being wasted?\u201d Like an evil queen in a fable it scanned the offending woman and spat: \u201cHer? Her and not me?\u201d How had she convinced a man to work long hours and do without luxuries in return for the mundane, mammalian joys of wife and child?", "I wanted to strangle and claw things. I\u2019d run out to my car, roll up the windows and drive around the block screaming. That way, no one would hear and become alarmed. No one would know that my maternal instinct was neither gentle nor generous. It was fierce, irrational, entitled, and the fact that no helpless infant was coming to save me from my narcissism only magnified the rage. It took less than a minute to scream myself hoarse. Then I\u2019d park the car, walk quietly into my postdivorce apartment and collapse in tears.", "The upside of allowing yourself to grieve like a 2-year-old instead of writing in a journal or forming complex sentences with a therapist is that the grief tends to disperse more quickly. Within a year or two I was able to react to pregnant mothers and their offspring like a normal person again \u2014 with smiles and coos. I took my vestigial longing over to the local children\u2019s hospital and volunteered to play games with the sick kids. Watching the sorrow and barely disguised terror on their parents\u2019 faces softened my envy for good.", "Then, last year, my heart started acting strangely. Each evening after dinner as I sat down to read or watch a movie, it would flutter fast and hard up into my throat like a hiccup, making me cough. This happened five or six times an hour until I fell asleep. My doctor said it might be a mitral valve prolapse. She ran an EKG on which the technician noted \u201cBorderline left atrial enlargement\u201d and made a cardiologist appointment for me. I didn\u2019t want to Google that and try to decode what it meant. I forced myself to wait for the echocardiogram.", "In the waiting room, a half-dozen septuagenarians, mostly men, some attached to portable oxygen tanks, read magazines while their wives filled out paperwork. A technician called my name and led me into a room marked \u201cEcho,\u201d where a cushioned table stood next to the same kind of machine I\u2019d seen in the movies.", "\u201cThat looks like a sonogram machine,\u201d I said.", "\u201cIt is,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cAn echocardiogram is just a sonogram of your heart.\u201d", "I climbed onto the table and lay on my left side. She affixed several electrodes to my chest, dimmed the lights, smeared a little gel onto my skin, and rolled the hand-held transducer alongside and underneath my left breast, instructing me when to inhale and when to hold my breath.", "\u201cHold, hold, just a little longer,\u201d she urged as she zeroed in on a spot and hit a button to save the image. \u201cBeautiful shot.\u201d That\u2019s what you want to hear when someone is photographing your heart: beautiful shot.", "\u201cYou must be a swimmer,\u201d she said, eyes still on the screen. \u201cYou can hold your breath a long time.\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d I said.

Like water rushing over a falls in gusts.", "My eyes widened. \u201cWhy is it so fast?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cThose are your valves,\u201d she said. \u201cThey open and close several times with each heartbeat.\u201d", "\u201cAnd that liquid sound is the blood?\u201d", "\u201cYes, blood filling and leaving each ventricle.\u201d", "She saw the tears gathering.", "\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d she said, putting her free hand on my arm, \u201cI\u2019ve been photographing the human heart for 20 years. It\u2019s made a believer out of me.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean\u2026 what starts it?

Mr. Carey\u2019s boss \u2014 Rupert Murdoch \u2014 is not known for backing off once he has set his sights on his prey; his purchase of Dow Jones also began with a spurned offer. What is more, now that Fox has made its interest in Time Warner known, other suitors may surface.", "While the offer from Fox may have been unsolicited and even unwanted, it represented a validation of Mr. Bewkes\u2019s stewardship of the company. Since taking over a struggling Time Warner at the start of 2008, he has carried out an ambitious turnaround strategy, methodically shedding Time Warner\u2019s noncore assets to transform the company from a sprawling media conglomerate into a pure entertainment entity.", "Gone are the cable business, the Internet business and the magazine business.

The idea was to use the cash from spinning off the various divisions to buy back stock and ultimately drive up Time Warner\u2019s market value.", "Internally, some executives agreed with the strategy. Others were wary of dismantling the company that had come to define the age of media behemoths.", "Questions loom over whether it was Mr. Bewkes\u2019s intention all along to make the company an acquisition target.", "\u201cIn this day and age, when you make yourself bite-sized, you\u2019re looking for a sale,\u201d said a former colleague of Mr. Bewkes, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

At that point, too, the field of possible bidders might have widened to include wealthy technology companies like Apple or Google, which are looking at investing more heavily in content.

And yet, for all these public strides, insiders say the culture has yet to fully transcend its frat-boy programmer reputation.

The group holds happy hours in 14 cities that regularly draw hundreds of women for socializing and networking. One such happy hour, held in March at Slate Bar in the Mission District, was a shared event with a relatively new meet-up group called Gays Who Tech.

Back then, it was the question of being a hawk or dove on Vietnam. Now it is not a war but an Internet retailer and its unparalleled grip on the cultural machinery that is provoking fierce controversy.", "At first, those in the publishing business considered Amazon a cute toy (you could see a book\u2019s exact sales ranking!) and a useful counterweight to Barnes & Noble and Borders, chains willing to throw their weight around. Now Borders is dead, Barnes & Noble is weak and Amazon owns the publishing platform of the digital era. The company founded and still run by Jeff Bezos dragged the publishers into modern times, forced them to digitize and urged on the Justice Department in its 2012 antitrust suit against the publishers and Apple. The conflict is unrelenting.", "The latest struggle between publishers and Amazon burst into public view two months ago, after the company began seeking concessions on book sales from Hachette, the fourth-largest publisher, which Hachette was unwilling to give. Amazon sought to get its way by delaying delivery of Hachette books, which roused Hachette\u2019s authors. At this point, Hachette is losing sales and Amazon is reaping a considerable amount of bad publicity.", "All of this angst and arguing is pushing forward a question: Is the resistance to Amazon a last-ditch bid to keep the future of American literary culture out of the hands of a rapacious corporation that calls books \u201cdemand-weighted units,\u201d or an effort by a bunch of dead-enders and snobs to forestall a future that will be much better for most readers and writers?", "Mr. Zandri, who 15 years ago had a $235,000 contract with a big New York house that went sour, has an answer.", "\u201cEverything Amazon has promised me, it has fulfilled \u2014 and more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ask: \u2018Are you happy, Vince?

Inspired by Walmart, Amazon takes a famously hard line toward the people who make the stuff it sells.", "\u201cAmazon is not evil, but it is ruthlessly, ruthlessly efficient,\u201d said Andrew Rhomberg, founder of JellyBooks, an e-book discovery site. \u201cAs consumers, we love Amazon\u2019s efficiency and low prices,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as suppliers, it is a toad that is hard to swallow.\u201d", "For Hachette, which publishes under the Little Brown and Grand Central imprints, the latest proposal was more elephant than toad. Both parties have declined to say exactly what Amazon is asking; the general belief is that it wants to increase its share of revenue on every e-book to 50 percent from 30 percent.", "Amazon believes that publishers take too much of the money in producing a book and add too little value. In traditional publishing, the highest royalty a writer could get was 15 percent of the book\u2019s price. With e-books, the royalty is 25 percent of net revenue, but Amazon feels that is still not enough. Mr. Zandri gets 35 percent, and self-published writers who use Amazon\u2019s platform get more.", "\u201cAmazon believes the value exchange between publishers and authors is fundamentally broken,\u201d said Scott Jacobson, who worked on the Kindle team at Amazon and is now at the Madrona Venture Group. \u201cIn a world where authors can hire their own editors, market their books through the web and social media, and get production and distribution through Amazon or other services, publishers will play a lesser role and their share of the economics will be diminished.\u201d", "So writers should get more and publishers less, an assertion with which few writers would disagree. But Amazon also believes that books should be cheap. This makes the pie smaller for everyone; Amazon argues that the publishers will make up on volume what they lose on each sale.", "In interviews, for the first time, executives from Amazon and Hachette explicitly described their positions.", "\u201cIf you charge high e-book prices, ultimately what you\u2019re doing is making a slow, painful slide to irrelevancy,\u201d said Russell Grandinetti, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for Kindle. \u201cYou have to draw the box big. Books don\u2019t just compete against books. Books compete against Candy Crush, Twitter, Facebook, streaming movies, newspapers you can read for free. It\u2019s a new world. It\u2019s so important not to simply build a moat around the industry the way it is now.\u201d", "Amazon favors a price of $9.99 for many e-book titles, while Hachette and other publishers want to charge more.

The family lawyer who helped establish our companies suggested that I create a board before I raised our first investment round and that I try to find some high profile people to join it. His objective was to make the team slide in my presentation deck look as impressive as possible. Off I went to enlist some big name folks to join my not-yet-established company.", "Within a month, I\u2019d assembled a board of eight, including myself, and we called a meeting. A friend lent me his boardroom, a big office in the city. I expected a casual, friendly affair where we would chat about business and strategy and they would agree to introduce me to some potential investors. I was in for a surprise.", "First of all, they wanted to know everything: How much money did we have in the bank? What were the liabilities? The budget? How many people had visited the site the previous week? The previous month? How long had they stayed? How much money had we made? And so on. I wasn\u2019t prepared, and it was overwhelming.", "After a couple of hours of grilling, I gained a sense of what a board expects from a founder. Before beginning Posse, I\u2019d run my own business for eight years and hadn\u2019t reported to anyone. In time, I came to appreciate the rigor of reporting. Before the next meeting, I made sure I sent out the cash-flow report, budget, metrics, and a presentation outlining what I wanted to talk about.", "Six months in, our group hit its first challenge. The business had started well; we\u2019d raised some money and gained traction. Everyone became excited, but no one had any experience working with start-ups. Their main understanding of the industry came from watching \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d", "Unexpectedly one director presented us with a proposal involving a full-time job and a lot of equity. The group wasn\u2019t sure how to react. He left the room while we discussed his proposal, and when we rejected it, he was hurt and embarrassed. He quit the board and sent us a huge invoice for his time, which we spent a year fighting and eventually settled.", "Some members of our original board were excellent and are still active today. Others drifted off. They harbored an expectation that we would be a huge hit within months, and when hard work set in, they disappeared. Some stuck around and were destructive when things didn\u2019t go their way.", "I learned how unpleasant the work environment can become with the wrong board in place. But I\u2019ve also learned how empowering the support of the right board can be. At a recent meeting, after closing off a round of funding, we were working on a strategy for the next phase of Posse\u2019s development. Our board has helped me prioritize objectives, recruit team members and raise capital when needed. The group has the right mix of experience to know when we\u2019re on-track and to guide me away from making (too many) mistakes.", "Some of my friends with similar companies have avoided creating a board outside of the founder group. That\u2019s because the board does have ultimate control over the company and who runs it, and many entrepreneurs find this threatening. As a sole founder, I have found my board to be incredibly valuable. In fact, we would not have survived without them.", "But putting the right group together is challenging.

Here are five things I\u2019ve learned the hard way.", "Make sure your directors have the right experience.", "Many people imagine that a board should consist of gray-haired gentlemen with high profiles in the business community along with friends who will invest in the business. My original board sounded impressive, but many were impressive in the wrong industries. They had no experience with the challenges a start-up like ours might face. So I received bad advice which led us to hire the wrong team and spend too much too quickly. A couple of our early directors had never used Facebook or Twitter. They wouldn\u2019t even join the business we were trying to build.", "Today, everyone on the board has expertise in different areas of early-stage companies in our space. Including me, we have four directors: Bill Tai, Silicon Valley start-up evangelist and investor; Lars Rasmussen, a co-founder of Google Maps; and Jeremy Colless, an Australian venture capitalist. They know what other businesses are doing to grow, engage users, monetize, and save costs. Most days, a board member emails me with an idea or opportunity that wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me. And through them, we can access almost anyone we would need to help our business.", "Make sure you invite people you like and trust.", "Directors have a power. They decide who leads the company, what deals to do and when to exit, so you must all share the same vision. You must know they will do the right thing, that they will stick around and support you when you hit tough times. One year into Posse, it looked as if the company might fail. One member of my board turned on me and influenced the rest of the group. I wrote about how this internal fallout almost ruined us and how I wound up sacking the entire board in an earlier post.", "I spent a lot of time with each of our existing directors before I asked them to join. I knew I could trust them to act in the best interests of the company and to stick it out. We\u2019ve had hard times, but I can honestly say that our group pulls together and digs in, no matter the circumstances.", "Keep the numbers small.", "We have four directors on our current board, including me, and one regular observer who acts like a director but doesn\u2019t vote. It\u2019s a tight group: Everyone knows the others\u2019 strengths; everyone is committed to making Posse a hit. I\u2019ve heard that the reason to keep boards small is to ensure that as founder you won\u2019t be outvoted. I suggest that if you think this, you have the wrong board or you\u2019re the wrong founder. For me, the benefit of having a small board is that I can spend time with each person regularly. There\u2019s no delay when we need to make an important decision. Everyone is in touch with what\u2019s happening and can contribute.", "Set expectations up front.", "It\u2019s easy to procrastinate when finalizing deals with advisers and directors. Everyone is there to be helpful, and at the start, it doesn\u2019t seem worth negotiating to pay them a share of nothing. The problems kick in after a few months when things start going well and you realize that you and they have different expectations about payment. Most start-up directors expect to receive equity rather than cash; I\u2019ve found the standard rate \u2014 in Sydney, Australia, anyway \u2014 is 0.5 percent to 2 percent, vesting over two years. Some want to be paid their standard consulting rate plus a bonus (often double) when payment is taken in equity rather than cash, but I haven\u2019t done any deals like this because I don\u2019t want to feel like the clock is ticking when I need help.", "You must determine what you expect of directors. How will they help with fund-raising, strategy, introductions and the like? If appropriate, you might want to agree on how much time they will commit \u2014 although when you have the right people on board it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll bug you with ideas and suggestions for how they can help. Although these conversations can be awkward at the beginning, I\u2019ve found that the directors who are best at negotiating their own deals are the ones who are most helpful when I am negotiating deals for Posse.", "Be transparent and organized.", "Your board should be the one group of people with whom you can be completely transparent. It\u2019s their job to help you work through challenges; they must understand those challenges if they\u2019re going to add value. At one of the first meetings of our new board, I announced that the product we\u2019d created wouldn\u2019t scale. We had to go back to the drawing board and try something else before we ran out of money. No one flinched. We put a process in place that would devise a better strategy. I\u2019ve also found that board meetings are much more effective when I\u2019ve put time into considering the agenda and have written a presentation to talk through.", "At my first board meeting, I learned what directors expect from a founder. It took me quite a while to work out what founders should expect from their directors. Our board helps me refine our strategy and operation plans; they\u2019re constantly suggesting new ideas and making introductions; they\u2019ve been involved in fund-raising; they hold me to account and oversee the governance of the company.", "The names on our board are impressive but that\u2019s not why they\u2019re there.

As for my German, if you think knowing how to say \u201cThe girl is drinking water\u201d is of limited use on a trip, perhaps you\u2019ve never imagined having to alert a parent at a D\u00fcsseldorf park that her toddler has crawled off and is lapping water from a puddle.

Does your regular health plan really cover you? If you bought travel insurance, will you actually be fully reimbursed? How do you find a local doctor? What\u2019s that bump on your arm? Doctor on Demand is one of several sites and applications offering virtual consultations with American doctors, but not all are accessible abroad or reasonably priced.", "Doctor on Demand is both. The app offers 15-minute consultations with an American board-certified physician for $40 a pop. The interface is simple, especially if you enter your payment information before your trip: Open it up, type in your symptoms and connect within two minutes. Of course, not even the best doctors can diagnose (let alone cure) all problems over a smartphone screen. And unless you\u2019re in the United States, where the app is also useful to travelers, they can\u2019t write you a prescription. But in many cases that $40 can save you the trouble and cost of finding a local doctor or emergency room. (Doctors on Demand says fewer than 10 percent of calls result in an immediate in-person referral for in-person care.)", "Two other related tips: Check if your health insurance has an app to find local doctors who are part of the network; I have the Blue Card Worldwide app from BlueCross BlueShield, and always look at the local hospital list in advance so, in case of emergency, I don\u2019t end up somewhere I\u2019m not covered.

Sure, it\u2019s 17 miles from here to there, but how much would that cost in a bus versus a taxi versus ZipCar? And if I chose a taxi, which service should I use to get one? RideScout shows more options, including some you\u2019ve probably never heard of. Flywheel to get a cab in San Francisco? Bandwagon to share taxis in New York? It\u2019s all in there, with estimated prices to allow you to choose the cheapest way that meets your needs. The app has customized details for 69 cities, up from five, as of June 9. (The company is calling it their \u201cSummer of 69.\u201d) Though there were a few pricing bugs when I tested it out, a Ridescout spokeswoman told me the latest version, to be released by Monday, resolves them (and will be powered by Google Maps rather than Apple Maps, a plus in my book).", "Meanwhile, BusBud has taken on a beyond-Herculean task of taming the vast, diverse, multilingual, technologically divergent world of independent bus companies into something that resembles the simplicity of an airfare or hotel meta-search like Kayak. The result: an imperfect but extraordinarily useful way to check out bus routes around the world. It has its limits \u2014 forget that dream journey by coach from Romania to Moldova. But where it does work, it makes the task of planning a bus journey as easy as the usually more expensive options of trains and planes and rental cars.

Log in to a social network and you\u2019ll find it directed at celebrities and civilians alike. (See: Woody Allen, Stephen Colbert and Justine Sacco, the former communications director for IAC who posted an insensitive Twitter message about AIDS in Africa.) Politicians are a perennial favorite: Chris Christie, Rob Ford, Anthony Weiner. Then there\u2019s the bigger game: courts of law, social movements, news media outlets, corporations and governments that have rubbed people the wrong way.", "As a now-hackneyed joke goes on Twitter, \u201cWhat are we angry about today?\u201d", "Bile has been a part of the Internet as long as Al Gore has; peruse any epithet-laced comments section or, worse, a chat room. But the last few years have seen it crawl from under the shadowy bridges patrolled by anonymous trolls and emerge into the sunshine of social media, where people proudly trumpet their ethical outrage.", "A 2013 study, from Beihang University in Beijing, of Weibo, a Twitter-like site, found that anger is the emotion that spreads the most easily over social media. Joy came in a distant second. The main difference, said Ryan Martin, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay, who studies anger, is that although we tend to share the happiness only of people we are close to, we are willing to join in the rage of strangers. As the study suggests, outrage is lavishly rewarded on social media, whether through supportive comments, retweets or Facebook likes. People prone to Internet outrage are looking for validation, Professor Martin said. \u201cThey want to hear that others share it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they feel they\u2019re vindicated and a little less lonely and isolated in their belief.\u201d", "Certainly, outrage can function as a corrective or anguished expression of helplessness, punishing the offending party if he, she or it has not been given any official penalty; think of George Zimmerman. Moreover, it can double as effective activism, forcing a response from the powers that be, as in the case of Ms. Sacco, whom IAC fired the day after her post went viral and who inspired someone to create a website with her name that redirects visitors to the nonprofit alliance Aid for Africa.", "But Internet outrage often says more about the commenter than the cause, and its deployment may do more harm than good, to the instigator and the issue.", "In another 2013 study, Professor Martin determined that people susceptible to Internet rage are also angrier than the general population, a finding that should come as little shock. \u201cThey expressed their anger less healthily, in maladaptive ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would either yell and scream or suppress it, but very few had any adaptive coping strategies. People who rant online in any way tend to get into more physical and verbal altercations.\u201d", "Correlation is not causation; voicing outrage on the Internet may not lead to a fistfight when the laptop is closed. But while expressing anger led to short-term relaxation for the study\u2019s participants, Professor Martin said that \u201cprevious research on catharsis shows that people who vent end up being angrier down the road.\u201d", "Yet outrage carries a different flavor from pure anger; it suggests an affront to one\u2019s value system as opposed to seething, Hulk-like fury. So whereas a venomous insult from an anonymous commenter simply seeks to tear down another person or institution, an outraged Twitter post from an identified account calls attention to the user\u2019s own probity. By throwing 140-character stones from our Google Glass houses, we preserve our belief (or delusion) that we are morally superior to those who have offended us.", "The emotion plays well on social media because of its brevity and conviction, too. A 700-word Facebook post accounting for all sides of a contentious issue is unlikely to garner as many readers and endorsements as a one-sentence quip blaring heightened feelings.", "One type of outrage is particularly appealing on social media: comedic anger. A bitingly clever takedown is sure to be circulated, though it is usually the same brand of hostility veiled in amusement. Unsurprisingly, some of the most popular outragers on social media are comedians, a professional class known for transforming wrath into wit and for neediness; Professor Martin pointed to Ricky Gervais as a skillful Twitter commingler of indignation and humor. His most popular posts attack religion and the hunting of animals; the one with the most retweets, by far, is this riff: \u201cSame-sex marriage isn\u2019t gay privilege, it\u2019s equal rights. Privilege would be something like gay people not paying taxes. Like churches don\u2019t.\u201d", "The outraged may also be enacting a defense mechanism reinforced by the very culture of Internet ire. When you\u2019re personally upset by something, it\u2019s difficult to be counterattacked for your ethical injury. To state one\u2019s outrage is to insulate oneself from criticism in the acid bath of the web.", "But such responses can overshadow or diminish the complexity of a subject, narrowing into a reductive meme or hashtag rather than opening up a thoughtful debate. Twitter response to Donald Sterling\u2019s racist comments, #BoycottClippers, was heartening. But the furor over one octogenarian\u2019s bigotry trumped the NBA\u2019s longstanding toleration of his discriminatory business practices, not to mention an opportunity to spotlight the league\u2019s exploitation of African-American youth for profit, as Theresa Runstedtler, an American University history professor, has argued. (Another wrinkle brought up by, among others, Bill Maher: that we get upset only when our own privacy is compromised, not that of others.)", "Furthermore, outraged comments are sometimes more offensive than the originating misconduct. In response to Ms. Sacco, for instance, a number of Twitter users urged for her to be killed or raped and get AIDS herself. When Ruth Graham, a journalist, wrote a Slate article called \u201cAgainst YA,\u201d with a subheading suggesting \u201cyou should feel embarrassed when what you\u2019re reading was written for children,\u201d thousands of adult readers of young-adult fiction took to the comments section and Twitter to excoriate Ms. Graham with language that would fit right in with surly teenagers.", "Mobs breed a sense of anonymity, and in the midst of trending Twitter outrage, Professor Martin said, \u201cyou may feel anonymous, even if you\u2019re not really.\u201d Such perceived anonymity encourages people \u2014 even seemingly sensitive readers of \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d \u2014 to say things they likely would not in person.", "Though we are quick to condemn callousness and prejudice as a form of bullying, we less readily interrogate our own participation, even as bystanders, in the widespread attack of a single person, which is a classic example of bullying. We may justify our reaction as appropriate remediation for whatever crime has been perpetrated, but fighting fire with fire rarely elevates the discourse.", "Ultimately, Internet outrage is the milquetoast cousin to direct action, a way to protest by tapping and clicking rather than boycotting and marching. It is a noble endeavor to become incensed about a cause and risk arrest or toil without acclamation for one\u2019s deeply held beliefs. Less honorable is joining a digital pile-on as a means of propping up one\u2019s ego, even if it comes in the form of entertaining zings.", "Perhaps the real problem, Professor Martin suggested, isn\u2019t our rage but our rashness, and its relationship to our easily accessible devices.", "\u201cThe Internet exacerbates impulse-control problems,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get mad, and you can tell the world about it in moments before you\u2019ve had a chance to calm down and think things through.\u201d"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/daily-report-europes-right-to-be-forgotten-ruling-offers-some-companies-an-opportunity/": ["Days after Europe\u2019s highest court said people could ask search engines to remove some links about themselves, Andy Donaldson started to receive phone calls, Mark Scott reports.", "Mr. Donaldson\u2019s British company, Hit Search, had previously created a service for companies and individuals to monitor how and where they were mentioned across the Internet.

It is important to note that this is the same generation in power which involved the United States unnecessarily in wars, ballooned the national debt, refused to curb explosive college fees and thereby saddled millions of young people with incredible financial burden, turned a blind eye to racial and sexual discrimination, has yet to fully recognize LGBTQ community members legally or socially, allowed jobs to flee the nation, and stated that businesses are people with the same rights as, say, a young college student, pushing his/her way through school with a minimum wage job. I would argue that it is no surprise young people have turned their backs on the traditional, superficial patriotism of older generations and have become more invested in equality and democracy.", "With this seeming disregard of the traditional symbols of the United States of America, perhaps the millennial generation is not as vain as they have been made out.

In his 1855 poem \u201cOne Word More,\u201d Robert Browning suggested that creative sensibilities are drawn to \u201cart alien to the artist\u2019s\u201d because branching out lets a person \u201cbe the man and leave the artist, / Gain the man\u2019s joy, miss the artist\u2019s sorrow.\u201d He meant that the more we master the techniques of our native art, the more our art becomes an expression of those techniques rather than a portal on our individuality. The more fluent we become, the more we become armored in that fluency. The issue is further complicated because arts differ in more than their formal elements; they also occupy different areas of the culture. So what happens when the genre-switch is not merely between forms, but between practices that stand in relation to each other as, say, professional football stands in relation to professional badminton?", "DIRECTING HERBERT WHITE: Poems (Graywolf, paper, $15) is a new book by James Franco, the Oscar-nominated actor, former Oscar host and all-around celebrity. That he would put out a book of poems with a respected press isn\u2019t groundbreaking \u2014 Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins published a collection called \u201cBlinking With Fists\u201d with Faber & Faber in 2004, an act for which we will all surely pay when great Cthulhu rises. But what\u2019s different about Franco\u2019s book is that it doesn\u2019t obviously represent a cash grab by the publisher or an ego trip by the artist. The blurbs accompanying this collection are from actual poets \u2014 Tony Hoagland, Frank Bidart \u2014 as opposed to the expected gaggle of hanger-arounders. And Graywolf, while one of the best publishers of American poetry, is probably not in a position to pay Franco an enormous advance or put him in front of the Oprah audience. This book is intended for real poetry readers, all five of them, as well as Franco\u2019s Twitter followers, all 2.2 million.", "But is it, you may be wondering, good? No. But neither is it entirely bad. \u201cDirecting Herbert White\u201d is the sort of collection written by reasonably talented M.F.A. students in hundreds of M.F.A. programs stretching from sea to shining sea. Which is perhaps not surprising, since Franco actually has an M.F.A. in poetry. I\u2019m obliged here to note that this actor is well acquainted with the educational system, having apparently attended graduate programs at Yale, Columbia, New York University, Brooklyn College, Warren Wilson College, the Rhode Island School of Design, Le Cordon Bleu, Quantico, Hogwarts (Ravenclaw), the Vaganova School of Russian Ballet and the Jedi Academy.", "But for all his inclination to wander \u2014 a Google search for \u201cJames Franco\u201d and \u201cdilettante\u201d returns some 20,000 hits \u2014 his interest in poetry is genuine. \u201cDirecting Herbert White\u201d is divided into seven sections (two of them riff on Smiths songs), and the poems are uniformly written in the kind of flat, prosy free verse that has dominated American poetry for ages (typical line: \u201cNew Orleans Square is my favorite part of Disneyland\u201d), with stanzas that aren\u2019t so much stanzas as elongated paragraphs. Franco takes his title from a Bidart poem that he turned into a short film in 2010, but this book\u2019s preoccupations exist far from the usual terrain of contemporary poetry: \u201cLindsay\u201d is the Lohan; there are elegies for people more famous than anyone you\u2019ve ever met; and the movie business is discussed with convincing first-person authority (\u201cIt\u2019s fun to react. It may be less / Intrusive, doing long takes . . . \u201d).", "As with most first-book poets, the farther Franco gets from himself, the better his work tends to be. The best poems here are six \u201cfilm sonnets,\u201d in which you can sense the cagey intelligence that emerges in his acting. Here is the beginning of \u201cFilm Sonnet 2,\u201d which is about Fellini\u2019s \u201c8 1/2\u201d:", "Marcello is fatigued. A passive-aggressive genius,\nA man wrapped in himself: art, mistress, and wife.\nHe goes to the spa, why? At the spa, people in white\nWalk about the plaza, there is a fountain, everyone is rich.", "The poem ends:", "Fellini\u2019s getting old, inspiration dries up, but here,\nThis despair is nice because it is the sorrow of an artist.\nAn important artist has important despair, and everything\nHe does can go on the screen: sex, religion, fear.\nA confession of pain and proclivities.", "\u201cThis despair is nice\u201d: The tone is neatly judged. Franco writes similarly well in poems like \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cEditing,\u201d and you find yourself wishing the sensibility here pervaded the book.", "It doesn\u2019t, unfortunately. Franco has a decent ear for speech, but a bad sense of the poetic line (\u201cAnd my nose was a blob\u201d). He\u2019s prone to phrases that sound good at first but collapse under scrutiny (\u201cWebbed by a nexus of stone walkways\u201d). Some of the writing is almost aggressively lazy: \u201cThere is one of two things that happen,\u201d one poem begins, practically begging for an editor to excise \u201cThere is\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d (and to change \u201chappen\u201d to \u201chappens\u201d). Many poems rocket past sincerity and plunge straight into sentimentality; others demonstrate a self-disgust more interesting to the author than the reader.", "So Franco is never going to be Wallace Stevens \u2014 or Cathy Park Hong or A. E. Stallings or Devin Johnston, for that matter. But most writers won\u2019t be. His work is a fair representation of a certain strand in contemporary poetry, and there\u2019s no shame in that. God knows he can write circles around Billy Corgan. To say this, though, is to ignore the larger issue, which is the grand-piano-in-a-bathtub impact of Franco\u2019s celebrity in an art form notably short on figures recognizable to anyone who doesn\u2019t subscribe to Ploughshares. This book wouldn\u2019t be published by Graywolf (I hope) if James Franco weren\u2019t \u201cJames Franco.\u201d James Franco wouldn\u2019t be doing events with Frank Bidart if he weren\u2019t \u201cJames Franco.\u201d For that matter, James Franco wouldn\u2019t be getting reviewed right now if he weren\u2019t \u201cJames Franco.\u201d In fact, if James Franco were just another M.F.A. student struggling to catch the attention of the two part-time employees of Origami Arthropod Press, he\u2019d probably be reading this piece and fuming about all the attention being given, yet again, to James Franco.", "It\u2019s easy to sympathize, even if one suspects some of the complainers are no better at writing poems than Franco is. Yet the annoyance this collection will inspire is rooted in a deeper anxiety: The attention commanded by James Franco\u2019s poetry has everything to do with \u201cJames Franco\u201d and almost nothing to do with poetry. And that cultural wealth is not transferable. Attention withheld from Franco\u2019s poems will not instantly devolve upon some worthy but obscure poet; it will go to another actor, or singer, or commercial nonfiction writer, or memoirist \u2014 or even to James Franco in his novel-writing incarnation. Poetry is the weak sister of its sibling arts, alternately ignored and swaddled like a 19th-century invalid, and that will change only by means of a long, tedious and possibly futile effort at persuasion. Perhaps it\u2019s a blessing to have James Franco on one\u2019s side in that struggle."], "https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/07/24/reviewing-those-uncharted-restaurants-the-romance-and-the-reality/": ["Ligaya Mishan writes the Hungry City column for the Dining section (her most recent column, on Brooklyn Ball Factory, appears here).

I don\u2019t order everything myself, as that would look suspicious; instead, I assign each diner a dish \u2014 with strict rules that no one should get possessive of what they\u2019re eating, since everything will be swapped.

What is the easiest way to convert an old typed manuscript of our family history into an electronic format so everyone in the family can get it by email?", "A. While a shop like FedEx Office that offers document scanning and conversions can do the job and save you time and hassle, you can also do it yourself with the right equipment. If you do not have a scanner at home or in the office, your local print-and-copy shop may have machines you can rent; many have automatic document feeders that make scanning a large stack of unbound paper relatively quick and easy. Many multifunction printers designed for home users include a scanning function, but it is a page-by-page operation unless you have a document feeder.", "You also need to decide what format you want to use for the electronic version of the book. Most scanning software lets you save the converted pages into a PDF file, which can then be emailed or posted on a file-sharing site like Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive for family members to download and read on their computers, tablets or phones. (They could even convert the file back into paper by printing it out themselves.)", "If you want to take the project a few steps further, you could convert the scanned pages into an editable text file. This file can be shared with family as a word-processing document that can be annotated, or even expanded upon with photographs and additional material. The file could also be converted into ebook-friendly formats for those who find the PDF format too inflexible.", "To convert type on a piece of paper into computer text you can edit, you should have a decent optical character recognition (O.C.R.) program. Prices range from free to a few hundred dollars, but you may already have one with your multifunction printer or business-software suite. O.C.R. software converts typed pages into text files by analyzing the letters on the scanned page and recreating them in a word-processing format.", "Optical character recognition works best with clean pages and clear, dark letters. Type degraded by duplication (photocopies of photocopies, faxes) and things like handwritten annotations, broken-up letterforms, garbled words and tightly spaced fonts can cause the program to incorrectly translate the text. You can make your own manual corrections on the computer\u2019s version of the file, and it is a good idea to proofread the entire document before sending it out anyway.", "Once you have converted the manuscript into a digital file, you can save or convert it further into a file format that works best for the family. The ePub format, for example, works on a number of ebook readers and allows the user to easily change the text size and font. Amazon\u2019s Kindle e-reader does not natively support ePub files, but free ebook-management software like Calibre can not only convert Microsoft Word documents into ePub files, it can also translate ePub files into to a Kindle-friendly format. Apple\u2019s Pages program can also export documents as ePub files, and other conversion programs, like Vibosoft\u2019s $40 ePub Converter for Windows or Mac, are available as well.", "Checking Internet Connection Speed", "Q. I feel like my broadband connection isn\u2019t as zippy as it used to be \u2014 or as fast as advertised. How can I test it most accurately myself?", "A. Plenty of online \u201cspeed test\u201d sites can give you an idea of your current download and upload rates by sending small amounts of data to and from your computer and the site\u2019s servers, and then measuring the time taken to transmit the files. To get the most accurate measure of your connection speed, however, plug your computer directly to your router with an Ethernet cable, if you can. Testing the speed over a wireless network usually brings slower results than with a wired connection.", "Before you begin, you should also disconnect from any virtual private networks you may be using to connect to the office. Additionally, stop any file downloads, music or video streaming services, online games or other activities that can tax the bandwidth. General Internet congestion can also affect your speed, so you may want to run the test several different times over a few days to see if your results vary.", "Once you have set up the cleanest possible connection between your computer and your Internet provider, visit the broadband-speed test site of your choice. The Speedtest.net Internet Speed Test and the Speakeasy Speed Test are two popular options.", "Most Internet service providers have their variations on the speed-test page as well, including AT&T, Comcast, Charter Communications, Cox, Time Warner Cable and Verizon. If you are checking your speed on a mobile device that cannot use Adobe Flash or other software used by speed-test sites, try either Bandwidth Place and Speedof.me, which both use HMTL5. (The Speedtest.net site also has apps for Android, iOS and Windows Phone.)", "One advantage to using your provider\u2019s speed-test page is that you are already on the company\u2019s site if you find the results troublesome. If the provider\u2019s own troubleshooting tips (which inevitably include rebooting your modem) have no effect, look for the support telephone number or sign up for a service appointment online so that a technician can come check for damage to your wires and other equipment."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/world/middleeast/zaatari-refugee-camp-in-jordan-evolves-as-a-do-it-yourself-city.html": ["ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan \u2014 A young Syrian salesman stopped into Ahmad Bidawi\u2019s barbershop for a shave the other day. Music wafted on fan-cooled air. Outside, on what has become the main commercial strip here in one of the world\u2019s largest refugee camps, workers steered handcarts packed with lumber and kitchen appliances through sunbaked crowds hanging out in front of shops.", "The scene could hardly have felt further from the mayhem across the border that Mr. Bidawi, like the other refugees, fled. Syria is only a few miles away. From the camp one can feel the shelling. A farmer back home and jack-of-all-trades, Mr. Bidawi arrived here with his wife and children a year ago, only to have his youngest daughter die in the camp, overwhelmed by tear gas fired when guards struggled to quell a riot. Everyone in Zaatari has horror stories about homes destroyed, family members lost and bad times in the camp.", "But now, at a pace stunning to see, Zaatari is becoming an informal city: a sudden, do-it-yourself metropolis of roughly 85,000 with the emergence of neighborhoods, gentrification, a growing economy and, under the circumstances, something approaching normalcy, though every refugee longs to return home. There is even a travel agency that will provide a pickup service at the airport, and pizza delivery, with an address system for the refugees that camp officials are scrambling to copy.", "The change, accelerated by regional chaos and enterprising Syrians, illustrates a basic civilizing push toward urbanization that clearly happens even in desperate places \u2014 people leaving their stamp wherever they live, making spaces they occupy their own. At the same time, Zaatari\u2019s evolution points more broadly to a whole new way of thinking about one of the most pressing crises on the planet.", "In June, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that the number of refugees worldwide in 2013 topped 50 million, the most since World War II, a figure substantially increased by the Syrian conflict. Add to that one million Iraqis displaced during the first months of this year.", "These vast forced migrations have accelerated discussions about the need to treat camps as more than transitional population centers, more than human holding pens with tents for transients. A number of forward-thinking aid workers and others are looking at refugee camps as potential urban incubators, places that can grow and develop and even benefit the host countries \u2014 places devised from the get-go to address those countries\u2019 long-term needs \u2014 rather than become drags on those nations.", "Such thinking is driven by reality: Syrian and Iraqi families, with no clear path to peace, and no other choice, their countries coming undone, find themselves facing extended exile in places like Zaatari, which the refugees are in effect retrofitting out of necessity to serve their immediate needs.", "\u201cYou can call a place like Zaatari impermanent and not build adequate infrastructure,\u201d as Don Weinreich, a partner at Ennead Architects in New York, recently put it. Ennead is collaborating with the United Nations refugee agency and Stanford University to reimagine how, and where, refugee camps around the world should, or shouldn\u2019t, be planned and built.", "\u201cBut organic development, driven by refugees, is unstoppable,\u201d Mr. Weinreich said. \u201cImpermanence costs more in the long run. Whether you encourage growth in the right ways or you fight it, it\u2019s going to happen anyway.\u201d", "That\u2019s what makes this sprawling, messy camp in the Jordanian desert such a compelling study in city-building \u2014 or as Kilian Kleinschmidt, the United Nations official in charge of Zaatari, calls it, \u201cthe most fascinating project on earth when it comes to the development of camps.\u201d", "Not that Zaatari is like downtown Amman. It is a squalid, barren, crime-ridden place. Most of those businesses and shops are unauthorized. Much of the site remains a tent city. But it\u2019s a far cry from a camp like Azraq, which Jordan and the United Nations refugee agency opened to Syrians recently, or camps in Turkey, run by the Turkish government, that have state-of-the-art facilities but are designed to suppress the sort of ground-up urbanism that has altered Zaatari.", "Azraq, located miles from anywhere, is strictly policed, with fixed, corrugated metal shelters in military order, dirt floors and shameful public toilets, and it has no electricity. So far about 11,000 Syrians are marooned there. The camp is planned to house more than 100,000.", "Refugees at Azraq, families with small children, terrified at night without electricity to light the shelters, unprotected against the scorpions, mice and snakes, say they escaped one nightmare to arrive at another.", "The oldest parts of Zaatari, by contrast, now have streets, one or two paved, some lined with electric poles, the most elaborate houses cobbled together from shelters, tents, cinder blocks and shipping containers, with interior courtyards, private toilets and jerry-built sewers. Clusters of satellite dishes and water tanks on the skyline can bring to mind favelas in Rio de Janeiro or slums in Cairo. Like favelas, the camp has grown according to its own ad hoc, populist urban logic, which includes a degree of social mobility.", "\u201cWhat is happening at Zaatari, while causing lots of problems, also presents opportunities as the camp evolves into a complex ecosystem that you could call a city or a slum,\u201d said Daniel Kerber of Morethanshelters, a German relief agency. \u201cEither way, it\u2019s a dynamic place, unforeseen by the humanitarian actors running it, which is giving refugees a sense of ownership and dignity.\u201d", "Mr. Kleinschmidt ticked off numbers: 14,000 households, 10,000 sewage pots and private toilets, 3,000 washing machines, 150 private gardens, 3,500 new businesses and shops. Not far from Mr. Bidawi\u2019s barbershop, Zaatari has a pet store, a flower shop and a homemade ice cream business. Refugees tote rotisserie chickens from a takeout joint on the main street, called the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.", "This is all black market. Smugglers traffic in camp vouchers and goods, undermining legitimate Jordanian businesses, profiting criminal gangs in and out of the camp. An empty police station disappeared from near the camp entrance one night, its trailers repurposed as homes and shops two days later.", "At a bridal shop here the other morning, the owner, Abdullah Harriri, said he had paid 7,000 Jordanian dinars, roughly $10,000, for his property at a prime location on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es \u2014 another underground transaction. \u201cBy the end of the year I should be able to sell this property for 10,000 or 12,000\u201d dinars, he calculated. A shadow real estate market is a sign of permanence.", "Zaatari\u2019s transformation happened after Mr. Kleinschmidt started talking with, and thereby neutralizing, the Mafia-like groups that had seized control of the camp. At the same time he worked to enlist allies among refugees, encouraging grass-roots initiatives, listening. In effect, he started treating Zaatari not like a camp but like a city. \u201cWe design refugee camps; refugees build cities,\u201d he said.", "Refugees at Zaatari steal the electricity that powers their shops and washing machines to the tune of $750,000 a month, an unsustainable burden for the United Nations. Mr. Kleinschmidt persuaded shop owners to install circuit breakers so the system would not collapse, and he is now working on a plan to institute monthly fees for shop owners and refugees with washing machines, eventually doing the same with sewage and water \u2014 in effect, slowly formalizing the camp\u2019s economy, an approach both fair and politically savvy.", "Jordan receives $1 million a day in international aid, and some Jordanians, including landlords, banks and small businesses, benefit from the Syrian influx. But poor Jordanians, who pay for their utilities, complain that Syrians steal jobs, drive up rents, overcrowd schools and drain resources.", "Those complaints partly explain Azraq, which seems above all conceived to prevent Syrians from escaping or tapping into public utilities. If it grows as predicted, it will no doubt succumb anyway to the inevitable urbanizing forces that are changing Zaatari, which will be occupied for years to come, if not by Syrians than by Jordanians. Installing a permanent municipal water system there would cost what the United Nations now spends every year trucking water to the camp, and it would be an investment in long-term development.", "Mr. Kleinschmidt, pushing this philosophy, is talking with, among others, representatives from Google about wiring the camp and with the urban planning office in Amsterdam, which recently offered 10,000 bicycles to the camp, an idea that prompted a few canny Syrian refugees to open bike repair shops even before the bikes arrived.", "That sort of enterprise should serve the Jordanian economy. A sign that Jordanian officials may be coming around to this long-term thinking is a recent promise by the Ministry of Environment to deliver several thousand trees to the camp.", "They would make life better for the Awad family, among the newest arrivals at Zaatari, nine of them, including six small children, sick from the flies and dysentery, crammed into windblown tents at the far end of the camp. Grateful to have left the bloodshed, they struggle to survive and dream about living like Rasheed Abdul Latif Rashed and his wife, Amal Zaubi, on the opposite end of Zaatari. That couple sold the family\u2019s gold jewelry to buy a complex of trailers not far from the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.", "\u201cWe were used to living a decent life back home, so we had to make something of our situation here,\u201d Mr. Abdul Latif explained, standing in the trailer that has become their living room, near a burbling aquarium and a martyr\u2019s shrine to their only child, a son killed in Syria.", "\u201cYou have to look ahead,\u201d he said, as did Mr. Bidawi, the barbershop owner who lost a daughter.", "Things are looking up for Mr. Bidawi and his wife.", "She is pregnant again."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/technology/principles-are-no-match-for-europes-love-of-us-tech-titans-like-amazon-and-facebook.html": ["LONDON \u2014 On weekends, Guillaume Rosquin browses the shelves of local bookstores in Lyon, France.

Security experts say email is a lot more like a postcard than a letter inside an envelope, and almost anyone can read it while the note is in transit. The government can probably read your email, as can hackers and your employer.", "What\u2019s the solution? Make your email more like a letter inside an envelope. The best way to do this is with a process known as encryption, which scrambles a message into unreadable code that needs a key to be unlocked, providing a layer of protection if someone intercepts your email.", "The downside to encryption tools is that they are usually difficult to install and use. In addition, they require the person on the other end to be using the same tools. Thanks to a renewed focus on privacy and security, however, new tools are arriving regularly that should make it easier to encrypt email.", "One promising new encryption tool is Virtru, a feature that can be added to Chrome and Firefox browsers or installed on the Mail program on the Mac and for Outlook on Windows. One of Virtru\u2019s big selling points is that it works with web-mail services like Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. There are also apps for iOS and Android.", "Another big benefit of Virtru is that recipients don\u2019t have to be using the service or any other encryption program to see your email. They receive an email that contains a link to your encrypted message. Once they click a button to verify their email address, they can read the unencrypted message in a separate web page and reply.", "Their responses won\u2019t be encrypted unless they also use Virtru, but your original email won\u2019t be included in the response, so it remains hidden from prying eyes.", "While Virtru is not a completely seamless experience, it is a walk in the park compared with some of the other options, which require signification coordination with the recipient of your messages.", "To install the browser plug-in, click the Get Virtru button on the company\u2019s website and it will detect what browser you\u2019re using. Click to download and the extension will install itself, all quickly and easily. You don\u2019t even have to restart your browser. (The company says support for Internet Explorer and Safari is coming soon.)", "The next time you compose a new email, you\u2019ll see a blue bar at the top of your email window with a little toggle button that lets you turn Virtru encryption on or off and access other options.

You can also revoke access to an encrypted message so your recipient won\u2019t be able to decrypt it in the future if the relationship goes sour.", "The methods aren\u2019t foolproof; someone can obviously still take a screenshot of an email once it\u2019s decrypted, or copy and paste the contents into a different file. And if your recipient writes back without encrypting the response, at least part of the conversation is not secure.", "Another drawback comes on mobile. You must use Virtru\u2019s app to compose and send secure messages on your mobile device, since it doesn\u2019t work on other mail apps on the phone.", "And there is one other aspect about Virtru that might make some people leery of the service: One of the company\u2019s founders, Will Ackerly, was a security engineer for the National Security Agency, the government agency that is said to intercept many forms of digital communications.", "Virtru promotes his background as a benefit. And John Ackerly, Mr. Ackerly\u2019s brother, a co-founder and the company\u2019s chief executive, says the company has taken pains to prove it is not tied to the N.S.A. Much of Virtru\u2019s code is open-source and has been published for peer review, giving the public a chance to look for potential vulnerabilities or back doors.", "Any Virtru product code that hasn\u2019t been published online is available for anyone who requests it, John Ackerly said. That doesn\u2019t affect the strength of its encryption; it\u2019s more like showing you the inner workings of a lock on a door. You can make sure the lock is strong, but it doesn\u2019t mean you can copy the key.", "In addition, the company is encouraging other companies or even individuals to set up servers that will store the encryption keys Virtru uses to decrypt emails. That would prevent all the keys from being stored in one place, adding another layer of security. When it comes to security, such distributed systems are generally safer.", "Although Virtru is relatively easy to use, it is not nearly the only option \u2014 especially if you just want to send a single encrypted message, perhaps one that contains financial information.", "If you\u2019re looking for one-off encryption, try a site like InfoEncrypt, which says it encrypts messages in the browser without storing any information.", "With InfoEncrypt, you type a message, create a password and then encrypt it. Then, you copy the encrypted message and paste it into an email and send it to someone. This is a little onerous, though. In order for the recipient to open the message, the sender must also pass along the password, presumably through something other than email.", "Another one-off option is SafeMess, which works much like InfoEncrypt. But SafeMess lets you set an expiration time for your messages, ranging from three minutes to 90 days.", "Expect more simplified encryption tools soon. Google, for example, is letting developers test end-to-end encryption tools for Chrome and hopes to release them broadly in the near future.

That category includes private small planes flown by amateurs as well as professionally piloted corporate flights in high-powered aircraft, such as the Gulfstream IV jet that crashed in May in Bedford, Mass., killing all seven people on board. By contrast, commercial aviation had no fatal accidents that year. Statistics from the N.T.S.B. show that general aviation aircraft average nearly seven accidents per 100,000 flight hours, compared with an average of 0.16 accidents per 100,000 hours for commercial airlines.", "Why the difference? For one, there are different administrative rules for each category: Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations for commercial airlines, Part 135 for on-demand charter flights, and Part 91 for general aviation. Because the rules are looser for general aviation than for commercial planes, the risks are much higher. General aviation pilots can be certified to fly a given aircraft with a relatively low number of flight hours.", "Most general aviation accidents involve some kind of pilot error. There are many factors that can contribute to this, with bad weather being the No. 1 culprit.", "An October 2012 report from the Government Accountability Office found that the highest incidence of fatal accidents in general aviation occurred with single-engine piston airplanes, on personal flights, in which pilots lost control of their aircraft. In some cases, bad weather was to blame, and according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, nearly 75 percent of weather-related accidents are fatal. (Dense fog was a possible factor in the Rockefeller crash.) Between 2008 and 2012, there were 7,502 general aviation accidents in the United States. Of those, 857, or 11 percent, had weather as a cause or contributing factor. Recognizing this, the Federal Aviation Administration just began an eight-month national safety campaign titled \u201cGot Weather?\u201d", "An N.T.S.B. study found that bad weather exposed weaknesses in a pilot\u2019s knowledge, training and skill, which were usually the real contributing causes of an accident.", "The current policies are not working.

But it has remained static, with the N.T.S.B. reporting an average of 1,500 aviation accidents a year, resulting in about 450 fatalities.", "Perhaps the F.A.A. should require all general aviation pilots to carry liability insurance, which would force pilots to have the superior training the insurance companies would require.", "There is currently no federal requirement that the owner or pilot of a private aircraft carry insurance to cover injuries to passengers or a third party on the ground. While some states do require this, the regulatory environment is an inconsistent patchwork.", "Typically an insurer will be more rigorous than the Federal Aviation Regulations in setting a minimum number of flight hours in a specific aircraft model, and may require additional training for a pilot who is considered inexperienced or has few flight hours. \u201cThe insurance companies study these statistics, know what leads to safer flying, and most importantly to them, have a vested interest in the pilot being properly trained and experienced in the aircraft before they take on the risk,\u201d said Stuart Fraenkel, a lawyer and associate adjunct professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.", "This lack of federal regulation can have a serious impact for victims.

She\u2019s the kind of creative person who was supposed to benefit when the Internet revolution collapsed old media hierarchies. But two decades since that revolution began, she\u2019s not impressed: \u201cWe are at risk of starving in the midst of plenty,\u201d Taylor writes. \u201cFree culture, like cheap food, incurs hidden costs.\u201d Instead of serving as the great equalizer, the web has created an abhorrent cultural feudalism. The creative masses connect, create and labor, while Google, Facebook and Amazon collect the cash.", "Taylor\u2019s thesis is simply stated. The pre-Internet cultural industry, populated mainly by exploitative conglomerates, was far from perfect, but at least the ancien r\u00e9gime felt some need to cultivate cultural institutions, and to pay for talent at all levels. Along came the web, which swept away hierarchies \u2014 as well as paychecks, leaving behind creators of all kinds only the chance to be fleetingly \u201cInternet famous.\u201d And anyhow, she says, the web never really threatened to overthrow the old media\u2019s upper echelons, whether defined as superstars, like Beyonc\u00e9, big broadcast television shows or Hollywood studios. Instead, it was the cultural industry\u2019s middle \u00adclasses that have been wiped out and replaced by new cultural plantations ruled over by the West Coast aggregators.", "It is hard to know if the title, \u201cThe People\u2019s Platform,\u201d is aspirational or sarcastic, since Taylor believes the classless aura of the web masks an unfair power structure. \u201cOpen systems can be starkly inegalitarian,\u201d she says, arguing that the web is afflicted by what the feminist scholar Jo Freeman termed a \u201ctyranny of structurelessness.\u201d Because there is supposedly no hierarchy, elites can happily deny their own existence. (\u201cWe just run a platform.\u201d) But the effects are real: The web has reduced professional creators to begging for scraps of attention from a spoiled public, and forced creators to be their own brand.", "Taylor\u2019s critique hits hard because she\u2019s not so easily dismissed as reactionary critics like Andrew Keen or Evgeny Morozov who tend to regard the web\u2019s cultural products as the juvenile doodlings of the undereducated. She accepts that there may be plenty of talent out there, but she thinks it\u2019s being exploited; she\u2019s seen what Clay Shirky called \u201cHere Comes Everybody,\u201d the Internet\u2019s promise of inclusivity and collaboration, and thinks it hasn\u2019t been good for anybody (except maybe online advertisers).", "Taylor subjects the \u201cInternet famous\u201d narrative to a particularly scathing critique. The story is familiar: An unknown artist self-produces a video, only to see it go viral and reach millions, gaining herself an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show. O.K., so then what? It\u2019s just back to serfdom (with exceptions, like E. L. James, author of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey,\u201d which began as \u201cTwilight\u201d fan fiction). In any event, the odds of going viral are comparable to winning the lottery, but the lottery, to its credit, actually pays out in cash. You might say virality is the promise that keeps the proletariat toiling in the cultural factories, instead of revolting and asking for something better.", "\u201cThe People\u2019s Platform\u201d has the flavor of a \u201cRoger & Me\u201d for the American cultural industries, and it will resonate with those in the creative classes who have seen their lives made harder by the web: writers of serious nonfiction, musicians, playwrights, novelists and investigative journalists. Combined, these make for a highly sympathetic class. But to the extent that Taylor condemns the web as generally bad for culture, the narrative is not free of complications. For one thing, her critique is far weaker for the part-timers, hobbyists and amateurs who use the web: The average Instagram user isn\u2019t exactly trying to make a career out of selfies and may not feel particularly exploited. The web, moreover, has created more than just cheaper versions of what came before \u2014 the core sites of Internet culture, say Awkward Family Photos (which collects same), are really just categories unto themselves. The uncomfortable fact that Taylor does not highlight is that it is non-careerists as much as aggregators who are doing the damage she describes.", "Absent also is the consumer qua consumer. Taylor believes we suffer from being pandered to by clickable content and a general erosion in the quality of content. But there\u2019s more to the Internet than listicles, and when we consider ourselves as just readers or viewers the stubborn fact is that it has never been cheaper or easier to get at good stuff. Netflix and YouTube are a bonanza for lovers of obscure television and film. And while many in publishing hate Amazon with a passion once reserved for television, no one can deny that readers can nowadays buy more books for less. A full accounting cannot ignore just how accessible culture has become.", "Leaving aside these complications, Taylor does force us to consider one big question: \u201cWhat do we lose if we let the middle go missing?\u201d She sees the solution in a movement toward \u201csustainable culture\u201d (which, as with organic food, would presumably mean paying more for things), along with more public support for the arts. As she points out, we\u2019ve taken to assuming that culture will just take care of itself, when that\u2019s never been the case.", "The tech industry might be tempted to dismiss Taylor\u2019s arguments as merely a version of typewriter manufacturers\u2019 complaints circa 1984, but that would be a mistake. \u201cThe People\u2019s Platform\u201d should be taken as a challenge by the new media that have long claimed to be improving on the old order. Can they prove they are capable of supporting a sustainable cultural ecosystem, in a way that goes beyond just hosting parties at the Sundance Film \u00adFestival?", "We see some of this in the tech firms that have begun to pay for original content, as with Netflix\u2019s investments in projects like \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d It\u2019s also worth pointing out that the support of culture is actually pretty cheap. Consider the nonprofit ProPublica, which employs investigative journalists, and has already won two Pulitzers, all on a budget of just over $10 million a year. That kind of money is a rounding error for much of Silicon Valley, where losing billions on bad acquisitions is routinely defended as \u201cstrategic.\u201d If Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon truly believe they\u2019re better than the old guard, let\u2019s see it.", "THE PEOPLE\u2019S PLATFORM\nTaking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age\nBy Astra Taylor\n276 pp. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $27."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/arts/poet-laureates-multiply-but-job-requirements-vary-widely.html": ["Literature, Ezra Pound once said, is news that stays news.

More than 200 Gazans have been killed, three-quarters of them civilians, according to United Nations officials; one Israeli has been killed. In any case, Israel\u2019s long-term interest lies in de-escalating, not moving to the ground war it now threatens.", "Remember that the trend had been away from Gaza rocket strikes. Last year, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry website, there were far fewer rocket strikes on Israel than in any year since Hamas took over Gaza in 2006. But then, since June, there were the kidnappings and killings, rockets and the kind of mutual escalation that arises when each side thinks that the other understands only violence.", "When missiles are flying, hard-liners on each side are ascendant. They purport to be defenders of their people, but, in fact, they\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated myopia and taken actions that ultimately created vulnerability and weakness.", "After all, it was Israel itself that helped nurture Hamas and its predecessors in the 1970s and \u201980s. The late Eyad El-Sarraj, a prominent psychiatrist in Gaza, warned Israel\u2019s governor that he was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by nurturing religious militants. According to the book \u201cHamas,\u201d by Beverley Milton-Edwards and Stephen Farrell, the governor replied: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we know how to handle things. Our enemy today is the P.L.O.\u201d", "Similar shortsightedness unfolded to the north. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 inadvertently helped lead to the rise of its enemy there, Hezbollah.", "Likewise, it was Hamas extremism and violence after the 2005 Gaza withdrawal that undermined Israeli moderates and led to the rise of the hard-liners who today are bombing Gaza. Israel helped create Hamas, and Hamas helped created today\u2019s Israel.", "The only way out in the long run is a two-state peace agreement. It\u2019s true that one is not achievable now, but the aim should be to take steps that make a peace deal possible in 10 years or 20 years.", "Israel could learn a lesson from Britain and Spain, both of which managed to defeat terrorist challenges that were once seen as insoluble. The analogy is imperfect, for rockets weren\u2019t falling on London or Madrid. But Spain could have sent troops to quash Basque terrorists, and Britain could have bulldozed the offices of the I.R.A.\u2019s political wing in Belfast.", "Instead, Spain gave autonomy to the Basque Country and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher negotiated an agreement in 1985 that was criticized at the time for rewarding terrorists. This was painful and controversial, and it was by no means an instant success. Thatcher said in her memoir that the results were \u201cdisappointing.\u201d Eventually, this approach proved transformative.", "Today, in Middle Eastern terms, the analog would be a minimalist response, not a maximalist one. It would be a halt to settlements, cooperation to bolster Mahmoud Abbas and other moderate Palestinians, and an easing of the economic chokehold on Gaza to strengthen businesses there as a check on Hamas.", "None of this is easy or certain. Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s admirable but failed peace initiative suggests that mutual distrust is so great that it may take years to lay the groundwork, so let\u2019s get started.", "When the families of a murdered Palestinian and a murdered Jew each call for humanity toward the other, it\u2019s easy to dismiss the plea as na\u00efve, inconsistent with harsh realities on the ground. But what we\u2019ve actually seen for decades is that aggression on one side boomerangs and leads to aggression on the other.", "In contrast, what has worked \u2014 albeit not very well and not very quickly, and in different circumstances \u2014 is the Spanish and British approaches of tough-minded conciliation and restraint to change the political landscape. That\u2019s the approach that empowers not the hawks, but rather the Fraenkels and the Abu Khdeirs, so that an impossible peace eventually becomes possible."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/technology/microsofts-top-lawyer-is-the-tech-worlds-envoy.html": ["REDMOND, Wash. \u2014 Bradford L.

Germans were already furious about revelations that Americans spied on the country\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel. And unless the ruling was reversed, one official told Mr. Smith, the German government would never rely on an American company like Microsoft to store its data in the cloud.", "After his conversations about the case in Germany, Microsoft subsequently challenged the judge\u2019s ruling in court, the first time an American company is believed to have fought back against a domestic warrant for data held overseas. A hearing on the case is planned for July 31.", "Such are the decisions regularly faced by Mr. Smith, 55, who has become the elder statesman of Microsoft and a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large. As Microsoft\u2019s chief representative on public policy matters, including privacy \u2014 an issue under close scrutiny around the world \u2014 Mr. Smith plays a significant role in many of the most critical decisions affecting the company\u2019s fortunes.", "Mr. Smith said he told the German official about the case: \u201cWe\u2019ve taken this on with a complete commitment to persevere and to do everything we can appropriately to win.\u201d", "The promise to the German officials carried weight. Mr. Smith is one of the most influential voices inside Microsoft, partly because he has been in his job since 2002, which makes him the longest serving member of the senior leadership team.", "His influence has only increased in recent years while Microsoft has churned through top executives and made other major changes, all in an effort to keep pace with competitors in the marketplace. Last week, in another major change, Microsoft said it planned to eliminate up to 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its total work force, over the next 12 months in an effort to thin out layers of bureaucracy at the company and move more quickly.", "But Mr. Smith\u2019s weight extends to the wider tech industry as well, partly because of his understanding of Washington. Mr. Smith worked for years as a lawyer there before moving to Microsoft\u2019s headquarters here outside Seattle. While much of the tech industry looks upon government with a strong sense of skepticism, if not disdain, he has cultivated relationships there for years.", "\u201cHe brings a much more Washington sensibility to the West Coast than many of his peers,\u201d said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former State Department official who now runs the New America Foundation and attended Princeton University with Mr. Smith. \u201cHe recognizes the necessity of government engagement. Government is not just an entity for favors. It has to be part of the solution.\u201d", "Mr. Smith\u2019s political skills have led to some speculation that he will pursue elected office. For now, though, he is putting those skills to use for Microsoft and the technology industry, particularly after the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden of government efforts to collect private data from online services operated by Microsoft, Google and others without search warrants and subpoenas. The leaks shook executives throughout the industry, many of whom worry about damage to the appeal of their products.", "Last year, Mr. Smith equated government snooping with other serious threats like malware and cyberattacks, and he also led an industry push for changes in how the government collects data.", "\u201cPeople won\u2019t use technology they don\u2019t trust, and we need to take the kinds of steps to sustain that trust,\u201d he said in an interview last week.", "An earlier policy issue facing Microsoft suggests how Mr. Smith likes to handle problems with pragmatism. When he interviewed for the general counsel job in 2001 with Bill Gates and other senior leaders of the company, Microsoft was facing a litany of penalties in its antitrust battle with the Justice Department, narrowly avoiding a government-ordered breakup of the company.", "But a new wave of antitrust battles in Europe and from private companies loomed. During his interview, Mr. Smith showed the executives a single slide declaring that Microsoft needed to make peace with its foes.", "At the time, Microsoft was widely seen as a bully. People who know Mr. Smith said that changing the company\u2019s legal stance in the antitrust case, as well as later legal stances the company has taken, helped soften the company\u2019s public image. Microsoft\u2019s repeated stumbles with important products have also made the company seem less fearsome.", "After the Snowden disclosures, Mr. Smith pursued an industrywide effort to limit the damage. In July of last year, Mr. Smith picked up the phone and called his counterpart at Google, Kent Walker, to explore whether the companies could gain strength by working together on a settlement with the government on data collection.", "The overture was remarkable considering Microsoft and Google are ferocious business competitors, and Microsoft has denounced Google\u2019s privacy practices through its \u201cScroogled\u201d advertising campaign. But the two companies put aside their hostilities and, in January, they and other technology companies reached a deal with the Obama administration. Leslie Miller, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment.", "\u201cKent and I talk frequently,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re on the same side, sometimes we\u2019re on opposite sides.\u201d", "And in the fall of 2013, Mr. Smith and Erika Rottenberg, the general counsel of LinkedIn, the social media company, organized a meeting of general counsels from a half dozen or so major technology companies to talk about further unifying their efforts to press for government change.

In March, a legal filing in a criminal case against a former Microsoft employee revealed that Microsoft snooped on the email and instant messaging accounts of a French blogger. The spying into the Microsoft-operated services was part of an internal investigation into leaks by the former employee, who received a three-month prison sentence.", "Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, said his view of Microsoft\u2019s actions on privacy was \u201cmostly favorable.\u201d While he criticized Microsoft\u2019s snooping, he commended Mr. Smith for quickly vowing to hand off similar cases to law enforcement officials in the future.", "Mr. Smith has experienced disappointments in his job.

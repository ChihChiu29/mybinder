It\u2019s a trademark shtick that happens to carry a whiff of the authentic, given Mr. Batiste\u2019s lifelong familiarity with New Orleans second-line parades. Naturally, it was one of the factors that led to his role as bandleader on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d which makes its debut on CBS on Tuesday.", "Mr. Batiste, 28, has a lanky frame, a dandyish flair and a breezy disregard for genre pieties. It\u2019s easy to picture him acclimating fast to a late-night talk show, even if the stubborn constraints of the format seem at odds with his brand of free-range spontaneity. The \u201clove riot\u201d \u2014 his favored term for a flash-mob-style street jam, which he facilitates through social media \u2014 is only the most literal manifestation of his drive to connect viscerally with an audience, winning over many startled listeners on the move, and at close range.", "This summer he and his band, Stay Human, played the Newport Folk Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival, on consecutive weekends at Fort Adams State Park in Rhode Island. Each of their afternoon sets ended, inevitably, with a pied-piper ramble into the throng. Both sets included Mr. Batiste\u2019s jubilant take on \u201cIf You\u2019re Happy and You Know It\u201d \u2014 ammunition for any killjoys inclined to distrust the earnest, infantilizing aspects of his style.", "But Mr. Batiste also tailored his message and band lineup for the two festival constituencies, demonstrating a sharp attunement to context that will be crucial in his new gig. \u201cThere\u2019s a reinvention of the role happening in many of the late-night shows right now,\u201d he said after his jazz festival set, referring to a wave of turnover that has made bandleaders out of the comedians Fred Armisen (\u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d) and Reggie Watts (\u201cThe Late Late Show With James Corden\u201d), and a household name out of the Roots, his direct competition on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon.", "Mr. Batiste, sitting on a couch in Fort Adams with his principal bandmates, the alto saxophonist Eddie Barbash and the drummer Joe Saylor, continued: \u201cWhat that means is, there\u2019s an opportunity for innovation.

He was 8 when he played his first gigs, as a percussionist, with the Batiste Brothers Band. After switching to piano, he was mentored by a distant cousin, the clarinetist Alvin Batiste. He moved to New York to attend Juilliard, and was soon turning up on concert stages with the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, which is how I first encountered him, about a decade ago.", "Mr. Marsalis is, famously, another scion of a musical family in Kenner; his father, the pianist Ellis Marsalis, was another of Mr. Batiste\u2019s teachers in New Orleans.

Still, Mr. Batiste clarified, \u201cI\u2019m not out to be an ambassador for an art form, because ultimately I feel like your playing does that.\u201d His stated cause is \u201csocial music,\u201d a phrase meant to encompass jazz and much else besides, and the title of his most recent album, released on Razor & Tie in 2013.", "It\u2019s instructive to compare Mr. Batiste to another proud product of Kenner \u2014 the saxophonist Branford Marsalis, Wynton\u2019s older brother, who served as the first bandleader on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jay Leno. He lasted just three years in that role, never shaking the impression that his rapport with Mr. Leno felt grudging and strained.", "Mr. Batiste has a leg up in that regard: He fell into brisk comic rhythm with Mr. Colbert last summer, during an interview on \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d The exchange, which pivoted on the subject of improvisation, left a strong impression.", "\u201cAs soon as that interview was over,\u201d Mr. Colbert said recently on \u201cThe Late Show Podcast,\u201d \u201cI went, \u2018Damn, I think that\u2019s a guy I could actually spend a few years onstage with.\u2019 \u201d (It didn\u2019t hurt that Mr. Batiste also staged a love riot, leading Mr. Colbert and his audience outside the studio.)", "One recent hallmark of the late-night landscape is the quirky bit designed to go viral; the Roots, a hip-hop group known for high-minded sociopolitical fury, have made this such a core feature of Mr. Fallon\u2019s show that it\u2019s easy to forget how shrewdly it plays against type. Questlove, the drummer and self-declared music geek who leads the Roots, manages to balance frivolity and substance, a strategy even more ideally suited to Mr. Batiste.", "By way of example: In 2011, as he was finishing his master\u2019s degree in jazz studies at Juilliard, Mr. Batiste self-released a live EP, \u201cMy N.Y.,\u201d recorded entirely on moving subway cars.

For now, though, I found a less novel, but far handier feature in the new iPhone \u2014 one that has long been the butt of jokes but is now becoming a necessary part of modern computing.", "You may have heard of it: It\u2019s called Siri, and together with voice-control initiatives from Google, Amazon, Microsoft and several start-ups, it is poised to change the way we think of computers.", "As David Pierce wrote recently in Wired, voice recognition and artificial intelligence are getting so good so quickly that it isn\u2019t really a stretch to imagine that talking to computers will soon become one of the signature ways we interact with them. The new Siri is paving the way to what you might call \u201cambient computing\u201d \u2014 a future in which robotic assistants are always on hand to answer questions, take notes, take orders or otherwise function as auxiliary brains to whom you might offload many of your chores.", "Picture the \u201cStar Trek\u201d computer, but instead of powering a starship, it\u2019s turning off the basement lights, finding you a good movie on Netflix and, after listening in on a fight between you and your spouse, reminding you to buy flowers the next day. It will be slightly creepy and completely helpful \u2014 and it\u2019s coming faster than you think.", "There is one key improvement to Siri in the iPhone 6s that suggests these grand possibilities. Rather than having to reach for your phone, you can now activate Siri by yelling at it from a few feet away. \u201cHey, Siri!\u201d you bellow, and the robotic assistant springs to life. This is not groundbreaking; hands-free voice control has been around in competing smartphones at least since Motorola introduced it in 2013, and several phone makers have adopted it since. Hands-free Siri is also available on older iPhones when the phone is plugged into its charger, because constantly listening for \u201cHey, Siri\u201d consumes battery power. (The iPhone 6s, however, reduces the drain on the battery through hardware changes.)", "But \u201cHey, Siri\u201d is not the only improvement. In iOS 9, Apple\u2019s new mobile operating system, Siri also has more powers to connect to deeper parts of your phone. It can control devices compatible with Apple\u2019s home-automation system, called HomeKit \u2014 you can tell it to turn down the lights, for example. Siri also controls Apple Music, the company\u2019s new streaming service. In the car, say, \u201cHey, Siri, play Dylan,\u201d and up comes \u201cSubterranean Homesick Blues.\u201d", "Then there\u2019s the ubiquity of voice-control devices. Besides the phone, Apple has put Siri in its watch and its coming Apple TV set-top box. Amazon has it on the Echo, a voice-controlled computer that is constantly listening and ready to help you out, and also in its TV streaming devices. Google and Microsoft also have embedded voice in phones, computers and TV devices.", "A host of start-ups are entering the game, too. One, called SoundHound, offers a taste of the possibilities of talking to machines: Rather than going through several sites to make a hotel reservation, you can ask, \u201cFind me a three- or four-star hotel in New York next Friday for less than $300,\u201d and off it goes.", "The ubiquity of voice-controlled assistants changes the way we interact with them. When Siri and other voice systems were new, they seemed gimmicky. Nobody quite knew what to do with them, and interactions veered toward the awkward. But the more assistants there are, and the more you use them, the more natural they feel \u2014 and that means the more you\u2019ll use them, feeding the cycle.", "I\u2019ve felt this happen most impressively with Amazon\u2019s Echo, a machine that one addresses with the keyword \u201cAlexa,\u201d and which I keep in my kitchen, the place I most often need a hands-free device. In my early days with the Echo, I didn\u2019t quite know what to use it for, and when it got something wrong, I tended to penalize the device for its shortcomings.", "But the more I stuck with the Echo, the better I understood its capabilities. Now I consult the Echo several times a day for the weather, to set timers, to do quick kitchen math and to play music or audiobooks. It\u2019s become one of the most useful gadgets I own. (And the voice-recognition hardware in the Echo is more powerful than that of the iPhone \u2014 Alexa can hear me from far across the room, while with the iPhone 6s, \u201cHey, Siri\u201d stopped working beyond about five feet.)", "The coming pervasiveness of voice-controlled machines will not occur without some social anxiety. There will be conventions to work out \u2014 is it O.K. to call out \u201cHey, Siri!\u201d on a bus? Probably not soon, but in time, that may happen; you\u2019ll cringe, and then it could become normal. (The new iPhone tries to learn your voice to prevent other people from activating your device.)", "There will be questions of privacy, too. To start up when they hear certain keywords, systems like \u201cHey, Siri\u201d have to constantly listen to their surroundings. Apple says Siri is watching for a pattern, not recording or storing any data.", "But you can imagine that actually analyzing all of your speech can\u2019t be far off, because it would make voice assistants more useful.

It\u2019s easy to see how such machines would become useful. After all, why should I have to ask my computer to do something \u2014 if it\u2019s listening, shouldn\u2019t it just notice that I told my wife we\u2019re out of bread and add it to the grocery list? If I tell my 5-year-old that he has three minutes to brush his teeth or else, shouldn\u2019t the computer set a timer and remind the distracted child that he might end up going to bed without a story?", "Indeed, a version of this voice-enabled disciplinarian made an appearance last season on \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d I found it dystopian, sure, but also kind of wonderful. Parenting is a slog; why wouldn\u2019t I want a computer to occasionally step in and have my back?", "That\u2019s how it begins, of course. Then, over time, as we allow these assistants to listen in to more of our lives, they\u2019ll start to use the data in unforeseen ways \u2014 to be more helpful, but also to get to know you better to better make a profit from your relationship.", "These are big worries. You don\u2019t have to really think about them with the new iPhone, which isn\u2019t doing anything nefarious with its audio assistant.

In the 18 months since leaving the military, he had grown long hair and a bushy mustache. It was 2012. He was working part time in a store selling baseball caps and going to community college while living with his parents in the suburbs of Phoenix. He rarely mentioned the war to friends and family, and he never mentioned his nightmares.", "He thought he was getting used to suicides in his old infantry unit, but the latest one had hit him like a brick: Joshua Markel, a mentor from his fire team, who had seemed unshakable. In Afghanistan, Corporal Markel volunteered for extra patrols and joked during firefights. Back home Mr. Markel appeared solid: a job with a sheriff\u2019s office, a new truck, a wife and time to hunt deer with his father. But that week, while watching football on TV with friends, he had wordlessly gone into his room, picked up a pistol and killed himself. He was 25.", "Still reeling from the news, Mr. Bojorquez surveyed the old baseball posters on the walls of his childhood bedroom and the sun-bleached body armor hanging on his bedpost. Then he took a long pull from the bottle.", "\u201cIf he couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d he recalled thinking to himself, \u201cwhat chance do I have?\u201d", "He pressed the loaded pistol to his brow and pulled the trigger.", "Mr. Bojorquez, 27, served in one of the hardest hit military units in Afghanistan, the Second Battalion, Seventh Marine Regiment. In 2008, the 2/7 deployed to a wild swath of Helmand Province. Well beyond reliable supply lines, the battalion regularly ran low on water and ammunition while coming under fire almost daily. During eight months of combat, the unit killed hundreds of enemy fighters and suffered more casualties than any other Marine battalion that year.", "When its members returned, most left the military and melted back into the civilian landscape. They had families and played softball, taught high school and attended Ivy League universities. But many also struggled, unable to find solace. And for some, the agonies of war never ended.", "Almost seven years after the deployment, suicide is spreading through the old unit like a virus. Of about 1,200 Marines who deployed with the 2/7 in 2008, at least 13 have killed themselves, two while on active duty, the rest after they left the military. The resulting suicide rate for the group is nearly four times the rate for young male veterans as a whole and 14 times that for all Americans.", "The deaths started a few months after the Marines returned from the war in Afghanistan. A corporal put on his dress uniform and shot himself in his driveway. A former sergeant shot himself in front of his girlfriend and mother. An ex-sniper who pushed others to seek help for post-traumatic stress disorder shot himself while alone in his apartment.", "The problem has grown over time. More men from the battalion killed themselves in 2014 \u2014 four \u2014 than in any previous year. Veterans of the unit, tightly connected by social media, sometimes learn of the deaths nearly as soon as they happen. In November, a 2/7 veteran of three combat tours posted a photo of his pistol on Snapchat with a note saying, \u201cI miss you all.\u201d Minutes later, he killed himself.", "The most recent suicide was in May, when Eduardo Bojorquez, no relation to Manny, overdosed on pills in his car. Men from the battalion converged from all over the country for his funeral in Las Vegas, filing silently past the grave, tossing roses that thumped on the plain metal coffin like drum beats.", "\u201cWhen the suicides started, I felt angry,\u201d Matt Havniear, a onetime lance corporal who carried a rocket launcher in the war, said in a phone interview from Oregon. \u201cThe next few, I would just be confused and sad. Then at about the 10th, I started feeling as if it was inevitable \u2014 that it is going to get us all and there is nothing we could do to stop it.\u201d", "For years leaders at the top levels of the government have acknowledged the high suicide rate among veterans and spent heavily to try to reduce it. But the suicides have continued, and basic questions about who is most at risk and how best to help them are still largely unanswered. The authorities are not even aware of the spike in suicides in the 2/7; suicide experts at the Department of Veterans Affairs said they did not track suicide trends among veterans of specific military units. And the Marine Corps does not track suicides of former service members.", "Feeling abandoned, members of the battalion have turned to a survival strategy they learned at war: depending on one another. Doing what the government has not, they have used free software and social media to create a quick-response system that allows them to track, monitor and intervene with some of their most troubled comrades.", "Their system has made a few saves, but many in the battalion still feel stalked by suicide.", "\u201cTo this day I\u2019m scared of it,\u201d said Ruben Sevilla, 28, who deployed twice with the 2/7 and now works for a warehouse management company called Legacy SCS near Chicago. \u201cIf all these guys can do that, what\u2019s stopping me?

At least two had been shot by snipers and one was hit by a grenade in Iraq, but they were redeployed to Afghanistan anyway. All three later killed themselves.", "The I.E.D.s, or improvised explosive devices, plagued patrols. The first convoy arriving in Sangin hit two. In the next two weeks, an I.E.D. hidden in a bicycle killed a medic, an I.E.D. packed in a culvert killed three Marines in a Humvee, and an I.E.D. discovered in a dirt lane killed a specialist trained to defuse the explosives.", "Manny Bojorquez spent the tour in a village called Musa Qala, where repeated offensives failed to drive out the Taliban.", "One evening his squad was patrolling single file across a field when the enemy ambushed it on two sides. As the squad sprinted for cover, Mr. Bojorquez watched a bullet hit a Marine in front of him, who crumpled to the dirt. Mr. Bojorquez and another Marine grabbed the bleeding man and dragged him to a ditch.", "Pressed against the ground, readying his machine gun, Mr. Bojorquez looked over and saw his teammate Corporal Markel laying down fire \u2014 with a steady grin on his face. Together they showered the surrounding fields and houses with bullets, providing cover for a medic. But the enemy pressed harder, another Marine was hit and the outnumbered squad had to pick up and run.", "\u201cIt\u2019s funny. I was never scared. You just act. But it stuck with me,\u201d Mr. Bojorquez said.", "By the end of the deployment, 20 Marines in the battalion had been killed and 140 had been wounded. Many lost limbs. Some were badly burned; others were so battered by blasts that they can scarcely function day to day.", "Others returned unscathed, but unable to fall in with civilian life. Members of the battalion say what they brought home from combat is more complex than just PTSD. Many regret things they did \u2014 or failed to do. Some feel betrayed that the deep sacrifices made in combat seem to have achieved little. Others cannot reconcile the stark intensity of war with home\u2019s mannered expectations, leaving them alienated among family and friends. It is not just symptoms like sleeplessness or flashbacks, but an injury to their sense of self.", "\u201cSomething happens over there,\u201d said Mr. Havniear, whose best friend from the battalion tried suicide by cutting his wrists after returning home, but survived. \u201cYou wake up a primal part of your brain you are not supposed to listen to, and it becomes a part of you. I shot an old woman. I shot her on purpose because she was running at us with an RPG. You see someone blown in half, or you carry a foot. You can try, but it is hard to get away from that.\u201d", "After Mr. Bojorquez returned home, he started having a recurring nightmare. He was patrolling with his squad when bomb blasts killed everyone but him. As the dust cleared, he looked up to see enemy fighters surging forward. He often sat up in bed, thinking he was choking on his own blood.", "Beginning in 2005, suicide rates among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans started to climb sharply, and the military and Veterans Affairs created a number of programs to fight the problem. Despite spending hundreds of millions on research, the department and the military still know little about how combat experience affects suicide risk, according to suicide researchers focused on the military.", "Many recent studies have focused on whether deployment was a risk factor for suicide, and found that it was not.", "The results appeared to show something paradoxical: Those deployed to war were actually less likely to commit suicide. But critics of the studies say most people deployed in war zones do not face enemy fire. The risk for true combat veterans is hidden in the larger results, and has never been properly examined, they assert.", "\u201cThey may have 10 times the risk, they may have 100 times, and we don\u2019t know, because no one has looked,\u201d said Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "The men of the 2/7 overwhelmingly see a tie between combat and their suicide problem. Not only were all of the men who committed suicide young infantrymen who struggled with experiences of killing and loss, they say, but it is possible to trace one traumatic moment forward and see how those involved are now struggling.", "Noel Guerrero and Manny Bojorquez were best friends in the battalion. As two Mexican-Americans from the Southwest, they bonded in infantry school over a love of Mexican hot sauce. In Afghanistan, they would share bottles sent from home.", "On one mission, Mr. Guerrero, then a 20-year-old lance corporal, was a machine-gunner atop a truck at the lead of a supply convoy. He said he was good at finding I.E.D.s and over six months had spotted almost a dozen that the battalion was able to avoid. But one day, the truck hit a big one, and the explosion flung him against his gun turret.", "Mr. Guerrero crawled from the smoking vehicle, his head spinning. He watched his sergeant\u2019s Humvee roll in to help. Then suddenly, another blast swallowed the sergeant\u2019s truck in smoke. The truck shot up 10 feet and came down with a crash, falling to its side. Then, chaos. The driver was trapped and screaming, with his arm caught under the wreckage. A medic in the back was pinned by a seat crushed against the truck\u2019s ceiling. The sergeant was dead.", "Before Mr. Guerrero could get to his feet to help, enemy fire started thudding into the ground around him. He spotted his machine gun in the dirt, where it had landed after being blown out of the truck, and with his vision still blurred, he began to return fire.", "Two other Marines, Cpl. Jastin Pak and Lance Cpl. Tanner Cleveland, scrambled into the wreckage. Mr. Pak crouched over the driver, shielding him until a line of Marines could lift the truck enough to free his arm. Mr. Pak and Mr. Cleveland emerged covered with blood, clutching the wounded, then went back for the remains of the sergeant. The platoon was out of body bags, so they stuffed the sergeant\u2019s remains into a sleeping bag.", "When it was all over, Mr. Guerrero picked up a cigarette that had been blown out of one of the trucks and lit it. After he exhaled, he noticed it was spotted with blood. He smoked it anyway.", "Since that day, Mr. Guerrero has blamed himself for the ordeal and has tried to kill himself three times. Mr. Cleveland, 26, of Chicago, also tried suicide, and Mr. Pak, of Oceanside, Calif., hanged himself in November.", "\u201cYou come back and try to be a normal kid, but there is always a shadow on you, a dark shadow you can never take away,\u201d Mr. Guerrero, now 28, said in an interview at his home in San Diego.", "\u201cNow, when I meet someone, I already know what they look like dead.

Four months after they returned, in the spring of 2009, he put on his dress uniform after an argument with his girlfriend and shot himself in his driveway.", "In December 2009, Pfc. Christopher G. Stewart hanged himself from a door in his barracks.", "In April 2010, Shawn Jensen, a sergeant who had just gotten out of the Marines and moved home to rural Washington State to work in construction, shot himself during an argument with his girlfriend and mother.", "The Marines tended to chalk up these first suicides to foolish impulses or prewar problems. Then came the death that shook the battalion, and prompted many to ask whether something was wrong not just with the men who killed themselves, but with them all.", "Cpl. Clay Hunt had been a sniper in the battalion. After he got out of the Marine Corps in 2009 after his second tour, his disenchantment with the war grew, and he sought treatment from Veterans Affairs for depression and PTSD.", "He became an outspoken advocate for young veterans, speaking openly about his problems and lobbying for better care for veterans on Capitol Hill. In 2010, he was featured in a public service message urging veterans to seek support from their comrades.", "At the same time, Mr. Hunt was fighting to get adequate care at the V.A., encountering long delays and inconsistent treatment, according to his mother, Susan Selke of Houston.", "Friends said Mr. Hunt had felt directionless. \u201cThere is so much isolation and lack of purpose.

Some more than others.\u201d", "No one knows whether the battalion\u2019s suicide rate is abnormally high or a common trait of fighting units hit hard by combat, because no one monitors troops over time. In an era of Big Data, when algorithms can predict human patterns in startling detail, suicide data for veterans is incomplete and years old by the time it is available. The most recent data is from 2011.", "The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Pentagon say they have introduced a new system, called the Suicide Data Repository, that is faster and more complete.", "But Dr. Harold Kudler, chief mental health consultant to the department, said the military and V.A. did not share information that could allow the monitoring of combat units over time.", "\u201cMight that be a good idea?

But he gave up on treatment at the V.A. and turned to alcohol, painkillers and eventually heroin, according to his former girlfriend, Allison Keefer. After the suicide of a friend from the battalion, Jeremie Ross, in July 2012, he quit work and slipped into a deep depression.", "At the funeral, Mr. Bojorquez stood with the others from the 2/7 as they shook their heads and discussed what to do. A battle-hardened former corporal named Travis Wilkerson spoke up.", "Once a fearsome team leader in a deadly sector of Sangin, he was now working as a night manager at a sandwich shop.

Realizing he was only wounded, he went into a bathroom in his home and shot himself again.", "As the news rocketed across Facebook the next day, Mr. Cleveland, who had tried suicide, thought, \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now where it\u2019s like, \u2018Who is next?\u2019 \u201d", "It was the friend who had helped Mr. Cleveland pull body parts from a smoldering Humvee in Afghanistan, Jastin Pak.

It asked him to list events from combat that were causing him anguish. He filled two pages, starting with the killing of an older man in Iraq who had been unarmed and finishing with placing the remains of the dead sergeant into a sleeping bag.", "After the eighth suicide in the battalion, in 2013, Mr. Bojorquez decided he needed professional help and made an appointment at the veterans hospital in Phoenix.", "He sat down with a therapist, a young woman.

He should treat it, he recalled her saying, \u201clike a bad breakup with a girl.\u201d", "The comment caught him like a hook. Guys he knew had been blown to pieces and burned to death. One came home with shrapnel in his face from a friend\u2019s skull. Now they were killing themselves at an alarming rate. And the therapist wanted him to get over it like a breakup?", "Mr. Bojorquez shot out of his seat and began yelling. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you just get over.\u201d", "He had tried getting help at the V.A. once before, right after Mr. Markel\u2019s funeral, and had walked out when he realized the counselor had not read his file. Now he was angry that he had returned. With each visit, it appeared to him that the professionals trained to make sense of what he was feeling understood it less than he did.", "He threw a chair across the room and stomped out, vowing again never to go back to the V.A.", "In recent years, suicide prevention efforts by the Department of Veterans Affairs have focused on encouraging veterans to go to its hospitals for help, but a bigger problem could be keeping them there.", "In interviews, many Marines from the battalion said they received effective care at the V.A.

A smaller study from the same year found about 90 percent dropped out of therapy.", "The therapies, considered by the department to be the gold standard of evidence-based treatments, rely on having patients repeatedly revisit traumatic memories \u2014 remembrances that seem to cause many to quit. Evaluations of the effectiveness of the programs often do not account for the large number of patients who find the process disturbing and drop out.", "Dr. Kudler of the Department of Veterans Affairs said data showed that 28 percent of patients drop out of PTSD therapy, but that most veterans stay in treatment and report improvements.", "He added that dropout is an issue in all mental health care, not just among veterans, and that the department was constantly trying to provide alternative types of therapy, like meditation.", "Craig J. Bryan, a psychologist and an Iraq war veteran, said that \u201cthe V.A. has done more to try to prevent suicide than anyone has done in the history of the human race.\u201d Mr. Bryan, who runs the National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah, added: \u201cBut most veterans who kill themselves do not go to treatment or give up. They are not interested. That is the challenge.\u201d", "Mr. Bojorquez tried the system one more time out of desperation. After the spate of suicides in 2014, he called and said he needed help. The V.A. had him see a psychologist and psychiatrist.", "He told them that he wanted therapy but no drugs. Too many friends had stories of bad reactions. One, Luis Rocha, had taken a photograph of all his pill bottles right before shooting himself.", "\u201cWe get it, no drugs,\u201d he recalled them saying. But on his way out, after scheduling a return appointment in two months, he was handed a bag filled with bottles of pills. He calmly walked to his car, then screamed and pounded the steering wheel.", "He wanted to get better, so he started taking the medications \u2014 an antidepressant, an anti-anxiety drug and a drug to help him sleep \u2014 but they made him feel worse, he said. His nightmares grew more vivid, his urge to kill himself more urgent.", "After a few weeks, he flushed the pills down the toilet, determined to deal with his problems on his own.", "Increasingly, members of the battalion felt that at home, as in Afghanistan, they were still the Forgotten Battalion. So they looked for help from the people they counted on in Afghanistan: their fellow Marines.", "In November, Mr. Branch, who was completing a degree in social work in Texas, posted a request on Facebook asking the others to enter their addresses in a Google spreadsheet. That way, if a Marine in Montana was worried about a friend in Georgia, he could look on the spreadsheet and find someone nearby to help.", "\u201cAll of us are going through the same struggle,\u201d Mr. Branch, now 28, said in an interview. \u201cIf we can get someone there that a guy can relate to, we hope it will make all the difference.\u201d", "The spreadsheet is part of a wider realization among young veterans that connecting with other veterans \u2014 whether through volunteering, sports, art or other shared experiences \u2014 can be potent medicine.", "One battalion member started an organic farm intended to help veterans heal by growing food. Another leads trips to bring together veterans with PTSD. Mr. Wood, 32, the former sniper, founded a national network of veterans, called Team Rubicon, that provides volunteer relief work after natural disasters.", "\u201cWe did it because we really wanted to help others,\u201d said Mr. Wood, of Los Angeles. \u201cWe soon realized it would help us, too.\u201d", "Less than two weeks after the Google spreadsheet was created, a text message popped up on the phone of a Marine veteran named Geoff Kamp. It was just after 11 p.m. on a Wednesday in November.", "Mr. Kamp, who had turned in early to be up for his shift with the Postal Service, reached for the phone next to his bed, read the text, turned to his wife and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while.\u201d", "An hour earlier, a 27-year-old Marine veteran, Charles Gerard, had changed his Facebook profile photo to an image of a rifle stuck in the dirt, topped with a helmet \u2014 the symbol of someone killed in action. In a post, he wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d", "After surviving an ambush in Afghanistan where several Marines were injured, Mr. Gerard said, he was treated for PTSD by the Marine Corps. But when his enlistment ended in 2011, so did his therapy. He tried to continue at the V.A., but long delays meant it was two years before he got any treatment, and even then, he said, he found it ineffective.", "He moved back to rural Indiana and worked at factories, but his anger frayed ties with his friends and family. News that comrades from the battalion had killed themselves pushed him deeper into despair. The night he changed his profile picture, his girlfriend had left him.", "Within minutes, the battalion\u2019s response system kicked in. Mr. Havniear in Oregon spotted the Facebook post and called a Marine in Utah who had been Mr. Gerard\u2019s roommate. They called Mr. Gerard immediately but got no answer. Mr. Gerard was parked in his pickup by a lake outside of town with a hunting rifle in his lap.", "Desperate to head off another death, they opened the Google spreadsheet and found Mr. Kamp, 90 minutes away. Within 10 minutes, he was in his truck, speeding north through the late autumn corn stubble.", "Mr. Kamp had never met Mr. Gerard. But he, too, had been injured in a firefight, and been dogged by guilt and anger afterward.", "\u201cEvery one of the guys that\u2019s died, I see myself in them,\u201d he said later in an interview at his home. \u201cIt\u2019s like you are always just one bad day away from that being you.\u201d", "At the lake, Mr. Gerard propped his rifle against his head, closed his eyes and pulled the trigger. There was a click, then nothing.", "He took a deep breath and checked the chamber. It was loaded, but the round was a dud.", "He decided the universe was telling him it was not his time to die. He tossed his remaining ammunition in the lake and drove home.", "A few minutes later, Mr. Kamp knocked on the door.", "They talked on the couch most of the night about relationships, work, mortgages, combat, guys who did not make it home and the cold feeling after Afghanistan that you are alone even when surrounded by other people.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll make it through this,\u201d Mr. Kamp told him.", "Mr. Kamp eventually called the sheriff\u2019s office for help, took the rifle for safekeeping and stayed until paramedics took Mr. Gerard to the veterans hospital in Indianapolis.", "In March, members of the group used their informal network to intervene with another battalion member in Louisiana. The jury-rigged system is far from ideal, they said, but they are determined to make it work.", "Mr. Gerard\u2019s experience shows, however, that the system is only as good as the V.A. treatment it is intended to connect to. The night he went to the psychiatric ward at the Indianapolis veterans hospital, he said, he waited and waited for a doctor to see him. After 24 hours, he gave up and checked himself out.", "\u201cThere was no one there for me,\u201d Mr. Gerard said in a quiet voice during a recent interview at his home after a 12-hour night shift at an auto plant.", "He looked pale and gaunt, a far cry from the tan and muscular Marine in photos from Afghanistan. Garbage and unwashed dishes were piled up around him. The curtains were drawn.", "He crushed out a cigarette. The V.A.? \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing to do with them since,\u201d he said.", "After swearing off the V.A., Manny Bojorquez turned increasingly to friends for support. Late-night calls and texts with guys from the battalion seemed to help more than therapy ever did.", "He reconnected with Mr. Guerrero, who still shared his love of Mexican hot sauce. The machine-gunner was living in California, in his last year of college, and he had a baby boy.", "\u201cThe guys we served with, they are the only ones we can really talk to,\u201d Mr. Bojorquez said in an interview.", "But in November, Mr. Bojorquez got a text from Mr. Guerrero that upended everything. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this life anymore,\u201d it said.", "Mr. Guerrero had never mentioned it to others, but he still believed his sergeant\u2019s death was his fault. If only he had yelled a warning. Or spotted the I.E.D. He was getting therapy and medication for his depression, but still often woke up with a deep dread, as if he were sitting at the principal\u2019s office, waiting to be punished. Every day, he wore a bracelet etched with the sergeant\u2019s name.", "That night, Mr. Guerrero had been watching television with his wife after church when something snapped. He crumpled to the floor and backed into a corner, crying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d", "He had not smoked since the Marines, but pleaded with his wife to go out and buy cigarettes. The panic and guilt were so excruciating that he decided the only relief was to kill himself. He went onto his porch with shaking hands to text Mr. Bojorquez to say goodbye.", "Mr. Bojorquez called immediately. Mr. Guerrero picked up, sobbing, but after a few words hung up.", "A fear had crept over Mr. Bojorquez over the last year that he was doomed to watch his friends die one after another until he was the only one left. At times, he saw it as another reason to kill himself. But it was also motivation to break the pattern.", "He knew he had to call 911, but hesitated. The call might land Mr. Guerrero in a psychiatric ward or ruin his marriage, already strained. Worse, if the police barged in, his friend might go berserk. Someone could get hurt. But what choice was there?", "The police pounded on the door just as Mr. Guerrero put a handful of pills into his mouth. He spent the next few weeks in a private inpatient treatment program for PTSD.", "It was far from a cure. He said he was still deeply depressed and ashamed. He still slept on the couch instead of in his wife\u2019s bed, and he was not speaking to his parents. But he was alive.", "Six weeks later, Mr. Bojorquez drove out to visit him in San Diego. The 911 call had not broken their friendship, but it had broken the long silence in which neither mentioned what he had brought home from war.", "They greeted each other in a hug. During a lunch at a nearby taqueria, Mr. Bojorquez talked about the night he had put a gun to his head. Mr. Guerrero talked about watching his sergeant\u2019s Humvee explode and being so rattled afterward that he did not care that his cigarette was flecked with blood. They stayed long after the lunch crowd cleared out.", "\u201cThis is good \u2014 us here like this,\u201d Mr. Guerrero told his friend. \u201cIt\u2019s the times when I\u2019m alone that I fear.\u201d", "They had found small ways to rebuild their lives. Mr. Guerrero had become a rabid marathoner and was leading the youth band at his church. Mr. Bojorquez was studying to join the United States Border Patrol and playing on a softball team with his brother.", "At dawn the next morning, Mr. Guerrero took Mr. Bojorquez on his favorite run to the top of a mountain behind his house. He had placed an old metal ammunition box at the top, where Marines could leave letters and sign their names. He dedicated it to the men of the Forgotten Battalion.", "As they clambered up the trail, they talked about how hard it was to find balance.", "\u201cThe death of my brothers consumes me,\u201d Mr. Guerrero said between breaths. \u201cIt gives me this dark energy. I don\u2019t know what to do, so I run. I run all the time. I pray I never run out of trails to run.\u201d", "It was five winding miles to the summit. When they reached it, the two stood side by side catching their breath and looking out at the dawn spreading over the ocean. Mr. Bojorquez hung his arm over his friend\u2019s shoulder. Hummingbirds zipped through the pink light.", "Mr. Guerrero broke the silence.", "\u201cI\u2019m glad I got to share this with you,\u201d he told his friend. \u201cI wish I could bring the whole battalion up here.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/technology/personaltech/answers-to-questions-about-apples-new-products.html": ["We asked readers to send us questions about Apple\u2019s new products on Wednesday when the company unveiled updated iPhones, a bigger iPad, an upgraded Apple TV and accessories. Many readers had queries about the new devices and how they work. Brian X. Chen and J.\u2009D. Biersdorfer answered the most frequently asked ones.", "Q. There is a slight width difference of a couple of millimeters with the new iPhones versus the old ones. Will this affect cases? \u2014 Brooks Hanley, Petaluma, Calif.", "Brian The increases in thickness and width compared to the previous iPhones are minor.", "Some case makers, like Speck, have said that the new iPhone 6S will fit inside their iPhone 6 cases. However, it\u2019s unsafe to conclude that all iPhone 6 cases will be able to fit the new iPhones, because hundreds of cases are on the market. Your best bet is to look up the website for your case\u2019s brand and contact its customer support to ask whether the cases will be compatible with the new iPhones.", "Q. Can Apple TV replace my Comcast cable box with DVR? If so, will I get all the stations I get now? \u2014 Ted David, Ocean County, N.J.", "J.D. Don\u2019t cancel your cable television subscription yet. Apple TV is not a complete replacement for cable service but more of an enhancement to it. Like earlier versions of the little black set-top box, it provides dozens of channel apps to choose from, like those for ABC and Fox, but if you read the fine print at the bottom of the page, Apple notes that many channels are \u201cfree with your subscription through participating cable and satellite providers.\u201d And of course, you may need a subscription for premium services like HBO.", "To see the content on these types of apps, sign up for a user name and password from your cable provider, and use those credentials when the big login box pops up on the TV screen. You can, however, subscribe directly to the HBO Now service on the Apple TV even if your cable package does not include HBO; the stand-alone HBO service here is $15 a month after the free trial period. Still, you can find plenty of free content on the Apple TV, including PBS shows and video podcasts \u2014 and you can watch pretty much anything you\u2019ve bought from the iTunes Store on there, too.", "Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said the company believes \u201cthe future of TV is apps\u201d and perhaps a real cord-cutting app like Sling TV\u2019s monthly $20 package of selected broadcast and cable channels is not far down the road. A cloud-based DVR to go with that would be on my wish list, too.", "Q. Any word on an OS X update? My Safari is breaking down and I\u2019ve been waiting for El Capitan. \u2014 Nelson Alexander, New York", "Brian Apple did not explicitly say anything on Wednesday about El Capitan, the next version of Mac OS X. But it quietly updated the webpage for OS X with a message that reads \u201cComing September 30.\u201d That\u2019s a bit later than the Sept. 16 release date for iOS 9, the mobile operating system, but it still gives Apple time to target the back-to-school season and the holiday shopping season, which is when Mac sales heat up.", "Q. How does the new iPad Pro differentiate itself from the MacBook Pro? \u2014 Quentin Nie, Hong Kong", "J.D. The iPad Pro and the MacBook Pro can share information by way of iCloud or the USB cable that works with its Lightning port, but they are different devices for different styles of working. (The prices for the two are also different, about $800 for the low-end iPad Pro with its 12.9-inch screen versus about $1,100 for the starter model MacBook Pro with its 13-inch screen.)", "The iPad Pro, while bigger, shinier and more robust than its iPad ancestors, is still a tablet that runs on an A9X processor and Apple\u2019s iOS operating system for mobile gadgets. The iPad Pro also runs apps specifically designed for iOS, but at least there are 850,000 of them to choose from.", "If you opt for a model that includes cellular service, you also have an Internet connection without having to hunt around for a Wi-Fi network or an Ethernet jack as you have to do to get most laptops online. The light weight and easy connectivity make the iPad Pro (or any cellular-equipped iPad) a useful tool for computing on the go. If you don\u2019t like typing on glass, you can even turn the iPad Pro into a sort of laptop-on-the-accessories-installment-plan by buying the optional Smart Keyboard for an additional $169 \u2014 which gives you a tactile keyboard and a place to prop up the tablet so you can better see what you\u2019re typing.", "The MacBook Pro may be heavier, but it\u2019s intended for more heavy-duty computing, running on Intel dual or quad-core processors. For input, the laptop comes with its own keyboard and track pad, and you can always use a mouse. It has USB, HDMI and Thunderbolt ports for attaching accessories, as well as a built-in slot for Secure Digital memory cards. You get far more onboard storage space \u2014 on a MacBook Pro, you can get up to 512 gigabytes on the base models; but you can go up to a full terabyte by paying more. The iPad Pro tops out at 128 gigabytes, minus what iOS takes up.", "Speaking of operating systems, the MacBook Pro runs the OS X operating system (not iOS) and all the programs and apps written specifically for it.", "Q. Can I use Apple TV to mirror my iPad 3 onto my new 2015 Samsung smart TV? Samsung software for this doesn\u2019t work. Navigating the iPad is much easier than navigating on the TV. \u2014 Morgan Sundance, Florida", "Brian Yes. The new Apple TV supports AirPlay, the feature used to stream content wirelessly from iPhones and iPads to the Apple TV. The iPad 3 includes support for AirPlay, so you should be fine.", "Q. Does the iPad Pro have a flash drive or a means to transfer documents from one device to another, as is the case with Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro? \u2014 Francys, Washington", "J.D. The iPad Pro does not have the USB connector needed to attach a standard USB drive as you can do with one of Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro tablets to move files between devices. Cloud services that make iOS apps (like Dropbox, Microsoft\u2019s OneDrive, Google Drive, Apple\u2019s own iCloud and so on) are still probably the most convenient way to pass files back and forth between devices if you don\u2019t want to bother with emailing them to yourself.", "As with other iPads, the iPad Pro has the Lightning port for charging and transferring some types of data (like iTunes purchases or iWork files) from the computer through the cable that links the Lightning port to the USB port on a Mac or Windows PC. But the iPad Pro also has a new port called the Smart Connector that can transfer power and data to the tablet. Apple\u2019s new Smart Keyboard uses the new port, and other companies like Logitech are building accessories that work with the Smart Connector, so some sort of smart dock with a USB port may be feasible if Apple approves.", "Apple does sell accessories for its Lightning port, like the $29 Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, but it\u2019s mainly intended for attaching a camera\u2019s USB cable to import photos and videos. The results have been mixed, but some brave souls have experimented with attaching flash drives to the iPad that way.", "Q. Any news on better battery life or increased battery size in the 6S compared to the 6? I\u2019d rather have a thicker phone than a thin one that has no battery life. \u2014 BB, New York", "Brian Apple\u2019s reported battery life for both the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus are identical, respectively, to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. But the new phones are slightly thicker than the previous ones and my guess is that is because the phones are more powerful (70 percent faster than the previous generation) and the camera is also a big improvement. Apple\u2019s website says the iPhone 6S has a battery life that will support talk time of as much as 14 hours on a 3G network, while the iPhone 6S Plus has battery life to support as much as 24 hours on 3G.", "Q. Does the new iPad Pro have 3D Touch? \u2014 Andrew Bavetta, Truckee, Calif.", "J.D. No. Apple\u2019s 3D Touch feature \u2014 which senses how much pressure you are applying to the screen and reacts accordingly with different actions and menus \u2014 is available only on the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. But Apple has a history of putting features into its iPhones first (think cameras, Siri, Touch ID) and then adding them to future generations of iPads, so maybe 3D Touch will turn up in a later model. Until then, iPad Pro users can vary their touch on the tablet with an optional Apple Pencil.", "Q. Can 16GB on the new iPhone accommodate the new camera features? It\u2019s too little on my 4S, so I guess my real question is, how does Apple justify this? 16GB is so insulting, that model should be free. \u2014 A. Coates, Brooklyn", "Brian I highly recommend against buying the 16-gigabyte model ($650). It\u2019s questionable why Apple continues to release an iPhone with so little storage in this day and age. Even light technology users who aren\u2019t constantly downloading new apps or taking that many photos will burn through 16 gigabytes quickly, especially with the new 12-megapixel camera. From a business perspective, Apple may be trying to encourage consumers to pay the extra $100 for the 64-gigabyte model because it offers so much more value.", "Q. Will the Apple Pencil work on older iPad models or only the iPad Pro? \u2014 Daren Woodward, The Bronx", "J.D. The $100 battery-powered Apple Pencil is specifically designed to work with the technology under the hood of the iPad Pro. An Apple representative told my colleague that the new stylus was not compatible with older models. If Apple declines to make its own stylus for its older iPad models, other companies have stepped up already.", "Wacom\u2019s Bamboo Fineline 2 for iPad (and compatible apps) are just $60, for example, and its basic Bamboo Solo stylus (which is less tied to specific drawing and note-taking apps) is around $20. The $50 Jot Dash and the $25 Hand Stylus are among the other fancy options for iPad writing sticks, and you can find cheap, simple styluses around the web for as little as $5. Many of these alternatives work on any touch screen, including iPhones and iPod Touch players \u2014 and even Android or Windows phones and tablets.", "Q. How can I get a manual to teach me how to use this thing? \u2014 Beverly Hayes, Vallejo, Calif.", "J.D. Apple obviously takes great pride in the elegant packaging for its products, but those sleek boxes rarely have room for anything more than a little card of setup information. So visit the Apple Support site and scroll down to the thing you just bought \u2014 iPhones, iPads, the Apple TV and the Apple Watch are all covered.

In 2007, Volkswagen ditched the pollution-control technology developed by Mercedes-Benz and Bosch in favor of internal technology. At the time, Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s determination to surpass Toyota put enormous strain on managers to deliver growth in America.

For instance, Udacity\u2019s Android course is staffed by instructors from Google, which developed the mobile operating system. Udacity\u2019s model also a puts a premium on one-on-one coaching, mentorship, career counseling and job-interviewing skills, all of which keep students more invested in their work.", "The absence of human interaction has long bedeviled online education, but Mr. Thrun has found a way to offer personalized teaching systems on a wide scale while keeping costs low. He does so using a proven Internet trick \u2014 online outsourcing.

Mr. Redzepi simply believes that the restaurant, where he has led the kitchen for 12 years, is ready for a drastic evolution.", "In his mind, Noma hasn\u2019t even crawled out of its infancy. \u201cWe\u2019re just finding our way,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it has been successful, even though it has had media attention and all that.\u201d Lately, he has been asking himself broad existential questions about what it means to be a local restaurant in the Nordic region. \u201cWhat are we?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how do we progress?\u201d", "To illustrate all this as he showed off the property, he grabbed a pebble and scratched out the number 12 in the dirt. Then he added a zero, conveying the notion that Noma could last for a century or more. \u201cWe should make decisions that make this evolution last for 912 years,\u201d he said.", "As for the next two years, he\u2019s already committed to giving the menu a radical shake-up. Over time, he has become less and less sure that it makes sense for customers to pass through the traditional stages of a tasting menu, from small nibbles to a slab of meat, culminating in sweets and coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the format of a tasting menu to dictate what we cook,\u201d he said.", "He intends to replace that predictable progression with a more fervent adherence to seasonality. In the fall, then, Noma\u2019s menu will focus only on wild game (from goose to moose) and foraged autumnal ingredients like mushrooms and forest berries. In the winter, when \u201cthe waters are ice-cold and some of the fish have bellies full of roe,\u201d as he put it, Noma will mutate into a seafood restaurant.", "Spring and summer? \u201cThe world turns green,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so will the menu.\u201d In an expectation-thwarting move, during those months Noma will become a fully vegetarian restaurant, with much of the bounty ostensibly coming from the farm he wants to conjure up.", "\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you going to give a bowl of spinach the same pleasure that a steak gives? A richness of flavor: That is something that we will deal with.\u201d (Even the tableware will shift with each season.)", "Mr. Redzepi, who seems to crave change the way most people crave that steak, said the transplanting is only one of the shifts he has in store for the months ahead.", "From late December to the middle of next April, the restaurant staff will be relocating to Sydney, Australia, to see what happens when the Noma approach is applied to Australian ingredients. (It undertook a similar experiment in Japan this year, and the Japanese reverence for the seasons clearly had a deep influence on Mr. Redzepi\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s as if everything they eat is at the right moment,\u201d he said.)", "For the first time in his career, Mr. Redzepi is forming a partnership to open a second restaurant, a more casual enterprise in Copenhagen with the chef Kristian Baumann heading the kitchen, and he has lured the Irish chef Trevor Moran to leave the Catbird Seat in Nashville and come back to Noma (where he worked for four years) to help lead the next wave.", "Evidence suggests that Mr. Redzepi\u2019s employees are accustomed to hearing their captain ordering them to steer for the high seas. Every week at Noma, after the final high-pressure dinner service, they gather in the kitchen for Saturday Night Projects, a public and semi-gladiatorial face-off at which young cooks are asked to put together their own dishes for Mr. Redzepi\u2019s inspection and analysis. He even broadcasts it via Periscope.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Google of restaurants,\u201d said Malcolm Livingston II, who moved from New York last year to become Noma\u2019s pastry chef. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps it exciting: It stays fresh.\u201d", "Over the years, Noma has pioneered approaches to fermentation, foraging, aging and even cooking with insects. \u201cYou\u2019re taking risks every time you move forward,\u201d said the head chef, Daniel Giusti, who grew up in New Jersey. But a big leap into agriculture could be the riskiest move of all.", "\u201cThat\u2019s where the challenge will come in,\u201d Mr. Giusti said. \u201cAre we growing the right stuff? Is it good? I know Ren\u00e9. It\u2019s going to have to be great.\u201d", "Technically, Noma\u2019s new home lies in the center of the city, even though it feels like some faraway vegetation-tangled edge. Mr. Redzepi may be seeking wilder pastures at the right time. A new walkable bridge will soon connect Nyhavn, one of the most tourist-packed parts of Copenhagen, to the docklike zone that currently houses Noma and its fermentation lab. As often happens in New York City, gentrification is surging in. Change is in the air.", "\u201cOf course we could just keep continuing, just stay put and do what we do there,\u201d Mr. Redzepi said. \u201cBut I genuinely think that we won\u2019t progress.\u201d He seemed rapt as he stood among the weeds and broken glass, as if admiring the new Noma in its finished state. \u201cI have yet to meet anyone who thinks this is a stupid thing,\u201d he said.", "He pondered this observation for a second or two.

Even some of her supportive circle of friends had seemed unsure of what to say when she sounded them out about it: Until Kim brought it up, one friend thought it was a fiction invented by the creators of \u201cFuturama,\u201d the animated television series whose \u201caccidentally cryopreserved\u201d protagonist wakes up in the future.", "\u201cIt freaks people out,\u201d she told Josh.", "And when she finally did talk to her father, in an airport lounge in June 2012, his refusal came as a rude awakening.", "Over the year, Mr. Suozzi offered to send the couple on a vacation. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to do together?\u201d he asked. \u201cGo to Europe, go on a cruise?\u201d", "But like many people, Mr. Suozzi knew of cryonics mostly as the butt of late-night talk show humor.", "When she told him what she wanted he simply shook his head.", "\u201cI can\u2019t help you with this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t live forever, Kim.\u201d", "In what Mr. Suozzi recalls as a heated conversation, Josh called to urge him to reconsider. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Josh demanded. \u201cShould we just give up on trying to treat her cancer now, too?\u201d", "\u201cIf you want to do this,\u201d Mr. Suozzi replied, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to figure out how to do it yourself.\u201d", "They had one other idea of how to raise the money.", "Reddit, whose far-flung and highly opinionated members were known for coming to the aid of those whose plight struck a collective chord, had loomed as a possible last resort since the outpouring of support at her earlier post about cancer.", "\u201cBut why would anyone donate?\u201d she demanded of Josh. \u201cThere\u2019s no compelling reason why I deserve another chance at life.\u201d", "\u201cYou can say that then,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLet people make up their own mind.\u201d", "First, though, in the two weeks that followed, they decamped to Hope Lodge, an American Cancer Society facility for patients being cared for at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where Kim was admitted to a trial of a long-shot experimental drug.", "There, in between Kim being pricked and prodded, they focused on what it might take to preserve and reconstruct her mind.", "They read academic journal articles on neuroscience, online forums and the Alcor website. The foundation, they learned, encourages customers to choose what it calls \u201cneuropreservation,\u201d or preserving just the brain, as opposed to freezing their entire body. Given the imperative for speed, the logic went, it was better to focus everything on the brain.", "\u201cIf I get frozen I will get my head chopped off,\u201d Kim told her friend Ms. Neidig matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper, and apparently it gets the juice in there faster.\u201d", "And the idea of a disembodied Kim was O.K. with Josh: \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on leaving her when she got old and saggy,\u201d he observed.", "If the $80,000 fee for neuropreservation seemed steep, they learned that about a third of it pays for medical personnel to be on call for death, while another third is placed in a trust for future revival. The investment income from the trust also pays for storage in liquid nitrogen, which is so cold that it can prevent decay in biological tissue for millenniums.", "Some of what they found out gave them pause. Alcor\u2019s antifreeze, once pumped through the blood vessels, transitions into a glassy substance before ice can form and do damage. The process, called vitrification, is similar to that used to store sperm, eggs and embryos for fertility treatments. But that glassy substance has been known to crack, likely causing damage of a different kind.", "And the infinite scenarios could seem overwhelming. Might she be back in a hundred years, or a thousand? Would Josh be there? In what form? If damaged, maybe her biological brain could actually be repaired?", "In the context of Hope Lodge, the prospect of cryonics did not seem to them so different from the clinical trials that hundreds of cancer patients were participating in with only the tiniest chance of success at enormous expense.", "Even with an ideal cryopreservation, the damage from her tumor would need to be repaired. And they were aware that her brain would most likely sustain more damage from the procedure itself.", "But part of her brain, Kim pointed out, had already stopped working and she still enjoyed life. And like brain-damaged patients, she felt she could be rehabilitated. In fact, digital repairs might well be easier than physical recovery. There was already some neuroscience research that made piecing together a damaged connectome seem conceivable.", "Memories, for instance, appear to be stored in multiple places. Certain areas of the brain responsible for tasks like attention might be replaced with off-the-shelf spare parts. The molecular identity of neurons held clues to which should be connected where. And broken ones might be digitally pieced back together, perhaps not even precisely, some researchers say.", "\u201cYou\u2019d ask yourself how many mistakes could you make and still have the same person,\u201d Joshua R. Sanes, director of the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University, said in an interview. \u201cThe ability of us to keep being ourselves in the face of changes in our nervous system is pretty amazing.\u201d", "Kim tried to make light of it all. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to enhance me,\u201d she told Josh. But she was serious when she told him she would rather survive in some damaged form than not at all.", "Amid the few fantasies they allowed themselves, Kim made a point to tell him something more tangible, too: \u201cI want you to be happy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a new person, and you\u2019ll be O.K.\u201d", "When an August M.R.I. showed that the experimental drug had failed to halt the growth of Kim\u2019s tumor, she and Josh shot and edited a short video for her blog, in which she asked for donations for cryonics.", "\u201cGet ready to feel weird about me!\u201d she posted on Facebook with a link.", "The next day, as they drove across the country to Duke University in Durham, N.C., where Kim was to receive radiation, she wrote out a longer explanation: \u201cReddit, help me find some peace in dying young (I\u2019m 23),\u201d it read.", "Josh rummaged for a pen, one hand still on the wheel. He scrawled \u201cFreeze Me, Reddit,\u201d on a stray piece of paper and handed it to her.", "She took a picture of herself, embedded it in her post and clicked \u201csend.\u201d", "In the first wave of response, Kim wrote to a friend, \u201cReddit was harsh.\u201d", "Hundreds voiced or linked to opinions over the course of a few days, more after Kim was featured on the local television news. The couple were prepared for the technical objections about cryonics and uploading minds.", "They even took a certain pleasure in the philosophical argument over whether any uploaded mind would essentially be a zombie, with all the behaviors of the original but lacking its soul.", "Some recoiled at the prospect of living much longer lives, citing fear of boredom, or being useless, or lonely. Others suggested the future would have little interest in relics from the 2010s (\u201cyou\u2019d be little more than a rodent to them, intelligence-wise,\u201d one wrote).", "But it was the hostility, as though they were proposing a Faustian bargain for all of humanity, that took Josh and Kim aback.", "One commenter vowed to donate money to cancer research, \u201cnot your extraordinary long-shot attempt at self-preservation.\u201d Another called Kim a \u201cselfish retard.\u201d", "Josh voted down the online critics and feigned keeping his temper.", "\u201cSome people who enjoy life fight for any chance to keep living,\u201d he replied to a post that suggested Kim should spend her remaining time \u201cactually living your life.\u201d", "Still, Kim\u2019s original post was \u201cupvoted,\u201d akin to \u201cliking\u201d on Facebook, 89 percent of the time, a hit in Reddit terms.", "And they were floored by the outpouring of support from strangers.", "A software engineer at Google, Maksym Taran, who like Kim was 23, donated $1,000 within hours and wrote a few days later that he would supply the full amount if she failed to raise it. Another donor was Michael Andregg, then 31, co-founder of Halcyon Molecular, a high-profile genetics start-up in Silicon Valley: \u201cI hope you preferably get better,\u201d he wrote to her, \u201cbut failing that get cryopreserved.\u201d", "Parijata Mackey, a young woman in California, connected her to a board member at Alcor, and sent her phone number: \u201cIf you\u2019re ever bored, or want to chat about cryo-sciencey-future things, feel free to call me anytime.\u201d", "A group of longtime cryonics supporters, the Society for Venturism, pitched in, as did Kim\u2019s mother, Jane Suozzi, who signed over a $10,000 life insurance policy she held in Kim\u2019s name.", "As donations continued to come in and their contacts at Alcor indicated that Kim would almost certainly be fully funded, Josh sat her down to shoot a thank-you video.", "Adamant about not having a \u201cbucket list,\u201d Kim nevertheless admitted to a certain interest in seeing the Grand Canyon, and in October 2012, she and Josh set out to visit it on a road trip. But first they stopped at a cryonics conference Alcor was holding to celebrate its 40th anniversary in Scottsdale, Ariz., at which she had been invited to speak.", "The conference was full of well-wishers, including several who had donated money to her. And Kim was looking forward to the talk by Sebastian Seung, a Princeton University neuroscientist who had treated cryonics seriously in his book published that year, \u201cConnectome: How the Brain\u2019s Wiring Makes Us Who We Are.\u201d", "If the brain\u2019s connections remain intact in the cryonics procedure, or can be pieced back together, he had written, \u201cthen we cannot rule out the possibility of resurrecting memories and restoring personal identity.\u201d", "But Dr. Seung, an adviser to the Brain Preservation Foundation, cautioned Alcor members that he hoped his talk would help them \u201cmake informed decisions\u201d", "Even though three-dimensional maps of partial bits of brain had become relatively easy to produce, Dr. Seung observed, Alcor had not published any such images \u2014 even of animal brains preserved under its protocol. Only two-dimensional images had been published. That raised questions about how well preserved their clients\u2019 brains were.", "Soon a heated argument ensued among some audience members over how to preserve brains.", "Greg Fahy, the chief scientist at 21st Century Medicine, the company that invented the cryoprotectant Alcor uses to protect the brain from ice crystals, defended Alcor\u2019s methods, pointing out that no method was available that could achieve connectome preservation using fixation and plastic embedding of a human brain, so that no evidence for that approach existed either.", "Dr. Fahy, a cryobiologist whose research focuses on organ banking, had provided the most encouraging signs that cryonics did preserve brain structure. In a 2009 experiment, his team showed that neurons in slices of rabbit brains immersed in the solution, chilled to cryogenic temperatures and then rewarmed, had responded to electrical stimulation.", "His method, he contended, preserved the connectome in those slices. But a complication prevented him from entering the prize competition: Brain tissue perfused with the cryoprotectant invariably becomes dehydrated, making it nearly impossible to see the details of the shrunken neurons and their connections under an electron microscope.", "Dr. Hayworth, the founder of the Brain Preservation Technology Prize, argued that a slice of brain responding to electrical stimulation was unconvincing evidence that the critical connections throughout the whole brain had been preserved.", "Yet the only competitor so far for his prize \u2014 Dr. Mikula of the Max Planck Institute \u2014 had also experienced difficulty in the key step of his method that would allow the tissue to be seen under an electron microscope.", "So Dr. Hayworth urged Dr. Fahy to find some way for his work to be better validated. \u201cWe have to be able to see it to believe it,\u201d he said.", "In fact, there was one way Dr. Fahy had considered. He could fix the brain\u2019s structure in place with chemicals first, just as Dr. Mikula was doing, buying time to perfuse the cryoprotectant more slowly to avoid dehydration. But he lacked the funds, he said, for a project that would have no practical business application for organ banking. Also, his company\u2019s focus is on what he calls \u201creversible\u201d cryopreservation, whereas fixing the brain\u2019s structure in place with chemicals, as is done in chemopreservation, would place biological revival, the goal of many Alcor members, even farther out of reach.", "Kim\u2019s talk was well-received. Josh, watching from the audience, felt warmed by the applause that broke out several times during her short presentation. Yet he noticed her losing her train of thought more than once.", "In early November, Kim assigned her power of attorney to Josh. She understood, Josh later realized, better than he had, how little time she had left.", "\u201cI know that, Mom and Dad, you probably would respect my last wishes,\u201d she said to her phone camera. \u201cBut Josh knows me best.\u201d", "Josh, who one year granted Kim\u2019s birthday wish to dress her, now dressed her every day.", "They had decided that Kim would die in the hospice Alcor had suggested near its headquarters in Scottsdale, one that would allow the cryonics team to be on hand with all its equipment so the preservation procedure could begin immediately. And after a sharp exchange, in which her father threatened to take Kim home with him to Florida, Mr. Suozzi backed down.", "\u201cJosh and I have only one thing in common,\u201d Mr. Suozzi said with a certain reluctant admiration. \u201cAnd that is our love for Kim.\u201d", "Kim decided to refuse food and water to hasten her death before the tumor consumed more of her brain. But 12 days after her arrival at the hospice \u2014 far longer than they had imagined would be necessary \u2014 the hospice informed them that because her condition seemed to have stabilized she would have to be treated as an outpatient.", "Alcor\u2019s emergency medicine technician was prohibited from touching Kim before her death was officially pronounced by a medical professional. When Josh protested, the hospice assured him that the nurse would get to the apartment Mr. Suozzi rented nearby in less than 15 minutes.", "But when, two days after Kim had left the hospice, Josh did call at 5 a.m. to say she was dying, it took an hour for one of the nurses to respond because, he was told later, they were between shifts.", "When it did begin, the procedure itself went mostly as planned. With the help of two nurses employed by Alcor, the company\u2019s emergency medical technician, Aaron Drake, performed a series of steps designed to keep the blood vessels in Kim\u2019s brain from collapsing.", "He connected her to a CPR device to restore the circulation of her blood. A tube was inserted into her lungs to deliver air. She was given medications to prevent the brain from swelling and to break up blood clots. Then she was lowered into an ice bath and carried to the van for the short drive to Alcor\u2019s facility.", "By late morning, her head had been separated from her torso. Josh watched from an observation window as the cryoprotectant was pumped through her main cerebral arteries.", "When all that remained was to continue the cooling with liquid nitrogen gas, Josh looked into her face for the last time. They had done, he thought, the best they could.", "Josh grieved for Kim in the usual ways, but also in some unusual ones.", "He had promised to periodically leave her messages so she could catch up on what she had missed, and he did.", "He reclaimed the job he had quit to care for Kim in the months before her death. He began to rebuild the ties to family and friends that he had neglected while Kim was dying and sought, as Kim had once put it, to \u201cfind a new person.\u201d", "When a CT scan of Kim\u2019s brain arrived from Alcor, it appeared to show that the cryoprotectant had reached only the outer portion of her brain, leaving the rest vulnerable to ice damage.", "Josh took some solace in the fact that the outer layer, associated with abstract thinking and language, appeared to have been protected.", "He holds out hope of seeing Kim again someday. \u201cUntil (or unless) the day comes that Kim can be brought back,\u201d he wrote on her Facebook page, \u201cremember her, celebrate her, and emulate her resilience, so we can create the future of her dreams.\u201d", "Kim\u2019s father sometimes leaves her voice mail messages too, just in case, he said, she does turn out to be around to hear them.", "\u201cKim, it\u2019s Dad,\u201d they often start, \u201cI just wanted to leave you a message.\u201d", "Brain preservation research went on too.", "In the late fall of 2013, almost a year after Kim\u2019s death, a celebrity D.J., Steve Aoki, announced a benefit for brain research.", "Of four charities Mr. Aoki identified, the one to register the most \u201clikes\u201d on his Facebook page over the following month would receive $1 from every ticket of his tour, likely to total some $50,000. One of them was Dr. Hayworth\u2019s Brain Preservation Foundation.", "Soon the foundation had won the contest. Of its winnings, $20,000 went to Dr. Fahy to enable him to try the new protocol he had proposed, first fixing the connectome in place with chemicals so that the brain did not shrink from dehydration and slices of it could be viewed under an electron microscope.", "Dr. Mikula also got some of the money and made progress. He discovered the one solvent among hundreds that allowed him to complete the task of staining a whole mouse brain and preserving it in plastic. The technique, he wrote in an email, can \u201clikely be adapted to human brains within five years.\u201d", "The journal Nature Methods published his protocol in April. And this month, a paper by Dr. Fahy and a colleague at 21st Century Medicine, Robert McIntyre, was accepted for publication by the journal Cryobiology.

Someone who can think how to tackle a problem with algorithms is as important as someone who can code. Completing those tasks can involve the same person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to do so. One of the hardest parts of computational thinking is overcoming an implicit assumption that a computer will intuit what you mean. A computer never misunderstands what you ask it to do. You simply may not be asking what you intended.", "Keeping this in mind in computational math can be challenging, especially when you begin.", "Before the thought of writing \u201cMath Bytes\u201d was even an inkling, I had read various books that unfold the beauty and creativity of math.

But since the operating system\u2019s release in late July, apps built for the software have not exactly taken off. That could be because the mobile version of Windows 10 for phones and smaller tablets \u2014 which ought to prompt wider adoption of the operating system \u2014 is not yet available, though you can download a preview edition to test on your phone.", "On the positive side, some \u201cfull\u201d Windows 10 apps for bigger tablets have already appeared, as well as some mobile-ready universal apps that demonstrate the future of the operating system.", "Those include WolframAlpha, a universal Windows 10 app that can be thought of as an anti-Google.

These tweaks are made by dragging on-screen sliders to see the effect in real time.", "Like WolframAlpha, the Photoshop interface feels at home in the Windows environment, and it is easy to navigate. But those hoping for the full Photoshop experience may be disappointed: The free app is for basic photo editing only and has a limited range of features. You can buy additional capabilities, such as the noise-reduction system and Instagram-like image filters, but these cost a few dollars via in-app purchase.", "Twitter has a universal Windows 10 app that demonstrates some of the issues that Microsoft faces. Twitter works on Windows 10 much as it does on other devices: You can read tweets from other people in your timeline and share your own posts, including photos and videos.", "But the strong design elements that characterize Windows 10\u2019s mobile interface are strange in this free app. Using Twitter on Windows 10 feels different from using it on the web or another smartphone. The whole tweeting experience is swamped with Microsoft\u2019s look and feel.", "Though this is admittedly a matter of personal taste, there is another issue: Twitter on Windows is not as full- featured as it is on iOS. It is also sometimes difficult to use, with icons in unexpected places. Such issues raise questions as to whether developers invest the same effort in Windows apps as they do in apps for other smartphones.", "Foursquare also has a universal Windows 10 app that has made the transition from previous versions of Windows. The free app, which has changed in function over time, is now a destination for crowdsourced reviews of venues like cafes, and it works just as well on Windows 10 as on other devices.", "Reviewers in the app store say the new version is visually confusing, however, and the dominating Microsoft user interface makes it easy to forget that you are reading a restaurant review in Foursquare as opposed to some other app.", "Microsoft\u2019s Office suite of business productivity apps is also available on Windows 10 (naturally). On your phone and smaller tablets, Word, Excel and other apps are free, though they require a free Microsoft account for Office 365 and they have less document-creation and editing power than you may be used to on your PC.

Oh, and McDonald\u2019s is now serving breakfast all day, which is really much bigger news than any of this other tech stuff combined.", "But as you are this week\u2019s substitute Farhad, I leave it to you to set the topics of discussion.

Amazon seems to like it the other way around. Out of nowhere on Tuesday, they announced that Prime members could now download (some) movies and TV shows to iOS and Android devices. In order to watch programming offline previously, you had to have an Amazon Fire tablet, so this gives Amazon a much bigger potential customer base.

What about plain old tech?", "Quentin: I guess Google is finding out a painful truth: When you\u2019re a global tech company that is basically into everything from advertising to computers to cars, you\u2019re going to get hassled. Possibly with good reason. Last week in Europe, the company faced a new online platform meant to help companies there sue for antitrust violations. In India, the authorities raised the same kind of charges about anticompetitive bullying.", "Mike: But they have a new logo. You can\u2019t sue a company if it has an attractive logo. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a law.", "Quentin: Yeah, sometimes watching older tech companies try to cope with a changing world is like having your parents come down to your basement party to \u201crelate\u201d to your friends.

On the printers they tweaked, 52 percent of all print jobs were double-sided, compared with 46 percent on the others. This increase of 6 percentage points may not sound like much, until you realize that about 18 billion pages roll off federal government printers each year, according to the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team report, suggesting that carrying this out across the entire federal government could save more than half a billion pages a year.", "In another experiment, researchers sent high school seniors text messages in the summer after they graduated, reminding them of the next steps required to enroll in college. A full 68 percent of those students randomly chosen to receive these texts subsequently enrolled in college, compared with 65 percent among those who didn\u2019t get any reminders. The effect was particularly large for low-income and first-generation students. If a rise of 3 percentage points in college-going doesn\u2019t excite you, realize that this is the result of only eight text messages at a total cost of about $7 a student, making it one of the highest bang-for-your-buck educational interventions tested. Certainly eight text messages are a more cost-effective way of promoting college than offering thousands of dollars in grant and scholarship aid.", "Small nudges can also help make people more honest. In one ingenious tweak, the research team added a prompt at the beginning of a federal-vendor tax collection form asking vendors to promise to report the truth. Those who were randomly selected to use this new form reported more taxable sales relative to those who used the old form. In just three months of using this form on just one small and obscure tax provision, this box caused people to volunteer an additional $1.6 million in taxes. Expanding this idea could potentially bring in billions of dollars in extra revenue.", "Too often the government\u2019s good intentions are buried by bureaucrats who make programs dreadfully difficult to understand, leading too few people to use them. For instance, if you are struggling to repay your student loans, you can apply to have your monthly payments reduced to a more manageable share of your income. The idea is that you still repay your debt, but you do so more slowly. The problem is that few people are aware of this possibility, and so few apply. That\u2019s a shame, because the federal government actually knows who is struggling to repay their loans and could help them directly. A targeted email sent to a random subset of these people led many more to apply for relief compared with those who didn\u2019t get an email.", "Other experiments focused on ways to increase savings among members of the military. The government offers generous savings plans, but less than half of all service members have signed up. When service members transferred to Joint Base Myer\u2013Henderson Hall in Virginia were prompted to make an active choice as to whether to enroll, there was a sharp increase in sign-ups. By contrast, those transferred to Fort Belvoir in Virginia, Fort Bragg in North Carolina or Fort Meade in Maryland received no such prompt, and there was no rise in enrollments.", "Various other experiments showed that a well-drafted letter could lead to an increase in health care enrollment; an effective email could lead people to join their workplace savings plan; a shorter web address could make people more willing to make online payments; telling people they had a \u201ctwo out of three\u201d chance was more persuasive than a \u201c66 percent\u201d chance; and veterans were more likely to engage with a program if you told them they had earned it, rather than that they were eligible for it.", "Perhaps as important, there were nudges that weren\u2019t effective.

But the group\u2019s 2015 annual report showed that watch sales during the year that ended March 31 grew 5 percent, to 3.12 billion euros, or about $3.48 million.", "Over all, however, the same report indicates that luxury as a sector continues to struggle. While group sales during the same period grew 4 percent, to \u20ac10.41 billion, profits were down 35 percent. Mr. Rupert attributed the decline to fluctuating exchange rates.", "Given the global climate of uncertainty, how many years of image building does Mr. Bonati think it will take to pay off the multimillion-dollar investment in Panerai\u2019s facility in Neuch\u00e2tel?", "\u201cTen years \u2014 maximum,\u201d he declared.

They were intended under the law to offer alternatives \u2014 and hopefully cheaper prices \u2014 to the plans sold by large established insurance companies in some regions.", "But as the new co-ops begin failing just a year into the effort to remake the health care industry with more competition and lower costs, the marketplace is proving hostile to newcomers trying to break into an industry dominated by powerfully entrenched businesses.", "Faced with these conditions, the federal government has promised to consider ways of helping them to get a firmer foothold, but some insurance experts doubt that government changes will be enough to prevent more failures.", "\u201cThis is not a market for the faint of heart,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a law professor at Georgetown University.", "The co-ops\u2019 problems are compounded by moves among the industry\u2019s biggest companies, like Anthem and Aetna, which plan to buy their rivals to become even bigger.

Hall, a health policy professor at Wake Forest University.", "These new carriers may have been hobbled from the beginning, some policy experts say, because the federal law that allowed them to sprout may not have first made the field level. For example, the federal loans granted to co-ops to get established are typically far below the capital needed to weather the uncertainty of the first years and be able to attract enough members to be successful.", "On top of that, the federal loans are accompanied by a tangle of regulations that make it hard to attract outside money that would ensure a strong footing as they expand.", "\u201cYou normally don\u2019t get a lot of start-up activity in the health insurance market because of the incredible barriers to entry,\u201d said Mark E.

Oscar has attracted more than 40,000 customers in New York and New Jersey who can use the website to easily look at their medical records and book appointments. Customers also have unlimited access to nurses or doctors via telephone.", "By way of contrast, ZoomPlus, which began as a collection of urgent care centers, bills itself as a \u201cKaiser 4.0,\u201d according to one of its founders, Dr. David Sanders.

Assurant Health, a for-profit insurer that tried an aggressive entry into the individual insurance market last year, stopped selling coverage altogether.

Evergreen, which has 22,500 customers, expects to roughly double in size by the end of next year. \u201cWe\u2019re the relatively nimble and agile tortoise,\u201d Dr. Beilenson said.", "The major hurdle for many of the co-ops is to find more capital, especially as they increase in size, which means they must set aside even more money to meet state rules on having sufficient funds to cover medical costs. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s the issue,\u201d said Dr. Martin Hickey, chairman of the National Alliance of State Health Co-ops.", "CoOportunity, a co-op in Iowa, had enrolled 120,000 members there and in neighboring Nebraska, but was shut down by Iowa\u2019s regulator. The co-op had potentially promising talks with a local health system and private banks, but was unable to secure financing. The co-ops say federal officials have been slow to outline ways that would make it easier for them to find outside sources of money.", "But they also point to the programs the federal government put in place to protect insurers from excessive losses if they enroll too many customers with expensive medical conditions. Under one program, insurers with healthier members must make payments to insurers covering sicker customers. And some small insurers are finding themselves with large bills, even before some of the other programs compensate them. In one case, a small insurer in Alabama, with just 1,100 members last year, is paying the dominant Blue Cross plan $1.5 million.", "The smaller players argue it is harder for them to find and document customers with serious illnesses. Someone with H.I.V., for example, may not need a checkup that would provide proof of the diagnosis.", "Federal officials say they have made it easier for the co-ops to convert some of their loans into more favorable types. They have also convened an advisory group of insurers to discuss how the rules under the law might be improved, but the co-ops argue that the discussions to date have focused solely on narrow technical issues.", "But Mr. Counihan of the government marketplace emphasized that some of the challenges facing the co-ops and other new players were not unique. \u201cAny start-up, irrespective of the business, is tough,\u201d he said."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/salesforce-we-give-customers-amazon-type-analytics/": ["Salesforce.com was one of the early giants of the cloud-computing revolution.

Those rules have more or less always held that hardware devices keep getting cheaper and less profitable over time. That happens because hardware is easy to commoditize; what seems magical today is widely copied and becomes commonplace tomorrow. It happened in personal computers; it happened in servers; it happened in cameras, music players, and \u2014 despite Apple\u2019s best efforts \u2014 it may be happening in tablets.", "In fact, commoditization has wreaked havoc in the smartphone business \u2014 just not for Apple. In the last half-decade, sales of devices running Google\u2019s Android operating system have far surpassed sales of Apple\u2019s devices, and now account for the vast majority of smartphones in use.", "For years, observers predicted that Android\u2019s rising market share would in turn lead to lower profits for Apple (profits, not market share, being the point of business). If that had happened, it would have roughly approximated the way the Windows PC industry eclipsed Apple\u2019s Mac business. \u201cHey, Apple, wake up \u2014 it\u2019s happening again,\u201d Henry Blodget, of Business Insider, warned in 2010.

While the iPhone\u2019s sales growth slowed in 2013 and 2014, it rebounded to near-record levels later last year, and its profits have remained lofty.", "Instead of killing Apple, commoditization caused something stranger \u2014 it hobbled Apple\u2019s main competitor in the smartphone business: Samsung, which until last year was gaining a creeping share of the profits in the smartphone business. At its peak in mid-2013, Samsung was making close to half of every dollar in the smartphone business, according to the investment bank Canaccord. (Apple was making the other half.)", "But the rise of low-end, pretty great Android phones made by Chinese upstarts like Xiaomi \u2014 and the surging popularity of Apple\u2019s large-screen iPhones \u2014 put Samsung in a bind. In July, Samsung reported its seventh straight quarter of declining profits. Canaccord\u2019s latest estimate shows Samsung making 15 percent of profits in smartphones, with Apple making 92 percent. (The numbers add up to more than 100 because everyone else in the smartphone industry loses money, so their share of the profits is negative.)", "You can expect Apple\u2019s proportion to grow. As analysts at Credit Suisse explained in a note last week, only about 30 percent of the world\u2019s 400 million iPhone users have upgraded to the large-screen models Apple introduced last year. Apple is bound to reap more money as the majority of its users inevitably jump to big phones over the next few years. In other words, for the foreseeable future, Apple stands virtually alone: It may be the only company making any money selling phones.", "What\u2019s driving the iPhone\u2019s escape from the trap of commodity hardware is that it is more than a hardware device. Instead, an iPhone is a tightly integrated mix of hardware, great software, and several pretty good services rolled into a single gadget.", "Apple\u2019s suite of services is far from perfect; as I\u2019ve argued before, for many people, Google offers a better range of cloud services to run on an iPhone. Still, Apple\u2019s services are good enough for most people, and as the company keeps expanding its ecosystem \u2014 covering payments and home and health devices \u2014 it will continue to build in different kinds of lock-ins for different kinds of users. Some people stay with the iPhone for its better App Store, others for iMessage, and many grandparents for FaceTime video calling and iCloud photo sharing. Just about everyone stays because they find Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system simpler to navigate, and easier to maintain, than the fragmented Android landscape. Put it all together and you get a package that few of Apple\u2019s rivals can replicate.", "But the iPhone is not just what it does, but what it means to its users \u2014 which is directly a product of the savvy way Apple has designed and marketed the device to produce global lust. As the writer Ben Thompson has argued, the iPhone is in many ways a \u201cVeblen good,\u201d the economic term for a product whose high price actually increases its desirability. Apple\u2019s resistance to selling low-end phones may thus feed into its success. IPhone resellers in Asia, for example, say that for many people, lower-end iPhones \u2014 even used ones \u2014 are seen as more desirable than more powerful, brand-new, but cheaper Android devices.", "Across large swaths of the globe, in other words, the iPhone is a status symbol, which is not to say that it\u2019s frivolous \u2014 unlike a Prada suit, the iPhone is one status symbol that you\u2019ll still find extremely useful.", "Of course, Apple\u2019s strategy is vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. Apple is betting on rising affluence across the globe to keep it in the black. If there\u2019s a slowdown in this rise \u2014 if the Chinese economy plunges, for instance, or, in the longer term, stagnant wages in Western countries push down consumers\u2019 desires to spend as freely on their phones \u2014 the iPhone will suffer. This explains why Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, rushed to reassure investors about the company\u2019s position in China during the recent Chinese market crisis.", "For now, though, it\u2019s difficult to conceive of a particular way in which Apple\u2019s phone could fall to its rivals.

Before the crisis, the Fed controlled the interest rate on those loans by modulating the supply of reserves: It lowered interest rates by buying Treasury securities from banks and crediting their accounts, increasing the supply of reserves; it raised rates by selling Treasuries to banks and debiting their accounts.", "As the crisis hit in 2008, the Fed pressed this system to its limits. It bought enough securities and pumped enough reserves into the banking system to drive interest rates on short-term loans to nearly zero. The federal government now pays about a dime to borrow $1,000 for one month. Companies with good credit pay about a dollar to borrow $1,000 from money market funds and other investors.", "It continued to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds to eliminate havens, forcing money into riskier investments that might generate economic activity.

Advertisers, for instance, can pay some ad blockers a fee to ensure their ads will get through to the consumer. Some companies, including PageFair, provide technology that helps publishers determine whether consumers are using ad blockers and then gives publishers the opportunity to serve consumers ads anyway.", "Many publishers like Allrecipes are also offering native advertising products, which are increasingly seen as an effective way to reach consumers. Excluding ads on social networks, the research firm Forrester estimates that native display ads will increase to about 15 percent of the online display ad market by 2020. These ads often resemble news articles or blog posts and are incorporated into websites and social feeds alongside editorial or user-generated content. Yahoo, Forbes, BuzzFeed and The New York Times are among the growing number of publishers with native ads.", "The goal is to give consumers something that feels less like an ad and more like content they would choose to read or watch.", "\u201cWe want to make sure that while we\u2019re still able to meet the needs by our advertising partners when it comes to traditional ads, we want to lean in much heavier to the native ads,\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky of Allrecipes said.", "Advertisers themselves, however, are far less concerned about ad blocking than they are about other issues, like ad fraud and viewability. In part, that is because advertisers do not pay for ads that are blocked, several ad industry executives said. More than that, industry executives see the rise of ad blockers as a self-created beast, fed by longstanding pressure to cram data-heavy, annoying ads onto the page. But where publishers might be worried, the ad industry instead sees ad blockers as an impetus to make advertising simpler and more engaging.", "\u201cAdvertisers and agencies have to raise their game,\u201d said Ben Winkler, the chief digital officer at the agency OMD. \u201cNot only will bad advertising be ignored, it may never be seen.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/technology/google-unveils-new-chromecast-devices-to-connect-smartphone-and-tv.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple used a flashy stage show this month to lay out a vision for how it wants to take over your living room.

I\u2019m also including Google Flights, which allows travelers to see if they can save money by departing days or weeks later, or by flying into or out of a different airport.", "The sites and apps are free. And in most cases, users are instructed to book through the airline, or airlines if they decide to buy a \u201chacker fare\u201d (more on that shortly).", "My go-to tool is Google Flights. It\u2019s swift yet comprehensive. And it has the essential filters (like fare class and stops) but requires few keystrokes to unearth all that information. Plug your travel dates into the search box and monthly calendars pop up with fares on each day (green fares are lowest), so you\u2019ll instantly know if you should tweak your arrival or departure to score a better deal.", "Google Flights is also my top pick because it makes searching for premium economy, business and first class fares simpler than most of its competitors, thanks to a drop-down menu on its landing page. Enter your dates, click on the fare class menu, and you\u2019ll see the lowest price for each class. A recent search for an October flight from New York to San Francisco showed the lowest economy fare as $337. For premium economy it was $737, and for business and first class it was $982. A \u201ctip\u201d at the top of the page said I could knock $208 off the business-class fare by leaving a day later and returning two days later.", "The site works smoothly on smartphones as well, but if you often browse flights on your phone, you may also want to try Hopper, which introduced an Android version of its iOS app last month.", "A few caveats: Hopper doesn\u2019t turn up flights by American Airlines and US Airways (they don\u2019t share flight data with Hopper), so you can\u2019t one-stop shop. And because the app is focused on the lowest price, it\u2019s not ideal if you primarily search for premium economy, business or first class seats.", "That said, the app is intuitive to use. I selected my departure and arrival airports and up popped color-coded fare calendars. Green dates had the best deals from New York to San Francisco ($325) and red dates had the most costly fares ($750). A summary noted that good deals for nonstop flights started around $350; flights with stops averaged about $50 less.", "When I selected my October dates, the app said the lowest round-trip fare was $341. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a great price,\u201d the app noted, \u201cbut you will likely pay more if you wait.\u201d (A price prediction scale said fares were expected to climb at least $195 after Oct. 4.)

Shopping here is the most fun when you use filters such as \u201cflight quality,\u201d which allows you to see, say, flights with Wi-Fi. Here too is where you can filter for \u201chacker fares\u201d: those that combine one-way tickets to or from a destination on different airlines, resulting in occasional bargains.", "If this intrigues you, then check out Skypicker, a Czech start-up that finds combinations of flights among airlines such as Spirit and United. For instance, the site turned up flights from New York for an October weekend in Chicago for around $140 using JetBlue and US Airways.", "Another nascent contender, Flyr, also advises travelers when to pounce. There are nifty graphs, and I see the potential, though Flyr has some shortcomings. The site can feel confusing; there are few options on the landing page; and American Airlines flights didn\u2019t show up in my searches, to name a few.", "One thing that distinguishes Flyr is that it allows undecided users to temporarily lock in a fare with no commitment to purchase the ticket (the few bucks you pay to lock in the fare are nonrefundable). That\u2019s helpful. Flyr will refund you up to $200 if your fare increases in that period and let you keep the lower price if the fare goes down. Note though that in some of my searches it was cheaper to lock in the fare directly on the airline\u2019s website. For instance, to hold the same United round-trip flight for seven days was $11 on Flyr and $8.99 on United.com. Lock in the fare through the airline\u2019s site and if the price goes up, you\u2019ve already secured the lower fare. If it goes down, you don\u2019t have to buy the ticket you\u2019re holding. Just book a new one at the lower price.", "Still, if, like me, you enjoy airfare hunting, it\u2019s probably worth revisiting Flyr when it has matured.", "Whatever farecasting tool you try, check the number of stops, time between connections, and trip duration (flights that are normally two hours can become 20 hours with layovers on some sites). No fare is a deal if you have to sprint through an airport only to miss the next leg of your trip, or spend more time flying from coast to coast than to Asia."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/opinion/breaking-up-big-tech-would-harm-consumers.html": ["To the Editor:", "Re \u201cBig Tech Has Become Way Too Powerful\u201d (Sunday Review, Sept. 20): Robert B.

Is he so different that he could even win?", "Mr. Trump may be very different from past candidates, but his story could easily end the way theirs did. He remains an extreme long shot, for the same reasons that no candidate remotely like him has ever come close to winning a presidential nomination.", "His chances will depend on the extent that his celebrity, media prowess and self-funding can defy the party elites who traditionally decide nomination contests. Those assets may be enough for him to brush aside the attacks that have quickly caused other campaigns to implode in the past.

But the party has succeeded in swaying voters even if conservatives have big reservations, as was the case with Mr. McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. It might be harder for the party to reach that point this year, with such a large field, but the field will eventually narrow.", "In both those elections, the establishment prevailed by swaying voters in blue and purple states. The 2008 contest was decided on Super Tuesday with big victories by Mr. McCain in California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois. The 2012 contest took longer to decide, in part because those states were pushed back in the calendar and didn\u2019t vote while the race was competitive, but Mr. Romney fought his way to the nomination with wins in Ohio, Michigan, New Hampshire and Florida.", "The blue-state Republicans are often forgotten because the Republicans who control the House and Senate tend to hail from the red states and districts where the G.O.P. wins elections. But the Obama-voting states still possess the delegates necessary to decide the G.O.P. nomination; Republicans in those states are generally more moderate, less religious and better educated than the red-state Republicans. If it came down to it, G.O.P. campaigns and aligned super PACs could easily spend more than $100 million in California, New York, New Jersey and other big, blue and often winner-take-all states in April, May and June of 2016 to knock Mr. Trump out.", "Would that be the party deciding, or the voters?"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/adam-grant-friends-at-work-not-so-much.html": ["ONCE, work was a major source of friendships.

Some people think pleasantries have no place in professional meetings.", "In a study led by the social psychologist Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Anglo-American, Mexican and Mexican-American participants watched a four-minute video of two people working together. Shortly after, the Americans generally remembered just as much as the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans about the task, but much less about the social interaction. Anglo-Americans struggled to remember the socioemotional aspects, such as smiling, handshaking and discussions about movies and weekend plans. In other studies, Americans were less likely to notice subtleties in communication when a message was described as having been sent from a manager at a large company than when the same message was supposedly sent from a friend. There was no such discrepancy between the professional and personal among people from China or South Korea.", "Why are Americans so determined to get down to business?", "The economic explanation is that long-term employment has essentially vanished: Instead of spending our careers at one organization, we expect to jump ship every few years. Since we don\u2019t plan to stick around, we don\u2019t invest in the same way. We view co-workers as transitory ties, greeting them with arms-length civility while reserving real camaraderie for outside work.

In an experiment, Professor Sanchez-Burks randomly assigned people to dress and act professionally or casually, and then tracked their mimicry of a specific interpersonal cue. When Protestant men dressed professionally and solved a business case, they mimicked this social cue at half the rate of those who wore Hawaiian garb and generated vacation ideas. The attire and task had no impact on women and non-Protestant men: They caught the cues regardless of what they were wearing and doing.", "The sociologist Max Weber classically argued that the Protestant Reformation had a peculiar effect on American work. At the dawn of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther preached that hard work in any occupation was a meaningful duty \u2014 a calling from God. John Calvin took this idea a step further, arguing that people should avoid socializing while working, as attention to relationships and emotions would distract them from productively fulfilling God\u2019s will. Over the generations, these Calvinist teachings influenced Protestants, who came to view social considerations as inappropriate and inefficient in the workplace. Protestant men were especially susceptible, as they were expected and socialized to focus on productivity.

The proportion of Protestant chief executives has declined, too. Why, then, does the Protestant ethic persist?", "A generational shift has reinforced the transactional mind-set in American workplaces, regardless of sex and religion. Although the evidence is strong that different generations generally want similar things out of work, the value placed on leisure time has increased steadily. When the psychologist Jean M. Twenge led an analysis of work preference surveys completed by high school seniors in 1976, 1991 and 2006, 17 percent of baby boomers strongly valued more than two weeks of vacation time, compared with 25 percent of Generation X and 31 percent of millennials.", "When we see our jobs primarily as a means to leisure, it\u2019s easy to convince ourselves that efficiency should reign supreme at work so we have time for friendships outside work.", "BUT we may be underestimating the impact of workplace friendships on our happiness \u2014 and our effectiveness.

In the old days, he would sketch all his mascots by hand and shape the structural foam for each oversize head with a pair of scissors and a knife. It was painstaking work.

Now, he has graphic designers who use computer programs to create models and patterns.", "\u201cIf you want another Youppi, it\u2019ll be perfect,\u201d said Tremblay, whose company continues to produce Youppi clones for the Montreal Canadiens, who adopted the mascot not long after the Expos left town in 2004. \u201cIn my time, you could see the difference. Or at least I could see the difference. Now, it\u2019s all perfect.\u201d", "Too perfect, perhaps. He cannot help but worry that something gets lost in the mechanized process.

Though it finished behind teams from South Korea and Florida, CHIMP made robot history by falling and then returning to its feet. Other robots fell over without getting back up.", "\u2018\u2018I aged 10 years when that robot fell down, and I gained it back when he got up again,\u2019\u2019 says Herman Herman, the director of the center, who has worked there since its founding 20 years ago.

These include producing better maps and safer guidance systems \u2014 and most lucrative, even if they\u2019re still years away, Uber\u2019s very own fleet of self-driving cars.", "It was a startling raid of talent. By offering private-sector salaries substantially higher than university equivalents (as well as a chance to earn equity in a fast-rising tech firm), Uber was able to acquire a hefty chunk of the center\u2019s brain trust, including some top experts in autonomous vehicles. In doing so, the company has placed a bet that self-driving robots are no longer the stuff of scholarly visions but valuable intellectual property.", "Carnegie Mellon\u2019s experience is a familiar one in the world of high-tech research. As a field matures, universities can wake up one day to find money flooding the premises; suddenly they\u2019re in a talent war with deep-pocketed firms from Silicon Valley. The impacts are also intellectual. When researchers leave for industry, their expertise winks off the map; they usually can\u2019t publish what they discover \u2014 or even talk about it over drinks with former colleagues. In the long run, raids can generate symbiotic relationships; researchers who return to academia years later bring their real-world experience into the classroom and can draw on their network of wealthy industry contacts to fund university research. But as Carnegie Mellon\u2019s roboticists are finding, reaching that end point can make for a bumpy ride.", "There\u2019s a useful high-tech concept called the Technology Readiness Level that helps explain why Uber pounced when it did. NASA came up with this scale to gauge the maturity of a given field of applied science. At Level 1, an area of scientific inquiry is so new that nobody understands its basic principles. At Level 9, the related technology is so mature it\u2019s ready to be used in commercial products. \u2018\u2018Basically, 1 is like Newton figuring out the laws of gravity, and 9 is you\u2019ve been launching rockets into space, constantly and reliably,\u2019\u2019 says Jeff Legault, the director of strategic business development at the National Robotics Engineering Center.", "Today\u2019s early-stage inquiry \u2014 so-called basic research, the Level 1 work, where scientists are still puzzling over fundamental questions \u2014 is financed almost exclusively by the federal government. It\u2019s too far out, too speculative, to attract much investment; it isn\u2019t clear if anyone will make any money on it. This wasn\u2019t always the case. Decades ago, corporations were more willing to engage in Level 1, moonshot research. Bell Labs supported the work that led to the transistor when it was far from clear that there would be a market for it; Xerox supported research into the \u2018\u2018windows\u2019\u2019 style of computing years before the market existed for such an interface. But in the last few decades, the vista of corporate R.&\u2009D. has shrunk as markets and executives have focused more on short-term profit, says Marc Kastner, an M.I.T. physicist. The far-off research questions have been left to university labs, though they struggle, too: The percentage of the federal budget devoted to basic research is about half of what it was in 1968.", "These days, private industry gets involved mostly when a field of research has matured to the midpoint of the NASA scale. In the \u201990s and early \u201900s this happened to \u2018\u2018machine learning,\u2019\u2019 the science of getting machines to recognize patterns. It had long been an academic concern.

But the intellectual register of their work changes. No more exploring hard, \u2018\u2018basic\u2019\u2019 problems out of deep curiosity; they need to solve problems that will make their employers money.

In 1979, the university founded its Robotics Institute to tackle the basic problems in the field, like how to interpret sensor data so a robot could \u2018\u2018see.\u2019\u2019 But by the \u201980s, government agencies and private firms struggling to create industrial and military robots were asking Carnegie Mellon\u2019s roboticists for help. To capitalize on this demand, the school established its National Robotics Engineering Center in 1995 and staffed it with a few faculty members and a large complement of full-time engineers, often young robotics graduates.", "In effect, Carnegie Mellon used the NASA scale to carve up its robotics research. The Robotics Institute would handle research from Levels 1 to 3 or 4, while the center would take technology from there and move it to 7. If John Deere approached the center for help with a self-driving tractor, for example, the center would produce a prototype that could be mass-produced while publishing its research publicly.", "\u2018\u2018Typically,\u2019\u2019 Legault says, \u2018\u2018people who call us, they\u2019ve been looking around, and there\u2019s nobody else who can solve their problem.\u2019\u2019", "By the late 2000s, the field of \u201cwheeled robots\u201d was taking off. Google had started its effort to make self-driving cars, and in 2007 roboticists at Carnegie Mellon won a military competition to produce a car that could navigate city streets; automakers were developing systems to help drivers stay in their lanes. A sort of Silicon Valley of robotics began to emerge in Pittsburgh as investors funneled money to firms like 4Moms (which makes robotized strollers) and Aethon (robots that deliver supplies in hospitals), heavily staffed by former Carnegie Mellon robotics experts. Today, nearly a third of the university\u2019s faculty in the field are involved in a start-up on the side.", "\u2018\u2018If you\u2019re well versed in the area of robotics right now and you\u2019re not working on self-driving cars, you\u2019re either an idiot or you have more of a passion for something else,\u2019\u2019 says Jerry Pratt, head of a robotics team in Pensacola that worked on a humanoid robot that beat Carnegie Mellon\u2019s CHIMP in this year\u2019s contest. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a multibillion- if not trillion-dollar industry.\u2019\u2019", "This precise epiphany was dawning on many at the National Robotics Engineering Center. One was John Bares, who ran the lab from 1997 to 2010.

Bares wanted to invent something and then sell it himself. \u2018\u2018I just had the itch to do product,\u2019\u2019 he says. In 2010, he left the center to found a start-up, Carnegie Robotics. Within a year, his team built a robot that could detect land mines, which the Army bought.", "In 2014, Bares got an email from Uber that led to a meeting with its chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Kalanick said he planned to open a lab in Pittsburgh and told Bares that Uber\u2019s mission was to increase the efficient use of cars, which would have environmental benefits. Bares was persuaded, and in January of this year he joined Uber. He knew that many of his former colleagues at Carnegie Mellon shared his entrepreneurial impulses.", "Back at the lab, in fact, a group was already preparing to break away. One of Uber\u2019s recent hires from the National Robotics Engineering Center told me that he and his 20-person team had long found their lab work rewarding, but that they had been stunned by the rush of money into robotics in recent years: Google bought Nest, the Internet-connected thermostat firm, for $3.2 billion; Makerbot, a start-up that creates inexpensive 3-D printers, was acquired by another company for $604 million. \u2018\u2018We were just flabbergasted,\u2019\u2019 he says, adding that his team could have invented those products \u2018\u2018in two weeks.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018I have this big, well-tuned machine of a team, standing there looking at me saying, \u2018Hey, man, when the hell are we going to do something big?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he says. His response was: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m an entrepreneur at heart. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u2019 He visited venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and lined up tens of millions of dollars to fund a robotics start-up. By summer 2014, he informed the National Robotics Engineering Center that he and his team meant to exit on Jan. 1 this year.", "Then Bares made his own offer: Join Uber\u2019s new lab, where, he said, \u2018\u2018their efforts would impact the world.\u2019\u2019 The team would get bigger salaries, and Uber could produce their inventions quickly. The team leader agonized over the choice; he\u2019d spent the last year dreaming of his own start-up. But he opted for Uber. \u2018\u2018They have the road map, and they have the fuel,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018They just need some tech. Here they are with an actual market for what we do.\u2019\u2019", "The scale of Uber\u2019s recruitment surprised nearly everyone I spoke to. \u2018\u2018I know of no place that was raided like that,\u2019\u2019 says Julio Ottino, dean of the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University. People at Carnegie Mellon did not want to talk about it; they declined even to confirm how many staff members had left. \u2018\u2018In an academic institution, people do come and go,\u2019\u2019 Herman says. \u2018\u2018The only unique thing here was the number is slightly larger.\u2019\u2019 In a typical year, he says, between five and 10 researchers leave for industry. \u2018\u2018I tell people, \u2018After you work here for a few years, you can get a job anywhere.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "The departures left Herman and Moore, who last year returned from Google to Carnegie Mellon as dean of the computer science school, scrambling to find replacements. They\u2019ve already hired a dozen new researchers, from institutions like Columbia University. In the long run, though, Moore says, they have to develop their own young scientists, encouraging robotics grad students to apply to the center: \u2018\u2018We\u2019re responsible for building all these duplicates of all these luminaries in robotics.\u2019\u2019", "Many familiar with Carnegie Mellon say the raid had a silver living, because it signals that the university is a hot place to work. One of those is Richard Florida, the urban-studies scholar who argues for the economic role of the \u2018\u2018creative class\u2019\u2019 in a city\u2019s economy. Florida himself was a social scientist at Carnegie Mellon for years, and his 2002 book, \u2018\u2018The Rise of the Creative Class,\u2019\u2019 was inspired in part by his noticing, in the \u201990s, that engineers there with a good high-tech idea had to leave for the East or West Coast to find investors, and they rarely came back. \u2018\u2018Pittsburgh has always been this caldron, but they couldn\u2019t get scale,\u2019\u2019 Florida says. \u2018\u2018What Uber provides is immediate scale.\u2019\u2019 And funding: This month, the company announced a $5.5 million gift to Carnegie Mellon to support a new robotics chair and three fellowships.", "A booming local industry gives \u2014 but also, inevitably, takes. Stanford gains luster from Silicon Valley, along with money for research. But the valley lures away promising scholars; in recent years, several have decamped to oversee online-course start-ups, for example, like Sebastian Thrun (who founded Udacity) and Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng (who created Coursera).", "\u2018\u2018Nobody is happy about that, but those are decisions that the faculty make, and they make them for rational reasons,\u2019\u2019 says Jennifer Widom, who led Stanford\u2019s computer-science department from 2009 to 2014. Short-term faculty stints in industry can be a good thing, she points out, because those who return can share with students their hard-won practical knowledge.", "The deeper impact of Uber\u2019s hiring may be how it affects what ideas roboticists will pursue. After all, 20 years ago, if you wanted to push the frontiers of robotics, you had primarily abstract academic options to consider. But now that the field is booming, a faculty member or grad student with an ambitious idea has to ask questions: Where\u2019s the best place to pursue my research \u2014 at a university, or in the corporate R.&\u2009D. lab at a place like Uber? What type of engineering work is so far out, so hard and so unsolved that it can only be done at a university?", "Moore says there is still blue-sky work to be done in robotics. One example is the problem of \u2018\u2018grasping.\u2019\u2019 Sure, wheeled robots can steer themselves through an Amazon shipping center pretty accurately; a self-driving car can trundle around San Francisco without running people over. But no robot can yet match the dexterity of a human hand. It can\u2019t fluidly and confidently manipulate objects on a table \u2014 like picking up a coffee mug (assuming it can first identify it). This is, Moore notes, a huge research challenge in the humanitarian and health fields, because such robots could transform the lives of people with mobility issues, including both the elderly and people with spinal-cord injuries.", "\u2018\u2018There\u2019s maybe about one million people in the United States who, if they dropped their TV remote on the floor, just have to wait for a caregiver to come along and pick it up for them,\u2019\u2019 Moore says. Grasping is a classic early-stage technology, one that the Ubers of the world won\u2019t spend any time developing because the payoffs are too far away. Moore says he also wants this research done in a university setting so the results will be published openly and benefit the world at large.", "But given the lucrative payouts that come when Silicon Valley decides to invest in a field \u2014 compared with the evaporating federal funds for \u2018\u2018basic\u2019\u2019 research \u2014 will there even be academics who want to do early-stage, public-minded work?", "Based on my conversations at Carnegie Mellon, there are many such idealists left. One of them is Siddhartha Srinivasa, a leading expert on manipulation in the Robotics Institute who works on adding intelligence to robot limbs. Right now, someone with a spinal-cord injury can get a robot to pick up a spoon and use it to eat a meal. But the arm is so laborious to control that a single sip from a bowl takes fully 10 minutes. If Srinivasa succeeds, the arm will intuit a gesture (\u2018\u2018Feed me some soup\u2019\u2019) and complete the task on its own.", "Srinivasa is 37, and after a decade at Carnegie Mellon is frequently approached by firms \u2014 \u2018\u2018the Googles and Ubers and others of the world\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but he has yet to abandon academia. He says he doesn\u2019t want to give up the intellectual freedom, the ability to do good for the world at large without worrying about profit. Still, he acknowledges industry\u2019s attractions. It\u2019s not just money; it\u2019s also validation. Investors and customers paying for your work is proof that it truly works.", "\u2018\u2018It\u2019s like the Uber thing, right?\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018You can come up with a scheduling algorithm, but does it work when there are 50,000 people trying to do this? How does it scale? Does it work when somebody comes and pours grease over your robot arm? Like, I don\u2019t know, and I want to know.\u2019\u2019 Last year, Srinivasa created his own part-time start-up in part to try to answer that question. The lab is still where ideas are born, but the market is now where they are put to the test."]}

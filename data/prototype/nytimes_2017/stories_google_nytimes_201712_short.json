This is true not just of theater but of love and also of the Broadway titan Harold Prince\u2019s new memoir, \u201cSense of Occasion\u201d \u2014 which is to a large degree his old memoir, annotated and updated considerably, but left with its fine patina essentially undisturbed.", "I didn\u2019t realize this until I paid $50 cash for a copy of Prince\u2019s out-of-print 1974 book \u201cContradictions\u201d to a rabbi who produced it from a plastic shopping bag in his ophthalmologist\u2019s Upper West Side waiting room. Everything about this transaction recalled a vanishing Manhattan.", "But Prince is not crippled by nostalgia. With glasses pushed atop his head in this book\u2019s cover photo, he gazes fiercely forward \u2014 despite the recent revue \u201cPrince of Broadway\u201d showcasing his copious and varied career highlights, which closed on Oct. 29, maybe because no one needed reminding.", "\u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d is the longest-running show ever on Broadway and haunts theaters the world over.

You keep strict accounts but get on with it.", "He doesn\u2019t discuss being adopted, by a stockbroker and his wife who nudged him into orchestra seats rather than baseball bleachers, but does mention a nervous breakdown at age 14, after a serious reduction in the family\u2019s circumstances during the Great Depression. Gone was the Pierce-Arrow motor car, the apartment near the Museum of Natural History. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t find a life in the theater, how the hell would I live?\u201d young Hal worried.", "With a chutzpah that would be impossible in the age of Google he faked a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that led him to the office of the Broadway eminence George Abbott. Their relationship was interrupted only by the mentee\u2019s stint in the Army and the mentor\u2019s death in 1995 at 107.", "Watching the creators of \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d trying to focus its theme, Prince learned the importance of metaphor. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about this milkman marrying off his five daughters. \u2026 Well, it\u2019s about the tough life of a Jew in Christian Russia.\u201d", "Jerome Robbins: \u201cBut what\u2019s it really about?\u201d", "Sheldon Harnick: \u201cForgodsakes, it\u2019s about tradition!\u201d", "And the rest is royalties.", "There are a few tantalizing glimpses of Prince\u2019s 55-year marriage to the former Judy Chaplin (daughter of Saul, the Academy Award-winning arranger and composer). She was a ballerina and pianist whom he met in Paris, and whose ambitions he regrets curtailing. There\u2019s also a perhaps inevitable cameo from Donald J. Trump. But those seeking gossip about, say, Patti LuPone on the set of \u201cEvita\u201d will be disappointed. This is a record of work.", "Where Abbott sought to entertain, Prince has striven to elevate. And the most important characters in his book and his world are not himself or the star actors, but his collaborators, who have always included the audience. This autobiography is not the grand chandelier crashing down as at the end of the first act of \u201cPhantom,\u201d but a series of warming, twinkling lights."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/same-sex-marriage-cake-court.html": ["At my middle brother\u2019s wedding, the cake was so good I ate three slices.

Thank you!\u201d My brother responded, \u201cWhy do you still have this?\u201d As if there were other things to store on my phone besides thousands of pictures of things I\u2019ve eaten.", "My youngest brother had a Baltimore-themed reception; the cake was a giant Berger Cookie, a specialty of the city. Years later, I was reminiscing with my mother and lamented not taking some cake home with me. \u201cWhy do you remember this?\u201d she asked. I replied, \u201cIt seemed important.\u201d", "If you have good cake at your wedding, I will send you a handwritten thank-you note every year. If you have bad wedding cake, I will complain about you with my dying breath. And God help the baker who comes between me and my cake.", "On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. Masterpiece Cakeshop sounds to me like the name of a lavish PBS dramatization of \u201cThe Great British Bake Off\u201d in period costume. It\u2019s not, unfortunately. In 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins, a same-sex couple, visited a Colorado bakery to order a wedding cake. The men were set to marry in Massachusetts, as it wasn\u2019t yet legal for them to do so in Colorado. However, their desire to share their union with their community prompted them to hold a reception in Denver. Enter cake. The bakery owner, Jack Phillips, turned them down, citing a religious objection. The couple sued, claiming the bakery violated Colorado\u2019s anti-discrimination law.", "Ostensibly, this is a free-speech case. The baker has a right, as an individual, to express his disapproval of the choice of two men to make a life together. Does he have the right to convert that disapproval into refusing service? When granted the right to marry, are we also granted the right to a wedding and a host of other cultural expressions?", "The baker\u2019s opinion about marriage isn\u2019t one that a majority of Americans hold. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that Americans support same-sex marriage by a margin of nearly two-to-one. Forty-seven percent of Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats voiced support of same-sex marriage in a 2017 Gallup poll. But what these numbers don\u2019t reflect is how these views manifest themselves in daily life for L.G.B.T. Americans. This case is a public reminder that, though the law may guarantee a right, an individual\u2019s actions can affect the way a group experiences its freedom.", "I started planning my wedding in 2015, before I was engaged and before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges made marriage equality the law of the land. I had a Google Doc full of pictures of obsidian tulips and interracial cake toppers, waiting on the world to change. My now-husband didn\u2019t know what I was up to. But that didn\u2019t matter. I was setting intentions for everything from my destiny to my cake flavors, irrespective of what the law would allow. However, once I started planning in earnest, I realized that actually executing a wedding is miserable and all I wanted was to begin my life with my husband as soon as possible.", "Nothing has surprised me more than finding out I abhorred wedding planning. I consider myself a mix of Auntie Mame and the guy who is always dropping by Ina Garten\u2019s house just in time for crudit\u00e9s and gossip. Putting on a huge to-do is what I was born for. I see it as part of a queer cultural inheritance: a resilient determination to celebrate, despite oppressive social policies.", "It felt like the dream of my ancestors that I would be able to register for expensive gravy boats and sign a document held in City Hall. It also felt like a chore.", "The saving grace of the monthslong gantlet was the promise of wedding expos. Americans spent an average of $35,329 on their weddings in 2016, according to a survey by the wedding site TheKnot.com. As in any other lucrative industry, there are thousands of vendors \u2014 caterers, florists, lighting designers \u2014 who would love nothing more than to help couples create their special day, for a price. Those vendors come together under one roof to lobby for business at wedding expos, which are like an office supply fair crossed with the Golden Globes. My dream.", "\u201cI have been waiting for this moment my entire life,\u201d I told my husband-to-be, David, clutching my first expo registration like a golden ticket. \u201cThere will be so much free cake! There will be brochures! About napkins!\u201d I waxed rhapsodic about signing onto the mailing lists of various D.J.\u2019s; he nodded. He expressed regrets he couldn\u2019t join. He\u2019s a pastor and the expo was on a Sunday, a work day.", "I wasn\u2019t about to let religious expression get in the way of my pursuit of cake samples, so I went alone.", "\u201cWhere\u2019s the bride-to-be?\u201d a vendor asked as I stared at his tower of orchids.

I shrugged. \u201cApparently, you\u2019re invisible without a bride,\u201d I said.", "She told me she understood. She wore scrubs, with her hair tied back, a marked difference from the party-casual dress of many other attendees. She explained that she was a vet and had accidentally left her engagement ring at work. Grabbing two more slices of cake, we wandered away from the table.", "We were interrupted by a voice: \u201cHello, young lovers!\u201d We found ourselves in front of a centerpiece vendor who hadn\u2019t had time for me earlier. A woman behind the table waved at us. \u201cSo, when\u2019s the big day?\u201d I looked at the vet. The vet replied, \u201cAugust.\u201d", "\u201cHow big?\u201d the vendor asked.", "\u201c150 people?\u201d I said.", "\u201cSo exciting,\u201d the vendor said, as she cracked open a huge binder. As we excused ourselves, she grabbed my arm. \u201cThere\u2019s Champagne downstairs,\u201d she said, conspiratorially. \u201cMake sure you all get some!\u201d", "Separately, the vet and I were two lonely, barely visible people with icing on our fingers. Together, we became a charming young black couple with a summer wedding and a deep interest in as many bite-size shortcakes as we could find. We looked the way people expected young and cake-worthy couples to look.", "We agreed to take this expo for everything it had to offer. It turns out heteronormativity is a very effective con.", "We bounced from table to table, collecting samples and spinning a tale of our joint bliss. At one point, taking a break from fish tacos and parfait trays, we leaned over a balcony and confessed that the process was harder than we\u2019d thought it was going to be. Money was shorter; time was fleeting; nothing felt magical. It was easy to feel you were doing it all wrong.", "\u201cThank you for being here,\u201d I said.

The bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over the coming decade.", "Far from simplifying taxes, the bill opened up a whole range of tactics to lower the amount owed to the Internal Revenue Service. \u201cBusiness owners or managers that plan well and pay for good advice will be able to achieve much more favorable rates,\u201d said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Treasury Department official. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that is a loophole or the intent of the legislation.\u201d", "One of the bill\u2019s biggest windfalls for the wealthy \u2014 cutting taxes on income received through so-called pass-through entities like partnerships, popular with real estate developers \u2014 got even more generous.

This break will still save the companies roughly half a trillion dollars compared with current law, according to an estimate by the Zion Research Group.", "Banks and other financial institutions will still be able to avoid taxes by making payments to offshore subsidiaries. The lawmakers had initially intended to prevent the tax benefits from such actions, but the banks got a last-minute reprieve for some transactions. In calculating the companies\u2019 tax bills, the bill excludes payments related to derivatives, a big source of income for financial institutions.", "Some last-minute changes were smaller and more peculiar: The bill includes limits on how much interest companies can deduct from their taxes, but excludes from those restrictions interest paid by car dealerships.", "The bill extends so-called bonus depreciation \u2014 the ability to take big deductions related to certain corporate investments \u2014 at a cost of $34 billion, but pays for it by reinstating the corporate alternative minimum tax. The last-minute decision to scrap the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax left lawyers and accountants scratching their heads about the ultimate impact.

Altman, arrives just in time to help fans celebrate and marinate in 20 years of \u201cBuffy\u201d memories, as well as those of its broody 1999 spinoff \u201cAngel,\u201d which followed Buffy\u2019s former flame to Los Angeles for five seasons of undead detective work. At more than 500 printed pages, the book is a hefty collection of interviews from actors (including the stars, Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz), writers, producers and academics.", "Readers can get the inside scoop on a wide range of topics \u2014 for instance, what it was like to film \u201cHush,\u201d a fourth-season \u201cBuffy\u201d episode that contained only 17 minutes of spoken dialogue in a 44-minute broadcast, or the main reason the \u201cAngel\u201d cast had a major change-up late in its run. The social issues the shows tackled (or not) at the time are also discussed, particularly in regards to WB network concerns: A staff member reveals that the part of Cordelia, Buffy\u2019s acerbic rich pal, was originally meant for a black actress, but spine-free executive worries about interracial relationships thwarted the casting intention. Queer characters eventually fared better.", "For the obsessive viewer, \u201cSlayers & Vampires\u201d is a new primary text to pore over, with plenty of behind-the-scenes tidbits about who hated whom and how TV shows are made. The authors even devote about 10 pages to the \u201cBuffy\u201d cast and crew recalling the creation of \u201cOnce More, With Feeling,\u201d the popular sixth-season musical episode that proved to be a bright spot in the grim American fall of 2001.", "That musical episode, like many of the early \u201cBuffy\u201d scripts, was written and directed by Joss Whedon, the show\u2019s creator and a frequent voice in \u201cSlayers & Vampires.\u201d Dissatisfied with the way his film screenplays were produced by others, he vowed: \u201cThe next person who ruins one of my scripts is going to be me.\u201d", "At the time, Whedon was hailed for the feminist perspective reflected in his work. Some of his quotes in the book support that view, but readers may feel doubts creep in if they\u2019ve read the blistering online essay published last summer by his ex-wife, Kai Cole, alleging infidelity and less-than-feminist behavior during their 16-year marriage; a reference in the book to Whedon giving \u201cpony rides\u201d to his actresses feels retro-squicky. Aside from claiming \u201cinaccuracies and misrepresentations,\u201d he has declined to comment on his ex-wife\u2019s accusations.", "That\u2019s not the only place he declined to comment. At the very end of \u201cSlayers & Vampires,\u201d the authors note that Whedon\u2019s numerous responses were taken from conversations he\u2019d had elsewhere with the co-author Edward Gross. In their acknowledgments, the authors also state that \u201cin almost all cases, material is taken from original interviews\u201d but admit to scraping public comments from news conferences and conventions into the manuscript.", "The revelation that \u201cSlayers & Vampires\u201d is something of a cut-and-paste job is not much of a surprise, given the sometimes-disjointed flow of the commentary, with writers and actors directly contradicting one another as if they weren\u2019t in the same room. Nearly identical comments from the same person appearing a page or two apart also distract. Key actors like Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon (who played two of Buffy\u2019s closest buddies, Willow and Xander) are barely in the book, which is also devoid of photos.", "\u201cSlayers & Vampires\u201d is clearly intended for \u201cBuffy\u201d and \u201cAngel\u201d aficionados, but these dedicated fans are also going to notice skewed representation and authorial slips. For example, in the synopsis describing the excellent second season of \u201cBuffy,\u201d the authors write that events forced \u201cBuffy to turn Mr. Pointy on the former object of her affections.\u201d", "While it sounds like a hip reference, Mr. Pointy was actually the favorite stake of Kendra, the Jamaican slayer who came forth as a plot point in the first season \u2014 and Buffy skewered her beloved with a sword blessed by a virtuous knight who had defeated the demon Acathla centuries before. Seriously, guys, Buffyverse fans notice these details and we get cranky about our fictional realities.", "For those who haven\u2019t seen either \u201cBuffy\u201d or \u201cAngel,\u201d hold off on reading \u201cSlayers & Vampires\u201d unless you want plot spoilers popping up like invading zombies on nearly every page. Better yet, watch the original shows first. All the \u201cBuffy\u201d episodes can be streamed on the Hulu subscription service or purchased as video downloads from the major online video emporiums; \u201cAngel\u201d is less widely available, but Hulu and the Google Play store have all five seasons. With no nostalgia-driven revival in sight, the \u201cBuffy\u201d legacy remains, frozen in time as a glorious pop-culture milestone and perhaps prophesied by one of the Slayer\u2019s lines from the series: \u201cI may be dead, but I\u2019m still pretty.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/briefing/tillerson-merkel-erdogan.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

Schreiber Studio, also in Chelsea, has survived by keeping its classrooms and administrative areas but letting go of its theater.", "In the mid-90s, Schreiber was riding high on the success of at least two former students, Edward Norton and Peter Sarsgaard. Around the same time, the school was offered the opportunity to buy its East 4th Street building, which was located across the street from the experimental theater La MaMa, next door to New York Theater Workshop, and included a theater space, offices, dressing rooms and a downstairs class area, for $90,000. But the money simply wasn\u2019t there, said Sally Dunn, its managing director.", "Instead, the now-49-year-old acting school moved to Chelsea right when it was becoming hot, said Peter Jensen, its artistic director. \u201cYou could just see all the hotels going up,\u201d he said.", "Meanwhile, student interest in the traditional scene-study class \u2014 what Mr. Norton and Mr. Sarsgaard cut their teeth on at Schreiber \u2014 was leaning more toward on-camera, commercial and casting classes, said Mr. Jensen. The whole nature of pursuing acting in New York was evolving, while the costs of teaching the trade were rising.", "By 2017, the school\u2019s annual rent had mushroomed to more than $300,000. Over the summer, to streamline costs, Schreiber reduced its square footage by more than half, giving up its in-house theater, where a full season of plays were regularly produced. For future productions, said Mr. Jensen, the plan going forward will be to rent space from other theaters like the Cherry Lane and the Robert Moss Theater.", "But that might not be as easy or as affordable as hoped. Over the last decade, the city has also lost approximately 50 small performance venues, and according to Ms. Dunch, the arts fundraising expert, this \u201cspace crunch\u201d affects the entire nonprofit theater industry, including acting studios.", "The Barrow Group, which leases space on West 36th Street, has been fortunate enough to hold on to both its theater space and its classrooms, but not without constant challenges. After the 2008 recession, the professional company and school stopped producing for its main stage. It moved its offices into a storage room. Instead of downsizing the school component, however, it expanded it, said Robert Serrell, its current executive director.", "Seth Barrish and Lee Brock, the artistic directors of Barrow, had developed a reputation as actor whisperers, with successful alumni like Anne Hathaway, Tony Hale and the newcomer Noah Schnapp (\u201cStranger Things\u201d). So they decided to capitalize on their signature teaching style by introducing it to more beginners. The school went from offering 70 classes a year in 2010 to 320 classes, 83 of which were for beginners, in 2016. It worked. The studio is also making inroads in higher education, having recently partnered with Quinnipiac University in Connecticut to produce a New Play Festival.", "Main stage productions at Barrow are happening again, some to critical acclaim. That said, the school\u2019s revenue is beginning to plateau and there\u2019s no more space for expansion. The annual rent is around $300,000, with 3.5 percent increases each year, and the booming Hudson Yards development nearby threatens to raise market rates even more. \u201cWith the rising cost of everything, it\u2019s scary,\u201d said Mr. Serrell. \u201cWe\u2019re a $2.1 million company; we\u2019re still scratching our heads. It\u2019s terrifically challenging, but we\u2019re determined to figure it out.\u201d", "Perhaps the answer is to leave Manhattan. The Atlantic looked in Brooklyn, but \u201cit\u2019s not any less expensive,\u201d said Ms. McCann.

The two-year conservatory, with an optional third year, costs about $8,000 annually.", "Although students are treated to regular Facebook Live events with movie stars and solo performance workshops, the focus remains on traditional stagecraft and acting technique.

He also emphasized China\u2019s technological prowess, and said more should be done by the government to guide the development of new industries like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.", "Mr. Wang stepped onto the world stage before an audience that included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, along with an all-star cast of Chinese tech entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma of Alibaba.", "Mr. Wang, 62, had emerged as the ideological counselor to Chinese leaders and the wordsmith of Mr. Xi\u2019s more authoritarian style before being tapped to join the Standing Committee at a Communist Party congress in Beijing two months ago. A close confidant of Mr. Xi and the two previous Chinese presidents, Mr. Wang was promoted despite never having governed a province or run a state ministry.", "On Sunday, Mr. Wang praised China\u2019s president for his \u201cdeep understanding\u201d of internet governance. He said the international community had \u201cwarmly received\u201d Mr. Xi\u2019s ideas about the internet, including the concept of cybersovereignty \u2014 a Chinese policy term used to argue that countries should be free to control the internet within their borders, even if it means censoring.", "\u201cGlobal cyberspace governance has no onlookers \u2014 we are all participants,\u201d he said, adding that \u201call parties\u201d should have a say over how the internet is managed across the world.", "The speech echoed arguments that Mr. Wang has made before. In the 1990s, as a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, he wrote that because China was so large and poor, it needed a stronger hand from the government to push through economic development. He said that such authoritarian rule was necessary for China to restore its national greatness after what the Communist Party has often described as a century of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers.", "This has made Mr. Wang a longtime skeptic of calls for China to allow greater democracy despite his extensive experience abroad, including in the United States. And while he has said he admires the strength of the United States, Mr. Wang has also been deeply wary of American power.", "His speech on Sunday showed how China\u2019s vision of the internet attempts to wrestle with such tension. Chinese leaders have long lauded the economic power of the internet, while being deeply cautious about its democratizing and internationalizing influence.", "In his speech, Mr. Wang highlighted China\u2019s openness and the need for equal access to the internet. Yet China has led the way in cutting its internet off from the world with filters and blocks known as the Great Firewall of China. It has also blocked internet access in areas where members of minority groups live, to limit the potential for unrest.", "Such contradictions were evident at the World Internet Conference, which was dreamed up by Chinese officials who wanted to create a Davos-style conference for technology. It has been held annually since 2014 in Wuzhen, an ancient canal town about 75 miles from Shanghai.", "While many major foreign websites are blocked in China, the wireless connections at the conference allowed open access to the global internet. A promotional video that was shown before Mr. Wang\u2019s speech showed the web connecting China to the world, ignoring the existence of the Great Firewall.", "For the format of his talk, Mr. Wang followed the lead of Mr. Xi. His offering of five proposals appeared to have been inspired by a speech by Mr. Xi at the second World Internet Conference, when the president offered five ideas for developing the internet.", "The conference also marked a fresh start of sorts for its organizer, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the government body that also oversees the country\u2019s internet. Weeks before the conference, the Chinese state media reported that the administration\u2019s former head, Lu Wei, was put under investigation by the Communist Party\u2019s anticorruption agency.", "Mr. Lu\u2019s successor, Xu Lin, was present at the conference, which also included more prominent foreign chief executives than in the past, including Sundar Pichai of Google and Mr. Cook of Apple. Analysts say Mr. Xu has been ordered to consolidate the administration\u2019s power, and also turn the conference into a higher-profile event.", "In his speech, Mr. Cook highlighted Apple\u2019s contribution to China\u2019s economy, saying that Chinese developers have earned more than 112 billion renminbi, or $16.9 billion, by selling apps to Apple users, more than developers from any other country.", "The presence of Mr. Cook and Mr. Pichai lends a stronger credibility to a conference that has struggled to attract top executives from overseas.

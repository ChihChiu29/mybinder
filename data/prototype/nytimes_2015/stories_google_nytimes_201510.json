Current technology puts the keys for access to the information in the hands of the individual user, not the companies.", "The first indication of the retreat came on Thursday, when the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that the administration would not seek legislation to compel the companies to create such a portal.", "But the decision, made at the White House a week ago, goes considerably beyond that.", "While the administration said it would continue to try to persuade companies like Apple and Google to assist in criminal and national security investigations, it determined that the government should not force them to breach the security of their products. In essence, investigators will have to hope they find other ways to get what they need, from data stored in the cloud in unencrypted form or transmitted over phone lines, which are covered by a law that affects telecommunications providers but not the technology giants.", "Mr. Comey had expressed alarm a year ago after Apple introduced an operating system that encrypted virtually everything contained in an iPhone. What frustrated him was that Apple had designed the system to ensure that the company never held on to the keys, putting them entirely in the hands of users through the codes or fingerprints they use to get into their phones. As a result, if Apple is handed a court order for data \u2014 until recently, it received hundreds every year \u2014 it could not open the coded information.", "Mr. Comey compared that system to the creation of a door no law officers could enter, or a car trunk they could not unlock. His concern about what the F.B.I. calls the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem received support from the director of the National Security Agency and other intelligence officials.", "But after a year of study and extensive White House debate, President Obama and his advisers have reached a broad conclusion that an effort to compel the companies to give the government access would fail, both politically and technologically.", "\u201cThis looks promising, but there\u2019s still going to be tremendous pressure from law enforcement,\u201d said Peter G. Neumann, one of the nation\u2019s leading computer scientists and a co-author of a paper that examined the government\u2019s proposal for special access. \u201cThe N.S.A. is capable of dealing with the cryptography for now, but law enforcement is going to have real difficulty with this. This is never a done deal.\u201d", "In the paper, released in July, Mr. Neumann and other top cryptographers and computer scientists argued that there was no way for the government to have a back door into encrypted communications without creating an opening that would be exploited by Chinese and Russian intelligence agents, cybercriminals and terrorist groups.", "Inside the White House, the Office of Science and Technology Policy came largely to the same conclusion. Those determinations surprised the F.B.I. and local law enforcement officials, who had believed just months ago that the White House would ultimately embrace their efforts.", "The intelligence agencies were less vocal, which may reflect their greater capability to search for and gather information. The National Security Agency spends vast sums to get around digital encryption, and it has tools and resources that local law enforcement officials still do not have and most likely never will.", "Disclosures by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden showed the extent of the agency\u2019s focus on cracking and circumventing the encryption of digital communications, including those of Apple, Facebook, Google and Yahoo users.", "There were other motivations for the administration\u2019s decision. Mr. Obama and his aides had come to fear that the United States could set a precedent that China and other nations would emulate, requiring Apple, Google and the rest of America\u2019s technology giants to provide them with the same access, officials said.", "Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, sat at the head table with Mr. Obama and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at a state dinner at the White House last month. According to government officials and industry executives, Mr. Cook told Mr. Obama that the Chinese were waiting for an opportunity to seize on administration action to insist that Apple devices, which are also encrypted in China, be open to Beijing\u2019s agents.", "In January, three months after Mr. Comey began pressing companies for special government access, Chinese officials had threatened to do just that: They considered submitting foreign companies to invasive audits and requiring them to build back doors into their hardware and software. Those rules have not been put into effect.", "The Obama administration\u2019s position was also undercut by officials\u2019 inability to keep their own data safe from Chinese hackers, as shown by the extensive cyberattack at the Office of Personnel Management discovered this year. That breach, and its aftermath, called into question whether the government could keep the keys to the world\u2019s communications safe from its adversaries in cyberspace.", "White House officials said they would continue trying to persuade technology companies to help them in investigations, but they did not specify how.", "\u201cAs the president has said, the United States will work to ensure that malicious actors can be held to account, without weakening our commitment to strong encryption,\u201d said Mark Stroh, a spokesman for the National Security Council. \u201cAs part of those efforts, we are actively engaged with private companies to ensure they understand the public safety and national security risks that result from malicious actors\u2019 use of their encrypted products and services. However, the administration is not seeking legislation at this time.\u201d", "But here in Silicon Valley, executives did not think the government\u2019s announcement went far enough.", "According to administration officials and technology executives, Mr. Cook of Apple has pressed the White House for a clear statement that it will never seek a back door in any form, legislative or technical \u2014 a statement he hoped to take to Beijing, Moscow and even London. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has threatened to ban encrypted devices and services, like the iPhone and Facebook\u2019s popular WhatsApp messaging service, but has done nothing so far to make good on that threat.", "Technology executives are determined to reassure customers abroad that American intelligence agencies are not reading their digital communications. It is an effort driven by economics: 64 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue originates overseas.", "Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft argue that people put not only their conversations but their entire digital lives \u2014 medical records, tax returns, bank accounts \u2014 into a device that slips into their pocket. While Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he is sympathetic to the concerns of law enforcement officials, he made clear during a visit to Silicon Valley in February that he was also aware of privacy concerns and that he sought to balance both interests.", "Technologists responded that, with regard to encryption, no such balance existed. \u201cThe real problem is, I don\u2019t see any middle ground for dumbing down everything to make special access possible and having the secure systems we need for commerce, government and everything else,\u201d Mr. Neumann said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/opinion/sunday/longing-for-the-innocence-of-playboy.html": ["YEARS ago, I remember a friend glumly confiding that her then 10-year-old son had gotten completely freaked out.

And so it\u2019s just pass\u00e9 at this juncture,\u201d said Scott Flanders, Playboy\u2019s chief executive.", "With a once-mighty circulation of 5.6 million now hovering around 800,000, Playboy has been left with no choice but to put on its big-girl panties and try to compete with other glossy lad mags and their versions of the Good Life.", "Most men my age, sons of the 1960s and \u201970s, have a Playboy story, whether it involved borrowing one of Dad\u2019s copies or sneaking a peek at their local convenience store.", "But we ladies grew up with Playboy, too.", "My father was not a subscriber, but the neighbors down the street, whose dog I would walk and whose mail I would retrieve when they were on vacation, were. When the magazine would arrive, I\u2019d ever-so-carefully slide it out of its brown paper sleeve and examine the centerfolds, comparing my 12-year-old self with the women who lolled on white-sand beaches or posed, delicately splayed on gorgeously styled beds. Their measurements were all dutifully reported, along with their \u201cturn-ons\u201d and \u201cturnoffs\u201d (which, if memory serves, involved, respectively, \u201clong walks on the beach\u201d and \u201cfake people\u201d).", "Playboy showed me what a pretty girl should look like \u2014 thin, white, young. More, it showed me what boys thought a pretty girl should look like. Unless they sneaked a peek at the hairy, heedless lovers in \u201cThe Joy of Sex,\u201d the only naked female bodies they saw were ones like those proffered by that sophisticated swinging bachelor Hugh Hefner, living the good life at the Playboy Mansion, where celebrities from John Lennon and John Belushi to Bill Cosby cavorted with ambitious lasses in lingerie or body paint.", "Feminists hated Playboy, and its hard-core cousins. In 1983, when I was 13, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin were arguing that pornography was not just offensive but was also a violation of women\u2019s civil rights. Even if the stance made for strange bedfellows \u2014 sharing picket lines with Jerry Falwell and his cronies must have been weird \u2014 at least feminists agreed: Porn was bad. Until we didn\u2019t, and it wasn\u2019t.", "Lucky me, this shift happened right around the time I started college, when sex-positive feminists \u2014 also known as \u201cdo-me feminists,\u201d early prototypes of Gillian Flynn\u2019s Cool Girls \u2014 were down with the nudity, with accompanying boyfriends to strip clubs and with treating porn as if it were no big deal. Playboy seemed sweetly antique as we explored the work of Annie Sprinkle, Susie Bright and Candida Royalle, and began taking responsibility for our own pleasure, which was not always easy in the pre-Internet age. (I look forward to explaining to future great-grandkids how, when I was young, you couldn\u2019t order your vibrators on the Internet, you had to actually walk into a store and buy them.)", "It was confusing \u2014 especially when Hef stepped back and his daughter, Christie Hefner, took the reins of Playboy Enterprises. Can a magazine exploit women if it\u2019s a woman doing the alleged exploiting? What did a real feminist look like? What did she do in bed? Was she a cheerful, dirty-movie-watching, beer-guzzling participant in any act, no matter how outrageous, as long as it was an act of her choosing? Or did she reject the old poses and standards and acts as the artifacts of a system that was never centered on female desire and never had her interests or her satisfaction at heart?", "My guess is that many women my age brokered a series of compromises, shaving our legs (but only when people would see them), performing oral sex like porn stars but insisting on reciprocity (because Betty Friedan would have wanted it that way). We\u2019d drink shots in short skirts, but we\u2019d come up with a series of code words and signals so that our girlfriends could steer us safely home; we\u2019d go teetering down the streets in our cutest, highest heels but clutching cellphones and a bristling fistful of keys as we walked; trying to have it all, do it all, be it all, sometimes without even figuring out which parts of it felt good or right or authentically pleasurable.", "What do feminists want?", "Feminists still can\u2019t agree. A few weeks ago, Susan Brownmiller, the 80-year-old author of the key feminist text \u201cAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,\u201d initiated a thousand tweets about slut-shaming and victim-blaming when she told a reporter, \u201cCulture may tell you, \u2018You can drink as much as men,\u2019 but you can\u2019t.\u201d Before that, the rock star Chrissie Hynde inspired a dozen hot takes when she revealed in her memoir that she\u2019d been raped, and that it was no one\u2019s fault but her own: \u201cYou can\u2019t paint yourself into a corner and then say, \u2018Whose brush is this?\u2019 \u201d", "If things were a mess 20 years ago, they\u2019re even more confusing now.

I think she has a lot of technical bravery both in the studio and live \u2014 as in, she\u2019s not afraid to set herself up to do a crazily virtuosic pattern on the harp at the same time as a bit of tightrope vocal acrobatics.\u201d", "Ms. Newsom strives to build a world within every song. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain level of layering and double-meaning-burying that I do,\u201d she said. \u201cCatching that stuff is not prerequisite to understanding what the song is about. Sometimes it\u2019s stuff that I do because for me, it gives life to the song.", "\u201cI feel like whether or not people are catching it overtly, they\u2019re breathing the air and feeling the ground under their feet,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd as they\u2019re listening to the song, they\u2019re believing in the realness of the world that song occupies. I feel like the realness is derived from these details everywhere \u2014 that every word in the song is serving some substantive purpose. For these super sleuths it\u2019s actually serving a narrative purpose \u2014 which is what the song does for me, but isn\u2019t necessarily what I expected it to do for anyone else.\u201d", "Ms. Newsom said \u201cDivers\u201d is her most unified album. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous word, but I think it\u2019s maybe the closest I\u2019ve come to a concept record, God help us,\u201d she said. After writing the first few songs, including \u201cDivers\u201d and \u201cSapokanikan,\u201d she mapped out a sequence of harmonies for the rest of the album. Then the lyrics took on extra duty: \u201cThey had to have their own little narrative arc but they also had to fit into the sequence,\u201d she said.", "\u201cI had the oddest feeling,\u201d she added. \u201cLike the songs were waiting for me fully formed, in terms of the lyrics at least. It felt like it was all swarming overhead and I was just plucking it and slotting it into place.\u201d", "Ms. Newsom and I visited the Waterhouse & Dodd Gallery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for a close view of photographs by Kim Keever, whose artwork accompanies \u201cDivers\u201d; it\u2019s also at the center of the coming video clip for the album\u2019s title song. One photo at the gallery, akin to the album cover, looked like a rocky, uninhabited landscape below luminous multicolored clouds.", "\u201cI like the fact that it\u2019s not clear whether they represent a period of time before humans, or a period of time after humans, the post-apocalyptic thing, or whether they represent just a part of the world where there are no humans, or whether they represent an iteration of Earth within the multiverse where humans never evolved to exist,\u201d Ms. Newsom said. \u201cAnd I like that the landscapes are viewed from a great distance in most cases, which is an image that comes up for me a lot in these songs, viewing things from above, speeding over landscapes.\u201d", "Actually, Mr. Keever\u2019s photographs document vanishingly brief events. He builds the miniature landscape and immerses it in a 200-gallon aquarium that is filled with water and dramatically lit. From a platform above the aquarium he pushes dyes into the water as the camera catches the swirling, evanescent shapes and colors. There are only a few moments before the water becomes a muddled brown.", "\u201cHis work is about time in a lot of ways,\u201d Ms. Newsom observed. \u201cHe\u2019s depicting these concrete landscapes, scenes we associate with permanence. They\u2019re rock-solid and massive and much bigger than us. But they\u2019re also these works that start disintegrating instantly \u2014 they\u2019re so time-sensitive and time-dependent.\u201d", "Time is a constant concern on \u201cDivers\u201d: historical time, space-time, the human life span, and the rise and fall of romances, cities and cultures. \u201cWaltz of the 101st Lightborne\u201d imagines soldiers who can traverse time as easily as space, leading to \u201ca war between us and our ghosts.\u201d (Ms. Newsom said she came up with \u201c101st Lightborne\u201d as a sci-fi extrapolation of airborne; only recently did she learn that Xbox gamers also have a clan called the 101st Lightborne. \u201cI need to use Google more,\u201d she said with a sigh.)", "She is wary of explaining too much about her songs. \u201cThe people who do listen to them really like to have an opportunity to unpack them on their own,\u201d she said.", "But she would allow that the songs on \u201cDivers\u201d are \u201call kind of love songs.\u201d And, beyond that, \u201cEvery theme on the record has this funny binary thing happening with it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt finds its opposite and pulls against it, sometimes across the lines of two different songs and sometimes over a single lyric. Opposing forces are pulling the whole thing very tight the whole time.\u201d", "There may be personal lore, too. Ms. Newsom lived on and off in Greenwich Village while writing the album, before moving back to California. The second song she released to preview the album is \u201cLeaving the City\u201d; New York is repeatedly mentioned through the album. \u201cThe opposite of mortality might be something concentrated and distilled like a city, a collection of people,\u201d she said. \u201cEnough people have said that New York is a magical city that I don\u2019t feel guilty saying that it\u2019s not for me. Cities that feel like cities are not for me.\u201d", "The album concludes with \u201cTime, as a Symptom,\u201d which opens with birdcalls and Ms. Newsom alone, singing to stark piano chords. \u201cLove is not a symptom of time/Time is just a symptom of love,\u201d she declares. And then, suddenly, the song turns ecstatic: An orchestra appears, her voice multiplies, the lyrics splinter from sentences to incantations: \u201ctranscend!\u201d The birdcalls persist: It\u2019s the sound of a mourning dove, with notes that Ms. Newsom realized she had put in her melody. She had to consult bird-watchers and Cornell\u2019s online birdsong archive to learn what it was.", "\u201cI just knew it was the birdcall I\u2019d been hearing all my life, at the end of the day, since I was a little child,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like a sort of quiet, happy lonesomeness of things ending in the fullness of time.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/magazine/has-diversity-lost-its-meaning.html": ["How does a word become so muddled that it loses much of its meaning? How does it go from communicating something idealistic to something cynical and suspect? If that word is \u2018\u2018diversity,\u2019\u2019 the answer is: through a combination of overuse, imprecision, inertia and self-serving intentions.", "Take the recent remarks by the venture capitalist John Doerr at this year\u2019s TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September. Doerr, who with his firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has invested in Google, Facebook and Amazon, was on hand to discuss diversity in the overwhelmingly white and male Silicon Valley. After explaining that K.P.C.B. had begun putting its employees through training in unconscious bias \u2014 the company was the subject of a high-profile 2012 sex-discrimination lawsuit brought by a former executive, Ellen Pao, which Pao lost \u2014 the 64-year-old Harvard Business School graduate professed himself \u2018\u2018deeply committed to diversity,\u2019\u2019 adding: \u2018\u2018We have two new partners who are so diverse I have a challenge pronouncing their names.\u2019\u2019", "Doerr was quick to issue an apology for what he called \u2018\u2018an unfortunate joke,\u2019\u2019 but his conflation of a few additions with substantial changes in corporate hiring and recruitment practices inadvertently revealed what\u2019s so irritating about the recent ubiquity of the word \u2018\u2018diversity\u2019\u2019: It has become both euphemism and clich\u00e9, a convenient shorthand that gestures at inclusivity and representation without actually taking them seriously.", "Many Silicon Valley firms are scrambling to hire executives to focus on diversity \u2014 there\u2019s an opening at Airbnb right now for a \u2018\u2018Head of Diversity and Belonging.\u2019\u2019 But at the biggest firms, women and minorities still make up an appallingly tiny percentage of the skilled work force. And the few exceptions to this rule are consistently held up as evidence of more widespread change \u2014 as if a few individuals could by themselves constitute diversity.", "When the word is proudly invoked in a corporate context, it acquires a certain sheen. It can give a person or institution moral credibility, a phenomenon that Nancy Leong, a University of Denver law professor, calls \u2018\u2018racial capitalism\u2019\u2019 and defines as \u2018\u2018an individual or group deriving value from the racial identity of another person.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s almost as if cheerfully and frequently uttering the word \u2018\u2018diversity\u2019\u2019 is the equivalent of doing the work of actually making it a reality.", "This disconnect is not, of course, limited to tech. In this year's annual Pub\u00adlishers Weekly survey of book-publishing employees, respondents \u2014 89 percent of whom were white \u2014 found \u2018\u2018no real change\u2019\u2019 in the racial composition of the work force since last year, despite \u2018\u2018increased attention given to diversity.\u2019\u2019 The television and film industries are being investigated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over complaints of sex discrimination. And yet, as is the case in Silicon Valley, small victories are often overenthusiastically celebrated as evidence of larger change. In September, for example, when Viola Davis became the first African-American woman to win the Best Actress in a Drama Series Emmy, the moment was cheered in the press as a triumph of racial equity in Hollywood. But just a month before, Stacy L. Smith, a professor of communication at U.S.C. who, with other researchers, had just released a damning report that studied gender bias in 700 films made between 2007 and 2014, lamented \u2018\u2018the dismal record of diversity, not just for one group, but for females, people of color and the L.G.B.T. community.\u2019\u2019", "Why is there such a disparity between the progress that people in power claim they want to enact and what they actually end up doing about it? Part of the problem is that it doesn\u2019t seem that anyone has settled on what diversity actually means. Is it a variety of types of people on the stages of awards shows and in the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies? Is it raw numbers? Is it who is in a position of power to hire and fire and shape external and internal cultures? Is it who isn\u2019t in power, but might be someday?", "Adding to the ambiguity is the fact that the definition of \u2018\u2018diversity\u2019\u2019 changes depending on who is doing the talking. The dictionary will tell you that it is \u2018\u2018the quality or state of having many different forms, types, ideas,\u2019\u2019 and the word is often used, without controversy, to describe things like the environment and stock-market holdings. But in reality \u2014 which is to say, when applied to actual people, not flora, fauna or financial securities \u2014 the notion of diversity feels more fraught, positioning one group (white, male Americans) as the default, and everyone else as the Other. Multiple studies suggest that white Americans understand \u201cdiversity\u201d much differently than black Americans. When Reynolds Farley, a demographer at the University of Michigan, researched the attitudes of people in Detroit about the racial composition of residential neighborhoods in 1976, 1992 and 2004, most African-Americans considered \u2018\u2018integrated\u2019\u2019 to be a 50/50 mix of white and black, while a majority of whites considered such a ratio much too high for their comfort each time the study was conducted.", "Bragging about hiring a few people of color, or women, seems to come from the same interpretive bias, where a small amount is enough. It also puts significant pressure on the few \u2018\u2018diverse\u2019\u2019 folks who are allowed into any given club, where they are expected to be ambassadors of sorts, representing the minority identity while conforming to the majority one. All this can make a person doubt the sincerity of an institution or organization \u2014 and question their place within it. When I was starting out in magazines, I was told by a colleague that my hiring was part of the company\u2019s diversity push, and that my boss had received a significant bonus as a result of recruiting me. Whether or not it was true, it colored the next few years I spent there, making me wonder whether I was simply some sort of symbol to make the higher-ups feel better about themselves.", "Diversity \u2018\u2018is an empty signifier for me now,\u2019\u2019 says Jeff Chang, the author of 2014\u2019s \u2018\u2018Who We Be: The Colorization of America,\u2019\u2019 though \u2018\u2018I still strongly believe in the possibility.\u2019\u2019 Chang prefers \u2018\u2018equity\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018diversity,\u2019\u2019 saying that the latter has been \u2018\u2018deradicalized\u2019\u2019 from its roots in the multicultural movements of decades past. He recalls an anecdote about a diversity week at a Texas university where few white students bothered to show up. \u2018\u2018Diversity,\u2019\u2019 Chang says, \u2018\u2018has become a code word for \u2018all those other folks.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 The problem with code words is that they\u2019re lazy: They\u2019re broad rather than specific, and can provide cover for inaction \u2014 the \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know how to do this or what it means, so can someone else please do the work for me?\u2019\u2019 maneuver.", "Talk is cheap, of course, and sometimes you get the sense that the people talking the most about diversity are the people doing the least effective work on it. In the season premiere of his HBO reality series \u2018\u2018Project Greenlight,\u2019\u2019 Matt Damon explained \u2014 to a veteran African-American producer, Effie Brown \u2014 that focusing on diversity in the casting of a film was more important than promoting diversity among those working behind the camera. It was a striking example not just of mansplaining but also of whitesplaining. His implication \u2014 roundly criticized on social media and in industry publications \u2014 is that on-screen visibility is everything, when what Hollywood needs just as much, if not more, are black studio executives, writers, directors and producers: the people who decide what stories are told in the first place.", "Maybe it\u2019s not surprising that just a month later, the African-American director Ava DuVernay made the opposite argument of Damon\u2019s at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards. DuVernay, who made \u2018\u2018Selma,\u2019\u2019 pointed out that of the 100 top-grossing films last year, only two were directed by women. She urged constant vigilance and proactive searching within the industry: \u2018\u2018We have to ask our agents about that script by the woman screenwriter. We have to ask, \u2018Hey, are there any women agents here that I could talk to?\u2019 We have to ask our lawyers about women in the office. We have to ask, when we\u2019re thinking about directors or D.P.s, \u2018Will women interview?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Her words were powerful and refreshingly specific; they were also further evidence that the work of articulating and creating diversity often \u2014 usually! \u2014 falls to those who are themselves considered \u2018\u2018diverse.\u2019\u2019", "It\u2019s something I have experienced myself. Over the past few years, numerous editors have reached out to me asking for help in finding writers and editors of color, as if I had special access to the hundreds of talented people writing and thinking on- and offline. I know they mean well, but I am often appalled by the ease with which they shunt the work of cultivating a bigger variety of voices onto others, and I get the sense that for them, diversity is an end \u2014 a box to check off \u2014 rather than a starting point from which a more inte\u00adgrated, textured world is brought into being. I\u2019m not the only one to sense that there\u2019s a feeling of obligation, rather than excitement, behind the idea. DuVernay herself hinted at this when she, too, admitted that she hates the word. \u2018\u2018It feels like medicine,\u2019\u2019 she said in her speech. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018Diversity\u2019 is like, \u2018Ugh, I have to do diversity.\u2019 I recognize and celebrate what it is, but that word, to me, is a disconnect.

My son, though, has a landlubber\u2019s palate and a tendency toward the plain. But when opportunity arose to journey to Sicily, I decided it was time to escape our child-imposed culinary straitjacket.", "On the advice of the cookbook author Nancy Harmon Jenkins, I chose four distinct centers of Sicilian cookery: Palermo, Trapani, Catania and the hill towns around Ragusa. Along the way my partner, Esther, and I would offer Luke tiny bribes: a soccer game in Palermo, a salt marsh with flamingos in Trapani, a hike up to Mount Etna\u2019s caldera. But the center of it all would be seafood, and lots of it.", "A little while after landing in Palermo, we took Luke to Piccolo Napoli, a no-frills trattoria fronted by a case of gleamingly fresh sea bream and cuttlefish. My eye drifted down the menu to bucatini con le sarde, a long, hollow pasta in a thick sardine sauce made green and yellow by wild fennel and saffron. Luke wouldn\u2019t touch that one.

We invite you to a hospitality at the half time.\u201d", "With Palermo down 1-0 we crowded into a banquet room to find a sprawling seafood buffet. Sheets of raw marinated sole, little square glasses bristling with squid tentacles, and a whole baked salmon. At one station, a waiter spooned out what looked like a pasta rag\u00f9 from an oversized tray. When I asked what it was, he confirmed it was indeed a rag\u00f9 \u2014 of swordfish.

A peninsular town that marks the division between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the greater Mediterranean, Trapani was historically a migratory path for the magnificent Atlantic bluefin tuna; since Roman times fishermen have used that natural geography to funnel the giant fish into standing nets where they were trapped and harpooned to death in a bloody process called \u201cmattanze.\u201d", "It was in Trapani that I confronted my own fish-eating qualms. I have written extensively about the tragic overfishing of the bluefin. Industrial fleets have reduced the Mediterranean stock dramatically in the last half century. Some hopeful signs are emerging: Last year the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s chief tuna scientist declared that \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d have been made in recent years \u201cwhich have led to the beginning of the recovery of Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin.\u201d Even so, I was hoping to avoid eating it.", "That would prove difficult. At the Cantina Siciliana, a blue-tiled gem on a sleepy street run by the lifelong fisherman Pino Maggiore, a mixed seafood antipasto appeared, consisting of marinated sardines, delicate raw pink shrimp and bluefin \u2014 a carpaccio from its loin and a bottarga from its ovaries. Later we were to come across entire bluefin delicatessens in Trapani that sold everything from the great tuna\u2019s salted heart to its dried stomach for soup stock.", "But the shadow of the fish\u2019s plight hovered over this seeming bounty. Much more welcome was a juicy mackerel baked in lemon and a seafood couscous, a nutty, granulated North African-influenced creation. Also appreciated was a hearty portion of busiate, a long local noodle curled in on itself, served with Trapani\u2019s signature garlic, tomato and almond pesto. Luke found the busiate shape intriguing but preferred it with marinara.", "Luke also enjoyed our other memorable taste of Trapani: the salt that had helped make the town a fish-processing hub for centuries. Through the introductions of the New York Italian specialty foods importer Gustiamo, we were able to make the acquaintance of Salvatore Gucciardo, the eldest son of a multigenerational salt-making clan.", "Luke quickly befriended Mr. Gucciardo\u2019s 5-year-old nephew, who had joined us, and together they ran through shimmering wetlands, green with shoots of garlic, flanked on one side by the cliffs of the hill town of Erice and the pulsing blue sea on the other. Flamingos were just arriving from Africa as the warmth of spring started to penetrate the island\u2019s bones.", "The salt the Gucciardos harvest comes in several grades, which we sampled right from the drying piles. So bright and intense was this stuff that I later found that I could use a fraction of the salt in my home recipes so long as I used \u201csale Trapanese.\u201d", "But like any good Sicilian, the salt merchant couldn\u2019t leave us with just salt. It was Pasquetta, after all \u2014 the \u201clittle Easter\u201d that Sicilians tack on after the Resurrection. First we stopped at the Bar Caff\u00e9 Castelli in the village of Nubia for a snack of panelle, little triangles of deep-fried chickpeas, and a sandwich of anchovies, herbs, oil and tomatoes. Then, back at the Gucciardo home, a proper Pasquetta meal: perfectly grilled whole sardines, more busiate and a cassata cake that traces its origins to Spanish conquerors. Luke tried a bit of everything and then asked if the robed saint in the icon on the wall was Obi-Wan Kenobi.", "We made the long haul from Trapani to Catania under cover of night and gave Luke a brief seafood respite the next day by taking him up volcanic Mount Etna and making our midday meal from rice balls filled with a magma of delicious rag\u00f9.", "But it was back to fish the following morning when I sneaked out at dawn toward the Pescheria, Catania\u2019s storied fish market. I met up with Ciccio Sultano, a two-star Michelin chef and proprietor of Ristorante Duomo in Ragusa.", "Like a shark, Mr. Sultano circled a particularly nice loin of swordfish, as mongers cried \u201cCiccio! Ciccio!\u201d With each circle, he checked to see if the price might go down. (The high price wasn\u2019t surprising \u2014 as I was to learn later, Mediterranean swordfish, like bluefin, is a fish of concern, and conservationists are calling for tighter regulations.) In between he bought 12 cups of sea urchin, a 10-pound dentex (a kind of supersized porgy), and three flats of pink shrimp. Wedging his thumb under a shrimp\u2019s head, he extracted a thimbleful of topaz blue eggs. \u201cCaviar!\u201d he said. On the fourth circle he abandoned the overpriced swordfish monger and found another equally nice loin at the price he wanted.", "Mr. Sultano then took me over to his secret corner of the market where a street vendor named Carlo plunged a harpoon of a fork into a tremendous caldron and pulled out a pile of steaming offal. \u201cNowadays,\u201d Mr. Sultano said, slicing it up, \u201ceveryone talks about street food. This is street food.\u201d He handed me a quivering piece of guts and then typed a phrase into Google Translate on his phone. \u201cFourth stomach of the calf,\u201d he read from the screen. I tried it, cringed and felt Luke\u2019s pain.", "I left Mr. Sultano and the market with a promise to dine at Duomo in Ragusa that evening. Knowing that the chef was planning a full-on Sicilian culinary assault, we decided to get some exercise. An hour outside of Catania we came to the Pantalica, a Unesco recognized wilderness necropolis dating back to Greek and Roman times that descends through a gorgeous rocky ravine resplendent in wildflowers.", "Soon we were working up a sweat even though the Italians we passed were bundled up as if it were the dead of winter. Then a German tourist walked by in a Speedo and plunged into the steely blue Anapo River at the gorge\u2019s bottom. Throughout, Luke snacked on another Mount Etna rice ball, savoring it to make sure it lasted the length of the trail.", "Hike complete, we pushed on to Ragusa. I was eager to get to the famed hill town not only to try Mr. Sultano\u2019s food, but also because the chef had forgotten the pink shrimp with the blue eggs back at the market and had asked me to bring them. With the ice melting in the shrimp bag I gripped the rental car wheel, white-knuckled. Finally on a street about five inches wider than my car, I passed the shrimp through the car-door window to the maitre d\u2019.", "Later we returned to Duomo for a Sicilian blowout, amusingly reinterpreted by Mr. Sultano. Here was a cannolo similar to ones we\u2019d eaten everywhere, but this time stuffed with savory ricotta and presented with a prawn resting on its back. Here was the spaghetti with sea urchin we had eaten elsewhere \u2014 but now with the direction \u201cDon\u2019t mix.\u201d It surprised me with layered flavors of increasing lemony-ness as I journeyed to its bottom. Here was the mackerel I\u2019d had seared and baked but this time raw and pungent. All of these I loved. All of these I wanted Luke to love, or at least to try. But by this point my son was fished out. He had tasted so much of Sicily. The squid ink and the artisanal salt. The sardines and the anchovies. It was time at last for him to return to his comfort zone.", "Like any good chef, Mr. Sultano sensed his client\u2019s true desires and offered him plate after plate of the fanciest pasta marinara imaginable.

While the new Apple box has flaws, it also has a cleaner interface for finding things to watch and a niftier remote control \u2014 not to mention more compelling apps and games.", "Redesigned Remote", "One of the biggest changes is a redesigned remote control, which has a touch pad and a few physical buttons. It is also thicker, which is actually an improvement because the previous version was so thin that it had a tendency to vanish between couch cushions. More important, the remote includes a microphone and a button to summon Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, for finding content.", "Siri for Apple TV can search for movies or TV shows across multiple streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu and HBO, along with Apple\u2019s iTunes Store, and play them right away. Pressing the Siri button and speaking the command \u201cFind \u2018Fresh Off the Boat\u2019 \u201d will find that the TV show can be streamed on Hulu and iTunes; selecting the streaming service will instantly show a list of episodes.", "Siri has other tricks, too. If you\u2019re watching something and missed what a character just said, you can ask Siri: \u201cWhat did they just say?\u201d and it will rewind the video about 15 seconds and replay that portion with subtitles turned on, before switching the subtitles off.", "Apple still has some kinks to work out with Siri. When I asked it to look up Nicolas Cage movies, it failed to find any relevant titles because it misspelled his first name as Nicholas (and try as I might, I could not make a silent \u201ch\u201d even more silent). When I tried the \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d command, Siri occasionally failed to display subtitles for content on Netflix and Hulu. Apple acknowledged both problems as known issues and said it was working to resolve them.", "Gaming and Apps", "Gaming on Apple TV is off to a promising start. The remote control includes motion sensors so it can double as a game controller.

The game Transistor, a role-playing title, was awkward with the touch pad and would benefit from a physical game controller, which is a supported accessory.", "Gaming graphics were also on par with Nintendo\u2019s Wii U, and some of the casual games seemed to compete directly in Nintendo\u2019s sweet spot: lightweight, family-friendly gaming.

Before you yawn from boredom, consider this: A screen saver can turn a TV into a living piece of art that is constantly changing, which is a great conversation starter at parties.", "For my Apple TV, I set up an Internet recipe with the site If This Then That, so that whenever I upload a photo to Instagram or \u201cLike\u201d a photo that my friend took on Instagram, it shows up on my Apple TV screen saver. That way, rather than relentlessly bombarding guests with selfies of my partner and me on vacation in Hawaii, my wallpaper is a window into moments captured by all the interesting people I know, not just snapshots from my life.", "If that setup is too complicated, Apple offers some neat screen savers, including high-definition videos of different locations shot from the sky, including the Great Wall of China.", "Buying Advice", "While the Apple TV is my favorite all-around streaming device, there are some weaknesses.", "Setting it up can be tedious. When you install streaming apps like Hulu and Netflix from the App Store, you type in your login credentials by swiping left and right with the remote to select letters of the alphabet one at a time \u2014 you have no option to do this by speaking into the microphone or using a keyboard on a smartphone.", "The Apple TV may also not be the best streaming device for everyone because of one missing feature: the ability to stream content available in Ultra HD 4K TV, the latest high-definition resolution supported by some of the newest TV sets.", "For early adopters of 4K television sets, the Roku 4, priced at $130, is a better bet. The Roku is versatile, has a nice selection of apps and has a comfortable remote control. Amazon\u2019s $100 Fire TV also supports 4K, but I recommend against it because of its cheap-feeling remote control and less polished user interface.", "Another competing device is Google\u2019s $35 Chromecast, a miniature dongle that pulls streaming content from a smartphone. It\u2019s a good option for people on a tight budget, but I found it unreliable \u2014 sometimes videos failed to stream from my smartphone to the device.", "There are two storage models for the Apple TV. For $149, you get 32 gigabytes; $199 buys 64 gigs. In my tests, apps and games were pretty slim in terms of data size, so 32 gigs should be enough for most people. Those who plan to do a lot of gaming will probably be safer with 64 gigs.", "Apple TV is on the path to turning the television set into a smarter connected screen.

It stokes emotions about \u201chomelands\u201d and invasions, as we have seen all summer, both in the Republican presidential contest and in the tragic situation in Europe. These arguments tend to produce more heat than light, making objective analysis difficult. Many politicians find that their poll numbers rise the further from reality they stray \u2014 as the Donald J. Trump playbook continues to prove. A recent Pew report confirms that the parties remain far apart, with Republicans far more certain than Democrats (53 percent versus 24 percent) that immigration is making our society worse.", "But history provides some clarity about the relative costs and benefits of immigration over time. Fifty years ago this month, Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 at the foot of the Statue of Liberty. By any standard, it made the United States a stronger nation. The act was endorsed by Republicans and Democrats in an era when cooperation was still possible. Indeed, the most serious opposition came from Southern Democrats and an ambivalent secretary of state, Dean Rusk. But it passed the Senate easily (76-18), with skillful leadership from its floor manager, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and Johnson himself.", "Since 1924, United States immigration policy had been based on a formula, derived from the 1890 census, that made it relatively easy for Northern Europeans to immigrate. But the formula set strict limits for everyone else. That seemed ridiculous to John F. Kennedy, who was trying to win hearts and minds in the Cold War, and it seemed even more so to his successor in 1965, as Johnson was escalating the war in Vietnam. The act\u2019s passage was one of the few positive legacies of that complex moment in American foreign policy.", "Johnson promised his opponents that the act would \u201cnot reshape the structure of our daily lives.\u201d But that prediction proved utterly untrue. By destroying the old national-origins system, the act opened the floodgates to the parts of the world that had been excluded in the past.", "What ensued was arguably the most significant period of immigration in American history. Nearly 59 million people have come to the United States since 1965, and three-quarters of them came from Latin America and Asia. It was not unrestrained immigration \u2014 the act created preferences for those with technical training, or family members in the United States. But it was vastly more open than what had come before.", "There is little doubt that the act succeeded in the ways that its progressive supporters hoped \u2014 it made America a genuinely New Frontier, younger and more diverse, truer to its ideals. But it also was a success when measured by a more conservative calculus of hard power. It certainly increased American security. Significant numbers of immigrants and their children joined the United States military after 1965, and in every category the armed forces became more ethnically diverse.", "The flood of new immigrants also promoted prosperity in ways that few could have imagined in 1965. Between 1990 and 2005, as the digital age took off, 25 percent of the fastest-growing American companies were founded by people born in foreign countries.", "Much of the growth of the last two decades has stemmed from the vast capacity that was delivered by the Internet and the personal computer, each of which was accelerated by immigrant ingenuity. Silicon Valley, especially, was transformed. In a state where Asian immigrants had once faced great hardship, they helped to transform the global economy. The 2010 census stated that more than 50 percent of technical workers in Silicon Valley are Asian-American.", "Google was co-founded by Sergey Brin, who emigrated from the Soviet Union with his parents at age 6. The new C.E.O. of United Airlines is Mexican-American. And an extraordinary number of Indian-Americans have risen to become chief executives of other major American corporations, including Adobe Systems, Pepsi, Motorola and Microsoft.", "In countless other ways, as well, we might measure the improvements since 1965. A prominent AIDS researcher, David Ho, came to this country as a 12-year-old from Taiwan. Immigrants helped take the space program to new places, and sometimes gave their lives in that cause (an Indian-American astronaut, Kalpana Chawla, perished in the Columbia space shuttle disaster). Almost no one would argue for a return to pre-1965 American cuisine, which became incomparably more interesting as it grew more diverse. Baseball has become a more dynamic game as it, too, has looked south and west. The list goes on and on.", "There will always be debates over immigration, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge that opponents of immigration are usually correct when they argue that immigration brings dramatic change. But a careful consideration of the 1965 Immigration Act shows that our willingness to lower barriers made this a better country. To convey that hard-earned wisdom to other nations wrestling with the same issues, and to open our own doors more widely, would be a modest way to repay the great contributions that immigrants have made on a daily basis to the United States over the past 50 years."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/technology/in-steve-jobs-tolerating-techs-unpleasant-visionaries.html": ["Not long ago, Larry Page watched the Disney film \u201cTomorrowland.\u201d He didn\u2019t like it.", "Mr. Page, the co-founder of Google and the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet, told shareholders in June that he wanted to see a positive depiction of technological advances, which is rare in the movies.

The film ultimately suggests that the deeply unpleasant behavior of people in the tech industry may be worth putting up with because of what they sometimes manage to create, often in spite of themselves. It is one of the few pop cultural depictions of the tech industry to buy into Silicon Valley\u2019s essential worldview: an aggressive optimism that is willing to roll over just about everything and everyone in its path in the service of what it sees as the more important goal of building tomorrow.", "The film, which opens in limited release this weekend and more widely on Oct. 23, is the most sophisticated take yet in a growing body of movies, TV shows, novels and other cultural takes on Silicon Valley. Based on a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin that is loosely adapted from Walter Isaacson\u2019s authorized biography of Mr. Jobs, this is the third major film about the Apple co-founder since his death in 2011. There was also \u201cJobs,\u201d the 2013 movie starring Ashton Kutcher, and, this year, \u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,\u201d the documentarian Alex Gibney\u2019s critical take on Mr. Jobs.", "Beyond Apple, there\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d the HBO comedy about the travails of a start-up, and \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d the AMC drama about the brutal personal computer business of the 1980s. Then there was \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d the 2010 film on the history of Facebook, which Mr. Sorkin also wrote. Even stories not nominally about the industry feature cameos by tech billionaires, who have become easy stand-ins for the powerful forces unleashed by technology \u2014 see \u201cBook of Numbers,\u201d the recent acclaimed novel by Joshua Cohen, or the Google-like founder who\u2019s the chief villain in the film \u201cEx Machina.\u201d", "It\u2019s easy to explain the bumper crop of pop-cultural takes on the tech industry. Like finance in the 1980s, technology has lately become not just a source of widespread economic angst, but one of social and cultural angst. And a small class of tech founders have become the most powerful figures of our time. Techies are the \u201cNew Establishment,\u201d as Vanity Fair calls them. The magazine even hosts an annual conference devoted to the emerging group of titans who seem certain to one day preside over every aspect of how we buy, watch, read, chat, eat, sleep, dream \u2014 if they don\u2019t already.", "And if the recent movies and TV shows about the tech industry are anywhere near accurate, we are all in for a heap of trouble. The tech founders who will rule our future are shown as hapless and comically myopic, inspired either by a desire for world domination or by petty efforts to relieve their social anxieties.", "What is unusual about \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is its search for a more authentic motivation for the villainies that we associate with tech billionaires like the Apple co-founder. \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is not very kind to Steve Jobs. He is presented as a man who spent years denying paternity of his daughter and who later only grudgingly paid for her support. At every turn, he treats employees and colleagues as expendable cogs in his corporate game, often without understanding the damage he inflicts on those around him.", "Yet unlike many across the business world, the Steve Jobs in this film is not motivated mainly by ego and greed. Instead, what really gets him going is an insatiable desire to \u201cput a dent in the universe,\u201d as Mr. Jobs often put it. Silicon Valley\u2019s insistence on changing the world is usually pilloried in the news media. But here, Mr. Jobs\u2019s mission is accorded respect \u2014 and his behavior, the film implies, can be ultimately tolerated because of what he built.", "Part of the film\u2019s success in this regard rests on Mr. Sorkin\u2019s decision to set the story on the development of the personal computer, a technology whose eventual importance is no longer a matter of dispute. Mr. Jobs\u2019s other great product, the touch-screen smartphone, may one day prove more thoroughly world-changing, but at the moment, it raises almost as many fears as it does hopes, and the film wisely stays away from it.", "The personal computer, though \u2014 who could argue that it hasn\u2019t proved groundbreaking? To show Mr. Jobs\u2019s ability to see the future, Mr. Sorkin quotes Mr. Jobs\u2019s best argument for the personal computer almost word for word. Humanity\u2019s greatest strength, Mr. Jobs once noted, is that we\u2019re tool builders. A condor is the most mechanically efficient animal on the planet, but a human being on a bicycle blows the condor away.", "\u201cWhat a computer is to me is, it\u2019s the most remarkable tool that we\u2019ve ever come up with,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.\u201d", "The ultimate importance of the personal computer hangs over every conflict in the film. When Mr. Jobs harangues his staff, when he puts the company ahead of his supposed friends, when he shows little regard for his family in the service of building what\u2019s next, he implicitly holds an ace with the audience who know how things eventually turned out. Sure, he may have been terrible to be around, but in the end, wasn\u2019t he right about the importance of that dent in the universe? And if he hadn\u2019t been as obnoxious about his aims, would the dent have been as large?", "During an argument late in the movie, Steve Wozniak, Apple\u2019s co-founder, who, like everyone else, often clashed with Mr. Jobs, tells him: \u201cYour products are better than you are, brother.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Mr. Jobs responds. The tech industry may be peopled by many petty, ruthless, self-important weirdos. But look at the products, not the people. In the future, only the products will matter."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/technology/personaltech/getting-directions-while-pedaling.html": ["Q.

That included passing visuals like a drone dog walker.", "\u201cWe thought that was kind of a joke, but that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Gale said. Another drone appears as a remote photographer for USA Today.", "The art team, which was overseen by the production designer Rick Carter, took part in brainstorming sessions to add as many blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-them background details as possible. \u201cWe were all just driving to the unknown,\u201d the costume designer Joanna Johnston said. \u201cSo everyone was going: \u2018What about this? What about this? But what about this?\u2019 \u201d", "For the town square, it was decided that the future Hill Valley would be more forward-thinking in its urban planning. Mr. Gale, Mr. Zemeckis and the production team all believed that community space would be emphasized and old architecture would be maintained, which mirrors the trends in urban design that gave birth to destinations like the High Line in New York. In 1985, the site in front of the Hill Valley clock tower is a parking lot; in 2015, it\u2019s a luscious green park with a lake.", "\u201cThat town square could exist now,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cWe\u2019d build upon what was and either turn it, or embrace it.\u201d", "The residents of Hill Valley also seem to make some strange fashion choices.

(Though some of the devices in the film work via voice recognition, \u00e0 la Siri.)", "But, when viewed in 2015, it\u2019s that incoming phone call that is, perhaps, the most eye-opening moment. Marty talks to his co-worker Needles (Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) via a large screen that is essentially an incredible combination of Skype and Facebook. As Needles antagonizes Marty, a running list of personal profile data appears on the bottom of the screen \u2014 from occupation, age, date of birth and address to favorite alcoholic beverages and hobbies. Needles, it turns out, is an \u201cavid basketball fan.\u201d Mr. Gale said this idea came from the assumption that computers would one day contain the information that in the 1980s could be found in a Rolodex.", "Marty wonders aloud if their boss is monitoring the call.

Walmart\u2019s web traffic in the fourth-quarter, holiday shopping season can be 10 times that of the rest of the year, Mr. King noted. \u201cNo single cloud provider can handle all that traffic,\u201d he said.", "Being able to let its large corps of developers move from one flavor of cloud to another, quickly and relatively effortlessly, is a priority for Walmart. In 2013, it bought a start-up, OneOps, which made management software for cloud development that helps automate the programming tweaks necessary to migrate from cloud to cloud.

Its stock price promptly fell 10 percent, the biggest one-day decline in more than a decade.", "With reports like these, it may seem difficult to derive a positive message from this season\u2019s information. Yet many investors habitually discount bad news and highlight the bright side.", "Are reports of declining profits \u2014 or outright losses \u2014 really good? Perhaps not, but they are often not perceived as devastating.", "When losses are disclosed, they are often seen as \u201cunsustainable, often one-time events,\u201d Ms. McNichols said. The logic is that for-profit corporations exist only for that purpose: to make a profit. Executives must stem losses, if they hope to keep their jobs.", "Wall Street analysts therefore sometimes assume that the disclosure of a loss implies that corrective measures are being taken. On the other hand, disclosure of rising profit prospects is often taken as a sign of sustainable prosperity and may be enough to bolster share prices, she said.", "That is because when you buy a share of a company\u2019s stock, you are buying a portion of that company\u2019s long-term earnings stream. If you pay a reasonable price, you should have a good chance of profiting. That is the theory, at least.

Almost every night, when you\u2019re asleep, Rihanna is in the studio. She was headed there after our meeting and Jennifer said she\u2019d be there until morning.

The Internet will explode when I say you were Googling childbirth.\u2019\u2019 She laughed and assured me she wasn\u2019t having a child anytime soon; her fear was generalized.

But thank God it did.\u2019\u2019", "It seemed like some part of Rihanna still couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d gotten away with it.

So I directed my question to a younger Rihanna, and asked if she had suddenly felt aware of race in a different way when she moved to New York.", "She hesitated, and when I nervously began to apologize, she interrupted.", "\u2018\u2018You know, when I started to experience the difference \u2014 or even have my race be highlighted \u2014 it was mostly when I would do business deals.\u2019\u2019 Business deals. Meaning that everyone\u2019s cool with a young black woman singing, dancing, partying and looking hot, but that when it comes time to negotiate, to broker a deal, she is suddenly made aware of her blackness. \u2018\u2018And, you know, that never ends, by the way. It\u2019s still a thing. And it\u2019s the thing that makes me want to prove people wrong.

For me, it comes down to smaller issues, scenarios in which people can assume something of me without knowing me, just by my packaging.\u2019\u2019", "While none of us are only our skin or clothes, we do increasingly expect megastars to deploy their whole being through packaging \u2014 a tidy and consistent message. If Rihanna has a \u2018\u2018thing\u2019\u2019 it\u2019s that she changes her thing so often. While a performer positioning themselves in relation to the art world might try to make this into a more overt performance, something that would reassure the intelligentsia, Rihanna isn\u2019t meta like that. She hasn\u2019t created a persona around herself like Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Madonna or so many other stars at her level. She doesn\u2019t have to manufacture dimensionality, because she actually is soulful, and this comes across in every little thing she does.", "Souls are funny things. They stay constant even when the outside changes, or when the heart makes mistakes. Souls don\u2019t really care about good or bad, right or wrong \u2014 they\u2019re just true. Everlasting. It makes you sound dumb to talk about this stuff, which is why no one could tell me exactly what it was about Rihanna. But millions of fans don\u2019t seem to need it explained to them. A soul just knows a soul. I never told you she was pretty because that\u2019s not what I experienced. My understanding, from the moment she sat down, was that we were in love. We were the most in love any two people had ever been. The sun was finally setting. We\u2019d been talking for almost two hours. I just had one more question.", "OUMAROU DIDN\u2019T ASK. He didn\u2019t have to.

Somehow this was the most exciting part of the whole day. \u2018\u2018O.K., here it is.\u2019\u2019 Oumarou nodded solemnly and I pressed play: \u2018\u2018You know what? If I ever go to West Africa, it would probably be for a free concert.\u2019\u2019 Rihanna\u2019s slight Barbadian accent was familiar to me now. \u2018\u2018I would want to do something for the people there. Maybe we can make a whole event, the way Bob Marley would have done it. Just for the people.

It took hours to get to Rihanna, but I was home in half that time \u2014 too soon. Oumarou and I agreed to keep in touch and waved goodbye. Before stepping inside my house, I lifted my blouse to my face; her perfume was still there. The problem with this kind of romance is that it all falls apart in the retelling. My husband and 3-year-old son tried but couldn\u2019t really understand how overwhelming and profound my connection with Rihanna was. And I\u2019ll admit that as the days go by, even I am beginning to doubt whether our time together meant quite as much to her as it did to me. It doesn\u2019t matter.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary (no second-rate sources here; what do you take me for?), it originated in the 18th century as a term for a shoemaker. For much of the 19th century, it was used to refer to persons of \u201cno breeding.\u201d According to the Oxford website, \u201cin time the word came to describe someone with an exaggerated respect for high social position or wealth who looks down on those regarded as socially inferior.\u201d A pretender.

Americans are in general a little squeamish about money and class \u2014 worshiping one while pretending the other doesn\u2019t exist \u2014 and more comfortable with hierarchies and distinctions that seem strictly cultural. A snob over here is someone who looks contemptuously down, convinced above all of his or her elevated powers of discernment.", "Of course, we all know people like that. There is a rich tradition, for instance, of film snobbery, or rather of passionate cinephiles being derided as snobs because of their willingness to read subtitles. The film industry does what it can in the autumn months to beckon them back into theaters with promises of \u201cseriousness,\u201d but a true snob will disdain obvious Oscar bait. If, that is, there are any true film snobs left. As subtitled movies grow scarcer on American screens, the traditional signifiers of snobbery grow scarce. Is a film snob someone who name-checks Pedro Costa, Michael Haneke or other international auteurs? Someone who drops the word \u201cauteur\u201d into a discussion of \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d? A person who admires Kristen Wiig, but only in her serious roles?", "You see the problem. \u201cSnob\u201d is a category in which nobody would willingly, or at least unironically, claim membership.

Such shallowness is the very definition of snobbery, but the title of the essay cuts two ways. It may be a debunking of what certain self-deluding moviegoers think they are doing, but it is also Kael\u2019s own fantasy about what those people, as a class, are really like.", "In any case, broadly speaking, Kael\u2019s position has prevailed. Condescension to the mass audience and its pleasures is not cool, or fashionable or politically correct. Populist entertainment sits comfortably alongside more rarefied aesthetic pursuits, not least at the New York Film Festival itself, which routinely makes room for big, awards-hungry Hollywood movies.", "All of which is good.

Because he had played for the United States, even if it was only one game, he was categorized as a returning national team player. That meant any team that selected him would go to the back of the line when the next one became available, a steep price to pay for a presumed backup goalkeeper.", "While he waited, Robles fielded offers from Norway, Sweden and Azerbaijan, but none of them made sense. So in the absence of any kind of signal from M.L.S., Robles took a job with a real estate business back home in Arizona; with a baby on the way, he needed the security of the health insurance the job offered, and the brokerage promised him a new career.", "\u201cWe were in a situation where I thought if soccer is done, it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Robles said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t bitter. I wasn\u2019t resentful. It was a hard way for it to end. But maybe, at the end of the day, that was my career and I was O.K. with it.

I can barely clothe and feed myself regularly while doing my job, let alone think about running two companies, so suffice it to say that Mr. Dorsey makes me feel bad about myself.", "But here\u2019s a question people behind the scenes keep asking me: Mr. Dorsey is the new chief executive, but he was also on the board for years as chairman (though no longer) and had a shot earlier in the company\u2019s life span to shape and form Twitter in his own vision. On Friday, we learned that he\u2019s planning a series of cost-saving measures, including layoffs.

They\u2019ve both talked about making Twitter easier for novices by developing new ways of presenting and sorting tweets. And notice that since Mr. Dorsey took over in the summer, he hasn\u2019t made any substantial changes to Twitter\u2019s product team \u2014 the team assembled under Mr. Costolo that is tasked with creating new features for Twitter.

This might give him special authority within Twitter to take steps that would otherwise have created tension. For instance, he has reportedly thought about dropping or somehow loosening a tweet\u2019s 140-character limit, a move that could make Twitter more appealing to people who find it bizarre (and which, let me just say, I have advocated for a long time). Under any other chief executive, such a move might have seemed blasphemous. But Mr. Dorsey\u2019s the guy who created the 140-character limit in the first place, so maybe he\u2019ll get a pass to change it.", "Mike: Which, in my mind, makes me question whether Twitter and Medium, the start-up founded by Evan Williams, who helped create Twitter and still sits on its board, will eventually clash and meet somewhere in the middle. But I digress.", "Farhad: The bigger question is whether it\u2019s too late to save Twitter. Honestly, Twitter is basically my favorite thing in the world, but on most days I just can\u2019t see it catching on widely. Do you disagree?", "Mike: Here\u2019s something to think about: A few years ago, when I was a full-time Twitter reporter, I wrote that more than one billion people have signed up for Twitter, tried using it and were like \u201cthis is lame\u201d and have never returned. I imagine that number has gone up since I last heard about it.", "So what does it take to persuade the millions who tried Twitter once and were too confused to come back to, um, come back? My guess is probably big email campaigns, which run the risk of annoying people. And, as Mr. Dorsey has said repeatedly, articulating Twitter\u2019s actual reason for being to a mainstream audience. For a company focused on communication and connecting the world, it has been amazingly bad at doing just that for years.", "In sum, I have no idea what Twitter needs to do, which is fortunately why I am not the chief executive.

Historic house and modern museum have always made an awkward fit, a standoff between preservation and innovation, and the problem remains, but the renovation has brought a wide-open new gallery space, a cafe and a raft of be-your-own-designer digital enhancements.

All you need to be is someone who keeps an eye on the news; who pays attention to loss through violence; and feels a personal stake in that loss, as if it were happening to people you know and care about, to people who live in your home. The artist Doris Salcedo was born in Bogota, Colombia, in 1958, and came of age in an era when civic murder was a way of life in her country. For some 30 years, she has made such memories the essence of a witnessing art which includes the dozens of austere but viscerally animated sculptures and installations that fill all four floors of the Solomon R.

When Joseph Stalin came to power art became government-dictated propaganda and its makers, often under threat, towed the line.

Indeed, if an enterprising filmmaker wanted to make a romantic biopic evoking the New York artworld from the rise of its bohemian avant-garde in the 1930s and \u201940s through the pluralist era of the \u201970s and \u201980s, he or she could not find a more suitable subject than Ms. de Kooning.

Cosby Jr. collection of African-American art. The Cosby collection, weighted toward canonical figures like Romare Bearden and Charles White, will bring in the crowds, but it is the curators and museum itself, which is in a period of renaissance, that have made the show rise well above predictability.

Now they have about them the stale air of white elephants. Uninitiated viewers, however, might thrill to the strenuously spectacular prints in this 19-piece show, which includes a dismally dystopian, aerial view of cattle in a muddy, Colorado stockyard and a futuristic image of the gleaming, gold-hued interior of a huge gas tank on a transport ship in the Persian Gulf. 279 Montauk Highway, Water Mill, N.Y., 631-283-2118, parrishart.org.

He was not ever, though, a shy painter. Few artists in any era have had as extroverted a hand as his, and as keen an instinct for visual theater. And when his sitters were people he cared for, something extra came into the work, a relaxed recklessness of a kind that scintillates and sluices through the 90 paintings and drawings in this show that comes to New York from the National Portrait Gallery in London.

But if you\u2019d visited the third annual Impressionist exhibition in Paris in 1877, you would have found a few things that countered such expectations: realistic paintings of a new Paris of mausoleum-like luxury high-rises and ruler-straight boulevards running back into infinite space. The name of the artist attached to these pictures was Gustave Caillebotte. His \u201cParis Street, Rainy Day,\u201d billboard-size and graphically bold, with its detailed but oddly empty image of well-dressed urban amblers, was a showstopper in 1877.

Last time, the Haggler detailed the trail of lost property and dented furniture in the company\u2019s wake, as well as a slew of complaints about last-minute, day-of-the-move price increases.", "The Transportation Department, we noted, revoked the company\u2019s license after it failed to respond to a request for a routine on-site inspection. Classic appears to have gone rogue. It won\u2019t respond to the federal government. Worse, it won\u2019t respond to the Haggler. Calls to the number on its website have yielded nothing but hold music.", "The firm is unmoored from the physical world, so it is hard to tell who owns it or where it is. It offers lowball bids and takes payments online, handing the labor and trucking part of jobs to incompetent subcontractors. It seems to exist in the ether.", "The Haggler didn\u2019t ask for help in unearthing concrete information about Classic two weeks ago, but one reader took up the challenge \u2014 and delivered a clever bit of sleuthing.

He then found an incorporation filing for Uber Movers in New Jersey. A man named Yakov Moroz was listed as the company\u2019s president. With that name in hand, the Masked Reader found Yakov Moroz on incorporation papers in Florida \u2014 for Classic Moving Services, a company with a principal address that is also in New Jersey.", "To be certain that the Masked Reader had the right name, the Haggler checked in with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the part of the Transportation Department that regulates interstate movers.

The latter has been the focus of lawsuits, including a case filed by a woman in Las Vegas named Lunetta Humphries who said, in 2013, that Priority 1 and another company, Direct Van Lines, had so botched her move that belongings worth more than $13,000 were lost, including a lynx coat, wedding rings and \u2014 most devastating \u2014 her son\u2019s ashes. Possessions worth an added $6,000 were damaged. The defendants never responded to the lawsuit, and Ms. Humphries was awarded a default judgment of more than $24,000.", "Whether she collected a penny is unclear.

Microsoft needs that connection.", "You\u2019re right that it has flip-flopped a bit with Xbox, which Sony has capitalized on to sell more PlayStations. But Microsoft seems to be doing better now that it has made the Xbox marketing message more about games, rather than other kinds of entertainment.

Gross, who wore a leopard-print scarf knotted at her neck, was typing rapidly, occasionally pausing to refer to a memoir open beside her. She swiveled in her chair to face me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s interesting that she never had an orgasm,\u2019\u2019 Gross began. \u2018\u2018I mean, not never, but not until later. I\u2019d like to ask her about that, but it\u2019s tricky.\u2019\u2019", "Gross often talks about sex on her NPR show, \u2018\u2018Fresh Air.\u2019\u2019 She frames it politically and socially, but she also comes at the subject with disarming specificity, uncovering details that seem not raw but quotidian. When she asked Lena Dunham about what it was like for her sexual partners to see her children\u2019s-book tattoos, she elicited an answer that was almost poetic \u2014 Dunham described the tattoos as \u2018\u2018wearing a sleeve when you are naked.\u2019\u2019 The exchange was also, in its way, just as boundary-pushing as the sex on \u2018\u2018Girls,\u2019\u2019 Dunham\u2019s HBO show. It\u2019s daring to talk about sex on public radio in the middle of the day, and \u2018\u2018tricky\u2019\u2019 because Gross is mindful of the needs of more conservative stations. \u2018\u2018Sometimes in social media people act like I must be this prude,\u201d Gross said, \u2018\u2018and they think it\u2019s hilarious that I\u2019ve used a certain word.\u2019\u2019 But Gross talks about sexuality on the air \u2018\u2018not because I want to be prurient\u2019\u2019 but because there is value in speaking honestly about something that is both essential and hidden. She uses the very public space of the interview to access tenderly personal places.", "This fall, Gross marks her 40th anniversary hosting \u2018\u2018Fresh Air.\u2019\u2019 At 64, she is \u2018\u2018the most effective and beautiful interviewer of people on the planet,\u2019\u2019 as Marc Maron said recently, while introducing an episode of his podcast, \u2018\u2018WTF,\u2019\u2019 that featured a conversation with Gross. She\u2019s deft on news and subtle on history, sixth-sensey in probing personal biography and expert at examining the intricacies of artistic process. She is acutely attuned to the twin pulls of disclosure and privacy. \u2018\u2018You started writing memoirs before our culture got as confessional as it\u2019s become, before the word \u2018oversharing\u2019 was coined,\u2019\u2019 Gross said to the writer Mary Karr last month. \u2018\u2018So has that affected your standards of what is meant to be written about and what is meant to maintain silence about?\u2019\u2019 (\u2018\u2018That\u2019s such a smart question,\u2019\u2019 Karr responded. \u2018\u2018Damn it, now I\u2019m going to have to think.\u2019\u2019) Gross says very little about her own life on the air. \u2018\u2018I try not to make it about me,\u2019\u2019 Gross told me. \u2018\u2018I try to use my experiences to help me understand my guests\u2019 experiences, but not to take anything away from them.\u2019\u2019 Early in her career, she realized that remaining somewhat unknown allows \u2018\u2018radio listeners to do what they like to do, which is to create you.\u2019\u2019 She added, \u2018\u2018Whatever you need me to be, I\u2019ll be that.\u2019\u2019", "Over the years, Gross has done some 13,000 interviews, and the sheer range of people she has spoken to, coupled with her intelligence and empathy, has given her the status of national interviewer. Think of it as a symbolic role, like the poet laureate \u2014 someone whose job it is to ask the questions, with a degree of art and honor. Barbara Walters was once our national interviewer, in a flashier style defined by a desire for spectacle. Gross is an interviewer defined by a longing for intimacy. In a culture in which we are all talking about ourselves more than ever, Gross is not only listening intently; she\u2019s asking just the right questions.", "Just before 10, Gross filled a compostable cup with half room-temperature water and half steaming water from a hissing machine on her desk. She has short blond-gray hair and heavy-framed glasses. She wears fitted jackets and chunky black shoes, stud earrings and red lipstick. To movie theaters, she brings a bag of pillows; at 4 feet 11 inches tall, she has often described herself as \u2018\u2018smaller than life.\u2019\u2019 In her, a fragility \u2014 fair skin, narrow bones \u2014 is fused with a powerful sense of self-containment. She feels a periodic need to take a walk around the block.", "This morning\u2019s interview was with Sarah Hepola, the author of a memoir of alcoholism, \u2018\u2018Blackout: Remembering the Things I Drank to Forget.\u2019\u2019 I went into the control room to listen. \u2018\u2018Terry will be with you in a second,\u2019\u2019 an engineer told Hepola, who was waiting in a studio in Dallas. As a practicality, Gross performs most of her interviews long distance.", "The control room had an anticipatory backstage feel. Moments earlier, a director was gesturing like a conductor, asking an engineer to \u2018\u2018Hit it!\u2019\u2019 with an audio clip. In high school, Gross wanted to be a lyricist; one of the things she loves about radio is that it has \u2018\u2018just enough theater.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Fresh Air\u2019\u2019 is intensely collaborative, and many staff members have been there for years, including the executive producer Danny Miller, who started as an intern in 1978.", "\u2018\u2018Hello, is this Sarah? Hi, this is Terry Gross. I\u2019ll be doing the interview with you today.\u2019\u2019 Gross\u2019s voice is briskly warm, with a luster that conveys the pleasure she takes in it as an instrument. For years, she took singing lessons; she told her instructor that she wasn\u2019t trying to become good at singing \u2014 \u2018\u2018I just want to be inside a song, to the extent that I can be. To just have my body inside a song.\u2019\u2019 The goal was raptness in a form she loves.", "\u2018\u2018If I ask you anything too personal \u2014 I know your book is personal, but say I cross a line, just tell me, and we\u2019ll move on,\u2019\u2019 she said to Hepola. \u2018\u2018And you can tell me anything on the record or off the record. O.K.? Swell.\u2019\u2019", "I settled in to listen.

Hepola told Gross, \u2018\u2018This was just as wonderful as I\u2019d dreamed it would be for 10 years,\u2019\u2019 and I wondered what her interview dream had been like.", "\u2018\u2018I have this very specific memory of being in a coffee shop in the West Village and working on a section of my book about adolescence,\u2019\u2019 Hepola said to me on the phone. \u2018\u2018And, bing! I heard Terry in my head. She was like: \u2018This is amazing. No one has really ever talked about adolescence in the way that you\u2019re talking about it right now.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 At that point, Hepola was early in her sobriety.

It\u2019s a wish not for recognition but for an experience. It\u2019s a wish for Gross to locate your genius, even if that genius has not yet been expressed. It\u2019s a wish to be seen as in a wish to be understood.", "The interview wish is as old as the form itself. Journalistic interviews in the United States increasingly began to appear in the 1860s. Before that, when reporters talked to people, they typically didn\u2019t quote them. Once interviewing started, it became a craze. It had its own practitioners, often women, who were thought to be better at drawing people out. Henry James\u2019s journalists were almost all \u2018\u2018interviewers,\u2019\u2019 and his characters, like Selah Tarrant in \u2018\u2018The Bostonians,\u2019\u2019 crave their scrutiny: \u2018\u2018The wish of his soul was that he might be interviewed,\u2019\u2019 James wrote.", "At first the interview was regarded as a particularly American phenomenon \u2014 pushy, but fair too, because it involved the cooperation of the interviewee, not just a sneaky reporter. The practice shifted radically after World War II. Television gained popularity \u2014 the age of the broadcast interviewer began. And psychoanaly\u00adsis \u2014 that other great innovation in opening people up \u2014 was being practiced more widely.", "Gross\u2019s interviews have often been compared to therapy. That\u2019s in part because of her seemingly neutral stance, but also because of the feeling of safety she gives her interviewees. Once in a while, a guest confesses to Gross that he\u2019s confiding something for the very first time. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve said that to anyone,\u2019\u2019 the \u2018\u2018Project Runway\u2019\u2019 host Tim Gunn told Gross in 2014, of spending time in a psychiatric hospital as an adolescent. Gross\u2019s response was as affecting as Gunn\u2019s story. She handles confessions quietly, acknowledging the weight of what\u2019s been said without drawing undue attention to it.", "Gross herself started seeing a therapist several years ago. \u2018\u2018When she asks me a question that gets exactly to the heart of what I\u2019m trying to say, but maybe haven\u2019t articulated clearly, it just feels so good,\u2019\u2019 Gross told me. \u2018\u2018My ideal as an interviewer is to be the person who gets it. Like somebody can tell you something really personal,\u2019\u2019 she continued, and \u2018\u2018you can ask them something that can help them comfortably move to the next place and go deeper.\u2019\u2019 She went on: \u2018\u2018Hearing someone speak really personally, and having that affirm your experience as a sexual person, or as a sick person, or just as a person trying to get through daily life, is really valuable. And I think that\u2019s why we turn to literature, I think that\u2019s why we turn to film, beyond the entertainment it gives us.\u2019\u2019", "She loves interviewing artists, she told me, because they are \u2018\u2018the people we designate to open up their lives for examination so we can understand better who we are.\u2019\u2019 They offer up their own stories as \u2018\u2018what Updike called \u2018specimen lives,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018Examples of what it\u2019s like to be human.\u2019\u2019", "Gross was born in 1951 in Brooklyn. She grew up in Sheepshead Bay, between Avenues X and Y. It was a new neighborhood, with postwar apartment buildings that went up on the site of an old racetrack. As a little girl, Gross loved realistic fiction (Beverly Cleary, the Betsy-Tacy series) and would retreat to the couch with a book when her family visited relatives.", "Gross\u2019s father helped run a family business selling materials to hatmakers. Her mother had worked as a secretary but quit after Gross\u2019s older brother was born, and later Gross would seek the life outside the home that wasn\u2019t available to her mother.", "As a freshman at SUNY Buffalo, Gross wanted to write. But she was worried she wasn\u2019t good enough to be great, and she struggled to find a subject. At the same time, she was shedding her \u2018\u2018good girl\u2019\u2019 identity. She tried being a hippie \u2014 \u2018\u2018I was too inhibited to be very convincing at it. And too Sheepshead Bay, probably\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and she tried drugs. One of the first times she dropped LSD, she determinedly brought along paper and pen: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going to have a subject,\u2019\u2019 she recalls thinking. \u2018\u2018All of my writerly inhibitions are going to open up, and my talent is going to be released!\u2019\u2019 LSD didn\u2019t help her writing, but for Gross it was a beneficially \u2018\u2018immersive experience.\u2019\u2019", "In the first months after she graduated in 1972, Gross floundered. She had married, but would soon divorce; she was fired from a job teaching eighth grade after only six weeks (she couldn\u2019t control the class). But then she discovered radio. One afternoon, about a year after she finished school, she was sitting in her house in Buffalo listening to \u2018\u2018Womanpower,\u2019\u2019 a feminist program on WBFO, the university station. One of her roommates was a guest, and she came out as gay on the air. Gross was surprised by the revelation, but more so by the way her roommate had delivered it: sitting before a microphone in a radio studio.", "Gross, who had wanted to do \u2018\u2018something in media\u2019\u2019 but hadn\u2019t known how to begin, was intrigued. Through her roommate, she learned there was an opening on \u2018\u2018Womanpower,\u2019\u2019 and Gross started on the show as a volunteer. Just over a year later, she moved to a program called \u2018\u2018This Is Radio.\u2019\u2019 The show\u2019s superpower was a phone line that allowed the staff to call anywhere in New York State toll-free. Gross would scour the Village Voice classifieds for people who might be interesting \u2014 jazz musicians offering lessons, a tattoo artist \u2014 and call them up and interview them. During college Gross had shed some of her innate reserve, but \u2018\u2018I still was just inhibitively shy,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018With a microphone, I wasn\u2019t shy.\u2019\u2019", "In 1975, Gross moved to Philadelphia to take over \u2018\u2018Fresh Air,\u2019\u2019 which was created by a former WBFO colleague (NPR began distributing it as a daily show in 1987). Gross says she was \u2018\u2018always inquisitive,\u2019\u2019 and her curiosity vibrates on the surface of old tape. In a 1980 conversation that was rebroadcast in September, Gross, still in her 20s, called the horror-film maker Wes Craven. Craven was not yet famous \u2014 this was years before \u2018\u2018A Nightmare on Elm Street\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but Gross had recently seen his slasher film \u2018\u2018The Last House on the Left.\u2019\u2019 She was so disturbed by its sadism that she wanted to find out who made it. Craven told her he was bothered by a sense that America had become \u2018\u2018immune to violence,\u2019\u2019 and he wanted to show the reality of it.", "\u2018\u2018I really understand what you\u2019re saying,\u2019\u2019 Gross told him, \u2018\u2018and I know that the movies I grew up on, even, like, the World War II and World War I movies, people were killed without any blood ever coming out.\u2019\u2019 Her response indicated that she was not out to attack Craven but to explore his motivations.", "\u2018\u2018You know, it went back to something that happened to me when I was a kid,\u2019\u2019 he ventured. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be interested in hearing it\u2014\u2019\u2019", "Of course she\u2019d be interested in hearing it! We all would. What emerged was a textured and totally creepy story of a mail-order bow-and-arrow set and a rat that took too long to die.", "Gross\u2019s impulse to explore what provokes her \u2014 the impulse that drove her to pick up the landline and call Craven \u2014 underlies her 40 years of interviews. Ira Glass, who was my boss at \u2018\u2018This American Life,\u2019\u2019 observes that Gross brings \u2018\u2018real questions she personally has been wondering about\u2019\u2019 to the kind of interviews that tell us \u2018\u2018what should we make of the latest news from Iraq or Syria\u2019\u2019 \u2014 as well as the good editorial sense of when to let an expert \u2018\u2018march off in unplanned directions.\u2019\u2019 He adds: \u2018\u2018There\u2019ve been times when I\u2019ve relistened, just to hear the order of the questions and to figure out what was planned and unplanned. Like a magician sitting in on another guy\u2019s act for two nights so he can figure out the trick, to steal it.\u2019\u2019 Glass singles out Gross\u2019s \u2018\u2018great improviser\u2019s performance chops. Not surprising that she loves jazz artists and stand-up comedians so much. She\u2019s their journalist peer.\u2019\u2019", "In June 2014, Gross interviewed Hillary Clinton, who was then promoting her memoir, \u2018\u2018Hard Choices.\u2019\u2019 Gross interviews very few politicians because it is difficult to get them to speak candidly. When she does, she moves into a register that is authoritative but no less authentic. Gross noted that as a senator Clinton didn\u2019t support gay marriage, but as secretary of state she emerged as an advocate for L.G.B.T. rights. \u2018\u2018She\u2019s on the international stage, where gay people are still being executed in some countries, or certainly imprisoned, and she\u2019s coming out not only for lesbian and gay rights but she\u2019s adding the T,\u2019\u2019 Gross said to me. \u2018\u2018I thought that was brave and remarkable. But I wanted her to bridge the gap.\u2019\u2019", "Gross framed the question by asking if there were things Clinton believed in personally but couldn\u2019t come out and support as a politician \u2014 like gay marriage? \u2018\u2018And I think she totally misinterpreted it as me trying to say, \u2018You\u2019re such a hypocrite.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "The exchange became rivetingly uncomfortable, with Clinton growing increasingly defensive as Gross asked whether her views on gay marriage had evolved, or whether she was responding to changes in American public opinion. Clinton was stubbornly evasive: \u2018\u2018I said I\u2019m an American, so we all evolved.\u2019\u2019 The back and forth continued:", "When the interview ended, Gross and her producers asked themselves, \u2018\u2018Are we going to keep that in the edit?\u2019\u2019 Yes, they decided: \u2018\u2018Maybe there\u2019s not a really satisfactory, conclusive answer,\u2019\u2019 but \u2018\u2018it felt like a real moment.\u2019\u2019 Gross went on: \u2018\u2018Even if the real moment isn\u2019t somebody being really honest and forthcoming and introspective, a real moment of friction, a real moment of tension, is still a real moment.\u2019\u2019", "Occasionally the \u2018\u2018real moments\u2019\u2019 can be awkward for Gross. In July, in an interview with the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, Gross began laughing in response to a story he told about being yelled at by a teacher. \u2018\u2018See, it sounds like you\u2019re laughing because, like, it\u2019s funny if you\u2019ve never been in the environment,\u2019\u2019 Coates said. Some on social media pegged Gross as a clueless white lady. But the exchange was constructive. Gross was simply reacting, and then listening as Coates explained his perception of her reaction. In doing so, he illuminated an experience of growing up in a culture of fear and violence.", "On \u2018\u2018Fresh Air,\u2019\u2019 we listen to Gross grapple with the most complex questions of existence \u2014 racial prejudice, faith, family, illness, morality, betrayal, gratitude. In 2011, when Maurice Sendak was 83, Gross called him at his home in Connecticut. What was meant to be a short conversation about his new book, \u2018\u2018Bumble-Ardy,\u2019\u2019 became a meditation on his nearness to death. You feel Sendak looking over into it from his living room.", "Sendak is scratchy and emotional, and Gross is gentle with him. \u2018\u2018And almost certainly, I\u2019ll go before you go,\u2019\u2019 he tells her. \u2018\u2018So I won\u2019t have to miss you.\u2019\u2019", "When Gross was growing up, she and her mother would take the subway to the department stores in Downtown Brooklyn twice a year, \u2018\u2018once for your fall wardrobe and once for your spring.\u2019\u2019 After they shopped, they would have two sandwiches at Junior\u2019s for lunch \u2014 corned beef and shrimp salad \u2014 and \u2018\u2018split them half and half.\u2019\u2019 Years later, when Gross\u2019s mother was living in Florida and sick with lung cancer, \u2018\u2018I took her shopping, and I helped her on and off with her clothes. It might not sound like a big deal to other people, but it made me so sad.\u2019\u2019 She continued: \u2018\u2018It made me so sad, the way the roles flipped.\u2019\u2019", "Eventually her mother\u2019s mind started to go, in part because of the chemotherapy. \u2018\u2018As she lost some of her cognitive abilities, I thought of myself as having duets with her. I\u2019d have these conversations where I knew that she knew the answers to the questions. I knew we were on safe territory,\u2019\u2019 she told me. \u2018\u2018I knew my part, she knew her part and we could converse that way.\u2019\u2019", "Gross and I were alone in the studio, a large room with sage green walls. Sunlight was filtered by screens, and the soundproofing sealed us off from the world. It was as if we had zipped ourselves inside a tent. We were talking about the deaths of Gross\u2019s parents, and I asked about Sendak, in relation to something I\u2019d been wondering about \u2014 the interplay between an interview and her private life. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t think of this until later,\u2019\u2019 Gross said. \u2018\u2018But the interview that I had with him was in a way the conversation I never had with my parents.\u2019\u2019", "She went on: \u2018\u2018I try not to confuse the two. I try not to equate the interview with real life. But at the same time, there\u2019s an intimacy in the interview \u2014 like, I\u2019m telling you things that people I work with probably don\u2019t know, because it doesn\u2019t come up. I would tell them if they asked, but it\u2019s just not a part of what you talk about in day-to-day work life necessarily.\u2019\u2019", "We had plans for dinner, and down the hall, in her office, Gross collected her things. She wheeled a crate-size cart of books and papers out to the parking lot, then transferred the contents to her trunk. The steering wheel was hot, and Gross put on puffy black winter gloves with leopard-print lining to protect her hands. Then she drove unexpectedly fast down Old City\u2019s narrow streets.", "On a typical day, Gross is at the office from 8:45 to 5:45. She and her husband, Francis Davis, who is a music critic, will go out for dinner (not fancy places: \u2018\u2018We like diners and delis\u2019\u2019), and then Gross will continue working at home, preparing for the next day\u2019s interview in the living room. She clarifies her thoughts first thing in the morning in the shower. That\u2019s when she asks herself: What do I care about? What in all of this research is meaningful? It\u2019s important to be away from her notes when she does this. She emerges from the shower with her \u2018\u2018major destination points.\u2019\u2019 Then she goes to her office and refers back to her notes \u2014 sheafs of facts; dog-eared, marked-up books \u2014 for the details. Then she does the interview. And then she is inundated by the other daily tasks of running a radio show. The next day, she does it all again. \u2018\u2018And that\u2019s been my whole adult life,\u2019\u2019 she told me. It\u2019s part grind and part devotion. As a young woman, Gross wanted to find \u2018\u2018a passion that could become my work.\u2019\u2019 She decided not to have children. \u2018\u2018I do feel like I was part of the first generation that actually had a choice. Where we would not be seen as either tragic or lacking in some way for not having children.\u2019\u2019", "The last time I visited Gross at the station, it was a Friday. She was wearing a loose denim jacket, and we were sitting across a table from each other, talking about weekend plans. \u2018\u2018Friday nights and Saturday nights Francis and I usually spend alone together because the weeks are just so crazy and so hectic and so noisy, like I have so many people in my head\u2019\u2019 \u2014 she cupped her hands next to her ears like headphones. \u2018\u2018You know what I mean?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Like in your ears,\u2019\u2019 I said, nodding. Sometimes, doing radio, your head falls to the pillow with someone\u2019s voice still collected there.", "Gross and Davis met in 1976 at a record store near the station. \u2018\u2018As I was falling in love with him, I also fell in love with his writing,\u2019\u2019 Gross told me on another day. Davis is also devoted to his work \u2014 in the pre-laptop era, he would lug a huge typewriter on vacations. The two always try to have dinner together. When Gross was younger, and working late nights, \u2018\u2018I would call him, and we\u2019d kind of have dinner together, because I\u2019d talk to him the whole time I was eating dinner. So we\u2019d be having dinner together whether we were in the same room or not.\u2019\u2019", "That weekend Gross had plans to see a four-and-a-half-hour opera, Rossini\u2019s \u2018\u2018William Tell.\u2019\u2019 She discovered opera only recently, and wishes she had found it when she was still taking singing lessons with an instructor, who died a few years ago. From him she learned about head tones and chest tones and how, when you\u2019re singing, your voice \u2018\u2018should resonate in the bones of your face.\u2019\u2019 She added: \u2018\u2018When I was taking singing lessons, I felt like, No one\u2019s having more pleasure in singing than I am. I sound horrible, but that doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m enjoying it.\u2019\u2019", "Outside the window, Philadelphia tourists were gliding by on Segways. Across from me, Gross was serene. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a function of age or temperament,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u2018\u2018but I\u2019m no longer seeking those major exclamatory notes of pleasure. I want a life that has pleasure contained within it.\u2019\u2019", "After Gross and I talked, we went for her usual walk around the block. It was a hot evening, and the sun was blazing as we passed the fortress of the Federal Reserve. And at that moment, the conversation got very personal, for me. I wound up telling Gross a secret. While I hadn\u2019t planned to do this, afterward I wondered whether some subconscious part of me had orchestrated it \u2014 whether, in some pathetic way, I was enacting my own interview wish.", "As I was about to make the confession, I said something like, \u2018\u2018O.K., I\u2019ll tell you, because you\u2019re Terry Gross,\u2019\u2019 which I immediately regretted. It was as if I was talking to Terry Gross the national interviewer. And maybe I was. I\u2019ve projected, the same as any listener. But we had spent time together, and she was no longer just a character to me. I wanted to confide in her because I wanted to be close to her, even as I was aware that this, too, could be as reflective of the roles we were playing as of \u2018\u2018reality.\u2019\u2019", "We were on a walk of predetermined length, undertaken for professional reasons. There were implicit boundaries. And on that sidewalk, I felt as if I was getting an answer to my question about whether, and how, the intimacy of such moments carried over into the world outside the studio, for both Gross and her subjects. Because while I was here with Gross as a function of my work, I was speaking to her from the heart of my life. It felt heightened, in the way that reporting does, but also scary, in the way that vulnerability does.", "All the time we walked, Gross was asking questions, and offering advice, which is different from on the radio. When we finished the walk, and I was leaving, I became nervously formal. When I reached to shake her hand, she very simply took mine in both of hers.", "I felt so awkward for days after the exchange had happened. Was it going to ruin the ongoing interaction? What did she think of me? It spoke to something important in the piece, but it was self-indulgent. Was it even worth including?", "But then I thought \u2014 real moment.

He arrived wearing a black beanie hat and a matching zip-up sweater. His nerves were frayed as he sat down for breakfast with two of Twitter\u2019s board members.", "It was just before the 2008 presidential election, and Mr. Dorsey was the chief executive of Twitter, then a fledgling start-up with a couple of dozen employees that was in disarray, replete with hourly server crashes and mismanaged employees.", "The board was not happy with his leadership. Sitting with an untouched bowl of yogurt and granola that morning, Mr. Dorsey was fired from the social network he had helped invent in 2006.", "Since then, Mr. Dorsey has been politicking and striving to take back the helm of Twitter. On Monday, he finally achieved that goal, returning as permanent chief executive of the San Francisco-based company almost seven years after he was ousted from the position.", "That may prove to be the easy part.", "While Twitter has gone public and grown considerably since Mr. Dorsey left in 2008 \u2014 it now has 4,100 employees and offices in more than 35 countries \u2014 the company finds itself, nearing the 2016 presidential election, in a new state of disarray.", "The board is fragmented, made up of former chiefs of Twitter \u2014 one of whom announced his departure on Monday \u2014 and others who rarely seem to use the service they govern. For years, the company has had a revolving door for executives, some who left voluntarily, while many were pushed out in power struggles. Employee morale is precarious.", "Twitter, as a product, has also barely changed since Mr. Dorsey left and returned, which has contributed to the company\u2019s major challenges. Twitter\u2019s 316 million active users pale in comparison to Facebook\u2019s 1.5 billion, and even Instagram\u2019s 400 million, and user growth has flatlined. The company\u2019s value has plunged from almost $40 billion shortly after its initial public offering in November 2013 to a low of $16.5 billion this August. It remains at less than $20 billion now.", "Twitter is not growing as fast as it could, the angel investor Ron Conway once told me, because the company doesn\u2019t think big enough. \u201cTwitter could be the next Google if it wanted to be,\u201d he said.", "Now all of these problems are Mr. Dorsey\u2019s to fix.", "\u201cUser growth is ultimately not going to be the biggest challenge; engaged users is what the company really needs,\u201d said Brian Blau, a research director at Gartner who covers social media. \u201cAnd ultimately they have to be engaged users that want to spend money with their advertisers.\u201d", "If Mr. Dorsey pulls off a turnaround, he may also be able to repair his own image, which has taken some hits over the years. He was once criticized for emulating Steve Jobs, who was ejected from Apple, the company Mr. Jobs co-founded. And Mr. Dorsey came under fire for taking sole credit for the creation of Twitter, even though several people contributed to its origin.", "Mr. Dorsey has some advantages in taking over Twitter now, even with the company\u2019s problems. He has grown to become an expert at boardroom politics, for example \u2014 he was executive chairman of both Twitter and Square until Monday\u2019s announcement, when he stepped down from that role at Twitter, and was able to convince both boards to let him run both companies. He is also a board member at Disney. He has shown he can be an effective chief executive, taking Square to a valuation of several billion dollars and the company to the verge of a public offering. And with all of these jobs \u2014 he is also an adviser to several start-ups \u2014 he is now a multibillionaire.", "Twitter also has colossal strengths. The service has become the zeitgeist of a million moments, where the pope, presidential candidates, celebrities, the rich, the poor and the disadvantaged all gather in the same room to talk about live events, and to make history.", "A former adviser to Twitter, who is close to the board, recently told me that in many respects, Mr. Dorsey\u2019s becoming chief executive will be the true test of whether the social network can become more mainstream (as its board hopes) and more profitable (as its investors expect).", "That\u2019s because Mr. Dorsey has, at least for now, the support of a board that is trying hard to turn around the company. Mr. Dorsey also has the power of being a co-founder. That may give him a freer hand in choices about the product, without anyone else meddling in his decisions.", "That has never been true for any of Twitter\u2019s previous chief executives. Last decade when he led Twitter, Mr. Dorsey found himself constantly at odds with Evan Williams, another co-founder, who owned the majority of Twitter.", "A freer hand has been tough to gain for many of Twitter\u2019s previous chief executives.

Google is not only the dominant search product on both desktop and mobile phones, \u201cGoogling\u201d is so ingrained in the Internet psyche \u2014 and it works so well \u2014 that even the force of habit would be hard to overcome.", "But after several years of more or less ignoring search, investors believe that could change. Mobile phones are new, the thinking goes, and people use them differently than they do desktops. Therefore, the time is ripe to create a new way to search.", "There are also some technical reasons. In the early days of the web people used search to navigate the vast sea of documents on the web. But today, a good amount of the most relevant information sits inside a handful of key applications with \u201cstructured data\u201d \u2014 data that is well-organized and easier to find and search.", "That makes the task of building a new search engine a whole lot easier than it was when Google was starting out.

I couldn\u2019t see where it led, though I was certain it was to Sushidai. It is widely known that at this tiny restaurant a breakfast of some of the world\u2019s freshest sushi begins with a multi-hour wait near a parking lot, as if you\u2019re outside Walmart on Black Friday hoping to snap up a flat-screen TV.

The sun, emerging after days of intermittent rain, was merciless. People were hunched on the curb, hanging their heads as if awaiting jail time, not green tea and fatty tuna. I put on sunglasses, opened a black umbrella and sank down, cocooning myself on the asphalt. For 45 minutes all I saw were shoes: white sandals, red sneakers, yellow ballet flats. At one point a man appeared, stood a few people behind me and said, \u201cFrom here you have to wait three hours.\u201d The two young women in front of me \u2014 for the sake of brevity I\u2019ll refer to them by their accoutrements, Trucker Hat and Crop Top \u2014 derided those who had left the line.", "\u201cHashtag weak,\u201d said Crop Top.", "Easy to say when you\u2019re not traveling solo.

Tables for two or more are not the default arrangement, thanks to standing sushi bars and long counters at restaurants specializing in tempura, ramen and soba. It is not uncommon to sit opposite a sushi chef and talk, or to order a meal from a restaurant ticket machine and enjoy it on a stool alongside other solo diners. At department store food halls, one can buy bento boxes, hot dumplings, and savory pancakes known as okonomiyaki and dig in at nearby tables. And at any 7-Eleven (they\u2019re ubiquitous and a go-to lunch spot) onigiri, balls of rice filled with meat, fish or vegetables that fit in your palm, can be had for a couple of dollars for a tasty lunch on the run.", "If you\u2019re concerned about safety, consider that the general crime rate in Japan is \u201cwell below\u201d the United States national average, according to the U.S. Department of State.

In Tokyo I walked (looking down on occasion at decorative manhole covers emblazoned with flowers and fire engines) or rode the subway (buy a 1,000 yen day-pass for the Metro and the Toei subway if you want to simplify things). But on this particular outing I decided to see what it was like to take a taxi in Tokyo, where drivers wear white gloves and passenger doors open automatically, as if by ghosts.", "On the way to Senso-ji, one of the city\u2019s oldest temples, my driver and I carried on a conversation using broken English and Japanese, friendly smiles and the Google Translate app on my iPhone. When I urged him to accept a large bill because I liked him and lacked exact change (tipping is generally not done), he declined. I insisted. This went on until he turned to me with a wide grin, took less than the cost of the ride from my pile of yen, and said with perfect clarity: \u201cDiscount!\u201d", "The entrance to Senso-ji Temple is not unlike the exit of a Disney World ride.

Believers let the smoke waft over their bodies and cleanse their hands in a nearby fountain, where water spouts from the mouths of dragons. Those who hope to glimpse the future give a few yen to read their fortune on slips of paper. Up the stone steps and inside the main hall, adherents stand before the inner sanctum with its sculpture of bodhisattva Kannon, \u201csent to relieve human misery on earth,\u201d a sign says. They press their palms together; they pray. Coins clang as visitors toss them into a large bin at the foot of the bodhisattva.", "Tranquillity can prove elusive amid the clank of change and the packs of tourists, undeterred by passing downpours. The quiet side streets around the temple, the color of silver mackerel after the rain and empty save for a rickshaw, beckoned. So did a dark sign below a tree limb around a corner: \u201cEnshrining Benzai-ten (the goddess of fortune).\u201d How could one resist?", "I was her only visitor. Known as the goddess of music, wealth and literature, Benzai-ten is on a small hill in the tidy Benten-Do Temple. Its black and gold doors were thrown open to the damp summer air. Inside, a candle flickered. A priest, his head shorn, knelt before her. I stood outside looking in.", "Shrines even more serene are hidden throughout the city. And I do mean hidden. One afternoon in Ginza, the ritzy shopping district, I passed a temporary billboard, which noted that Shinto priests have been conducting religious rites at nearby Toyoiwa Inari, home to the god of marriage, since 1928. Finding a spouse is easier than finding his shrine. A red sanctuary where a pair of regal-looking fox statues stand sentry, the shrine is wedged between two tall buildings at the end of an alley that at first blush seems as if it could only be home to mice and trash cans.", "The brick streets surrounding Toyoiwa Inari are lined with upscale boutiques and international chains, from Apple to Zara. The architecture is not as eye-popping as that in the Aoyama district, where the glass Prada store by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, architects of the Tate Modern in London, is a tower of huge green diamonds. Nor are the stores as playful as those in Shibuya, like Mandarake, the manga and anime chain.", "Ginza, however, has luxurious mega department stores where Japanese brands such as Double Standard Clothing (shopping bags said: \u201cI saw you sad. And your sadness is very sexy\u201d) mix with international labels. At Ginza Mitsukoshi this summer, the French house Lanvin was selling pieces from a less expensive, \u201conly-in-Japan\u201d line, as the saleswoman put it, called Lanvin en Bleu, where skirts could be had for $100, instead of $1,000.", "Of course, in Tokyo, you don\u2019t go to stores just to shop. At another Mitsukoshi, moments before opening, a woman in traditional Japanese clothing came outside and thanked shoppers for visiting. As the first wave of customers flooded the store, staff members on each floor bowed in unison.", "Indeed, department stores are a must-see if only to gawk at basement food halls such as Mitsukoshi\u2019s Ginza Food Garden, where the Paradox of Choice is in full effect thanks to display cases that dazzle with meticulously presented bento boxes, fluffy tempura plates, mochi, and chocolate discs adorned with edible pigs and bears.", "Some of the most rewarding food is found in basements. In the labyrinthine bowels of Tokyo Station, in the Marunouchi business district, is a section known as Tokyo Ramen Street, the realm of top ramen makers, including Rokurinsha Toyko. At this modest restaurant, where the rumble of trains is offset by the slurping of contented customers, the line is routinely out the door.", "I don\u2019t know how I finally found the place, or what I ordered from the machine at the entrance. I looked at photos of ramen bowls and pushed a button. Or three. I put in yen. Some spat out. An attendant came over to help, then showed me to a banquette near other solo diners facing the open kitchen. Ramen of one sort or another was on its way.", "Confusion is part of the Tokyo novice experience. It was a relief, at least for this traveler who likes to be in charge, to surrender to the unknown, to not have, or even know how to get, all the answers. Someone would always point me in the right direction. Or I would do the pointing \u2014 at photos of objects, at food, at myself. At Temomin Suite at the Tokyo International Forum, one of the city\u2019s affordable walk-in massage shops, I stretched out in a cabana and pointed at my sore neck. The masseuse needed no further instruction.", "There was something appealing about not speaking much. Communication was reduced to the bare essentials. No more, no less, than what needed to be said. And what couldn\u2019t be said was expressed through looks and gestures, or simply forgotten.", "Similarly, it was by observing that I learned how to eat whatever it was I ordered. At Rokurinsha on Tokyo Ramen Street I received two bowls: one with thick, chewy tsukemen (heavenly dipping noodles) and a soft-boiled egg; the other included broth, bones and nori (dried seaweed). I observed the technique of the woman next to me, also dining solo, as she held her egg aloft with chopsticks, then used a spoon to cradle it from below as she took a bite.", "Such was my education and entertainment. Tokyo has an overwhelming number of highly produced diversions, many of which can be comfortably enjoyed alone: arcades, Kabuki shows, amusement parks such as Tokyo Joypolis and Tokyo Dome City, and cafes where women dressed like maids will treat you like the millionaire that you aren\u2019t. After dark, areas like Shinjuku pulse with kaleidoscopic lights and carousers.", "I prefer to turn in early and rise with the fishmongers.", "\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d asked one of the chefs at Sushidai at the Tsukiji market (which will be moving to a new location in 2016) when I took a seat at the counter. So began the conversation: with him, with the Canadian couple to my left, with the family to my right. The family didn\u2019t speak English, but that morning we all spoke sushi, nodding in appreciation of what our chef put in front of each of us: a dozen vivid, moist, generous pieces of fish including fatty tuna, snapper, sea eel and mackerel.", "\u201cMy favorite,\u201d the chef told me.", "It was like eating sushi for the first time.

In the \u201960s, San Francisco was synonymous with the hippie counterculture; in the \u201990s, it was the dot-com boom (and eventual bust, in the early 2000s); more recently, it was the ripening of the Bay Area food movement.

He is, to Agu and the others, a larger-than-life figure, half monster and half wizard.

Facebook currently faces challenges from five European regulators, including a Dutch-led investigation into how the company uses data from services like Instagram and WhatsApp and a Belgian effort to stop it from tracking consumers who have not joined the service.", "Mr. Schrems, lawmakers and various regulators are essentially asking why consumers don\u2019t have more control over the information gathered by their computers and phones \u2014 and perhaps soon by their smartwatches and self-driving cars. \u201cThis is something we see as a fundamental value,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. To drive home the analogy for an American, he put it this way: \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t feel like applying the First Amendment.\u2019 \u201d", "Mr. Schrems first became interested in privacy when he spent a year as an exchange student in Avon Park, a town in central Florida. It was quite a shock for a 16-year-old from cosmopolitan Salzburg, Austria\u2019s fourth-largest city. \u201cEveryone was deeply religious, everyone was Republican,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. He remembers being surprised at the level of security in his high school, which had video cameras mounted in the hallway.", "Like many young, well-educated Europeans, Mr. Schrems likes the United States, but he objects to the tendency of Silicon Valley companies to beg forgiveness rather than ask permission. \u201cThe approach of the big companies is saying we\u2019re above the law,\u201d he said. Not for nothing does he call his organization \u2014 which consists mostly of him and some university friends \u2014 Europe-v-Facebook.", "One reason European countries take privacy so seriously is that it\u2019s technically considered two rights. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the right to \u201crespect for private and family life\u201d and also, separately, that \u201ceveryone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.\u201d It also says that data protection laws must be overseen by independent regulators, which is why national data protection authorities in Europe have so much power.", "\u201cData protection is a right to determine how \u2014 rather than whether \u2014 one participates in sharing information,\u201d says Viktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute who writes on these issues. That distinction is important: Data protection doesn\u2019t just protect information individuals don\u2019t want to share; it also gives them some control over information that companies have already gathered. Like every right, it has limits. But \u201cit\u2019s intended to give individuals control over every phase and stage of the use of their personal information,\u201d he said.", "The concept of data protection as distinct from privacy only dates back to the late 1960s, when computers and databases became more sophisticated. With memories of World War II-era fascism still relatively fresh, European countries began passing data-protection laws in the 1970s. In 1983, the German Federal Constitutional Court recognized an individual\u2019s right to control information about himself as \u201cinformationelle selbstbestimmung,\u201d or \u201cinformational self-determination,\u201d a phrase that sounds very German even after translating it into English.", "To American lawyers, \u201cinformational self-determination\u201d can sound more like literary theory than law. And even some Europeans see data protection laws as based on confusing logic and overseen by old-fashioned bureaucracies that can complicate everyday tasks without offering an effective way to stop truly bad actors.", "But Continental European law recognizes a concept of personal dignity, which includes privacy and reputation, that needs to be respected. That\u2019s why the European Court of Justice last year recognized the so-called right to be forgotten, which lets individuals seek removal of search engine links to information about them that\u2019s \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant.\u201d", "To Mr. Schrems, the debate in the United States that arose out of the Snowden leaks was centered on the question of security \u2014 keeping information out of the hands of others. In technology circles, that discussion often revolves around encryption and other technical solutions that put the onus on individuals to protect themselves, a popular idea in libertarian-leaning Silicon Valley that doesn\u2019t play as well in Europe.", "\u201cEncryption is based to some extent on the idea that the law won\u2019t protect your rights, so you have to protect yourself,\u201d says Karl-Nikolaus Peifer, director of the Institute for Media Law and Communications Law of the University of Cologne. \u201cThe European tradition is that the law will protect you.\u201d", "Two days after I met Mr. Schrems in Vienna, I watched him give a short speech at an International Bar Association conference at the Savoy Hotel in London.", "He looked distinctly out of place amid all the lawyers in suits.

Mr. Schrems appealed. Perhaps most important, however, Mr. Schrems\u2019s original complaints helped inspire the forthcoming European Union data protection legislation. \u201cHe was actually the trigger for me to understand that we couldn\u2019t continue the way the law was applied,\u201d said Viviane Reding, the former European Union justice commissioner who proposed the law and is now a member of the European Parliament.", "The current version of the legislation calls for a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d system in which American companies would be regulated primarily by the data protection authority of the country in which their European headquarters were in.

But the court\u2019s decision will make that difficult, and it seems to open the door for national regulators to investigate any of those transfers, which could cause significant headaches for technology companies. Final decisions, made by the European Court of Justice, would be based on corporate behavior, including, potentially, whether companies were cooperating with the N.S.A. American technology companies could also move some operations to Europe, thus avoiding the need to transfer data across the Atlantic.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a massive tension between the libertarian values of Silicon Valley, which is focused on innovation, and the 28 national regulators focused on the rules and regulations of privacy as a human right,\u201d said J.

Given these grim statistics, it\u2019s no wonder that Americans are a captive market for anything, from supposed smart drugs and supplements to brain training, that promises to boost normal mental functioning or to stem its all-too-common decline.", "The very notion of cognitive enhancement is seductive and plausible. After all, the brain is capable of change and learning at all ages. Our brain has remarkable neuroplasticity; that is, it can remodel and change itself in response to various experiences and injuries. So can it be trained to enhance its own cognitive prowess?", "The multibillion-dollar brain training industry certainly thinks so and claims that you can increase your memory, attention and reasoning just by playing various mental games. In other words, use your brain in the right way and you\u2019ll get smarter.", "A few years back, a joint study by BBC and Cambridge University neuroscientists put brain training to the test. Their question was this: Do brain gymnastics actually make you smarter, or do they just make you better at doing a specific task? For example, playing the math puzzle KenKen will obviously make you better at KenKen. But does the effect transfer to another task you haven\u2019t practiced, like a crossword puzzle?", "The researchers recruited 11,430 viewers on the popular BBC online science program \u201cBang Goes the Theory\u201d for six weeks of brain training, with 10-minute sessions three times each week. Subjects were placed at random in three groups: one experimental group playing games of reasoning and testing problem-solving skills; a second experimental group that emphasized tests of attention, short-term memory and math skills that were typical of commercially available brain-training games; and a control group that performed the equivalent of Google searches by answering obscure test questions.", "All subjects took a benchmark cognitive test, a kind of modified I.Q. test, at the beginning and at the end of the study. Although improvements were observed in every cognitive task that was practiced, there was no evidence that brain training made people smarter.

(Full disclosure: I\u2019m 59, so I\u2019ve got skin in this game.) Unlike the younger participants, older subjects showed a significant improvement in verbal reasoning, one of the components of the benchmark test, after just six weeks of brain training, so the older subjects continued in a follow-up study for a full 12 months.", "Results of this follow-up study, soon to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, generally show that continued brain training helps older subjects maintain the improvement in verbal reasoning seen in the earlier study. This is good news because it suggests that brain exercise might delay some of the effects of aging on the brain.", "OF course, skeptics might argue that older people are already on a downward cognitive trajectory, so their improvement with brain games is not actual enhancement so much as a slowing in the decline of mental acumen. Call it what you will, but it still sounds fine to me.", "There are also easy and powerful ways to enhance learning in young people. For example, there is intriguing evidence that the attitude that young people have about their own intelligence \u2014 and what their teachers believe \u2014 can have a big impact on how well they learn. Carol Dweck, a psychology professor at Stanford University, has shown that kids who think that their intelligence is malleable perform better and are more motivated to learn than those who believe that their intelligence is fixed and unchangeable.", "In one experiment, Dr. Dweck and colleagues gave a group of low-achieving seventh graders a seminar on how the brain works and put the students at random into two groups.

Random selection ensures that any observed differences between the three groups is a result of the type of exercise, not any other characteristics of the subjects. The researchers found that while both resistance and aerobic training groups improved equally on spatial memory, only the women who did aerobic exercise improved on verbal memory, suggesting that different types of exercise might have specifically different cognitive benefits.", "Also, a new study found that women who did weight training twice a week for a year had less brain shrinkage than those who trained once a week or did stretching exercises, though the cognitive significance of this effect is not yet clear.", "How might exercise exert these effects? Intriguingly, exercise in humans and animals increases the level of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, in the blood and brain. BDNF promotes the growth and formation of new neurons, and it may be responsible, in part, for a remarkable effect of exercise on the brain: an increase in size of the hippocampus that is linked with improved memory.", "Conversely, adverse experiences like major depression can lower BDNF levels and are associated with hippocampal shrinkage, a phenomenon that helps explain some of the cognitive impairments that are a hallmark of depression. Aside from making people feel better, antidepressants can block the depression-induced drop in BDNF, so these drugs are, in a sense, neuroprotective.", "I know, exercise is work, so you undoubtedly want to know if there is a smart pill, like Adderall or Ritalin, that will do the trick. Well, there is little question that these stimulants increase focus and make the world feel more interesting by releasing dopamine in key brain circuits. But when it comes to their effects on memory and learning, the data are mixed.", "The only consistent cognitive benefit of stimulants is their effect on the consolidation of long-term memory, meaning that they strengthen the ability to recall previously learned information \u2014 an effect that might confer some advantage in the real world.", "Some worry that stimulants might somehow boost efficiency at the cost of creativity, but research suggests otherwise. The concern reflects a common notion of creativity, namely that you need to be a little unfocused to think in a synthetic, novel way, and that stimulants will impede this mental process.", "For example, one study compared two groups of healthy young adults who were randomly assigned to Adderall or a placebo. Both groups were give four different tests of creative thinking. Adderall enhanced performance on one of the tests, the embedded image test, which requires subjects to reassemble a whole image from a scrambled one.", "Still, these are subtle effects, and there is no evidence that any prescription drug or supplement or smart drink is going to raise your I.Q.", "But there is one thing that doesn\u2019t require a prescription that seems to help preserve cognitive fitness: other people.", "There is strong epidemiologic evidence that people with richer social networks and engagement have a reduced rate of cognitive decline as they age.

Subjects were cognitively assessed with a simple word-recall test at baseline and then at two-year intervals, and social integration was gauged by contact with family, friends and other social activities.", "The results showed that people with the highest level of social integration had less than half the decline in their cognitive function of the least socially active subjects. Also, the cognitive protective effects of socializing were greatest among subjects with fewer than 12 years of education.", "Of course it\u2019s possible that poor memory itself might cause social isolation, so the researchers reanalyzed the data, removing subjects with the worst baseline cognitive function. The results were unchanged, making reverse causation an unlikely explanation for their finding.", "In the end, you can\u2019t yet exceed your innate intelligence. But that seems less important than the fact that there is much that you can do to reach your cognitive potential and to keep it.

In so doing, he played directly to the kind of sentiments encapsulated in this Rebecca Traister post, expressing pleasure at how wonderfully the debate went for liberal Democrats:", "From Las Vegas, we saw what was surely one of the higher-quality debates Democrats (and certainly Republicans) have held in ages, and it was especially good if you were a Hillary Clinton supporter, a Bernie Sanders supporter, a left-of-center Democrat, or anyone who is deeply sick of reading Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2026", "The truth is, Sanders has offered Clinton \u2014 and Democrats \u2014 a million gifts so far this season. Among the most valid fears was that Hillary\u2019s candidacy would go unchallenged, would proceed as a coronation. But the senator from Vermont has already ensured that this won\u2019t be the case. He is a serious challenger, a smart and good man who is probably going to beat her in early states, and perhaps beyond. This is not bad news for Hillary. As tonight\u2019s debate showed, it\u2019s great news. It means there\u2019s someone to keep her on her game; no Hillary is worse than a coasting Hillary. It means an engaged electorate and candidates who need to pay attention to the direction in which their party\u2019s voters want to go.", "This sentiment, I think, is widely shared among the people currently telling pollsters that they would vote for Sanders over Hillary. They expect her to win, they basically like her, but having him press her from the left makes them feel good about their party and feel safer about Hillary herself. Hence the \u201ceverybody\u2019s a winner\u201d response that you see in Democratic reactions to the debate so far: Both insider reactions and preliminary polling suggest that Hillary won, but everybody thought Bernie did well too, his Facebook and Google numbers surged, his dismissal of the emails was a particular hit with focus groups, etc. Good feelings all around!", "But in actual elections there can only be one winner.

Maybe Sanders will feel good about playing the role that many his own supporters, again, appear to have cast him in: Hillary\u2019s Jiminy Cricket, a friendly Jewish uncle of a conscience keeping her on the straight and narrow and left-wing. Plus, there\u2019s also a plausible case that Sanders should prefer Hillary to Joe Biden on ideological grounds \u2026 and since Biden\u2019s hypothetical candidacy would have been the immediate beneficiary if Bernie had actually drawn blood in this debate, you could argue that the Vermonter is serving his underlying causes better by not pressing an anti-Hillary case too hard.", "But the dynamic here shows why some of the scenarios people have been spinning these last few months, in which a Sanders victory in Iowa or New Hampshire sets in motion a cascade effect that costs Hillary the nomination, have always been so unlikely. The analogies to 1968, in particular, with Sanders playing Eugene McCarthy to Hillary\u2019s L.B.J., ignore the fact that Johnson was at that point genuinely hated by a substantial portion of the Democratic base. But Hillary isn\u2019t hated by Democrats; they still like her, even if the rest of the country doesn\u2019t at the moment, and they like Sanders in part because liking him seems like a way to make her more likeable (that is, more liberal) as well. And that, in turn, puts a pretty hard-seeming ceiling on his insurgency, because the party doesn\u2019t want to turn against the frontrunner in a truly fundamental way, and so the arguments that a normal insurgent would need to deploy against her \u2014 again, character arguments above all \u2014 are likely, if deployed, to hurt him as much or more than her.", "I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: Barring an indictment, she\u2019s got this."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/sports/football/jaguars-bills-streaming-experiment-a-success-for-what-it-is.html": ["Think of the expectations raised by this partnership: the N.F.L. behemoth and Yahoo, with its strong sports presence and more than one billion users worldwide, uniting to stream a single game to 185 countries.

After all, the humanist intellectuals of that era were obsessed with the Latin style of writers like Cicero and Virgil, who had lived a millennium and a half before; why wouldn\u2019t the readers of the year 3000 still be reading and writing the same classical language? Latin was timeless, in a way that vernacular tongues like Italian and French couldn\u2019t hope to be. Following this logic, Poliziano composed his \u201cManto\u201d in Latin, and Petrarch did the same with his epic \u201cAfrica.\u201d Today, of course, those works are known only to a few specialists in Neo-Latin literature. It is Petrarch\u2019s Italian lyrics, his sonnets to his beloved Laura \u2014 along with vernacular works by Dante and Rabelais, Cervantes and Montaigne \u2014 that went on to influence the course of European literature.", "The fate of the Neo-Latin writers, who were defeated by time because they aimed too directly for timelessness, teaches a lesson that modern writers have had to learn again and again. When Wordsworth, at the beginning of the 19th century, mocked the artificial diction of English poetry and dared to write about real figures from contemporary life \u2014 demobilized soldiers, tramps, \u201cidiot\u201d children \u2014 he was subjected to vicious abuse by critics. Surely, they argued, poetry was a timeless realm, in which diction and subject matter were supposed to be elevated and generalized; how could the mere anecdotes of Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cLyrical Ballads\u201d be real poetry? Again, a hundred or so years later, shocked readers objected to T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d for including props of contemporary life, like motorcar horns and music-hall lyrics. Yet today it is precisely these poets who are the classics, while their more conventionally poetic rivals are forgotten.", "There is something perpetually counterintuitive about the idea that the local is the royal road to the universal. If the goal of art is to speak to different kinds of people, across barriers of time and space, then it would seem logical for the artist to treat the lowest common denominators of human experience \u2014 the things that are the same for everyone, everywhere. For a very long time, that meant the standard of art should be nature. Homer, Virgil and Milton could all use similes comparing a crowd of men (or, in Milton\u2019s case, fallen angels) to an agitated swarm of bees, because the way bees act never changes. But in the modern world, we are alienated from nature in ways that earlier generations could never have imagined: How many city-dwellers have ever seen a beehive with their own eyes? (A good measure of the distance we have traveled is that if you Google \u201cHomer\u201d and \u201cbees,\u201d the first results are not quotations from the \u201cIliad,\u201d but images of Homer Simpson being chased by bees.)", "The mutability of our outer lives \u2014 the way manners, morals and technology now change radically from decade to decade \u2014 means that writers today must trust even more in the unity of our inner lives. The way we dress, act and even think may alter, but they do not alter so much as to render generations unrecognizable to one another. In general, our moment is perhaps too impressed by distinctions and divisions \u2014 between past and present, but also between classes, races and genders. Of course, the individual cannot be canceled in the quest for the universal \u2014 that way lies a sterile Neo-Classicism or an empty humanism. But the continuing premise of literature is that our differences, though essential, are not exclusive: Each human being contains the potential for all forms of human experience, just as every musical pitch contains all its own overtones. This is not an ideal but an empirical fact, which is confirmed every time a 21st-century reader feels understood by Shakespeare.", "Adam Kirsch is a columnist for Tablet.

You will waft and drift and never get a toehold. If, on the other hand, you bet it all on the particular, really dive unreservedly into specificity, with no thought for higher things, you will find \u2014 inevitably, magnificently \u2014 that your novel about three plumbers in Milwaukee in 1987 becomes a singing blueprint of human significance.

The two great foundational plots, at any rate, are as follows: A dog falls in love with a cat, a neighbor borrows something and doesn\u2019t return it. Wait \u2014 can that be right?

Those making less than $12,500-a-year backed him 63-37, while those making more than $100,000 voted against him 67-33.", "In 2012, by contrast, Obama won low-income voters, those making less than $30,000, decisively, 63-35, but also did far better than Dukakis among those making more than $100,000, winning 44 percent of their votes. Four years earlier, in 2008, Obama won among voters with the highest incomes, above $200,000, 52-46, and nearly tied among those making $100,000 to $200,000, 48-50.", "Because high-income voters turn out in higher percentages than low income voters, even in presidential years when turnout rises generally, exit poll data underestimates the importance of high end support for Democratic presidential candidates. Because of this higher turnout, the top two income quintiles of the electorate contributed the same number of votes to Obama\u2019s victory in 2012 as the bottom two income quintiles, according to American National Election Studies data provided to me by Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory.", "In other words, upscale voters were just as important to the Obama coalition as downscale voters. One consequence of the increased importance of the affluent to Democrats, according to Bonica and the three co-authors on the inequality paper, is that the Democratic Party has in many respects become the party of deregulated markets.", "\u201cThe Democratic Party pushed through the financial regulation of the 1930s, while the Democratic party of the 1990s undid much of this regulation in its embrace of unregulated financial capitalism,\u201d the four authors write.", "They cite the crucial role of congressional Democrats in enacting the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which eliminated past restrictions on interstate banking; the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed the 1933 Glass\u2013Steagall Act separating commercial banking from other financial services; and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which restricted government oversight of most over-the-counter derivative contracts, including credit default swaps \u2014 all of which played a role in the financial crisis of 2007-2009.", "The critique of the increased Democratic dependency on the rich by Bonica and his co-authors is modest in comparison to that of Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page, political scientists at Princeton and Northwestern.

For now his messages appear to have caught on primarily among ideologically liberal voters, although there is an argument that it will resonate with others as they learn more about it.", "Most important, in recent years, the Democratic Party has become the political home for those whose most passionate cause is cultural, as opposed to economic, liberalism: decriminalization of drug possession; women\u2019s rights; the rights of criminal defendants; and rights associated with the sexual revolution, including transgender rights, the right to contraception, abortion and same-sex marriage.", "Democrats in recent years have done well in presidential years with an agenda focused on \u201cvalues conflicts\u201d and cultural liberalism. But the party, if its aim is to mobilize those on the bottom rungs of the ladder, whites as well as blacks and Hispanics, will face some bitter conflicts, because these target voters are often the most hostile to the left-leaning social rights agenda.", "An April 2013 General Social Survey report on \u201cTrends in Public Attitudes about Sexual Morality\u201d found, for example, that", "College graduates were 22.9 percentage points more liberal on homosexuality than those without high school degrees, and 24.8 percentage points more liberal in their views on gay marriage.", "The same class differences have been found in views on abortion, school prayer and the survey question: should women should be the equal of men.", "The Republican Party helps maintain minority loyalty to Democrats with policies opposed by blacks and Hispanics and with incendiary, biased rhetoric.", "For many black and Hispanic voters who hold conservative views on social issues, the Democratic Party\u2019s commitment on civil rights, immigration reform and the safety net trumps any hesitation about voting for Democratic candidates who hold alien cultural and moral views.", "The same is not true for noncollege whites. Many of these voters hold liberal economic views, as evidenced by the passage by large margins of minimum wage referendums in four solidly red states last year. In the case of these white voters, however, animosity to Democratic cultural and moral liberalism trumps Democratic economic liberalism, as demonstrated by the near unanimous Republican-majority midterm and presidential voting in the poorest white counties of Appalachia.", "The practical reality is that the Democratic Party is now structurally disengaged from class-based populism, especially a form of economically redistributive populism that low-to-moderate-income whites would find inviting.", "It may be that voter discontent will topple one of the parties and something new will emerge \u2014 an improbable development. As it stands, schisms that pit advocates of the lunch pail tradition against those better-off voters who are vested in social and cultural issues will continue to constrict Democratic success, particularly at the state and local level, where Republicans have now achieved substantial retrenchment of the liberal state."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/amazon-building-a-tech-business-for-the-long-haul/": ["LAS VEGAS \u2014 Amazon Web Services doesn\u2019t just want to dominate the global business in selling computing online.

So if I couldn\u2019t remember where the 1964 Summer Olympics were held or that the entry was the TOKYO GAMES and I had to look it up (not to mention figure out how the rebuses should be distributed throughout the entry), so be it.

I tend to like the rebus puzzles that have a reason for the rebus squares to exist, and creating dense shapes in the grid with rebus squares was something I hadn\u2019t seen before. A spiral seemed like a visually interesting choice that contrasted with typical crossword symmetry, and it would require a rebus density that was much higher than usual.", "The original submission didn\u2019t shade the rebus squares, only the black squares that were part of the spiral\u2019s path, with a note telling the solver to look for a shape indicated by the theme entries. I slightly doubted that the puzzle was solvable that way because the gimmick is so unexpected, but I just figured Will would make it easier if he thought the same. I think moving the puzzle from its original Saturday spot to a Thursday and shading the spiral makes it tractable. Hopefully there\u2019s still a challenge in figuring out the theme and that the disruption in pattern-matching makes for a unique solving experience.

Nobody is born stylish. Everybody wants to be a little memorable, and some would like to be somebody else, or more like the self we see in the better part of our minds. It\u2019s about one hundred years since fashion took its place alongside literature, painting and music as a way to look for the social essence of one\u2019s era. Proust saw it happening, and, in \u2018\u2018In Search of Lost Time,\u2019\u2019 Madame de Guermantes\u2019s dresses are \u2018\u2018not a casual decoration alterable at will, but a given, poetical reality like that of the weather, or the light peculiar to a certain hour of the day.\u2019\u2019 I tried to recall the passage as I waited for Karl Lagerfeld in his Paris apartment off the Boulevard St. Germain. It was just after 1 p.m., though there is something timeless about the room where he likes to take his lunch. It has blinds and something of an Art Deco ambiance in shades of gray, angular, with spotless glass and candle-scented air, a Jeff Koons sculpture erupting on the table, next to a beautiful drawing for the poster of the 1924 film \u2018\u2018L\u2019Inhumaine.\u2019\u2019", "The room is all about the books, lying horizontally on towering shelves that go to the ceiling.

He loves work and does eight collections a year for Chanel, as well as his work for Fendi and other companies. In conversational terms, he takes to the track like a prize racehorse, not only groomed, but leaping the fences and taking the corners with brio. Unlike most people in fashion, he actually likes questions, gaining on you one moment, falling back the next, but never resting on his laurels. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever met anyone more fully native to their own conception of wonder. That\u2019s to say: He lives out his own legend in every way he can think of, with every instinct he has, and in a world of stolid conventions, he has the courage to perpetuate a vision of something wonderful. He also has the intelligence not to take himself terribly seriously, laughing easily, sending up his own iconic status, and \u2014 God save us \u2014 actually thinking about the world he makes money from, instead of just feasting on its vanities. Lagerfeld is a man on top of his own greatest invention: himself. And believe it or not he has the talent and the good taste, after all these years, to continue finding the world mysterious, and to give himself wholeheartedly to its discovery.

It is fabulous, both inward and outward at the same time, the actions of a man searching his thoughts and pouring out his learning. It\u2019s not everyone who sees thoughts as action, but he does. Let me show you how he trips from one thing to the next. When I asked him about the 19th century, he only said, \u2018\u2018We are spoiled. We have dry cleaners. They did not.\u2019\u2019 Then he talked about the Scottish philosopher David Hume. (\u2018\u2018I just found a book by him in a box of books that came to me from my parents.\u2019\u2019) Then quickly we moved to the case of the German novelist G\u00fcnter Grass. At this point I saw how entertainingly Lagerfeld will give vent to his opinions. I told him I once did a public talk with Grass at the New York Public Library. Grass had just published a memoir that revealed his time spent as a young member of the Waffen-SS. \u2018\u2018He left it too late,\u2019\u2019 Lagerfeld said without hesitation. \u2018\u2018You can\u2019t give moral lessons all your life and have that in your past. He was the most boring, lesson-giving writer, and everything was lost in fake political thoughts. Willy Brandt was clever enough not to give him a post. And \u2014 even worse \u2014 the sketching!\u2019\u2019 At this Lagerfeld let out a giant roar of disapproval. \u2018\u2018Horrible! Like a mediocre German art student of the 1950s!\u2019\u2019 He went into a piece of gossip and quoted his friend, the late style journalist Ingrid Sischy (\u2018\u2018a genius\u2019\u2019) and then told me that before he knew that fashion could be a job he wanted to be a cartoonist.", "He hates it when people talk to him about their illnesses.

I remember when I was at school I saw the \u2018The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\u2019 I could not sleep for three weeks because I thought the strange marionette played by Conrad Veidt would come onto my balcony and then kill me the same way.

He never went to school for fashion, though early on he designed for the couture house Jean Patou. But it was not in couture that he made his name, rather as an irreplaceable styliste, a king of ready-to-wear long before it was the mainstay of the big fashion houses. He cultivated his mind and made his own prestige, becoming a personality in Paris fashion when he worked for Chlo\u00e9. He was a lightning rod of 1970s sensibility, imbuing his designs with an essential sparkle and a Pop Art accessibility. The ultimate cultural magpie, Lagerfeld grew in fame, and has remained in orbit, as a freelance personality with a strong conception of himself that exists beyond the labels he represents. After 60 years of achievement, he appears more like a grand film director than a designer. He never sought to own the studio. He just wanted to imbue his work with unmistakable good form. And that is what he does.

And in my childhood I heard about Hedwig Dohm, a German-Jewish feminist who was a writer in Berlin.

He said goodbye to it a long time ago, but something remains. His father, Otto, was managing director of an American-owned German milk-products company, Gl\u00fccksklee, from which the family became considerably affluent. The north German, Hanseatic world of Bad Bramstedt, where Karl grew up, appears to lie a million miles away from who and what he is now, but, for all its remoteness, the Germany of his past is not invisible, and I sense that the values of that world still detain him. One might argue that his working life is a fabulous refusal of the past, but even a refusal is an acknowledgment, and one can have a deep connection to things that disgust one. In any event, his creativity is now a principality of its own, and he leases it to Chanel.", "A butler in a white jacket served us lunch.

This is different. History is not interesting \u2014 what is interesting is the anecdote.\u2019\u2019", "Lagerfeld was 49 when he became head designer at Chanel. It seemed perfect, and many of the designers who came after \u2014 Tom Ford, Riccardo Tisci \u2014 had much to learn from him about how to revivify an old brand.

The stiff white collar, the fingerless gloves, the dark jacket and pants, the rings, the dark glasses and the ponytail. When I was with him, his face was an even mask of light foundation and his hair was powdered. He has fleshy lips, Oscar Wilde lips, and a sparkle in the eye that one only sees with his permission, when he dips his glasses to let you see that a joke has made its way through to the smart interior. Lagerfeld is a little cosmology of luxury. He doesn\u2019t much care for the things around him, except the books, but he cares for himself. He wants to present the best of all possible worlds and impose his own philosophy of improvement. \u2018\u2018The American poet Wallace Stevens once wrote that \u2018money is a kind of poetry.\u2019 Do you agree?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Yes and no,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018What do you think?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u2019\u2019 He stared for a moment into a large sculpture beside us, an unknown piece that had been hidden behind a wall in the Marais for 200 years.", "\u2018\u2018Let me tell you something,\u2019\u2019 he began. \u2018\u2018The great art collections were made from very little money. Nowadays, rich people wait for things to become expensive before they buy them. And why? Because they may not be flattered to have something in their house that they bought for little money, even if it is great. But you know, I had Warhols and Basquiats and I gave them away because I thought they would not last.\u2019\u2019", "Modesty \u2014 like jealousy \u2014 is a dish best served cold. But there is something warm in Lagerfeld\u2019s insistence that he only wants to do better. I looked up and saw a book about the American artist Whistler and remembered an opinion someone had of him: \u2018\u2018His problem is he behaves as if he had no talent.\u2019\u2019 Lagerfeld is the exact opposite. He has the natural self-doubt of the truly gifted, and the charm to render his doubt as a point of style. So, naturally, I found myself reassuring him, and asking him the kinds of questions he might wish to be asked.", "\u2018\u2018Your profile is recognized everywhere,\u2019\u2019 I said. \u2018\u2018Does that feel strange to you?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018But in everyday life I don\u2019t think about my profile.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018I think about mine all the time.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018But you have a good profile.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Not so much.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018My mother used to say to me, \u2018Your nose is like a potato.

No\u00ebl Coward lived alone. So did Jonathan Swift and Simone de Beauvoir. And Oscar Wilde spent more time in hotel rooms than he did at home in Tite Street. Lagerfeld sees his work as an engine of self-propulsion, and he is never lonely, he says, because he is just too busy, plus there\u2019s his beautiful cat, Choupette. You can be in love with your work. He prefers to avoid the word \u2018\u2018love.\u2019\u2019 But for some people, it is work that delivers the great moments of discovery and escape. We were ranging across the subjects in that beautiful, old-fashioned way of his when a moment\u2019s silence opened up.", "\u2018\u2018Are you happy?\u2019\u2019 I asked.", "\u2018\u2018You are never happy in the moment when you ask yourself that question,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018So I don\u2019t ask myself the question, which means I must be happy. I\u2019ve been lucky. I didn\u2019t finish school. I learned nothing. It is all improvisation. And yet I am not doing badly. Happiness is not something life owes you.\u2019\u2019", "SOME CITIES ARE LIGHT in your mind but dark in reality, and Seoul looks bad in the rain. It was spring but the Han River was blue in the wrong way, like a stressed vein, and the sky was unsmiling the day I arrived. People were driving as if imminent disaster was just part of the ordinary atmosphere in South Korea. You might wonder how such a place happened to fall so hard for luxury, but it makes sense if you believe that beautiful things cheer you up. There are little bits of architecture to remind you that Seoul does have a culture of its own, but mainly, these days, there are labeled, shimmering towers (K-Biz, Simpac) and Kentucky Fried Chicken. A lady held up the perfect pink umbrella as I passed and a man was leaning against the window of Domino\u2019s Pizza, wearing the kind of leather jacket that boys used to spend their whole childhood waiting to buy.", "I went to the third floor of the Shilla hotel and found Lagerfeld sitting behind a desk at the end of a function room, the Diet Coke already poured and sitting beside a pot of sharpened pencils, a Diptyque candle creating a little halo of pomander in Karl\u2019s corner. A model was standing in front of him wearing a long layered black dress covered in white embroidered flowers. \u2018\u2018You\u2019ll notice the waist is higher,\u2019\u2019 he said, and then he shrugged, as if the whole thing was merely a personal enthusiasm. \u2018\u2018Have a sweet,\u2019\u2019 he said, proffering a plate of disgusting morsels that tasted of nothing. Then he was off again: looking, assessing, opining and being brilliant at what he does. Lagerfeld had flown to Seoul for Chanel\u2019s cruise show and he was checking the accessories, basically, but doing so with an almost hilarious degree of flair and exactitude, rather in the manner of Herbert von Karajan conducting the violin section during a rehearsal of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony.", "\u2018\u2018Virginie,\u2019\u2019 he said in French, \u2018\u2018are you persuaded that these Bermuda pants work, the black with the indigo?\u2019\u2019 He suggested they try a white camellia brooch further up. He said no to several possible handbags. He said yes to a belt. He hesitated, asking the model to walk and then he asked that some black gloves be added. \u2018\u2018It is higher than an empire waistline, in the Korean style,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018This is a thing from history.\u2019\u2019 He had an idea that the models\u2019 eyebrows should sometimes be doubled, like two eyebrows, and in others they were hardly drawn in at all. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s just an idea I had,\u2019\u2019 Lagerfeld said. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t ask myself why.\u2019\u2019 He told me that all the buttons and all the embroidery on the dresses were done by artisanal firms owned by Chanel. \u2018\u2018Make some movement with the dress as you walk,\u2019\u2019 he said to a young model. \u2018\u2018We want to see the layers of the dress as you move.\u2019\u2019 He turned and drew our attention to the use of hair pieces. \u2018\u2018I wanted the hair to be like a hat,\u2019\u2019 he said. Again, he addressed the models. \u2018\u2018I want the hands in the pockets, yes? Like that. Yes. Beyond cool.\u2019\u2019", "Lagerfeld was in his element \u2014 styling. He gets as much pleasure nowadays from taking all the photographs for his campaigns and from running a publishing imprint, always styling, always choosing, always thinking the fresher thing, capturing the image. He doesn\u2019t have to make money and he doesn\u2019t have to please anyone, except himself. One suspects this may be the biggest task of all. And that it has never been possible for Lagerfeld to say, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019\u2019 Everything he does is a product of his need to put something in place that didn\u2019t quite exist before, and that is carefulness as fuel, carefulness as existential necessity: He cares, therefore he is. I don\u2019t believe anything about Karl Lagerfeld is accidental, and even his suppressions are part of his game. In any case, it works. Chanel has annual sales to the tune of $5 billion.", "It was all camera shutters clicking on the third floor of the Shilla. Lagerfeld looked up at Michel Gaubert, the sound stylist. \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s hear the music that goes with this,\u2019\u2019 he said. Within seconds it filled the room, \u2018\u2018What I Mean\u2019\u2019 by A.G. Cook, a heavy-bass, synth-dependent track that sounds, someone said, with its little voices on a loop, like two chipmunks orgasming. Karl tapped his hand on the desk and turned. \u2018\u2018You could not say this was a very beautiful city, could you?\u2019\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018\u2018Very gray, but there is an energy. For a long time I wanted to come to Korea, but I need a professional reason. I am not a tourist.\u2019\u2019 He stood up to greet more of the kind of people he spends his public life with: Fran\u00e7oise-Marie Santucci of French Elle, Godfrey Deeny of Le Figaro, Christiane Arp of German Vogue. His smile grew, though, and he emitted a little purr of delight, when his friend the model Brad Kroenig came into the room. Kroenig came with his son Hudson, who is Lagerfeld\u2019s godson. The designer spent a minute in natural affection before turning back to the group at the table. Looking down, he quickly sketched what the venue would look like for the show. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s an art installation,\u2019\u2019 he said, looking briefly up and then down again, \u2018\u2018and afterward, for the party, there will be 6,000 camellias.\u2019\u2019", "That night, inside the Dongdaemun Design Plaza \u2014 a giant silver pebble designed by Zaha Hadid in the market neighborhood of Yeji-dong (\u2018\u2018a neighborhood for learning politeness\u2019\u2019) \u2014 the city\u2019s fashionistas were out in force to toast all things Chanel, or all things Lagerfeld, since for them the two names are synonymous. These people were logocentric, dressed top to toe in Chanel and nothing but Chanel, and the giddiness at the show could only derive from the presence of the icon and superstar who had made it possible. The audience peered from their colored stools (it was indeed an installation, like being at the center of a molecule cluster) and they couldn\u2019t cheer enough and they believed fame was a kind of breathable ether. When Kristen Stewart entered the room a general but quite tangible levitation occurred, and the ladies in their Chanel togs threw off all decorum and jumped on their seats to take pictures. At the end of the show, Lagerfeld took to the runway and seemed like a vivid piece of defiance, still working and already thinking at that very moment of his next collection.", "\u2018\u2018I DON\u2019T WANT to see all those old dresses,\u2019\u2019 Lagerfeld said, back in Paris, when I asked about a retrospective of his work organized by Amanda Harlech in Bonn. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t go. I\u2019m more interested in the ones I\u2019m trying to design now. I am not like all those art directors now, who have 20 people sketching. I do it all myself. There\u2019s an old German dictum \u2014 \u2018no credit on the past.\u2019 And with those words I can manage.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018How important is daydreaming?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018If you don\u2019t daydream your life is a nightmare,\u2019\u2019 he said. Those women in Seoul were like the girls I grew up with. They just wanted a lipstick that could make them feel they might belong in a bigger town. \u2018\u2018Luxury is something very few people have,\u2019\u2019 Karl said. \u2018\u2018And to buy a handbag is to have a dream of getting nearer. That\u2019s our culture and tons of people \u2014 me included \u2014 make a lot of money from it.\u2019\u2019 When I press him to think more about what it is people actually want, he stepped back. He is wary of intellectualizing something that seems so obvious and yet so mysterious to him. He knows so much, but there are perhaps some things that he simply doesn\u2019t care to know, for fear of them evaporating. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m actually very superficial,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018And I work on that. I became, as you say, an icon \u2014 and this removed me from reality. I don\u2019t go on the streets any more.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018There are people, let\u2019s say young people, who have never been to Paris.

I love what she does now. He [McQueen] had an obsession with death and phantasm that I don\u2019t share, but I love what she does. I just photographed a dress of hers that I thought was so beautiful.

The real lesson in VW\u2019s scandal \u2014 in which the automaker installed \u201cdefeat devices\u201d that showed the cars emitting lower emissions in lab tests than they actually did \u2014 is not that our cars are stuffed with too much technology.

Cars today are lousy with code that can\u2019t be inspected, opening the way for scary hackings and cheats and also the unforeseen complications of interactions between robots and humans.", "Some of these problems call for obvious fixes. As many have pointed out since the VW admission, the code in our cars (and other life-threatening machines) shouldn\u2019t be secret, but should allow for better inspection by authorities and independent experts. Another obvious fix is to replace the sort of lab-testing that VW was able to game with the kind of real-world analysis that uncovered its chicanery.", "But to do that, we\u2019ll need more technology, not less. We need more sensors in cars and on roads and a network of computers watching the data to figure out when vehicles are behaving in aberrant ways. In other words, the best way to prevent cheating isn\u2019t to make our cars dumber, but to make the entire transportation grid smarter.", "Look at how the VW cheating was uncovered. The software in the company\u2019s diesel cars seems to have been designed to detect when a driver was pushing it through the specific routines that the Environmental Protection Agency uses in its emissions labs. When it detected these routines, the car\u2019s software figured, \u201cHey, someone\u2019s testing me!\u201d and then put itself into an innocent, low-emissions mode that it didn\u2019t use on the open road.", "The cheating was discovered only when researchers at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit automotive research group, working with scholars at West Virginia University, used smarter technology. To analyze VW\u2019s emissions in real-world conditions, they used sophisticated devices mounted inside the trunks of two VWs and one BMW that collected and analyzed exhaust fumes as the cars drove along routes mainly in California.", "The devices are called \u201cportable emissions measurement systems,\u201d or P.E.M.s, and they are a relatively novel way of measuring how vehicles perform in real-world conditions. The devices found that nitrogen oxide emissions from the VW Jetta were 15 to 35 times the acceptable standards, while those from the VW Passat were five to 20 times over the limit; the emissions from the BMW X5 were generally at or below the standards.", "\u201cThis is a recent development \u2014 you miniaturize the equipment you\u2019d have inside a lab so that it fits inside a trunk,\u201d said John German, a senior fellow at the I.C.C.T. These devices are bulky and expensive: Each P.E.M. unit fills most of a car\u2019s trunk, and operating the system and analyzing the data requires trained professionals. The council paid West Virginia University about $70,000 to study just three cars, Mr. German said.", "He said it would take \u201ca very long time\u201d before such systems would become small and cheap enough to be used routinely in all cars. Still, as in all things powered by software, it\u2019s likely these devices will become more accessible over the next few years, permitting more such tests, if not everyday use.", "There are other emerging technologies to monitor emissions.

In 2014, emissions were 40 percent higher than expected emissions based on guidelines \u2014 and the gap has consistently grown since 2001. The research group blamed automakers\u2019 ability to specially prepare their cars for tests, making them unrepresentative of real-world conditions, for part of the gap.", "In the future, the kind of data the council collected from its many sources could become a standard part of driving.

Utekar left Mumbai, India, to start an M.B.A. program at the University of Michigan campus in Flint, his landlord gave him a driving tour of his new home. Dennis Brownfield watched out for his tenants, and he wanted Mr. Utekar to understand the dynamics of a city often defined by deindustrialization and decay. His car provided the first lesson. It was a Honda Civic with a license plate that read \u201cGM LEFT,\u201d a commentary on the 70,000 automotive jobs that have disappeared over the years in this birthplace of General Motors.", "They rolled to a stop in the empty parking lot between the main library and Central High School, an imposing brick building shuttered because of falling enrollment and budget cuts. \u201cNow make sure you\u2019ve got your seatbelt on because I\u2019m going to show you an American custom,\u201d Mr. Brownfield said. He shifted into reverse, cranked the steering wheel hard to the right, gunned the engine and popped the clutch. The result was a dizzying, deftly executed series of backward 360s. For a final flourish, Mr. Brownfield yanked the emergency brake to abruptly change directions.", "\u201cThat\u2019s called a doughnut,\u201d he said when they had skidded to a stop. \u201cIt\u2019s how we have fun in Michigan.\u201d", "Rattled but impressed, Mr. Utekar realized: This was going to be a lot different than India.", "Culture shock is not unusual among international students pursuing degrees in the United States, but some places are more shocking than others. Flint, 60 miles northwest of Detroit, is perennially ranked one of the most dangerous cities in the country. It has lost half its residents since the 1960s, according to the Census Bureau, and the population recently dipped below 100,000 for the first time in nearly a century. Thousands of homes are abandoned \u2014 often stripped bare by thieves in search of scrap metal \u2014 and arson is commonplace, infusing some neighborhoods with an eerie sense of desolation. In October, the county health department declared a public health emergency after elevated lead levels were discovered in the city\u2019s water supply.", "It is not, to state the obvious, a fun-loving college town like Ann Arbor. And yet, they come. This year, more than 700 international students, the largest number ever, are studying at U.M.-Flint, a commuter school of some 8,500 undergraduate and graduate students. Nearly 200 more attend Kettering, a smaller, more selective private university with a focus on automotive engineering. The numbers may seem comparatively modest, but this is a place people leave. These students \u2014 from Saudi Arabia, India, China, South Korea, Nigeria and more than 40 other countries \u2014 had hundreds of choices, and they chose Flint.", "The question, of course, is why.", "Some reasons are practical. Both universities offer degrees in fields popular with international students \u2014 engineering, business, computer science and health care. Tuition at U.M.-Flint is inexpensive compared to private universities, and the cost of living is low; a two-bedroom apartment near downtown rents for about $500 a month, utilities included. The universities actively recruit overseas and have forgiving admissions policies for foreign applicants (no SAT or ACT required). With international enrollment climbing nationwide for nearly a decade, to almost 886,000, it is perhaps inevitable that students find their way to cities like Flint.", "Conversations with some three dozen international students at U.M.-Flint and Kettering reveal another explanation. A coveted degree from the United States was their primary goal; where they attained it was far less important. Many found their way to Vehicle City by accident. Some had hopes of immigrating.", "Once here, they grumble about being homesick and about a strange meteorological term called wind chill factor. Joshua O. Anifowoshe, a Nigerian, would sometimes join in dorm-room griping with other international students who were disappointed in U.M.-Flint. Mr. Anifowoshe had wanted a smaller school, but after attending a boisterous football game in Ann Arbor with more than 100,000 fans, he started to waver, and transferred. \u201cIt was kind of lonely and boring in Flint,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized I needed a more rigorous academic environment and a more lively campus.\u201d", "But the majority of international students stick it out \u2014 57 percent earn degrees in four years and 86 percent in five years, according to U.M.-Flint (impressive, considering that only 11 percent and 28 percent of all full-time freshmen there accomplish the same). In the process, the students said, they developed a deeper, more cleareyed understanding of the real America, and experienced an unanticipated sense of community.", "Mr. Utekar\u2019s story illustrates the leap of faith many international students take. He was working in sales for a Mumbai pharmaceutical company when he decided to try to immigrate to the United States. His sister had married an American and become a citizen while working for Wells Fargo on an H-1B visa after attending graduate school at Ithaca College. Mr. Utekar began researching M.B.A. programs.", "He considered the University of Michigan\u2019s highly ranked Ross School of Business in Ann Arbor but couldn\u2019t afford it. Back then, in 2010, Flint would cost him just $10,000 a year \u2014 $40,000 less than Ross. He checked a map and the two campuses were just an hour\u2019s drive apart. How different could they be?", "\u201cI did not look up anything about Flint, which was good because I wasn\u2019t judgmental and paranoid when I got here,\u201d he said. Besides, he had missed the application deadlines for his other choices.", "Residents seemed surprised and grateful when they learned someone had traveled such a great distance to study in Flint, Mr. Utekar said. He rented a room in a group house for $200 from Mr. Brownfield, and stood in line once a week for free groceries at a nearby church. He discovered McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s. A friend in India sent him incense sticks and ink drawings of Krishna on dried palm leaves that he sold at art fairs. A music student lent him a pair of Indian tabla drums, and he was soon playing with various bands in the area. He began dating an American woman.", "After completing his M.B.A. in 2013, Mr. Utekar had a job with a local software firm for a year on his F1 student visa. Students and recent graduates can work or intern for 12 to 29 months under the Optional Practical Training program in jobs related to their area of study. Roughly half of U.M.-Flint graduates take advantage of OPT, but how many succeed in permanently immigrating \u2014 there is still a 7 percent cap-per-country on green cards \u2014 is not known.", "Mr. Utekar\u2019s visa was still valid when his job ended, so he enrolled in the master\u2019s program in computer science, which he expects to complete next fall. Now 33, he does not want to leave the United States. He and his girlfriend recently bought a 1,344-square-foot house for $9,800 and have begun restoring it. \u201cMaybe I was just lucky, but I\u2019ve met amazing people in Flint,\u201d he said. \u201cI like it here.\u201d", "That\u2019s what Flint officials like to hear. In the past decade, they have worked to make the city more appealing to students. A one-mile stretch that connects the University of Michigan campus and Kettering has been landscaped and rechristened University Avenue. The former Hyatt Regency Hotel downtown was converted into student housing. Last year, the popular farmers\u2019 market relocated to the edge of the U.M. campus, a fortresslike collection of interconnected brick buildings constructed in the \u201970s. A newer classroom building occupies the former site of the AutoWorld theme park, a short-lived attempt to lure tourists that was leveled in 1997. Abandoned buildings are still easy to spot. But a handful of new bars and restaurants have given students more to do, and Susan E. Borrego, chancellor of U.M.-Flint, has been talking to local leaders about sponsoring a cricket tournament.", "For merchants, the students provide an economic boost in a city saddled with double-digit unemployment. The international student in Flint spends on average almost $30,000 a year to cover tuition, fees and living expenses, according to the Association of International Educators. And that translates to more than $25 million annually for the local economy.", "So it\u2019s no wonder that six U.M.-Flint staff members regularly travel the world to recruit students. Dan Adams, director of its international center, frequently finds himself in Dubai or Singapore fielding questions from a parent or two whose Google search turned up distressing news about Flint. \u201cI only have about 60 seconds of their attention to try and sell the school,\u201d he said, \u201cso I emphasize all the support services we offer, the small class sizes, and point out that downtown Flint is a safe area.\u201d", "Kip Darcy, vice president for marketing, communications and enrollment at Kettering, takes a focused approach to recruiting engineering students. \u201cWe concentrate on India and China because they are a huge market for students hoping to study in the U.S., and they also have nascent automotive industries.\u201d", "Kettering began working last fall in China with an independent broker, who assists students with the application process. U.M.-Flint contracts with approximately 20 brokers in various countries. In addition to collecting fees from students, the agents are paid $1,000 for each student they deliver who enrolls for at least two semesters. It\u2019s a practice the National Association for College Admissions Counseling permits in the recruitment of international students. But it does not endorse it, according to Eddie West, director of the association\u2019s international initiatives, and member schools cannot pay commissions for placement of domestic students.", "Brokers can have a huge influence, steering students toward specific schools, whether a good fit or not. Neelam Gire, a soft-spoken 24-year-old, desperately needed direction. She had hoped to attend medical school in India but froze when it came time to take the demanding entrance exam, which is given after high school.", "\u201cI was sitting in the car with my mom watching people go into the building to take the test,\u201d she remembered. \u201cI told her I just couldn\u2019t do it and we left. It was a big relief to drive away.\u201d", "Her mother encouraged her to study in the United States and, for $500, hired a broker to suggest schools, help her with applications and prep her for her visa interview. U.M.-Flint was the first to accept her. She had never heard of Michigan, let alone Flint, but she thought the other options \u2014 the State University of New York and Fairleigh Dickinson University \u2014 were too close to her former boyfriend, who attended a community college in New Jersey. What if she bumped into him?", "She checked into her dorm on a Sunday. She was struck by the emptiness of the campus, and downtown. \u201cI was shocked that there were no tall buildings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looked like a village. I had a brochure that showed people sitting on the grass and chatting, and I was wondering, \u2018Where are they?\u2019\u201d", "When a fellow student from India gave Ms. Gire a tour of Flint to help her acclimate, he presented an array of personal safety tips. Don\u2019t walk alone after dark. Stay alert so no one can sneak up on you. Never wear high heels because assailants can hear the click of your shoes on the pavement, and it\u2019s hard to run away.", "While Ms. Gire dealt with acute anxiety, her mother, a single parent, struggled to pay her college expenses. In tearful Skype conversations, her two younger sisters complained that the family was suffering financially because of her. \u201cThey thought I was in some beautiful place and enjoying life, but it was hard for me to even go outside because I thought it was unsafe,\u201d she said.", "Ms. Gire reluctantly moved off-campus into a studio apartment to save money, further isolating herself. She spent entire days playing video games and eating. She gained 10 pounds and dropped out for a semester, holed up in her apartment. Returning home would be shameful.", "Slowly, she got used to living away from her family. The university hired Ms. Gire as an \u201cinternational ambassador,\u201d bolstering her confidence and enabling her to make new friends. The eight ambassadors correspond with prospective applicants from other countries, welcome newcomers and plan events.", "Because it\u2019s the international students who live on or near campus, they have an outsize impact on life at U.M.-Flint. In fact, the 2014-15 student government president was from Mauritius, an island off the southeast coast of Africa.", "Ms. Gire got involved with the Indian Student Association and helped organize a celebration last fall to mark Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights. At a school where almost half the students are part-time and 50 is considered a big turnout, more than 400, including a group of exchange students from Mexico and dozens of American students, squeezed into four rooms in the student center. There was food, a D.J. and dancing, both traditional and not so traditional. Fines were levied for overcrowding.", "\u201cNo one wanted to leave,\u201d Ms. Gire said. \u201cThey just wanted to keep dancing.\u201d", "Ms. Gire now lives with her Canadian boyfriend in East Village, a 16-block neighborhood near downtown that is popular with international students. They want to stay in the United States. After graduating in June with a psychology degree, Ms. Gire got a job, under the OPT program, in the university\u2019s international admissions office. She intends on enrolling in a master\u2019s program in public administration in about a year, with the career goal of working in higher education with international students.", "\u201cI used to hate it here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now it feels like home.\u201d", "\u2022", "A mile south of U.M.-Flint, Kettering is a block from the former site of Chevy in the Hole, the hulking factory complex where the Flint Sit-Down Strike in 1936-37 catapulted the United Auto Workers union into national prominence. Formerly known as General Motors Institute, Kettering continues to have strong ties with the auto industry. Its undergraduates \u2014 nearly 1,800 of them \u2014 participate in a co-op program that alternates academic studies with paid, full-time employment with corporations, frequently one of the Big Three automakers or their suppliers.", "One Friday night last semester, the International Club at Kettering met at Extreme Indoor Kart Racing in a lonely shopping center, where a handful of customers were playing arcade games or racing under fluorescent lights on a quarter-mile track outlined with old tires. There was a good turnout: 40 students representing Pakistan, India, China, Iran and Brazil along with a few Americans.", "Locksly Wallace, an effervescent Jamaican with a quick smile, doled out tickets and a few students put on their crash helmets, prompting a furious round of selfies. About a dozen men in the automotive systems program gathered at a viewing window, eagerly awaiting their turn and critiquing another group navigating the track. An animated discussion on cornering technique ensued.", "\u201cWe are really car freaks,\u201d one explained.", "The students stayed for three hours and enthusiastically ate pizza in the otherwise empty parking lot before car-pooling back to campus.", "Mr. Wallace reported that the night took $600 from the International Club budget and injected it directly into the local economy. Money well spent, in his opinion.", "Typical of Kettering students, Mr. Wallace took an intentional route to Flint. He had tested into a high school for students with academic potential and was selected to participate in an intensive five-week pre-college program at Kettering aimed at low-income students of color. Once again, he stood out, earning a scholarship to study chemical engineering.", "Mr. Wallace, whose mother worked as a maid and seamstress to support the family, grew up with seven siblings in Central Village, a rough area between Kingston and Spanish Town characterized by poverty and violence. He admitted that his expectations of life in the United States were formed largely by Hollywood, and like many international students he thought that all of America was prosperous. When he arrived, he discovered a city that had similarities with Central Village. \u201cIt turned out that Flint is pretty much what I\u2019m used to, so I can relate to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only shock was realizing that, \u2018Oh, this happens in America, too.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Students describe the Kettering campus, comprising just seven buildings near downtown, as an island isolated from the city\u2019s more crime-ridden neighborhoods. There\u2019s a police substation across the street from the university, and Kettering\u2019s website describes a \u201cstate-of-the art security and high definition closed-circuit television surveillance system\u201d installed in 2013.", "But Mr. Wallace didn\u2019t retreat from the rest of the city. He joined a mentoring program that connects Kettering students with academically promising high school students. He met regularly with three boys, prepping them for college, taking them to art museums, and offering them advice on girlfriends and other mysteries of adolescence.", "\u201cI had friends back home who dropped out of high school and ended up on the corner smoking weed,\u201d Mr. Wallace said. \u201cSome of them were dead before they were 18. So I could empathize and offer good solutions for what they were going through.\u201d", "The young men he befriended had a sense of hopelessness. \u201cThe common theme that I heard was: \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get out of here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wallace said. \u201cFlint really has nothing to offer kids with potential. They\u2019re going to leave.\u201d", "Mr. Wallace earned his master\u2019s in engineering management in June and works as a project manager at an automotive supplier. He hopes to land a job in the renewable energy field in California and, eventually, return to Jamaica.", "He is rooting for better times in Flint but he has no intention of staying. \u201cThe engineer in me loves problem solving,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve done my time.\u201d"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/hackers-prove-they-can-pwn-the-lives-of-those-not-hyperconnected/": ["It took the hackers less than two hours to take over Patsy Walsh\u2019s life.", "On a recent Friday, Mrs. Walsh, a grandmother of six, volunteered to allow two hackers to take a crack at hacking her home. How bad could it be?", "Mrs. Walsh did not consider herself a digital person. As far as she knew, her home was not equipped with any \u201csmart devices,\u201d physical objects like refrigerators and thermometers that transmit information to the Internet. Sure, she has a Facebook account, which she uses to keep up on friends\u2019 lives, but rarely does she post about her own.", "\u201cI don\u2019t post things about myself and don\u2019t really understand why other people do,\u201d Mrs. Walsh said. \u201cThe fact you can go from one friend\u2019s profile to their friends\u2019 profiles is creepy. I guess you could find out a lot of information about somebody if you really wanted to.\u201d", "Indeed. Days before hackers even set foot in Mrs. Walsh\u2019s home overlooking Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, Calif., they found her Facebook account and \u2014 though it was comparatively locked down \u2014 uncovered just enough to begin to take over her digital life. The New York Times was invited to witness the hacking, on the condition that Mrs. Walsh\u2019s town not be named.", "The twist was that once the hackers found their way in, they discovered someone else had already been there.", "The hackers could see that Mrs. Walsh had liked a page organized by Change\u00ad.org. That was all they needed to construct some convincing click bait. Within 10 minutes, they composed a fake email from Change\u00ad.org asking her to sign a fake petition about land use in Marin County.", "When that link led her to a page that asked her to enter her email address and password, she complied. To spare Mrs. Walsh any actual harm, the hackers used a service called Phish5, which does not actually store passwords and is often used by employers to test employees\u2019 ability to spot malicious phishing cons.", "Had the two been actual attackers, they would have had all the information they needed to \u201cpwn\u201d Mrs. Walsh \u2014 hacker speak for taking over someone\u2019s digital life \u2014 from afar, particularly because, Mrs. Walsh confessed, she was guilty of using the same password across many accounts.", "All this before they had even set foot in Mrs. Walsh\u2019s home.", "The hackers, Reed Loden, the 27-year-old director of security of HackerOne, a San Francisco security start-up, and Michiel Prins, the 25-year-old co-founder of HackerOne, were greeted warmly when they arrived at her home.", "\u201cWelcome Hackers\u201d was scrawled on a heart-shaped chalkboard on the front door, and deviled eggs, tuna sandwiches and fresh iced tea were waiting. Mrs. Walsh said she expected the hackers would wear black, but Mr. Loden and Mr. Prins did not fit that stereotype. Mr. Loden, who hails from Mississippi, ended his sentences with a warm \u201cthank you, ma\u2019am\u201d \u2014 his manners intact even while explaining that he had just hacked Mrs. Walsh\u2019s power of attorney form.", "\u201cThey\u2019re very polite,\u201d Mrs. Walsh noted. (Later, she invited both to Thanksgiving dinner.)", "Over an hour and a half, they discovered a way to open the Walshes\u2019 garage door. It was simply a matter of using a \u201cbrute force attack\u201d against an older door opener. The process entailed testing thousands of code combinations until hitting the correct one. Earlier this year, the hacker Samy Kamkar demonstrated how to do this in less than 10 seconds using a Mattel toy.", "Mr. Loden and Mr. Prins also found a way to intercept Mrs. Walsh\u2019s television. A service worker had not installed her DirecTV securely, with a password, which meant anyone with knowledge of the device\u2019s I.P. address could control the television remotely.", "In this case, the hackers used their access to purchase a three-hour pass to an array of adult channels \u2014 the names of which would not be suitable for print here.", "Still, Mrs. Walsh was not impressed. \u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong about getting into my TV?\u201d When Mr. Loden pointed out that someone could blast pornography in her living room in the middle of a dinner party, Mrs. Walsh conceded, \u201cI can see how that would be a little shocking to guests.\u201d", "From there, the hackers made their way to the back of Mrs. Walsh\u2019s house, where her PC was waiting. With her passwords posted on the nearby router, their task was easy. Within minutes, they had not only broken into Mrs. Walsh\u2019s email account, but also that of her daughter \u2014 who at some point had allowed the computer\u2019s browser to auto-fill her password. (As a courtesy, the hackers made sure to send Mrs. Walsh\u2019s daughter an email from her own account with the subject line: \u201cReminder: Change my password.\u201d)", "They searched Mrs. Walsh\u2019s email for the term \u201cSSN\u201d and within seconds had access to her Social Security number, her PayPal account, her air miles account and her insurance information. They had even gotten their hands on her power of attorney form.", "What\u2019s worse, they weren\u2019t the only ones with access to all of the above.

The other had been a social call. I was in the area, and had said that I\u2019d like to see some trees, lamenting that down where I live, in Southern California, they were dying by the millions on account of the drought. On that trip, I came from due east, and had been reading his latest novel, \u2018\u2018Purity.\u2019\u2019 I thought it would be right to arrive as his guest in Santa Cruz ready to present my reactions to the book, which is filled with great comedy.

But as I traveled west, I regretted that despite having consumed the book quickly, eagerly, in a motel room in Chowchilla (a town that features a large women\u2019s prison, where I was visiting people), I had not managed to read the last eight pages. I was not going to park somewhere and read them in the car before arriving, because that would seem unnatural, to finish a book in a car.

No, I\u2019d thought, I\u2019ll finish it on his porch, which was what I did, and closed the book happy to see the little brown towhees that figure in the s\u00e9ance and texture of the novel\u2019s ending, which I later called light and he called dark.", "The next week, after that visit, came this curious assignment, to write about Jon, who is not a close friend, but a friend, which is what makes it curious. He\u2019s someone I\u2019d first met 18 years ago and had liked right away, a person whose considerable charisma happens up close, as presence. I\u2019ve always felt some kind of warmth toward him, or from him, separate from my admiration for him as a writer. He likes women from California, at least that is what he always says, and he is someone I could telephone in consternation, in need of advice, and have done so. But he would not want to hear from me every day, and this has also strengthened a mutual trust, both of us being people who want brief social engagements and then to return to nurturing a productive alienation or joy and either way conduct life with a limited amount of interaction, at least with other writers.", "But we had submitted to do this thing together, and then could not agree on where to meet. I wanted Jon to see the filmmaker James Benning\u2019s cabins, one a replica of Thoreau\u2019s, the other of Ted Kaczynski\u2019s, and to perhaps discuss solitude, American transcendentalism and eco-activism, and be in a beautiful but lesser known part of California, the central-southern Sierras. Jon rejected that. A friend jeeringly said to me, \u2018\u2018Why don\u2019t you go birding with him?\u2019\u2019 Which was the very thing Jon suggested, that we go to the Channel Islands in pursuit of the rare island scrub jay, which, I thought, as soon as he suggested it, would never work, because the boats that go there are vomitoriums and the island where this jay lives offers scant shade, and I hate the sun. After that exchange, I thought it would be O.K. to just go ahead and admit something to myself, an opposition: that he, Jon, loves birds, and I love people and come down on their side if we are choosing teams. I could even form a kind of repulsion toward the rare island scrub jay, when I imagined being trapped on a boat in the boiling ocean, in search of the squawking creature that, like every other scrub jay, eats canned sardines.", "In the end, I simply returned to him in Santa Cruz, with a quick jaunt, first, to a beautiful little town in the San Lorenzo Valley where Jon and his girlfriend, Kathy, used to live, a place with a main-street bar and hardware store, and just off the main street, a swimming hole. Then Jon and the photographer went off to shoot the portrait among some redwood trees in a state park, after which Jon and I sat down to talk at a picnic table over a ravine, where we remained until a plague of mosquitoes and then one human, a Franzen fan, all alighted on Jon and it was time to escape to a restaurant in Santa Cruz, where the fog, which Jon describes with felicity and precision in \u2018\u2018Purity,\u2019\u2019 had rolled in and made us cold.", "JON WAS THE PERSON who told me to read \u2018\u2018Angels\u2019\u2019 by Denis Johnson, which I still consider a very fine American novel. He once said to me that strawberries are an unnecessary apology for rhubarb, and recommended to me, aptly, the Wim Wenders film \u2018\u2018The American Friend.\u2019\u2019 I met only on one occasion his very famous American friend, the one who killed himself at the age of 46, and that famous friend had said to me that he, meaning Jon, seemed so serious and stern but then it turns out he is the nicest person in the world. Which I had suddenly remembered, and relayed to Jon, back when I had learned that his friend died.", "The first thing I asked Jon about was Oakland, as Pip, a character in \u2018\u2018Purity\u2019\u2019 (her full name), lives there, in a house that\u2019s something like a squat, where one character reads Gramsci and is connected to the Catholic Worker. Jon himself had spent time hanging out at a Catholic Worker house in Philadelphia, in the mid-\u201990s. He found their objectives appealing, he said, and even went to Catholic Church. Although it was, he told me, \u2018\u2018partly a matter of a girl.\u2019\u2019 About Catholicism, Jon said, \u2018\u2018If you really take Flannery O\u2019Connor seriously, as I did at that time, you get interested. That was probably the peak of my involvement with Dostoyevsky, and with both of those writers it\u2019s not art and it\u2019s not religion, it\u2019s religious art, although Dostoyevsky is so multivalent that it\u2019s more complicated.\u2019\u2019", "We moved on to a discussion of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, and Jon spoke of their relation as a competition. \u2018\u2018You had two talents of that order working at the same time,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018and in the same way that siblings specialize, they each became more intensely the thing they\u2019d been to begin with \u2014 as a way of competing, and a way of saying, \u2018I\u2019m not that other sibling, I\u2019m me.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 And I said, \u2018\u2018but in order to occupy what they nonetheless misperceive as the one spot.\u2019\u2019 To be fair, I know little of Tolstoy\u2019s biography, only that he was a pacifist and revolutionary, had a late-life religious conversion and died in a train station. I mentioned these things and Jon said that what happened to Tolstoy \u2014 his conversion, his strange behavior later in life \u2014 could have been merely \u2018\u2018TIAs.\u2019\u2019 I asked what that was or those were, and he said, \u2018\u2018Transient ischemic attacks, you know, mini-strokes. The brain isn\u2019t getting enough oxygen and you get weird.\u2019\u2019 And I said, \u2018\u2018Reduce it all to the brain! What a positivist response!\u2019\u2019 And Jon replied, \u2018\u2018Well, he was very old.\u2019\u2019", "Later we spoke of East Germany, which figures prominently in \u2018\u2018Purity,\u2019\u2019 and, who knows, might even be having some kind of revival \u2014 great athletes, milk banks for women who can\u2019t breast-feed, lifetime employment, clunky retro aesthetics. Jon, I thought, is onto something. He\u2019s going to have sparked a honeymoon for East Germany. An Italian friend, a Marxist who had vacationed in the G.D.R. as a teenager, had just been waxing eloquent to me about the Trabant, that beloved jewel of East German automotive engineering, and about the women of the German Democratic Republic, whom he had found \u2018\u2018simple\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018natural,\u2019\u2019 and this friend had said \u2018\u2018simple\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018natural\u2019\u2019 like you\u2019d describe fresh ingredients. The Republic of Bad Taste is how the G.D.R. is cleverly referred to in a section title of \u2018\u2018Purity.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018There was just such dowdiness,\u2019\u2019 Jon said to me. Spiessig, he said, was the German word for it. If there were a magazine about G.D.R. lovelies, I thought, it could be called Spiessig. But really Jon had already covered that territory in \u2018\u2018Purity\u2019\u2019 and more reflexively: In one of my favorite scenes, the East German character\u2019s good-looking mother reclines on a couch drinking white wine, aware that she looks like an advertisement for life in the G.D.R.", "For the record, Angela Merkel would not be included in my fictional magazine Spiessig. Among other big names from the G.D.R., we discussed Christa Wolf, who was anti-unification \u2014 a position, we agreed, that was not insane to take. Jon said that she later wrote a book about having been an unofficial collaborator. \u2018\u2018Until the advent of the Internet,\u2019\u2019 Jon said, \u2018\u2018the G.D.R. was the most perfectly surveilled society in the history of the world.\u2019\u2019 Which presented a natural transition to Andreas, an East German in \u2018\u2018Purity\u2019\u2019 who becomes an Assange-like leaker, except that while Assange seems to focus mostly on the secrecy of governments, Andreas believes in exposure as some kind of generalized goodness, and what he leaks is kept somewhat vague. At a late point in the narrative, Andreas compares the Internet to the Stasi itself, although it seems he feels its encroachment because he has a damning personal secret to protect. Assange, I said to Jon, had also made this comparison of the Stasi and the Internet, and Jon said, \u2018\u2018Good for him.\u2019\u2019 But for Assange, I said, I believe it\u2019s about Google\u2019s relation to the N.S.A. While for Jon, and Andreas, the nature of the Internet itself is totalitarian in its sheer ubiquity. \u2018\u2018I think the dream of radical transparency is a nightmare,\u2019\u2019 Jon said. \u2018\u2018People saying how wonderful technology is and that crime will disappear because everything will be known about everyone.\u2019\u2019 I pictured ISIS beheadings, which are certainly related to a skillful use of social media, or that\u2019s what everyone says, and I asked, but do people really talk that way? And he said, \u2018\u2018Yes, just go to TED talks,\u2019\u2019 and I said I\u2019d never watched a TED talk. The mere name, I thought, sounds so idiotic. A TED talk.", "Then we were on to the subject of Edward Snowden, and Jon said he could understand both Snowden\u2019s youthful idealism and Obama\u2019s contention that the invasions of privacy are not grievous and are in the interest of fighting terrorism. \u2018\u2018Obama\u2019s position is that it\u2019s just metadata and a rather small amount of metadata,\u2019\u2019 Jon said, \u2018\u2018and that intelligent, patriotic people have talked it over and there are safeguards in place. I can see both sides.\u2019\u2019 I said that my understanding was that the spying by the N.S.A. was both illegal and unconstitutional. Jon said Snowden and Chelsea Manning were heroes in Silicon Valley and that Silicon Valley was suspicious of the government and saw it as the enemy. But this opposition, Silicon Valley versus the government, seemed to obfuscate things for me, as if the example of Judith Miller, to cite only a single emblematic name, did not itself argue emphatically for leakers and data dumps. Could it be possible, I wondered, that the Iraq War might not have happened if a Snowden, an Assange, had arrived on the scene just a few years earlier? But Jon and I didn\u2019t take this path.", "We moved on to other things, namely the commodification of personal data by the tech giants. \u2018\u2018Capitalism,\u2019\u2019 Jon said, \u2018\u2018hadn\u2019t invaded every pore of your existence until the Internet.\u2019\u2019 He said that privacy invasions and data gathering far outstrip what the government is doing in that regard. \u2018\u2018My character Andreas says that people should be more afraid of what Google can do to you than what the government can do to you.\u2019\u2019 But were the tech companies, I wondered, isolated entities or part of something much larger, the character of so-called neoliberalism? Jon, after all, had cited Evgeny Morozov, who has said that \u2018\u2018no plausible story can emerge unless Silicon Valley itself is situated within some broader historical narrative \u2014 of changes in production and consumption, changes in state forms, changes in the surveillance capabilities and needs of the U.S. military.\u2019\u2019 Which to me seems exactly right (I read it after our discussion), and what I tried to say in my own less eloquent way, but Jon was tired and our night was coming to a close. I\u2019ll take it up with him another time, I thought.", "THE NEXT MORNING, as I drank coffee and ate toast in Jon and Kathy\u2019s kitchen, we discussed Faust and Mephisto, who connect to \u2018\u2018Purity\u2019\u2019 by way of its epigraph. Jon had said, the night before, when I asked him why Mephisto wants Faust\u2019s soul, \u2018\u2018Because that is his nature.\u2019\u2019 I had thought immediately of Wagner, and how such a thing works in Wagner, but I wondered how and if it works in fiction, to have a single fixated desire as a nature, or even to have a fixed nature. I mentioned \u2018\u2018East of Eden\u2019\u2019 by Steinbeck, a book Jon loves, which features a character with a fixed and indivisible nature \u2014 a child who is born evil, a bad seed. Jon was quiet, and when he spoke, he told me that his cousin had been recently murdered. \u2018\u2018My Aunt Margo used to call him a bad seed,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He was an alcoholic, and he was murdered by his best friend after they had spent a day and a half drinking together. You can investigate the psychology of it, but basically my aunt was right: He was a bad seed.\u2019\u2019 But then he went on to investigate not the psychology of bad seeds as types, but the psychology of his cousin, who was not a type, but an individual. \u2018\u2018He and his friend were in a bar, and then they finally ran out of money, so they went home and continued drinking there, and apparently the friend got it in his head,\u2019\u2019 Jon said, \u2018\u2018that my cousin was interested in the friend\u2019s daughter, and that led to violence.\u2019\u2019 The details, Jon said, were horrifying. When his cousin was still conscious he was asked whether he wanted to be taken to the hospital, and the cousin said, \u2018\u2018No, he\u2019s my best friend.

Honor, but not sugarcoat. He\u2019d called the cousin bad. But then, almost despite his initial instinct, he had allowed for the cousin\u2019s life to be truly a loss, and depicted to me the cousin\u2019s final moment as a kind of sudden heroism.

Experts say Thanksgiving fares are usually least costly in September or the first half of October. Orbitz, the booking site, announced in September that the best deals on airfares this year for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve were to be had between Oct. 5 and Oct. 12.", "And FareCompare, the flight search engine, found that based on its data for 2014, travelers who bought Thanksgiving tickets in September paid 20 to 50 percent less than those who didn\u2019t book until November. For instance, a round-trip ticket from Los Angeles International Airport to Orlando Executive Airport was $900 in September 2014. Come October, that ticket cost $130 more for a total of $1,030, according to FareCompare. By November it was $270 more than the October fare, resulting in a $1,300 ticket.", "That said, all hope is not lost. Let\u2019s begin with Thanksgiving.", "According to research from Patrick Surry, the chief data scientist at Hopper, a website and app that advises travelers when to book airfare, as long as you book your Thanksgiving flights more than 10 days in advance, you won\u2019t pay too much more than the early birds. Domestic round-trip flights rise less than 5 percent up to 10 days before departure, Hopper said. It\u2019s only within 10 days of Thanksgiving that prices jump (Christmas is a different story; we\u2019ll get to that in a minute).", "So what should you do to get a reasonably priced ticket? As always, flying on certain days and avoiding others will help you save. The consensus among researchers at several online travel agencies and travel search engines is that, as with years past, flying on Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 26) will yield some of the lowest fares.", "If you can\u2019t fly then, FareCompare says the next best option is to leave Monday, Nov. 23, or Tuesday, Nov. 24. The site predicts the most expensive day to depart will be Wednesday, Nov. 25, while Sunday, Nov. 29, will be the most expensive day to return. So extend your holiday, if possible, and return on Monday, Nov. 30, or Tuesday, Dec. 1, instead. Saturday, Nov. 28, is also a better option than Sunday, according to the site.", "This isn\u2019t a science, however, and experts don\u2019t always end up recommending the same travel dates. Travelzoo, for example, says the best travel dates for cheap Thanksgiving flights (in addition to Thanksgiving Day) are Tuesday, Nov. 17; Wednesday, Nov. 18; Thursday, Nov. 19; Monday, Nov. 23; Friday, Nov. 27; Wednesday, Dec. 2; and Thursday, Dec. 3.", "Looking ahead to Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve, some of the most appealing airfare deals have come and gone, according to Orbitz, but the next best options will show up early next month.

The average domestic round-trip airfare for the holidays, as of last week, is $383, down about $10 (3 percent) from last year at this time, according to Hopper. For each day closer to Christmas, the average round-trip holiday airfare is bumped up about $1.60. So in general, the best time to book is about 80 days before departure, based on the site\u2019s research.", "We\u2019re now beyond that ideal of 80 days in advance, but there are still things you can do. Mr. Surry\u2019s research at Hopper suggests that travelers can save up to 30 percent by finding flights that depart on Dec. 21 (the Monday before Christmas) or on Christmas Eve, and return on Christmas Day or on or after Tuesday, Jan. 5. If you plan on going away for New Year\u2019s, traveling on New Year\u2019s Eve or New Year\u2019s Day, you can save more than 25 percent. The most expensive days to travel around this time are the weekends after Christmas (Dec. 26 and 27) and New Year\u2019s (Jan. 2 and 3).", "Of course these are suggested days, based on predictions. And, again, different sites have their own recommendations. Travelzoo experts, for instance, say that you should try to fly on the following dates: Wednesday, Dec. 16; Friday, Dec. 25; Wednesday, Jan. 6; Thursday, Jan. 7; and Saturday, Jan. 9.", "To simplify matters, go online and create your own guide to your preferred holiday travel dates. In September I wrote about sites in the business of what\u2019s known as \u201cfarecasting,\u201d or predicting the best date to buy a ticket. These tools allow you to plug in your desired travel dates and see which combination of departure and return days across multiple airlines results in the cheapest fare. Hopper, for instance, has fare calendars and predicts whether a ticket price is likely to drop or increase.", "You can also wait to buy and sign up for fare alerts if you want to roll the dice during the holidays and book tickets at the last minute. Google Flights allows you to see if you can save money by, say, leaving days earlier, or by flying into or out of a different airport. Travelzoo has an airfare search engine, Fly.com, which shows prices across multiple websites and airlines. There\u2019s a fare calendar as well.", "And of course the same tactics that apply to getting lower airfare rates all year long can also help during the holidays. Gabe Saglie, a senior editor with Travelzoo, said to be sure to compare fares into and out of multiple airports. \u201cFor example,\u201d he said, \u201cthis means L.A.-bound fliers should look beyond L.A.X. to airports like Long Beach, John Wayne/Orange County and Burbank, which tend to feature a cozier overall flying experience and, because they\u2019re home to low-cost carriers, competitive fares.\u201d", "Just don\u2019t sacrifice everything for a deal. While making a few stops can lower the cost of a ticket, it can also increase the chance you\u2019ll miss your flight, especially if you have little time between connections.", "As Mr. Saglie pointed out: \u201cThink of the extra price you might pay for a nonstop flight as an insurance policy.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/technology/how-emojis-find-their-way-to-phones.html": ["An obscure organization that standardizes the way punctuation marks and other text are represented by computer systems has in recent years found itself at the forefront of mobile pop culture, with its power to create new emojis.", "A new batch is under review, a process that takes months.

Of course, this was in the 1960s, when the American Medical Association was still waging war on the profession via its Committee on Quackery, which labeled chiropractors as an \u201cunscientific cult.\u201d", "The A.M.A.\u2019s Committee on Quackery is long defunct, having gone out of existence after a lawsuit by chiropractors led to a 1987 federal district judge\u2019s ruling that the medical association had tried to destroy the chiropractic profession. Since then, the number of chiropractors has steadily grown. Today it seems as if everyone I know is seeing one \u2014 and not just for the standard hands-on treatment of lower-back pain, but for an expanding range of interventions falling under the rubric of \u201cintegrative wellness.\u201d", "The American Chiropractic Association estimates that there will be 80,000 chiropractors in the United States by 2020, up from 58,000 in 2010, with chiropractic colleges graduating about 3,000 new practitioners each year. A 2007 study found that more than 18 million Americans had been treated with spinal manipulation, the core of chiropractic practice, during the previous year, a number that has likely increased since then.", "Many insurance plans now reimburse patients for basic chiropractic care for back and neck pain.

Dr. Alan Hilibrand, a professor of orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, said, \u201cAt least as far as low-back pain is involved, it poses very little risk, and there are a lot of real advantages to it in this world of more and more medicine, and more and more opiate addiction.\u201d", "Dr. Richard Deyo, the Kaiser-Permanente endowed professor of evidence-based medicine at Oregon Health and Science University and the author of \u201cWatch Your Back!\u201d called chiropractic care for lower-back pain \u201ca reasonable alternative for people who would prefer to avoid medication or high-tech intervention.\u201d He said more doctors were referring patients to chiropractors and more insurance plans were covering them for reasons that included \u201cgrowing evidence that chiropractic care may be approximately as effective as conventional care, at least for back pain; successful lobbying by the chiropractic profession; and at least some evidence that for back pain, chiropractic care may be cost neutral rather than adding to costs of care.\u201d", "A review of available evidence from the Cochrane Collaboration, a global network of researchers, concluded that \u201ccombined chiropractic interventions slightly improved pain and disability in the short term and pain in the medium term for acute/subacute low-back pain.\u201d And other studies have shown that chiropractic treatment or exercise may be more effective than painkillers for the relief of neck pain. Yet the Cochrane reviewers pointedly added that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that chiropractors \u201cprovide a clinically meaningful difference for pain or disability\u201d for lower-back pain \u201cwhen compared to other interventions.\u201d", "Dr. Deyo said the mechanism of how chiropractic care might help still isn\u2019t well understood, although he speculated that a combination of factors might be responsible, including some muscle relaxation, possibly \u201ca realigning of the facet joints on vertebrae that help maintain alignment,\u201d and a powerful placebo effect conveyed by the hands-on treatment. Yet another factor might be the simple passage of time, he said, adding that \u201cmost people with back problems seek treatment when they\u2019re at their worst. They\u2019re probably going to get better on their own, with or without care.\u201d", "There\u2019s a case to be made for patience, given that the basic procedure is not without some documented dangers, particularly when it comes to the treatment of neck pain.", "Last year, the American Heart Association urged practitioners to inform patients of a possible association between neck manipulation and the risk of a tear in the artery walls in the neck that could result in a stroke, although it noted that \u201cit cannot be said with certainty that neck manipulation causes strokes.\u201d A 2007 report in the journal Spine estimated that the risk of any \u201cseriously adverse effect\u201d of cervical spine manipulations, including a serious worsening of pain or \u201cpersistent or significant disability/incapacity\u201d was at worst six per 100,000 treatments.", "William Meeker, president of the Palmer College of Chiropractic-West Campus in San Jose, Calif., maintained that the risk of a chiropractic adjustment causing \u201cmorbidity or mortality\u201d was a fraction of the risk of taking a course of aspirin. He said chiropractors were generally better trained than ever, minimizing the risk of harm from such procedures. The standard is four to five years of postgraduate study at a chiropractic college and at least one year of supervised patient care. Before chiropractors can practice, they must also pass a national exam and be licensed by their state.", "The American Chiropractic Association says the training is similar to that at medical school. At the same time, Dr. Deyo and other experts have expressed concern about the tendency of some members of the profession to dabble in a widening variety of medical realms, in a kind of mission creep. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with chiropractors who assert they treat diabetes and heart disease and thyroid problems, and I have to say I\u2019m skeptical,\u201d Dr. Deyo said. A brief Internet search confirmed that some chiropractors claimed to offer such therapies as \u201cpendulum divination,\u201d \u201cbiological terrain assessment\u201d and \u201cherbal crystallization analysis.\u201d", "I can only imagine what my dad would have said.", "I got a front-row-seat view of the industry\u2019s holistic possibilities a few minutes into my appointment with a chiropractor who had been so highly recommended by a friend that I rashly didn\u2019t check beforehand if he had contracted with my insurance plan. (Turns out he hadn\u2019t: Despite all that lobbying, many chiropractors would rather not deal with insurance. )", "To my surprise, and temporarily stunned acquiescence, what I\u2019d imagined would be a brief encounter resulting in a soothed tailbone for $125 (the fee quoted by the receptionist) turned into a three-hour \u201cwellness\u201d exam, with more than $300 in extra charges.", "Long before he looked at my spine, the chiropractor inspected the rest of me with various instruments, alerting me \u2014 by dictating loudly to his assistant, who scribbled on a pad \u2014 that I was suffering, among other things, from a potential Candida infection in my mouth, a slight tremor and muscle wasting in my hand, possible Lyme disease, bone-density loss, mismatched leg lengths, a worrisome \u201cbrown spot\u201d on my right eye and an asymmetrical smile.", "The founding theory of the chiropractic profession, dating back to 1895, is that everything is connected, and that harm to the nervous system caused by a skeletal misalignment can lead to a gamut of health problems. But who knew the tailbone was connected to the smile bone?", "I\u2019d entered that office considering myself a relatively healthy, if aging, woman, but left feeling like a walking time bomb. I couldn\u2019t have foreseen there\u2019d be so many completely new things to worry about. This may explain why I worriedly ended up agreeing to a supposedly essential set of X-rays for $165, although I managed to decline the offer of proprietary vitamins for sale at the front desk. Only in the last 15 minutes of the appointment did the chiropractor manipulate my tailbone \u2014 for less than five minutes \u2014 after which his assistant deployed what she told me was ultrasound therapy, for an extra $70 that was disclosed only when I was handed the bill.", "The jury is out as to whether any of it helped, since my tailbone didn\u2019t stop hurting for another couple of weeks. Was it merely the passage of time, as Dr. Deyo had suggested, or did that 15 minutes of touch and heat \u2014 and maybe some placebo effect \u2014 do the trick?", "My chiropractor did do me a service by urging me to get my bone density checked \u2014 which I did, at a specialist\u2019s lab, resulting in a diagnosis of osteoporosis (sigh) and a prescription for Fosamax. While, after all my research, on balance I\u2019d be willing to visit a chiropractor again for serious lower-back pain, I plan to pursue \u201cintegrative wellness\u201d at least in the near future by nudging my primary care doctor for periodic, thorough checkups.", "The next time I see him, I\u2019ll ask if I should worry about my crooked smile.", "Katherine Ellison is the author of several books, including the forthcoming \u201cADHD: What Everyone Needs to Know,\u201d written with Stephen P.

She\u2019s a skeptic who was once a believer, a clinical psychologist among the industry shills and the literary hand-wringers, an empiricist among the cherry-picking anecdotalists, a moderate among the extremists, a realist among the fantasists, a humanist but not a Luddite: a grown-up. She holds an endowed chair at M.I.T. and is on close collegial terms with the roboticists and affective-computing engineers who work there. Unlike Jaron Lanier, who bears the stodgy weight of being a Microsoft guy, or Evgeny Morozov, whose perspective is Belarussian, Turkle is a trusted and respected insider. As such, she serves as a kind of conscience for the tech world.", "Turkle\u2019s previous book, \u201cAlone \u00adTogether,\u201d was a damning report on human relationships in the digital age. By observing people\u2019s interactions with robots, and by interviewing them about their computers and phones, she charted the ways in which new technologies render older values obsolete. When we replace human caregivers with robots, or talking with texting, we begin by arguing that the replacements are \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d but end up considering them \u201cbetter than anything\u201d \u2014 cleaner, less risky, less demanding. Paralleling this shift is a growing preference for the virtual over the real. Robots don\u2019t care about people, but Turkle\u2019s subjects were shockingly quick to settle for the feeling of being cared for and, similarly, to prefer the sense of community that social media deliver, because it comes without the hazards and commitments of a real-world community. In her interviews, again and again, Turkle observed a deep disappointment with human beings, who are flawed and forgetful, needy and unpredictable, in ways that machines are wired not to be.", "Her new book, \u201cReclaiming Conversation,\u201d extends her critique, with less \u00ademphasis on robots and more on the dissatisfaction with technology reported by her recent interview subjects. She takes their dissatisfaction as a hopeful sign, and her book is straightforwardly a call to arms: Our rapturous submission to digital technology has led to an atrophying of human capacities like empathy and self-\u00adreflection, and the time has come to reassert ourselves, behave like adults and put technology in its place. As in \u201cAlone Together,\u201d Turkle\u2019s argument derives its power from the breadth of her research and the acuity of her psychological insight. The people she interviews have adopted new technologies in pursuit of greater control, only to feel controlled by them. The likably idealized selves that they\u2019ve created with social media leave their real selves all the more isolated. They communicate incessantly but are afraid of face-to-face conversations; they worry, often nostalgically, that they\u2019re missing out on something fundamental.", "Conversation is Turkle\u2019s organizing principle because so much of what constitutes humanity is threatened when we replace it with electronic communication. Conversation presupposes solitude, for example, because it\u2019s in solitude that we learn to think for ourselves and develop a stable sense of self, which is essential for taking other people as they are. (If we\u2019re unable to be separated from our smartphones, Turkle says, we consume other people \u201cin bits and pieces; it is as though we use them as spare parts to support our fragile selves.\u201d) Through the conversational attention of parents, children acquire a sense of enduring connectedness and a habit of talking about their feelings, rather than simply acting on them. (Turkle believes that regular family conversations help \u201cinoculate\u201d children against bullying.) When you speak to people in person, you\u2019re forced to recognize their full human reality, which is where empathy begins. (A recent study shows a steep decline in empathy, as measured by standard psychological tests, among college students of the smartphone generation.) And conversation carries the risk of boredom, the condition that smartphones have taught us most to fear, which is also the condition in which patience and imagination are developed.", "Turkle examines every aspect of conversation \u2014 with the self in solitude, with family and friends, with teachers and romantic partners, with colleagues and clients, with the larger polity \u2014 and reports on the electronic erosion of each. Facebook, Tinder, MOOCs, compulsive texting, the tyranny of office email, and shallow online social activism all come in for paddling. But the most moving and representative section of the book concerns the demise of family conversation. According to Turkle\u2019s young interviewees, the vicious circle works like this: \u201cParents give their children phones. Children can\u2019t get their parents\u2019 attention away from their phones, so children take refuge in their own devices. Then, parents use their children\u2019s absorption with phones as permission to have their own phones out as much as they wish.\u201d For Turkle, the onus lies squarely on the parents: \u201cThe most realistic way to disrupt this circle is to have parents step up to their responsibilities as mentors.\u201d She acknowledges that this can be difficult; that parents feel afraid of falling behind their children technologically; that conversation with young children takes patience and practice; that it\u2019s easier to demonstrate parental love by snapping lots of pictures and posting them to Facebook. But, unlike in \u201cAlone Together,\u201d where Turkle was content to diagnose, the tone of \u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d is therapeutic and hortatory. She calls on parents to understand what\u2019s at stake in family conversations \u2014 \u201cthe development of trust and self-esteem,\u201d \u201cthe capacity for empathy, friendship and intimacy\u201d \u2014 and to recognize their own vulnerability to the enchantments of tech. \u201cAccept your vulnerability,\u201d she says. \u201cRemove the \u00adtemptation.\u201d", "\u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d is best appreciated as a sophisticated self-help book. It makes a compelling case that children develop better, students learn better and employees perform better when their mentors set good examples and carve out spaces for face-to-face interactions. Less compelling is Turkle\u2019s call for collective action. She believes that we can and must design technology \u201cthat demands that we use it with greater intention.\u201d She writes approvingly of a smartphone interface that \u201cinstead of encouraging us to stay connected as long as possible, would encourage us to disengage.\u201d But an interface like this would threaten almost every business model in Silicon Valley, where enormous market capitalizations are predicated on keeping consumers riveted to their devices. Turkle hopes that consumer demand, which has forced the food industry to create healthier products, might eventually force the tech industry to do the same. But the analogy is imperfect. Food companies make money by \u00adselling something essential, not by placing targeted advertising in a pork chop or by mining the data that a person provides while eating it. The analogy is also politically unsettling. Since platforms that discourage engagement are less profitable, they would have to charge a premium that only affluent, well-educated consumers of the sort that shop at Whole Foods are likely to pay.", "Although \u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d touches on the politics of privacy and \u00adlabor-saving robots, Turkle shies from the more radical implications of her findings. When she notes that Steve Jobs forbade tablets and smartphones at the dinner table and encouraged his family to talk about books and history, or when she cites Mozart, Kafka and Picasso on the value of undistracted solitude, she\u2019s describing the habits of highly effective people. And, indeed, the family that is doing well enough to buy and read her new book may learn to limit its exposure to technology and do even better. But what of the great mass of people too anxious or lonely to resist the lure of tech, too poor or overworked to escape the vicious circles? Matthew Crawford, in \u201cThe World Beyond Your Head,\u201d contrasts the world of a \u201cpeon\u201d airport lounge \u2014 saturated in advertising, filled with mesmerizing screens \u2014 with the quiet, ad-free world of a business lounge: \u201cTo engage in playful, inventive thinking, and possibly create wealth for oneself during those idle hours spent at an airport, requires silence. But other people\u2019s minds, over in the peon lounge (or at the bus stop), can be \u00adtreated as a resource \u2014 a standing reserve of purchasing power.\u201d Our digital technologies aren\u2019t politically neutral. The young person who cannot or will not be alone, converse with family, go out with friends, attend a lecture or perform a job without monitoring her smartphone is an emblem of our economy\u2019s leechlike attachment to our very bodies. Digital technology is capitalism in hyperdrive, injecting its logic of consumption and promotion, of monetization and efficiency, into every waking minute.", "It\u2019s tempting to correlate the rise of \u201cdigital democracy\u201d with steeply rising levels of income inequality; to see more than just an irony. But maybe the erosion of humane values is a price that most people are willing to pay for the \u201ccostless\u201d convenience of Google, the comforts of Facebook and the reliable company of iPhones. The appeal of \u201cReclaiming Conversation\u201d lies in its evocation of a time, not so long ago, when conversation and privacy and nuanced debate weren\u2019t boutique luxuries. It\u2019s not Turkle\u2019s fault that her book can be read as a handbook for the privileged. She\u2019s addressing a middle class in which she herself grew up, invoking a depth of human potential that used to be widespread. But the middle, as we know, is disappearing.", "RECLAIMING CONVERSATION\nThe Power of Talk in a Digital Age\nBy Sherry Turkle\n436 pp. Penguin Press. $27.95."]}

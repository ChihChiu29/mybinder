But three men claim they wanted to prove that wasn\u2019t quite true, \u201cjust for the fun of it.\u201d", "So about a year ago they created Snapsaved.com, a web tool that when connected to a Snapchat account would save a user\u2019s photos and videos in an online storage locker.", "Then, last week, they said their experiment went haywire when their servers were breached. A handful of people on the online message board 4chan claimed to have access to a huge stash of private photos, including potential child pornography, stolen from Snapsaved.com.", "\u201cOf course we\u2019re very sorry,\u201d one of the men said in an interview. \u201cThis whole thing was blown up beyond what we expected. We haven\u2019t profited from this, and we don\u2019t want to be famous.\u201d", "The men, who spoke English with Northern European accents, would not disclose their names, ages or location, saying only that they were somewhere outside the United States. The New York Times contacted them last Friday through Snapsaved\u2019s Facebook page.", "They agreed to talk over an Internet phone connection but went to considerable effort to conceal their identities: They used a random name generation program to create their online handle, \u201cSchmidt Gizi,\u201d and claimed to be using so-called proxy computer servers to hide their location. Trucks could be heard in the background during the conversation, indicating that they were most likely outside.", "They have taken Snapsaved offline.", "Just how links to the photos from Snapsaved surfaced on message boards is still a mystery and the men said they did not know who was responsible.", "The size of the collection of stolen photos is also hard to pin down. Posters on 4chan claim they stole around 200,000 images. But the men who say they created Snapsaved said that the stolen collection had more like 40,000 and that hackers had inflated the total with pictures from pornography sites.", "Indeed, it is even impossible to say for certain if the links to images making the rounds on message boards are really from Snapchat, though the men who say they created Snapsaved said they had seen the stash of photos and believe they were taken from their own servers.", "The incident has raised new questions regarding Snapchat, which is particularly popular among teenagers. Security researchers say that while any dedicated hacker with enough time and resources can find a way to tap into Snapchat, the company could make it harder for third-party services like Snapsaved.", "\u201cBut with enough motivation, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019ll still be reverse-engineered,\u201d said Adam Caudill, an independent security researcher and outspoken Snapchat critic. \u201cThe issue with them is that their users expect more privacy than they can provide, and the nature of the service has made it more of a target than most.\u201d", "Snapchat has faced past criticism regarding its promises of privacy. Last year, security experts publicly revealed a flaw in the company\u2019s technology, which Snapchat quickly dismissed. Days later, the service was hacked to expose the handles and phone numbers of thousands of Snapchat users.", "Many take issue with Snapchat\u2019s privacy claims. The Electronic Privacy Information Center has asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into Snapchat\u2019s data security practices. In May, Snapchat settled with the F.T.C. and agreed to further improve its privacy features over time.", "The three men contacted through the Snapsaved Facebook page provided The Times with a list of Snapchat user names collected from Snapsaved.com to prove they were affiliated with Snapsaved.com. A number of those user names matched the names of people who commented on Snapsaved.com\u2019s Facebook page and indicated on that page that they had signed up for the service. A random sampling of about 40 names on the list also matches the names of Snapchat users.", "They said they built the site in October 2013 after they were hired by someone they met on BlackHatWorld.com, an online message board where users trade tips and swindles to make money off search engines using practices that are typically rejected by companies like Google.", "This person, whom the men would not identify but said was based in Hong Kong, owned the Snapsaved.com domain listing or Internet address. The men tried to contact this man after the hack, but he did not respond to them.", "Snapsaved acted as a sort of online middleman between Snapchat and individual users. After a person entered a Snapchat handle and password, any photos or images sent to friends were saved to Snapsaved\u2019s server. Over the past year, the men said they had collected about 13 gigabytes of photos and data from more than 260,000 users.", "That means that even if a Snapchat user did not use Snapsaved.com, that person\u2019s photos may still be at risk if they were sent to someone who had gained access to the site.", "The men were alerted that something was wrong only after the first news reports began to circulate last week. They claimed two different people hacked into the Snapsaved.com server, and were able to steal 415 megabytes of data. The stolen content only includes photos and videos, these men said, and not user names, phone numbers, passwords or other account information.", "After realizing their server had been breached, the men said they deleted all of the photos and took down the website.", "The men said they decided to talk because they wanted to make it clear that it was their site that was hacked \u2014 not Snapchat. And they also wanted to make clear that they did not intend to collect child pornography.", "But six months ago, that is what happened. The men said they found images of child pornography uploaded to the Snapsaved.com server. They said they were able to trace the Internet addresses of the users sharing those photos to Sweden and Norway and sent that material to child protective services in those countries.", "Snapchat has said that what Snapsaved did is an unauthorized use of its service, and condemns the practice. On Tuesday, Snapchat posted an update to its blog, warning users not to obtain access to third-party services that have tied into its service without permission.", "\u201cWhen you give your login credentials to a third-party application, you\u2019re allowing a developer, and possibly a criminal, to access your account information and send information on your behalf,\u201d the company said in its blog post.", "Snapchat says it is not averse to working with partners and hopes to do more of that, but it does not invite them to reverse-engineer its service in order to find and exploit its flaws.", "For now, the men responsible for Snapsaved.com have not gone to the authorities to talk about the incident. They said they were concerned for their safety, and worried they would be prosecuted for storing or inadvertently distributing the photos.", "And yet, since The Times interviewed them over the weekend, they have shown some signs of bravado, even asking to be paid in Bitcoin \u2014 the online currency \u2014 in exchange for an interview, according to Motherboard, Vice\u2019s technology site. The Times did not pay for its interview.", "\u201cWell \u2026 my time is finite, and the amount of interviewers is very high, we have made a public statement, explaining our side of the story,\u201d one of the men said in a Facebook message on Tuesday.", "\u201cIf you wish further elaboration on the topic, we can give you that, but we are very busy at the moment.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/business/media/how-facebook-is-changing-the-way-its-users-consume-journalism.html": ["MENLO PARK, Calif. \u2014 Many of the people who read this article will do so because Greg Marra, 26, a Facebook engineer, calculated that it was the kind of thing they might enjoy.", "Mr. Marra\u2019s team designs the code that drives Facebook\u2019s News Feed \u2014 the stream of updates, photographs, videos and stories that users see. He is also fast becoming one of the most influential people in the news business.", "Facebook now has a fifth of the world \u2014 about 1.3 billion people \u2014 logging on at least monthly. It drives up to 20 percent of traffic to news sites, according to figures from the analytics company SimpleReach. On mobile devices, the fastest-growing source of readers, the percentage is even higher, SimpleReach says, and continues to increase.", "The social media company is increasingly becoming to the news business what Amazon is to book publishing \u2014 a behemoth that provides access to hundreds of millions of consumers and wields enormous power. About 30 percent of adults in the United States get their news on Facebook, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. The fortunes of a news site, in short, can rise or fall depending on how it performs in Facebook\u2019s News Feed.", "Though other services, like Twitter and Google News, can also exert a large influence, Facebook is at the forefront of a fundamental change in how people consume journalism. Most readers now come to it not through the print editions of newspapers and magazines or their home pages online, but through social media and search engines driven by an algorithm, a mathematical formula that predicts what users might want to read.", "It is a world of fragments, filtered by code and delivered on demand. For news organizations, said Cory Haik, senior editor for digital news at The Washington Post, the shift represents \u201cthe great unbundling\u201d of journalism. Just as the music industry has moved largely from selling albums to songs bought instantly online, publishers are increasingly reaching readers through individual pieces rather than complete editions of newspapers or magazines. A publication\u2019s home page, said Edward Kim, a co-founder of SimpleReach, will soon be important more as an advertisement of its brand than as a destination for readers.", "\u201cPeople won\u2019t type in WashingtonPost.com anymore,\u201d Ms. Haik said. \u201cIt\u2019s search and social.\u201d", "The shift raises questions about the ability of computers to curate news, a role traditionally played by editors. It also has broader implications for the way people consume information, and thus how they see the world.", "In an interview at Facebook\u2019s sprawling headquarters here, which has a giant, self-driving golf cart that takes workers between buildings, Mr. Marra said he did not think too much about his impact on journalism.", "\u201cWe try to explicitly view ourselves as not editors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have editorial judgment over the content that\u2019s in your feed. You\u2019ve made your friends, you\u2019ve connected to the pages that you want to connect to and you\u2019re the best decider for the things that you care about.\u201d", "In Facebook\u2019s work on its users\u2019 news feeds, Mr. Marra said, \u201cwe\u2019re saying, \u2018We think that of all the stuff you\u2019ve connected yourself to, this is the stuff you\u2019d be most interested in reading.' \u201d", "Roughly once a week, he and his team of about 16 adjust the complex computer code that decides what to show a user when he or she first logs on to Facebook. The code is based on \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of metrics, Mr. Marra said, including what device a user is on, how many comments or likes a story has received and how long readers spend on an article.", "The goal is to identify what users most enjoy, and its results vary around the world. In India, he said, people tend to share what the company calls the ABCDs: astrology, Bollywood, cricket and divinity.", "If Facebook\u2019s algorithm smiles on a publisher, the rewards, in terms of traffic, can be enormous. If Mr. Marra and his team decide that users do not enjoy certain things, such as teaser headlines that lure readers to click through to get all the information, it can mean ruin. When Facebook made changes to its algorithm in December 2013 to emphasize higher-quality content, several so-called viral sites that had thrived there, including Upworthy, Distractify and Elite Daily, saw large declines in their traffic.", "Facebook executives frame the company\u2019s relationship with publishers as mutually beneficial: when publishers promote their content on Facebook, its users have more engaging material to read, and the publishers get increased traffic driven to their sites. Numerous publications, including The New York Times, have met with Facebook officials to discuss how to improve their referral traffic.", "The increased traffic can potentially mean that the publisher can increase its advertising rates or convert some of those new readers into subscribers.", "Social media companies like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn want their users to spend more time,or do more, on their services \u2014 a concept known as engagement, said Sean Munson, an assistant professor at the University of Washington who studies the intersection of technology and behavior.", "Facebook officials say that the more time users spend at its site, the more likely there will be a robust exchange of diverse viewpoints and ideas shared online. Others fear that users will create their own echo chambers, and filter out coverage they do not agree with. \u201cAnd that,\u201d Mr. Munson said, \u201cis when you get conspiracy theories.\u201d", "Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed, a news and entertainment site, said his rule for writing and reporting in a fragmented age is simple: \u201cno filler.\u201d News organizations that still publish a print edition, he said, have slots \u2014 physical holes on paper or virtual ones on a home page \u2014 that result in the publication of stories that are not necessarily the most interesting or timely, but are required to fill the space. It was partly to discourage such slot-filling that BuzzFeed did not focus on its home page when it first started, he said.", "Mr. Kim of SimpleReach says he advises established media companies that \u201cit\u2019s dangerous to start chasing social. You\u2019ll end up like everyone else, and you\u2019ll lose your differentiation.\u201d The question that older publications that are not \u201cdigital natives\u201d like BuzzFeed have to ask themselves, Mr. Kim said, is \u201cAre you creating content for the way that content is consumed in this environment?\u201d", "Ms. Haik, the Washington Post digital editor, is leading a team, started this year, that aims to deliver different versions of The Post\u2019s journalism to different people, based on information about how they have come to an article, which device they are on and even, if it is a phone, which way they are holding it.", "\u201cWe\u2019re asking if there\u2019s a different kind of storytelling, not just an ideal presentation,\u201d she said. For instance, she said, people reading The Post on a mobile phone during the day will probably want a different kind of reading experience than those who are on a Wi-Fi connection at home in the evening.", "The Post is putting time and energy into such efforts, Ms. Haik said, because it is \u201cultimately about sustaining our business or growing our audience.\u201d More than half of its mobile readers, she said, are so-called millennials who consume news digitally and largely through social media sites like Facebook. Some publications have found a niche in taking the opposite approach. The Browser is edited by Robert Cottrell, a former journalist at The Financial Times and The Economist. Mr. Cottrell skims about 1,000 articles a day, he said, and then publishes five or six that he finds interesting for about 7,000 subscribers who pay $20 a year. A recent selection included the life of an early-20th-century American bricklayer and a study of great Eastern philosophers.", "\u201cThe general idea is to offer a few pieces each day which we think are both enjoyable and of lasting value,\u201d Mr. Cottrell said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly at the other end of the process from the algorithms.\u201d", "Artificial intelligence, he said, may eventually be able to find a piece of writing moving, in some sense, and want to share it. But for the moment, computers rely on information gathered online \u201cand that is going to be a very, very impoverished data set compared to a human being.\u201d", "Mr. Marra, the Facebook engineer, agrees that a human editor for each individual would be ideal. \u201cBut it\u2019s not realistic to do that at scale for every person on the planet,\u201d he said, \u201cand so I think we\u2019ll always have these hybrid systems like News Feed that are helping you find the things that you care about.\u201d It is simply, he said, \u201ca personalized newspaper.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/opinion/ireland-still-addicted-to-tax-breaks.html": ["The Irish government decided last week to get rid of a tax loophole that has helped big multinational companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions in taxes to any government at all. But hold the champagne: Ireland could well replace one problematic tax policy with another, leaving aggressive tax avoidance pretty much intact.", "On Oct. 14, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said the country would get rid of the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d \u2014 a provision that allows companies doing business in the country to avoid taxes by making royalty payments to an affiliated firm that is registered in Ireland but has its tax home in another country, often a tax haven like Bermuda that has no corporate income taxes. The provision will disappear for new companies in January, but businesses already using it can continue to do so until 2020.", "Still, Ireland, which for years used policies like the double Irish to attract multinational businesses, appears uninterested in true reform. It will create a new provision known as the Knowledge Development Box that will allow technology, pharmaceutical and other companies that make money from patented products and services to pay a discounted tax rate. Officials haven\u2019t said much about what kinds of profits will qualify for the lower rate or what it will be. Experts expect it to be lower than the already low standard corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent.", "Ireland is not alone in trying to lure tech companies with very low tax rates. Since last year, Britain has been phasing in what it calls the Patent Box. By 2017, the country will have just a 10 percent tax on profits from \u201cpatented inventions and certain other innovations.\u201d That will be less than half its standard corporate tax rate of 22 percent.", "There are numerous problems with such policies. For starters, they leave one group of businesses \u2014 those that are not fortunate enough to make money with the help of patented products \u2014 at a significant disadvantage. Is it fair to have a much higher tax on the profits of, say, a modestly profitable restaurant business than on a highly prosperous technology giant?", "These tax policies also create a dangerous race to the bottom, with each nation trying to outdo the others in tax giveaways. If left unchecked, this could make it impossible for any nation to tax profits from a fast-growing part of the economy. Governments, of course, must still pay for public services, so they will have to levy higher taxes on individuals, which will fall most heavily on the middle class and the poor.", "It is particularly depressing that countries like Britain and Ireland are engaging in such beggar-thy-neighbor policies given their public commitments in international forums to behave differently. For instance, the Group of 20, of which Britain is a member and at which Ireland is represented through the European Union, has made ending tax avoidance a priority. If even G-20 countries cannot resist the temptation to create giant loopholes, how can the international community ever hope to persuade other nations that are tax havens to change? Getting countries to cooperate with one another on tax policy is beginning to seem like a far-fetched idea."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/daily-report-science-start-ups-get-renewed-interest-from-venture-capitalists/": ["After years of shying away from science, engineering and clean-technology start-ups, investors are beginning to take an interest in them again, raising hopes among entrepreneurs in those areas that a long slump is finally over.

The company, which is based in Los Angeles (\u201ca city that has always been a frontier for new explorations,\u201d Sharon notes), has commissioned and produced three operas to date, all of which have been site-specific enterprises that reimagine the roles of both the performers and the audience. \u201cInvisible Cities,\u201d based on Italo Calvino\u2019s postmodern book of the same name, has received the most acclaim; its composer, Christopher Cerrone, was a finalist for a 2014 Pulitzer Prize.", "\u201cInvisible Cities\u201d will be released Nov. 4 as the Industry\u2019s first recording, both as an \u201cart-object physical CD,\u201d in an edition of 500, and as a digital artifact on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify and the like. \u201cWe needed to honor and let the music stand on its own. Now that the performance is over, it\u2019s part our mission to keep these works disseminated and as lively as we can,\u201d says Sharon. The opera was originally performed last fall in Los Angeles\u2019s Union Station, where Amtrak maintained its regularly scheduled operations while 200 viewers, armed with headphones, chose their own adventure by following whichever singers and dancers they preferred. \u201cIt allowed a listener to live in the work sonically, while also having a deeply satisfying visual experience,\u201d Cerrone says.

Soon enough, it had spawned versions from L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Smashbox, Clinique, Jane Iredale, Stila and Dior \u2014 and paved the way for a Korean beauty invasion of the United States.", "The beauty market has long been led by European countries, which were thought to be the source of innovation. But in recent years, American women (and beauty companies), their interest piqued by the BB cream, began to look more closely at Korean multistep skin-care regimens, and they liked what they saw.", "\u201cIt shifted our consciousness on what it means to take care of your skin,\u201d said Megan McIntyre, the beauty director at the lifestyle site Refinery29. Seeing the care Korean women devote to their skin made consumers curious about new techniques, Ms. McIntyre said, adding that the often adorably twee packaging, high-tech innovations (peel-off lip stains, overnight masks) and affordable prices have not hurt, either. But let no one think that Korean women just slap on a BB cream and call it a day.", "\u201cThe American approach is: the simpler the better, the faster I can get out the door,\u201d said Cindy Kim, a founder of Peach and Lily, one of a number of online retailers, including Soko Glam and Memebox, that sells Korean beauty products. \u201cThe Korean mentality is comprehensive and detailed.\u201d", "And it is exhaustive. First, there\u2019s cleansing, often with two different cleansers (one oil-based to remove makeup, then a foaming cleanser), followed by a toner to balance pH levels on the face.", "Then there are \u201cessences\u201d and serums, which is \u201cwhere the number of steps can blow up,\u201d Ms. Kim said. The serums often target single issues: aging, radiance, hydration, redness. An eye cream, plus moisturizer, and BB cream (for day) or an overnight sleep mask are applied next and all sealed with a mist.

Peter Thomas Roth, a skin-care line in New York, makes a CC cream (a lighter sibling to the BB cream) in South Korea. Its answer to the Korean essence, a step between cleansing and treatment, is its Un-Wrinkle Turbo Line Smoothing Lotion. It also has a sleeping mask (a concentrated mask you wear overnight) and an oil-like product made from squalene, which comes from sugar cane and has long been popular in Asia.", "For sure, there is an exoticism to Korean ingredients, with products like LadyKin Vanpir Dark Repair Cream (which touts Red Dragon Blood Resin Extract) and Mizon Returning Starfish Cream (with 70 percent starfish extract).

How did you end up advising the heads of major companies?", "A. In England, after you finish school, you can choose to go to university or to work \u2014 and I went to work. So I wrote to the C.E.O. of I.C.I. [the now defunct Imperial Chemical Industries] and was hired on a fast-track management training program, studying accounting at the same time. I was 19, 20 \u2014 working near the top with the C.E.O. \u2014 and couldn\u2019t believe how bureaucratic it was. It was just wrong.", "This is what has driven me for 25 years. Most guys at that age want to meet girls; I wanted to meet C.E.O.s. The D.N.A. for Xinfu came from my 20s. Later, I worked as a headhunter at a search firm for a while just so I could get more access to chief executives.\u201d", "Q. You are a self-described \u201cC.E.O. confidant.\u201d What does that mean?", "A. Both \u201ccoaching\u201d and \u201cconsultancy\u201d have a bad name. \u201cCoaching\u201d relies too much on soft skills, and \u201cconsultancy\u201d is too focused on figures. I consider myself a personal confidant and sparring partner on their business and leadership.", "First I sit down and challenge them really hard about whether their company will work short-term, whether the business is robust. And then I ask, \u201cWhat is the future of this company? What\u2019s Version 2? Do you have five or six ideas that can change the industry?\u201d", "I have a team of about 12 experts, and I may bring in three or four on a project. I want to avoid the trap that it will turn Xinfu into a big consultancy.", "Q. Much of your work is in China. What drew you there, and how do you fit in as an outsider?", "A. About six years ago, while working on my book \u201cThe New Secrets of CEOs,\u201d I interviewed 200 C.E.O.s around the world. I started meeting more Chinese C.E.O.s and realizing how different they were.", "Now I tend to do four weeks in the U.K., two to three weeks in China, and one week somewhere else. I get itchy feet, and I love going to China. But it was hard at times \u2014 I had to break into a \u201cguanxi,\u201d or network.", "Q. Jack Ma is the chief executive of the day, after Alibaba\u2019s I.P.O. broke all records. What do you think of him?", "A. I divide C.E.O.s into different types, and Jack Ma is what I call a missionary C.E.O. He wants to build a great company for China. He has an edge to him, like Steve Jobs. He\u2019s a fighter. He\u2019s a cult figure in China.", "Q. Who were the pioneers before newer entrepreneurs like Jack Ma?", "A. Liu Chuanzhi is considered the grandfather of Chinese business. When he started Lenovo, there was no structure for a company like that in China. There was no legal system, no regulatory system. He had to build it from scratch.", "The first generation of C.E.O.s, the pioneers, are now in their 60s. Psychologically, they have a fear that everything will be taken away. Nothing\u2019s forever, and anything can be taken from you.", "Q. What are some common management problems for Chinese C.E.O.s?", "A. They feel they can\u2019t move fast enough. Then it all seems like too much, so they hire a manager, usually a Westerner. Then something goes wrong, and they want to take control again. Then they end up in this crazy loop.", "The best C.E.O.s are the ones who develop a system, and then break out of that loop. Companies have to be able to run without them. You have to let go. For most C.E.O.s, the company is too centralized around them \u2014 and it puts too much stress on them. They have to build trust, form a fellowship.", "It\u2019s one thing to be an innovator. But then you have to build a company and keep it going. You want workplaces where your people feel comfortable. Many companies don\u2019t have the talented people to keep it going. Chinese employees are the least engaged in the world. There\u2019s 30 percent churn \u2014 meaning the number of people leaving every year. And because people leave so fast, you never get much execution or experience.", "Q. There\u2019s a stereotype that the Chinese can\u2019t innovate, only replicate. Is it true?", "A. They\u2019ve got big issues in innovation. If you go back in time, China was once very innovative. But because of recent history \u2014 the impact of the Cultural Revolution \u2014 it\u2019s hard for Chinese people to innovate, to think out of the box.", "In the last five or 10 years, they didn\u2019t have to innovate. They could make plenty of money manufacturing or copying other people\u2019s ideas.", "The common perception is that the Chinese are not good innovators. But they are good blenders \u2014 look at Alibaba. That\u2019s a combination of eBay, PayPal and Google. Tencent\u2019s WeChat is very innovative in terms of features, but not in terms of global recognition.", "In the next decade, there will be another generation of innovators. And my bet is that there will be some Chinese innovators in there, probably in networks, in the Internet space. There will be one or two breakouts.", "Q. There are large, successful Chinese companies. Yet your average guy in London or New York probably couldn\u2019t name a couple of Chinese brands. Why?", "A. There is a massive gap. Most Chinese C.E.O.s don\u2019t have a global mindset. They don\u2019t understand the mindset of Western people. Two-thirds don\u2019t speak English. The Chinese are trying to learn about global brands.", "Q. How do you deal with corruption?", "A. I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by the new Chinese government. They are cracking down hard on corruption and excesses. And while this will hurt some companies in the short term, like luxury hotels, it will help in the long term.", "Q. Who\u2019s the most colorful chief executive you\u2019ve met?", "A. Do you know Huang Nubo, the mountaineer-poet who tried to buy 300 square kilometers of Iceland? Anyway, he has a live shark in a tank in his office \u2014 and monkeys. I\u2019ve never seen that from a top executive. [Mr. Huang is a real estate developer and chairman of Beijing Zhongkun Investment Group.]", "Q. What will push China ahead of the West?", "A. They\u2019ve got massive ambitions \u2014 and that pushes them much more than Western C.E.O.s. There\u2019s a big nationalist streak. I went to Beijing\u2019s Silicon Valley and asked the next generation, \u201cDo you want to be a billionaire?\u201d And they said, \u201cI want to do this for China. I work from the moment I wake up until I go to bed. I work seven days a week until I get tired and take one day off.\u201d This nationalism and relentless hard work will pay off."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/18/your-money/the-downsides-of-generous-workplace-perks.html": ["FOR many employees these days, the only fringe benefits they can hope for are decent health care coverage and a working coffee machine.

It can be a good thing, by demonstrating that a company trusts its employees to make wise decisions. But \u201cit all depends on the norms and expectations in the work force,\u201d Professor Bailyn said.", "If taking off time is explicitly or implicitly frowned on, then people may use even less vacation time than under more formal policies, she said.", "Even the newest benefit, reimbursement for egg freezing, has skeptics who say that while this could be a welcome choice for some women, it could also be seen as workplaces paying women to put off childbearing.", "The companies, on the other hand, say the perks are all about making their employees\u2019 lives easier and more in their control.", "SAS, a software company that employs almost 7,000 people at its headquarters in Cary, N.C., was ranked No. 2 on Fortune\u2019s 2014 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For in the United States, right behind Google.", "SAS offers free personal trainers at its on-site fitness center, an indoor pool, hair salon, free on-site health care and work-life counselors.", "The benefits and culture as a whole help \u201cminimize the stresses that affect employees every day,\u201d said Jenn Mann, an SAS spokeswoman. \u201cWe want employees to be there on the first day of school or take an aging parent to the doctor.

We come to see a player\u2019s outlook, largely a matter of finding suitable opponents, may be changed by the recognition that there is more to life than that. But are we not all players, Roberts asks, when we surf the web and respond yes or no to the \u201cchoices\u201d we are spoon-fed?", "Though he writes in a neutral tone, Roberts sees that the dangers are great: \u201cWith each transaction and upgrade, each choice and click, life moves closer to us, and the world becomes our world.\u201d Our society, he fears, is in the process of enacting \u201cthe merger of self and market.\u201d Part of the merger is involuntary. Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have supplied consumer data to the government, but Americans were never asked to approve the National Security Agency\u2019s Prism and XKeyscore systems, which can record the movement of Internet users from site to site and the composition of emails from start to finish (including deletions). That extraordinary evolution of surveillance came from government and market together acting as a shepherd without the consent of the sheep. But if we are watched more than we realize, and more than we would like, it is also true that we have acquired an irrepressible eagerness to watch the lives of others. We pay to be the spectators of our own loss of privacy.", "Roberts\u2019s criticism centers on two distinct threats to a society that aims to be responsible, self-governing and interested in the well-being of future generations. The first threat comes from the power of distraction \u2014 deployed by the market for its own purposes \u2014 which disables us from attending to obligations and even from practicing ordinary prudence. Roberts cites a study that found that people remember the price of things bought with credit cards far less precisely than the price paid in cash. Time we spend looking into an iPad window to choose among 20 deals on jackets is time we might give to looking out of another kind of window and doing something about climate disruption.", "A second threat to personal autonomy and social responsibility comes, Roberts says, from our desire for immediate gratification in everything we do, from validating our political opinions to finding the nearest coffee shop. His comments on distraction and on immediacy are pertinent and help to characterize something that has gone badly wrong with American morale in the last 30 years or so. Yet Roberts often treats these separate dangers as if they were the same.", "Under the heading of \u201cimmediate gratification,\u201d he adduces the iPhone digital assistant Siri, who speaks to her owner in humanoid tones \u2014 the first generation of the dematerialized robot whose 10th generation may be the operating system depicted in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d The hero of that movie becomes attached to his system, a cute and upbeat voice with an amusing robot brain, and soon finds he enjoys her company with a cheerful gratitude he could never feel for a human partner. Are his feelings right or wrong? If the robot simulates a human entity and elicits a human response, what basis do we have for criticizing the transaction? The answer depends on ideas about human dignity, reciprocal relationships and the examined life, which the very comforts of technology have made harder for people to dwell on.", "A journalist and the author of \u201cThe End of Oil\u201d and \u201cThe End of Food,\u201d Roberts says his politics have not changed; he was and remains a political liberal. But his diagnosis of the impulse society has led him to \u201cconclusions that are distinctly conservative.\u201d This is less mysterious than he thinks. A conservative may have much in common with a conservationist. \u201cI do not like,\u201d Edmund Burke wrote, \u201cto see any thing destroyed; any void produced in society; any ruin on the face of the land.\u201d If you look on society as a product of human energy that has become a second nature to us, the environment we have to care for includes society itself, as well as the natural world of mountains, lakes and forests.", "Much of \u201cThe Impulse Society\u201d is a history of the run-up to the financial collapse of 2008. A long-term deterioration of morale was necessary to open the financial market to devices of toxic ingenuity like collateralized debt obligations, which the too-big-to-fail banks sliced and diced and sold to the wise and credulous alike. The corporate raiders of the 1970s and 1980s, Roberts argues, were early adventurers on the same path; corrupt practices in which they engaged, including stock buybacks, did permanent harm to a sense of the common good that once cut across social classes. The company town has almost vanished from American life. More than two million factory jobs were lost between 1979 and 1983, and recovery from the recessions of the 21st century has not been followed by a return of jobs. Why not? Because companies and shareholders found that \u201cthe return on technology was better than the return on people.\u201d Manufacturing has fallen from 25 percent of the economy in 1970 to 12 percent today. Between the 1970s and the early 2000s, when stock options and other compensation packages became common, the average chief executive went from being paid 20 times as much as the median employee to being paid 400 times as much.", "\u201cThe Impulse Society\u201d bears a generally reformist message, supported by uneven rows of miscellaneous facts. Its argument would be clearer if its definitions were sharper. The book\u2019s publicity compares it to \u201cThe Culture of Narcissism,\u201d by Christopher Lasch \u2014 an absorbing study of the decline of the autonomous personality, widely discussed when it appeared in 1979 \u2014 but Roberts says little in depth about personal or social pathology. A fairer book for comparison would be \u201cThe Acquisitive Society,\u201d a critique of the ethics of capitalism published in 1920 by the British historian R. H. Tawney. Corporate and dynastic property rights, Tawney believed, were deleterious unless attached to a social function, a kind of productive work that carried a visible benefit for the whole society. The defense of rights without some such function was a defense of privilege, and \u201cthe definition of a privilege is a right to which no corresponding function is attached.\u201d There you have three words, closely defined by their interrelations: function, right and privilege. Such definitions may work to build a case for the radical reform of society.", "By contrast, the tendency Roberts calls by the name of \u201cimpulse\u201d covers a multitude of faults.

Some of the experts I spoke to explained back then that while violence was clearly pushing children out of Honduras, many of the young Guatemalans were coming from less-violent areas, suggesting a more complicated set of causes.", "When I finally returned to the story at the end of this summer, after another immigration project, it was clear to me that some of the nuance had been lost in the nonstop \u201ccrisis\u201d coverage. So I started making plans to go to Nebaj, a remote area of the Guatemalan highlands where a number of children were coming from.", "Ms. Robles: I had already traveled to Honduras this spring to cover what was driving this rush of children to the United States. When those stories ran, I kept hearing from friends in Miami, where I am based, about kids they knew who had arrived. Several friends of mine had friends, relatives or neighbors who had made the trip, but one story in particular stopped me in my tracks. A friend of mine mentioned how a human-rights activist she knew in South Florida was forced to pay for the liberation of a Guatemalan teenager named Cecilia, whom she hardly knew. The activist had started receiving menacing phone calls from a smuggler who demanded payment for the girl, who had recently arrived from Guatemala. They suggested that if she did not pay, the girl would wind up in a brothel, which forced the human rights activist to hop into her car with some friends for a rest-stop rendezvous with armed smugglers. The story was so crazy that it sounded made up. I decided I had to meet Cecilia for myself.", "I went to the house in Miami where she is living and heard about her three-nation odyssey that started in the Guatemalan highlands.", "Mr. Cave: Turns out, Cecilia was from the exact area I planned to visit. The next challenge was getting there, and connecting with the family. I\u2019ve canceled previous trips to northern Guatemala because of washed-out roads, but this time my contacts assured me I could get there. Google Maps said it would take three or four hours from Guatemala City (in my rented four-wheel drive); my friends told me it was a good eight or nine.

Getting people to talk openly and honestly \u2014 Cecilia\u2019s family, and others with similar experiences \u2014 proved to be an enormous challenge. I found a few people with the help of a local farmer (and the good karma from giving some tired men in dirty boots a ride home), but making contact with Cecilia\u2019s family was difficult. I had the name of the town where she said she was from, but then she didn\u2019t seem to want anyone to visit, even though she was otherwise eager for us to tell her story. It turned out the family had moved. I eventually learned that Cecilia\u2019s stepfather had been killed, and her mother had been raped, forcing them to move from the little town they didn\u2019t want us to visit. But I was pretty confused at this point. Frances, what did you make of all of this?", "Ms. Robles: At first I thought they were dodging us, because Cecilia and her family were afraid of the coyotes. But they made it pretty clear that the person they did business with in Guatemala was not the one who ultimately held Cecilia in Texas and drove her to Florida seeking ransom. They had borrowed $7,000, with their house as collateral, to pay one coyote for Cecilia\u2019s transport. This new person wanted more. (One thing we learned in reporting this story is that the smuggling networks operate like a relay race, with disjointed segments handing over migrants from one region to another.)", "Ultimately I had to understand that there\u2019s a deep distrust of foreigners in rural Guatemala. Remember that many of these people do not speak Spanish, and they suffered terribly during the country\u2019s civil war. Those scars remain, so you can\u2019t just walk up to an indigenous community and expect them to tell you about the laws they broke and mafiosos they did business with. For this reason, we agreed not to use any of their last names.", "Mr. Cave: You\u2019re absolutely right about the history. This was an area where talking to strangers a generation or so ago often meant a loved one disappeared. And at times, this fear, and the desire to tell outsiders what they seemed to want to hear, was readily apparent.

I don\u2019t think she understood the risks she was taking on this trip.

They now have two enormous debts to pay off \u2014 one for Cecilia, another for her mother, Juana, who followed a few weeks later because she had not heard from her daughter and worried that she had been hurt (and that Cecilia would not be able to pay back the loan). Instead of meeting up with Cecilia, though, Juana ended up being robbed of the money she borrowed at the Guatemala-Mexico border. And this is pretty common in and around Nebaj; a lot of the money borrowed for journeys north ends up lost, with migrants robbed or just deported without ever reaching the United States.", "As I was driving back to Guatemala City, I kept thinking of Cecilia\u2019s cousin, Ana.

So she had already tried to cross the border twice in an attempt to reach her husband, who had left for the United States a few years earlier. Her coyote promised her three tries. When I left, she was planning that final attempt. I\u2019m still not sure what happened to her. What do you think will happen to Cecilia?", "Ms. Robles: Cecilia wanted a job sewing. She\u2019s really skilled at making clothes by hand. But because she\u2019s undocumented and the lady who paid for her freedom is not her legal guardian, she has not been able to register for school, never mind get a job.

It is a dystopia in which money buys everything, especially youth; the main markers for the poor are now signs of aging even more than signs of starvation. The hit man observes all this unquestioningly and takes his orders from a woman he knows mostly long distance. Since he is exceptionally crafty at executing these jobs, part of the fun is in watching him improvise. One very worthwhile detour involves his taking voice coaching to acquire a lower-class British accent so he can pose as a workman to get onto an estate outside London by claiming to be a delivery man for something called Jolly Good Fellows.

His wife was starring in the New York premiere of \u201cTough Titty,\u201d a play about coping with breast cancer written by their friend Oni Faida Lampley, who died of the disease in 2008.", "Braugher parked nearby and arrived at the end of the performance.

But he didn\u2019t mind: Brabson, who played his wife on \u201cHomicide,\u201d had paused her career to look after their sons while Braugher searched for the right show. He was happy, he said, to return the favor.", "After the performance, the three of us walked through the Village looking for a place to eat. Braugher ventured into a couple of bars. They were all too loud for him. He considered a cast member\u2019s offer to retreat to a nearby apartment for a glass of wine. First he said yes, and then he looked a little panicked and made his excuses. We settled on a generic bar raging with 20-somethings.", "\u201cI\u2019ve really been trying to break my addiction to critically acclaimed, poorly watched shows,\u201d Braugher said, sipping sparkling water. One of them, \u201cLast Resort\u201d (2012), in which Braugher played an altruistic, rogue submarine commander, couldn\u2019t figure out whether to be \u201cBand of Brothers\u201d or \u201cScandal.\u201d Another, Romano\u2019s \u201cMen of a Certain Age,\u201d was never likely to get big ratings when episodes centered on Braugher, Romano and Scott Bakula going for colonoscopies on their 50th birthdays. But he didn\u2019t want to dwell on his disappointments. In fact, it quickly became clear that Braugher would rather talk about anything other than his career. I told him I\u2019d recently had a child, and he immediately told me I needed to have another one. \u201cYou have to build a family. You\u2019ll never regret it.\u201d", "Brabson tittered. \u201cWell, we had our doubts after our first one with you traveling so much.\u201d", "Braugher looked perplexed. \u201cReally?\u201d", "It was at that moment that I remembered I\u2019d met him briefly before. We\u2019d sat across the aisle from each other on a Jet Blue flight a decade ago, and he\u2019d spent most of the flight laughing, with his arm around his eldest son.", "Braugher put up little resistance when Brabson suggested they move to New Jersey in the late \u201990s to raise their family. He never took to Hollywood, and says he rarely went out in Los Angeles. \u201cI marvel at people who have that ability to network,\u201d Braugher said. He related a story about starring with Rob Lowe in Australia in a mini-series adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s novel \u201cSalem\u2019s Lot.\u201d \u201cI remember looking at Rob and saying, \u2018Wow\u2019 \u2014 you know, he\u2019s a networker, a people person \u2014 and I said, \u2018This is amazing: we might be polar opposites.\u2019 Rob lives smack dab in the middle of the city, he\u2019s superconnected and he has that connective personality. I get invited to a thousand parties, but do I show up at them? No, I don\u2019t.\u201d", "Braugher remains intensely private. He rebuffed me when I asked if I could meet him at his Venice rental, where he stays when he is filming the show; he told me he was happy to talk, but he wouldn\u2019t give up part of his soul. About his personal life, he would only say that there had been \u201cstumbling blocks.\u201d (Braugher stopped drinking alcohol and smoking years ago.) \u201cI won\u2019t go into details, but I have not always been at the top of my game, and that has a cost.\u201d", "Braugher looked around the restaurant to see if anyone was watching and then unleashed an incandescent smile. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a memoir.\u201d", "After \u201cMen\u201d was canceled, the co-creator of \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201d Michael Schur, contacted Braugher about playing Captain Holt. Braugher was intrigued that Holt was a gay man in a stable relationship, whose sexual orientation was never played for cheap laughs. In the process of fleshing Holt out, he has wholly reimagined the trope of the humorless police chief. There\u2019s a moment in an episode last season, when the buttoned-up Holt walks in with a cast on his arm. The detectives try to guess how it happened. Peralta theorizes that he hurt his arm when he tried to smile. Holt walks over to Peralta and tells him that he sprained it in a Hula-Hoop class. He pulls out his phone to show him the evidence and says gravely: \u201cI\u2019ve learned all the moves. The pizza toss. The tornado. The scorpion. The oopsie doodle.\u201d", "Peralta looks at him with horror. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d", "Holt deletes the pictures, speaking even more slowly. \u201cBecause no one will ever believe you.\u201d", "\u201cAndre has such a fluency in the world of cop drama, and that works to his advantage,\u201d Samberg says. \u201cApplying the polish and dramatics that you would to something very serious to something very silly is a classic move that I always love.\u201d", "A week or so after Braugher\u2019s scene in the box, he and Brabson spent the morning fooling around with their sons before the makeup artists arrived to get them ready for the Emmys. It was Braugher\u2019s eighth nomination, this time for best supporting actor in a comedy. He was up against, among others, Ty Burrell of \u201cModern Family\u201d \u2014 who ended up winning \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t what was making him nervous. The host, Seth Meyers, had asked Braugher to be in a live sketch in which he had to get up from his seat and ask for the theater\u2019s bathroom key, a prospect that filled him with some of his old dread about nonscripted performances.", "\u201cI\u2019m still not a natural in front of people,\u201d Braugher told me later. \u201cI\u2019m shy. I\u2019m a hermit. But I\u2019m learning a little more; my profile is getting higher because of the show. I\u2019ve been forced to sort of step up.\u201d", "The sketch came off flawlessly. A little later, Braugher and Brabson slipped out, skipping the parties and retreating to Venice. \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d was on a weeklong hiatus, and the next day the Braugher family was heading for New Jersey, where Andre could ride his bike, tend his tomatoes and try to beat his kids at H-O-R-S-E.

The more recent parallel developments in computing power and computer networks spurred the actual revolution of Mr. Isaacson\u2019s title.

An embittered former professor, the scientist convinced a judge that Mauchly stole crucial concepts during a weekend visit in 1941 to his Iowa home. When it came to the successor to ENIAC, however, it was Mauchly\u2019s turn to cry foul. The Princeton mathematician John von Neumann consulted on the project but was vilified as \u201cstealing ideas and trying to pretend that work done at the Moore School was work he had done.\u201d", "Matters have only gotten worse since.

But experience in business and government suggests that interdisciplinary undertakings as often as not yield least common denominator pabulum. The notion that somehow in scientific domains such interactions will have talismanic results is not credible. Here Mr. Isaacson has an important insight: Collaborative teams need to have a shared objective, usually provided by a passionate and visionary leader. \u201cThe Innovators\u201d is filled with examples of once-prolific organizations like Bell Labs and the Moore School that disintegrated once it lost the leaders who defined and enforced common institutional aims.", "Mr. Isaacson\u2019s feel for the personalities involved is unfortunately not matched with a corresponding understanding of the basic economics of the businesses created.

Rather than explore the full range of innovations that have transformed the economy and society as a whole, Mr. Isaacson focuses narrowly on applications that relate to journalistic enterprises. For instance, how the emergence of cloud computing has enabled insurgents like Salesforce.com to challenge incumbent giants like Oracle is left unexplored. And within the consumer Internet, content dwarfs commerce in his telling. The rise of Amazon, eBay and Priceline, whose combined market value now exceeds a quarter trillion dollars, are mentioned in passing or not at all.

But Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, is known for patience and a willingness to experiment.", "At some point, because Amazon\u2019s data showed that Kindle owners purchased more Kindle books than they did print books, the company began selling the e-readers at cost, expecting to make a profit on e-book sales.", "That set in motion a path to domination. Today, with its latest high-end reader, the Voyage, offering a display that looks just as good as a hardcover, Amazon has vanquished just about every competing e-reader, and the Kindle has become the most triumphant and menacing brand in publishing.", "Amazon now looks to be preparing a full-scale ground invasion of the rest of the gadget landscape. In addition to a new Kindle reader, this year the company entered two new device categories, and it expanded the rest of its hardware lineup.", "Yet its strategy appears puzzling, with a lineup of tablets and other devices that sound fantastic in theory, but often fall short of greatness in real-world use.", "Amazon now makes four different kinds of devices. There are dedicated e-readers, multipurpose tablets and, starting this year, a TV streaming device and a smartphone, the Fire Phone. Just this week, Amazon introduced another streaming machine, the Fire TV Stick, a $39 gadget that is the size of a USB stick and promises to turn your television into an Amazon-powered video service.", "When you count each variation of each device, you find that Amazon, the ostensible retailer, makes more hardware products than Google does, and almost as much stuff as Apple.", "Spending time with its devices, as I did recently, offers a peek into Amazon\u2019s otherwise opaque soul. The hardware shows off Amazon\u2019s strengths in the continuing tech war between it and Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Among these strengths: Like a true retailer, Amazon appreciates the attractiveness of clever pricing strategies, and of giving customers devices that feel expensive, but aren\u2019t. Amazon, more than most rivals, also understands the value of packaging customer service with its hardware. Its high-end tablets include Mayday, a system that instantly summons a live video call with an agent who can answer most of your how-to questions \u2014 which is one of the best features on any device by any company.", "But Amazon\u2019s devices also highlight its deep weaknesses. The company seems congenitally blind to the charms of hardware and software design, and it has not yet managed to attract enough partners, including app developers, to expand the utility of its devices. It was the lack of apps, among other flaws, that doomed the Fire Phone, the device Amazon began selling with tremendous fanfare in July.

This year Amazon blessed the HDX 8.9 with a faster processor than was available in last year\u2019s model, better graphics capabilities and a surround-sound system made by Dolby. At $379, the HDX is also $120 cheaper than Apple\u2019s latest large-screen iPad.

The HDX sure is thin and light, but because it is made out of a plasticky magnesium alloy \u2014 rather than the brushed aluminum of the iPad \u2014 it feels a bit rubbery and cheap. More than that, it\u2019s undistinguished, a generic black slab. It looks more like a tablet designed by a minimalist robot than one thought up by a human.", "But the biggest problem is what to do with this device. As they become squeezed in our lives between bigger phones and better laptops, tablets have lately been suffering an identity crisis; there doesn\u2019t seem to be much to do on a high-powered tablet that you couldn\u2019t do better on a phone or computer. That problem plagues Apple\u2019s new iPads, but it\u2019s even more pronounced on a tablet like the HDX, which does not have a great bank of the latest apps to give it extra utility. As a result I mostly found myself watching Amazon\u2019s streaming movies and surfing the Web. In this way, the HDX 8.9 compares unfavorably with last year\u2019s Apple iPad Air, which is now on sale for $399 \u2014 $20 more than the HDX, but worth the price in access to a great deal more apps.", "Amazon\u2019s lower-end Kindle tablets offer a much more compelling case. The company makes six-inch and seven-inch Fire HD tablets that start at $99 and $139; for $50 more, either size comes in a \u201ckid\u2019s edition,\u201d which includes a cute rubber case, a one-year subscription to Amazon\u2019s selection of children\u2019s movies and TV shows, and a two-year, no-questions-asked replacement guarantee. There\u2019s that clever pricing strategy.", "Like the HDX, the Fire HDs are boxy and appear generic, and they do not have access to the latest apps. But for that price, it\u2019s hard to quibble with form over function. For people whose only interest in tablets is to consume media, these tablets are great deals. They are pretty speedy, they have passable interfaces, and if you are into watching TV shows and playing games, they sure get the job done.", "What is Amazon\u2019s endgame with all these devices?

Mr. Stone also invoked the much-discussed TED talk by Dan Pallotta, in which he questioned whether the cost of running a charity should be the main measure of its performance. Mr. Pallotta argued that charities should be run more like businesses, along with a similar compensation model. So the for-profit business model may be just what charities need, and Silicon Valley may be the place where it happens.", "It is easy to be cynical, especially at an event called Techmanity, about whether this is all about charity or money.", "Vivienne also talked about how she next wanted to help animals. In fact, the first campaign for the new app is for Farm Sanctuary, a charity that aims to eliminate animal cruelty in the raising of farm animals.", "Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be cynical.

The banner by the campus entranceway welcoming the Class of 2018 waved in the breeze, as if beckoning the newcomers to discover all that awaited them. All around the campus stood buildings named after women: the Margaret Clapp library, the Betsy Wood Knapp media and technology center, dorms, labs, academic halls, even the parking garage. The message that anything is possible for women was also evident at a fenced-in work site, which bore the sign \u201cElaine Construction,\u201d after a firm named for one woman and run by another.", "It was the first day of orientation, and along the picturesque paths there were cheerful upper-class student leaders providing directions and encouragement. They wore pink T-shirts stamped with this year\u2019s orientation theme: \u201cFree to Explore\u201d \u2014 an enticement that could be interpreted myriad ways, perhaps far more than the college intended. One of those T-shirted helpers was a junior named Timothy Boatwright. Like every other matriculating student at Wellesley, which is just west of Boston, Timothy was raised a girl and checked \u201cfemale\u201d when he applied. Though he had told his high-school friends that he was transgender, he did not reveal that on his application, in part because his mother helped him with it, and he didn\u2019t want her to know. Besides, he told me, \u201cit seemed awkward to write an application essay for a women\u2019s college on why you were not a woman.\u201d Like many trans students, he chose a women\u2019s college because it seemed safer physically and psychologically.", "From the start, Timothy introduced himself as \u201cmasculine-of-center genderqueer.\u201d He asked everyone at Wellesley to use male pronouns and the name Timothy, which he\u2019d chosen for himself.", "For the most part, everyone respected his request. After all, he wasn\u2019t the only trans student on campus. Some two dozen other matriculating students at Wellesley don\u2019t identify as women. Of those, a half-dozen or so were trans men, people born female who identified as men, some of whom had begun taking testosterone to change their bodies. The rest said they were transgender or genderqueer, rejecting the idea of gender entirely or identifying somewhere between female and male; many, like Timothy, called themselves transmasculine. Though his gender identity differed from that of most of his classmates, he generally felt comfortable at his new school.", "Last spring, as a sophomore, Timothy decided to run for a seat on the student-government cabinet, the highest position that an openly trans student had ever sought at Wellesley. The post he sought was multicultural affairs coordinator, or \u201cMAC,\u201d responsible for promoting \u201ca culture of diversity\u201d among students and staff and faculty members. Along with Timothy, three women of color indicated their intent to run for the seat. But when they dropped out for various unrelated reasons before the race really began, he was alone on the ballot. An anonymous lobbying effort began on Facebook, pushing students to vote \u201cabstain.\u201d Enough \u201cabstains\u201d would deny Timothy the minimum number of votes Wellesley required, forcing a new election for the seat and providing an opportunity for other candidates to come forward. The \u201cCampaign to Abstain\u201d argument was simple: Of all the people at a multiethnic women\u2019s college who could hold the school\u2019s \u201cdiversity\u201d seat, the least fitting one was a white man.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about Timothy,\u201d the student behind the Abstain campaign told me. \u201cI thought he\u2019d do a perfectly fine job, but it just felt inappropriate to have a white man there. It\u2019s not just about that position either. Having men in elected leadership positions undermines the idea of this being a place where women are the leaders.\u201d", "I asked Timothy what he thought about that argument, as we sat on a bench overlooking the tranquil lake on campus during orientation. He pointed out that he has important contributions to make to the MAC position. After all, at Wellesley, masculine-of-center students are cultural minorities; by numbers alone, they\u2019re about as minor as a minority can be. And yet Timothy said he felt conflicted about taking a leadership spot. \u201cThe patriarchy is alive and well,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to perpetuate it.\u201d", "In the 19th century, only men were admitted to most colleges and universities, so proponents of higher education for women had to build their own. The missions at these new schools both defied and reinforced the gender norms of the day. By offering women access to an education they\u2019d previously been denied, the schools\u2019 very existence was radical, but most were nevertheless premised on traditional notions: College-educated women were considered more likely to be engaging wives and better mothers, who would raise informed citizens. Over time, of course, women\u2019s colleges became more committed to preparing students for careers, but even in the early 1960s, Wellesley, for example, taught students how to get groceries into the back of a station wagon without exposing their thighs.", "By the late 1960s, however, gender norms were under scrutiny. Amid the growing awareness of civil rights and women\u2019s liberation, academic separation based on gender, as with race, seemed increasingly outdated. As a vast majority of women opted for coed schools, enrollment at women\u2019s colleges tumbled. The number of women\u2019s colleges dropped to fewer than 50 today from nearly 300.", "In response to shifting ideas about gender, many of the remaining women\u2019s colleges redefined themselves as an antidote to the sexism that feminists were increasingly identifying in society. Women\u2019s colleges argued that they offered a unique environment where every student leader was a woman, where female role models were abundant, where professors were far more likely to be women and where the message of women\u2019s empowerment pervaded academic and campus life. All that seemed to foster students\u2019 confidence. Women\u2019s colleges say their undergrads are more likely to major in fields traditionally dominated by men. Wellesley alumnae in particular are awarded more science and engineering doctorates than female graduates of any other liberal-arts college in the nation, according to government data. Its alums have become two secretaries of state; a groundbreaking string theorist; a NASA astronaut; and Korea\u2019s first female ambassador.", "As women\u2019s colleges challenged the conventions of womanhood, they drew a disproportionate number of students who identified as lesbian or bisexual. Today a small but increasing number of students at those schools do not identify as women, raising the question of what it means to be a \u201cwomen\u2019s college.\u201d Trans students are pushing their schools to play down the women-centric message. At Wellesley, Smith, Mount Holyoke and others, they and their many supporters have successfully lobbied to scrub all female references in student government constitutions, replacing them with gender-neutral language. At Wellesley, they have pressed administrators and fellow students to excise talk of sisterhood, arguing that that rhetoric, rather than being uplifting, excludes other gender minorities. At many schools, they have also taken leadership positions long filled by women: resident advisers on dorm floors, heads of student groups and members of college government. At Wellesley, one transmasculine student was a dorm president. At Mills College, a women\u2019s school in California, even the president of student government identifies as male.", "What\u2019s a women\u2019s college to do? Trans students point out that they\u2019re doing exactly what these schools encourage: breaking gender barriers, fulfilling their deepest yearnings and forging ahead even when society tries to hold them back. But yielding to their request to dilute the focus on women would undercut the identity of a women\u2019s college. While women in coed schools generally outpace men in enrollment and performance, the equation shifts after college: Recent female graduates working full time earn far less than their male counterparts, and more experienced women are often still shut out of corporate and political leadership \u2014 all of which prompts women\u2019s-college advocates to conclude that a four-year, confidence-building workshop still has its place.", "\u201cSisterhood is why I chose to go to Wellesley,\u201d said a physics major who graduated recently and asked not to be identified for fear she\u2019d be denounced for her opinion. \u201cA women\u2019s college is a place to celebrate being a woman, surrounded by women. I felt empowered by that every day. You come here thinking that every single leadership position will be held by a woman: every member of the student government, every newspaper editor, every head of the Economics Council, every head of the Society of Physics. That\u2019s an incredible thing! This is what they advertise to students. But it\u2019s no longer true. And if all that is no longer true, the intrinsic value of a women\u2019s college no longer holds.\u201d", "A few schools have formulated responses to this dilemma, albeit very different ones. Hollins University, a small women\u2019s college in Virginia, established a policy several years ago stating it would confer diplomas to only women. It also said that students who have surgery or begin hormone therapy to become men \u2014 or who legally take male names \u2014 will be \u201chelped to transfer to another institution.\u201d Mount Holyoke and Mills College, on the other hand, recently decided they will not only continue to welcome students who become trans men while at school but will also admit those who identify on their applications as trans men, noting that welcoming the former and not the latter seemed unjustifiably arbitrary.", "But most women\u2019s colleges, including Wellesley, consider only female applicants. Once individuals have enrolled and announced that they are trans, the schools, more or less, leave it to the students to work out how trans classmates fit into a women\u2019s college. Two of those students hashed it out last fall after Kaden Mohamed, then a Wellesley senior who had been taking testosterone for seven months, watched a news program on WGBH-TV about the plummeting number of women\u2019s colleges. One guest was Laura Bruno, another Wellesley senior. The other guest was the president of Regis College, a women\u2019s school that went coed in 2007 to reverse its tanking enrollment. The interviewer asked Laura to describe her experience at an \u201call-female school\u201d and to explain how that might be diminished \u201cby having men there.\u201d Laura answered, \u201cWe look around and we see only women, only people like us, leading every organization on campus, contributing to every class discussion.\u201d", "Kaden, a manager of the campus student cafe who knew Laura casually, was upset by her words. He emailed Laura and said her response was \u201cextremely disrespectful.\u201d He continued: \u201cI am not a woman. I am a trans man who is part of your graduating class, and you literally ignored my existence in your interview. . . . You had an opportunity to show people that Wellesley is a place that is complicating the meaning of being an \u2018all women\u2019s school,\u2019 and you chose instead to displace a bunch of your current and past Wellesley siblings.\u201d", "Laura apologized, saying she hadn\u2019t meant to marginalize anyone and had actually vowed beforehand not to imply that all Wellesley students were women. But she said that under pressure, she found herself in a difficult spot: How could she maintain that women\u2019s colleges would lose something precious by including men, but at the same time argue that women\u2019s colleges should accommodate students who identify as men?", "Although it may seem paradoxical, Jesse Austin said he chose to attend Wellesley because being female never felt right to him. \u201cI figured if I was any kind of woman, I\u2019d find it there. I knew Wellesley would have strong women. They produce a ton of strong women, strong in all sorts of ways.\u201d", "When Jesse arrived on campus in the fall of 2009, his name was Sara. Eighteen years old, Sara wore form-fitting shirts and snug women\u2019s jeans, because growing up in a small, conservative town in Georgia, she learned that that\u2019s what girls were supposed to do \u2014 even though she never felt like a girl. As a child, Sara had always chosen to be male characters in pretend plays, and all her friends were boys. In middle school, those boys abandoned her because she was a social liability: not feminine enough to flirt with and not masculine enough to really be one of the guys. In high school, at the urging of well-intentioned female classmates, she started wearing her hair down instead of pulled back and began dressing like they did, even though people kept pointing out that she still acted and carried herself like a boy. \u201cI had no idea that gender was something you could change,\u201d Jesse told me recently. \u201cI just thought I needed to make myself fit into these fixed places: There are boys, and there are girls. I knew I didn\u2019t fit; I just didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me.\u201d", "Around the middle of Sara\u2019s first year at Wellesley, she attended a presentation by trans alums, including one who was in the process of transitioning. As Sara listened, the gender dysphoria she\u2019d always felt suddenly made sense. \u201cIt was all so clear to me,\u201d Jesse told me. \u201cAll I needed were the words.\u201d Sara spent the next two weeks scouring the Internet for videos and information on becoming a man. She learned that unlike previous generations, today\u2019s trans young adults don\u2019t consider physical transformation a prerequisite for identity. Some use hormones; some have their breasts removed in \u201ctop\u201d surgery; some reject medical interventions altogether, as unnecessary invasions and expense. She discovered that sexual orientation is independent of gender: Some trans men are attracted to women, some to men, some to both. And she learned that trans men aren\u2019t necessarily determined to hide the fact they were raised as girls, or that they once attended a women\u2019s college.", "Soon after, Sara cut her hair short and bought her first pair of men\u2019s jeans. Sara told friends she was a man. By second semester, he was using male pronouns and calling himself Jesse, the other name his mother had considered for her daughter. He also joined a tiny campus group for students who knew or suspected they were trans men. It was called Brothers, a counterweight to the otherwise ubiquitous message of sisterhood.", "That summer, Jesse saw a gender therapist, and early in his sophomore year, he began injecting testosterone into his thigh every two weeks, making him one of the first students to medically transform into a man while at Wellesley. He became the administrator of Brothers. Though he felt supported, he also felt alone; all the other trans men on campus had graduated, and the other students in Brothers were not even sure they identified as men. Outside Brothers, everything at Wellesley was still sisterhood and female empowerment. Nevertheless, he said, \u201cI thought of Wellesley as my home, my community. I felt fine there, like I totally belonged.\u201d", "Jesse decided he wanted to have top surgery over winter break, and his parents agreed to pay for it. He returned for spring semester but only briefly, taking a sudden leave of absence to go home and help care for his ill father. When Jesse re-enrolled at Wellesley a year and a half later, in fall 2012, much had changed in Jesse and at school. Having been on testosterone for two years at that point, Jesse no longer looked like a woman trying to pass as a man. His voice was deep. His facial hair was thick, though he kept it trimmed to a stubble. His shoulders had become broad and muscular, his hips narrow, his arms and chest more defined.", "Wellesley was different, too. By then, a whole crowd of people identified as trans \u2014 enough for two trans groups. Brothers had officially become Siblings and welcomed anyone anywhere on the gender spectrum except those who identified as women. Meanwhile, Jesse and some transmasculine students continued to meet unofficially as Brothers, though Jesse was the only one on testosterone.", "Over all, campus life had a stronger trans presence than ever. At least four of the school\u2019s 70 R.A.s did not identify as women. Student organizations increasingly began meetings by asking everyone to state preferred names and pronouns. Around campus, more and more students were replacing \u201csisterhood\u201d with \u201csiblinghood\u201d in conversation. Even the school\u2019s oldest tradition, Flower Sunday \u2014 the 138-year-old ceremony that paired each incoming student with an upper-class Big Sister to support her \u2014 had become trans-inclusive. Though the school website still describes Flower Sunday as \u201ca day of sisterhood,\u201d the department that runs the event yielded to trans students\u2019 request and started referring to each participant as a Big or Little \u201cSister/Sibling\u201d \u2014 or simply as Bigs and Littles.", "And yet even with the increased visibility of trans students on campus, Jesse stood out. When he swiped his Wellesley ID card to get into friends\u2019 dorms, the groundskeepers would stop him and say, \u201cYou can\u2019t go in there without a woman to escort you.\u201d Residential directors who spotted him in the dorm stairwells told him the same thing. In his own dorm, parents who were visiting their daughters would stop him to ask why he was there. Because bathrooms in the dorms are not labeled \u201cwomen\u201d or \u201cmen\u201d but rather \u201cWellesley only\u201d and \u201cnon-Wellesley,\u201d students who didn\u2019t know Jesse would call him out for using the \u201cWellesley only\u201d bathroom instead of the one for visitors. When he tried to explain he was a Wellesley student, people sometimes thought he was lying.", "\u201cEverything felt very different than it had before,\u201d he said of that semester. \u201cI felt so distinctly male, and I felt extremely awkward. I felt like an outsider. My voice was jarring \u2014 a male voice, which is so distinct in a classroom of women \u2014 so I felt weird saying much in class. I felt much more aware of Wellesley as a women\u2019s place, even though the college was starting to change.\u201d", "Once spring semester ended, Jesse withdrew. \u201cI still think of Wellesley as a women\u2019s place, and I still think that\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t encompass me anymore. I felt it was a space I shouldn\u2019t tread in.\u201d", "Some female students, meanwhile, said Wellesley wasn\u2019t female enough. They complained among themselves and to the administration that sisterhood had been hijacked. \u201cSiblinghood,\u201d they argued, lacked the warm, pro-women connotation of \u201csisterhood,\u201d as well as its historic resonance. Others were upset that even at a women\u2019s college, women were still expected to accommodate men, ceding attention and leadership opportunities intended for women. Still others feared the changes were a step toward coeducation. Despite all that, many were uneasy: As a marginalized group fighting for respect and clout, how could women justify marginalizing others?", "\u201cI felt for the first time that something so stable about our school was about to change, and it made me scared,\u201d said Beth, a junior that year, who asked to be identified by only her middle name because she was afraid of offending people she knew. \u201cChanging \u2018sister\u2019 to \u2018sibling\u2019 didn\u2019t feel like it was including more people; it felt like it was taking something away from sisterhood, transforming our safe space for the sake of someone else. At the same time, I felt guilty feeling that way.\u201d Beth went to Kris Niendorf, the director of residential life, who listened sympathetically and then asked: Why does \u201csibling\u201d take away from your experience? After thinking about it, Beth concluded that she was connected to her classmates not because of gender but because of their shared experiences at Wellesley. \u201cThat year was an epiphany for me. I realized that if we excluded trans students, we\u2019d be fighting on the wrong team. We\u2019d be on the wrong side of history.\u201d", "Exactly how Wellesley will resolve the trans question is still unclear. Trans students say that aside from making sure every academic building on campus has a unisex bathroom, Wellesley has not addressed what gender fluidity means for Wellesley\u2019s identity. Last spring, Alex Poon won Wellesley\u2019s 131-year-old hoop-rolling race, an annual spirit-building competition among seniors. Alex\u2019s mother was the hoop-rolling champion of the Class of \u201982 and had long ago taught her daughters the ways of the hoop, on the assumption that they would one day attend her alma mater. (One of Alex\u2019s older sisters was Wellesley Class of \u201911; another went to Bryn Mawr.) Alex was a former Girl Scout who attended an all-girls high school. But unknown to his mother, he was using Google to search for an explanation for his confusing feelings. By the time Alex applied to Wellesley, he secretly knew he was trans but was nonetheless certain Wellesley was a good fit. For one thing, going there was a family tradition; for another, it was a place where gender could be reimagined. In his sophomore year at Wellesley, he went public with his transgender status.", "On hoop-rolling day, Alex \u2014 wearing a cap backward on his buzz-cut hair \u2014 broke through the finish-line streamer. President H. Kim Bottomly took a selfie with him, each with a wide smile. A small local newspaper covered the event, noting that for the first time in the school\u2019s history, the winner was a man. And yet the page on Wellesley\u2019s website devoted to school traditions continues to describe the race as if it involves only women. \u201cBack in the day, it was proclaimed that whoever won the Hoop Roll would be the first to get married. In the status-seeking 1980s, she was the first to be C.E.O. Now we just say that the winner will be the first to achieve happiness and success, whatever that means to her.\u201d But Alex isn\u2019t a her, and he told me that his happiness and success includes being recognized for what he is: a man.", "That page is not the only place on the site where Wellesley markets itself as a school of only female students. Elsewhere, it crows that \u201call the most courageous, most provocative, most accomplished people on campus are women.\u201d The student body, it says, is \u201c2,300 smart, singular women feeling the power of 2,300 smart, singular women together\u201d on a campus where \u201cour common identity, spirit and pride as Wellesley women\u201d are celebrated. Those sorts of messages, trans students say, make them feel invisible.", "\u201cI just wish the administration would at least acknowledge our existence,\u201d said Eli Cohen, a Wellesley senior who has been taking testosterone for nearly a year. \u201cI\u2019d be more O.K. with \u2018We\u2019re not going to cater to you, because men are catered to everywhere else in life,\u2019 rather than just pretending we don\u2019t exist.\u201d", "Some staff and faculty members, however, are acknowledging the trans presence. Women-and-gender-studies professors, and a handful of others, typically begin each semester asking students to indicate the names and pronouns they prefer for themselves. Kris Niendorf, director of campus and residential life, recruits trans students who want to be R.A.s., as she does with all minorities. Niendorf also initiated informational panels with trans students and alums. And before this school year began, at the urging of trans students, Niendorf required all 200 student leaders to attend a trans-sensitivity workshop focused on how to \u201ccreate a more inclusive Wellesley College.\u201d For the last few years, orientation organizers have also included a trans student as one of the half-dozen upper-class students who stand before the incoming first-years and recount how they overcame a difficult personal challenge.", "And yet many trans students feel that more needs to be done. They complain that too many professors assume all their students are women. Students provided numerous examples in courses across subject areas where they\u2019ve been asked their viewpoint \u201cas a woman.\u201d In a course on westerns two years ago, an essay assignment noted that western films and novels were aimed at male audiences and focused on masculinity. The professors asked students for their perspective \u201cas a female reader or watcher\u201d \u2014 wording that offended the three trans students in class. When a classmate pointed out the problematic wording to the professors, the instructors asked everyone instead \u201cto explore how your own gender identity changes how you approach westerns.\u201d", "At times, professors find themselves walking a fine line. Thomas Cushman, who has taught sociology at Wellesley for the last 25 years, first found out about Wellesley\u2019s trans population five years ago, after a student in one of his courses showed up at Cushman\u2019s office and introduced himself as a trans male. The student pointed out that every example Cushman gave in class referred to women, and every generic pronoun he used was female, as in \u201cAsk your classmate if she. . . . \" He told Cushman that Wellesley could no longer call itself a \u201cwomen\u2019s college,\u201d given the presence of trans men, and he asked Cushman to use male pronouns and male examples more often, so trans students didn\u2019t feel excluded. Cushman said he would abide by whatever pronoun individual students requested for themselves, but he drew the line at changing his emphasis on women.", "\u201cAll my life here,\u201d Cushman told me, \u201cI\u2019ve been compelled to use the female pronoun more generously to get away from the sexist \u2018he.\u2019 I think it\u2019s important to evoke the idea that women are part of humanity. That should be affirmed, especially after being denied for so long. Look, I teach at a women\u2019s college, so whenever I can make women\u2019s identity central to that experience, I try to do that. Being asked to change that is a bit ironic. I don\u2019t agree that this is a \u2018historically\u2019 women\u2019s college. It is still a women\u2019s college.\u201d", "On the second day of orientation this fall, Eli Cohen arrived on campus in a muscle T and men\u2019s shorts, with a carabiner full of keys hanging from his belt loop. He was elated to be back to the place that felt most like home. It was the first time in four years that Eli had not been part of orientation \u2014 first as a newcomer and then two years as an R.A. We hung out in the Lulu Chow Wang Campus Center, known affectionately as Lulu, and watched the excited first-years flutter by, clutching their orientation schedules and their newly purchased Wellesley wear.", "Just 12 days earlier, Eli underwent top surgery, which he said gave him a newfound self-assurance in his projection of manhood. It had been nine months since he started testosterone, and the effects had become particularly noticeable over the three-month summer break. His jaw line had begun to square, his limbs to thicken and the hair on his arms and legs to darken. And of course now his chest was a flat wall. As his friends caught sight of him for the first time in months, they hugged him and gushed, \u201cYou look sooo good!\u201d", "Though Eli secretly suspected in high school that he was a boy, it wasn\u2019t until after he arrived at Wellesley that he could imagine he might one day declare himself a man. By his second year, he had buzz-cut his hair and started wearing men\u2019s clothes. He asked his friends to call him Beckett, which is similar to his female birth name, which he asked me not to mention. His parents live only 14 miles away and dropped by for short visits. He left his girl nameplate on his dorm door. His friends understood that whenever his parents arrived, everyone was to revert to his female name and its attendant pronouns. He was an R.A. at the time and decided not to reveal his male name to his first-year students, figuring it was too complicated to explain which name to use when.", "Given how guarded he had to be, being Beckett was exhausting and anxiety-inducing. Demoralized, he eventually told his pals to just use his birth name. The summer after his sophomore year, he got an internship at a Boston health center serving the L.G.B.T. community, and many of his co-workers were trans. Their confidence gave him confidence. When the Wellesley office that coordinates internships sent out an email to all interns that began, \u201cGood morning, ladies . . . ,\u201d he emailed back to say he did not identify as a woman. The coordinator apologized and explained that all the names on her paperwork from Wellesley were female.", "By summer\u2019s end, he began introducing himself as Eli, a name utterly unlike his birth name. Eli mustered the courage to tell his parents. It took a little while for his mother to accept that her only daughter was actually a son, but she came around.", "When I asked Eli if trans men belonged at Wellesley, he said he felt torn. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think we have a right to women\u2019s spaces. But I\u2019m not going to transfer, because this is a place I love, a community I love. I realize that may be a little selfish. It may be a lot selfish.\u201d Where, he wondered, should Wellesley draw a line, if a line should even be drawn? At trans men? At transmasculine students? What about students who are simply questioning their gender? Shouldn\u2019t students be \u201cfree to explore\u201d without fearing their decision will make them unwelcome?", "Other trans students have struggled with these questions, too. Last December, a transmasculine Wellesley student wrote an anonymous blog post that shook the school\u2019s trans community. The student wrote to apologize for \u201cacting in the interest of preserving a hurtful system of privileging masculinity.\u201d He continued: \u201cMy feelings have changed: I do not think that trans men belong at Wellesley. . . . This doesn\u2019t mean that I think that all trans men should be kicked out of Wellesley or necessarily denied admission.\u201d He acknowledged he didn\u2019t know how Wellesley could best address the trans question, but urged fellow transmasculine classmates to \u201cstart talking, and thinking critically, about the space that we are given and occupying, and the space that we are taking from women.\u201d", "The reactions were swift and strong. \u201cA lot of trans people on campus felt emotionally unsafe,\u201d recalled Timothy, a sophomore that year. \u201cA place that seemed welcoming suddenly wasn\u2019t. The difficulty was that because it was a trans person saying it, people who don\u2019t have enough of an understanding to appreciate the nuance of this can say, \u2018Well, even a trans person says there shouldn\u2019t be trans people at Wellesley, so it\u2019s O.K. for me to think the same thing, too.\u2019 \u201d", "Students and alums \u2014 queer and straight, trans and not \u2014 weighed in, sometimes in agreement but other times in anger. Some accused the blogger of speaking on behalf of women as if they were unable to speak for themselves. Others accused him of betraying transmasculine students. (He declined to comment for this article.) But other students, including several transmasculine ones, were glad he had the courage to start a public discussion about Wellesley\u2019s deeply conflicted identity. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important conversation to have,\u201d Eli said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have this conversation without feeling hurt or hated?\u201d", "In some ways, students are already having that conversation, though perhaps indirectly. Timothy ended up easily winning his seat on the student government last spring, capturing two-thirds of the votes. Given that 85 percent of the student body cast ballots in that race, his victory suggests most students think that transmasculine students \u2014 and transmasculine leaders \u2014 belong at Wellesley.", "Another difficult conversation about trans students touches on the disproportionate attention they receive on campus. \u201cThe female-identified students somehow place more value on those students,\u201d said Rose Layton, a lesbian who said she views trans students as competitors in the campus dating scene. \u201cThey flirt with them, hook up with them. And it\u2019s not just the hetero women, but even people in the queer community. The trans men are always getting this extra bit of acknowledgment. Even though we\u2019re in a women\u2019s college, the fact is men and masculinity get more attention and more value in this social dynamic than women do.\u201d", "Jesse Austin noticed the paradox when he returned to campus with a man\u2019s build and full swath of beard stubble after nearly two years on testosterone. \u201cThat was the first time in my life I was popular! People were clamoring to date me.\u201d", "Trans bodies are seen as an in-between option, Timothy said. \u201cSo no matter your sexuality, a trans person becomes safe to flirt with, to explore with. But it\u2019s not really the person you\u2019re interested in, it\u2019s the novelty. For lesbians, there\u2019s the safety of \u2018I may be attracted to this person, but they\u2019re \u201creally\u201d a woman, so I\u2019m not actually bi or straight.\u2019 And for straight people, it\u2019s \u2018I may be attracted to a woman\u2019s body, but he\u2019s a male, so I\u2019m not really lesbian or bi.\u2019 \u201d", "Kaden Mohamed said he felt downright objectified when he returned from summer break last year, after five months of testosterone had lowered his voice, defined his arm muscles and reshaped his torso. It was attention that he had never experienced before he transitioned. But as his body changed, students he didn\u2019t even know would run their hands over his biceps. Once at the school pub, an intoxicated Wellesley woman even grabbed his crotch and that of another trans man.", "\u201cIt\u2019s this very bizarre reversal of what happens in the real world,\u201d Kaden said. \u201cIn the real world, it\u2019s women who get fetishized, catcalled, sexually harassed, grabbed. At Wellesley, it\u2019s trans men who do. If I were to go up to someone I just met and touch her body, I\u2019d get grief from the entire Wellesley community, because they\u2019d say it\u2019s assault \u2014 and it is. But for some reason, when it\u2019s done to trans men here, it doesn\u2019t get read the same way. It\u2019s like a free pass, that suddenly it\u2019s O.K. to talk about or touch someone\u2019s body as long as they\u2019re not a woman.\u201d", "While trans men are allowed at most women\u2019s colleges if they identify as female when applying, trans women \u2014 people raised male who go on to identify as women \u2014 have found it nearly impossible to get through the campus gates. Arguably, a trans woman\u2019s identity is more compatible with a women\u2019s college than a trans man\u2019s is. But most women\u2019s colleges require that all of an applicant\u2019s documentation indicate the candidate is female. That\u2019s a high bar for a 17- or 18-year-old born and raised male, given that so few come out as trans in high school. (Admissions policies at private undergraduate schools are exempt from Title IX, which bans gender discrimination at schools receiving federal funds.) Two years ago, Calliope Wong, a high-school trans woman from Connecticut, applied to Smith College, but her application was returned because her federal aid form indicated she was male. She posted the rejection letter online, catalyzing a storm on the Internet and student rallies at Smith. Smith eventually agreed to require that the applicant be referred to as female only in the transcript and recommendation letters, but not on financial-aid documents; by then, however, Wong had decided to attend the University of Connecticut.", "For its part, Wellesley has never admitted a trans woman, at least not knowingly. Many Wellesley students, including some who are uncomfortable having trans men on campus, say that academically eligible trans women should be admitted, regardless of the gender on their application documents.", "Others are wary of opening Wellesley\u2019s doors too quickly \u2014 including one of Wellesley\u2019s trans men, who asked not to be named because he knew how unpopular his stance would be. He said that Wellesley should accept only trans women who have begun sex-changing medical treatment or have legally changed their names or sex on their driver\u2019s licenses or birth certificates. \u201cI know that\u2019s a lot to ask of an 18-year-old just applying to college,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at the same time, Wellesley needs to maintain its integrity as a safe space for women. What if someone who is male-bodied comes here genuinely identified as female, and then decides after a year or two that they identify as male \u2014 and wants to stay at Wellesley? How\u2019s that different from admitting a biological male who identifies as a man? Trans men are a different case; we were raised female, we know what it\u2019s like to be treated as females and we have been discriminated against as females. We get what life has been like for women.\u201d", "In May, Mills College became the first women\u2019s college to broaden its admissions policy to include self-identified trans women, even those who haven\u2019t legally or medically transitioned and even if their transcripts or recommendation letters refer to them as male. The new policy, which begins by affirming Mills\u2019s commitment to remaining a women\u2019s college, also welcomes biological females who identify anywhere on the gender spectrum, as long as they haven\u2019t become legally male. The change grew out of two years of study by a committee of faculty and staff, which noted that Mills has always fought gender-based oppression and concluded, \u201cTrans inclusiveness represents not an erasure but an updating of this mission.\u201d", "Mills also aims to educate students, staff and faculty members to be more trans inclusive, said Brian O\u2019Rourke, who oversees enrollment at the college and was the president\u2019s liaison to the committee. I asked O\u2019Rourke if that included reducing the focus on women in the classroom. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a national speaker on trans issues join us on campus about a year ago, and one of the things she suggested is that we stop referring to Mills as a women\u2019s college, because that concept is exclusionary. In the auditorium, there was an audible gasp. We\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about how to stress women\u2019s leadership and women\u2019s empowerment and at the same time, include people who may not identify as women. The answer is: We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d", "Last month, Mount Holyoke College announced a more far-reaching policy: It would admit all academically qualified students regardless of their anatomy or self-proclaimed gender, except for those biologically male at birth who still identify as male. In a list that reflects just how much traditional notions of gender have been upended, Mount Holyoke said eligible candidates now include anyone born biologically female, whether identified as woman, man, neither or \u201cother\u201d and anyone born biologically male who identifies as a woman or \u201cother.\u201d The school president, Lynn Pasquerella, said she and her officers made the decision after concluding it was an issue of civil rights.", "But Pasquerella said accommodations for trans students will not include changing the school\u2019s mission. \u201cWe\u2019re first and foremost committed to being a women\u2019s college,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop using the language of sisterhood.\u201d She mentioned she taught a class in critical race theory two years ago and told her students, \u201cWhen I use the term \u2018sisterhood,\u2019 I\u2019m using it in a way that acknowledges the fact that not everybody here identifies as a woman. It is a rhetorical device . . . , but it is not intended to exclude anybody.\u201d", "I said her explanation seemed like the one for using \u201che\u201d as a generic pronoun for a male or female. She offered a different analogy, noting the parallel between women\u2019s colleges and historically black colleges and universities. \u201cIsn\u2019t it still legitimate to speak of being a community of color even if you have half a dozen students who aren\u2019t individuals of color?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe same might be said about women\u2019s colleges. Our mission was built upon education for women, and while we recognize that not everyone identifies this way, this is who we are and how we talk about things.\u201d", "Meanwhile, Wellesley continues to struggle with its own identity. In August, Debra DeMeis, the dean of students, told me the administration had not yet worked out how to be a women\u2019s college at a time when gender is no longer considered binary. President H. Kim Bottomly and Jennifer C. Desjarlais, the dean of admissions, declined to talk to me. But a few days after Mount Holyoke\u2019s announcement, Bottomly released a statement saying that Wellesley would begin to think about how to address the trans question.", "On the last Friday in May, some 5,000 parents, alumnae and soon-to-be graduates streamed onto the rolling field near Severance Hall, named after Elisabeth Severance, a generous 1887 alumna. It was a gorgeous, temperate morning for Wellesley\u2019s 136th annual commencement, and once the last baccalaureate degree was conferred, the audience was asked to stand. As is the school\u2019s tradition, two graduates led an uplifting rendition of \u201cAmerica, the Beautiful.\u201d The lyrics, for those who needed them, were printed in the commencement program, including the chorus: \u201cAnd crown thy good, with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea!\u201d", "Those words were penned by Katharine Lee Bates, an 1880 graduate of Wellesley who defied the expectations of her gender, and not just by becoming a professor, published author and famous poet. A pastor\u2019s daughter, she never married, living instead for 25 years with Katharine Coman, founder of Wellesley\u2019s economics department, with whom she was deeply in love. When a colleague described \u201cfree-flying spinsters\u201d as a \u201cfringe on the garment of life,\u201d Bates, then 53, answered: \u201cI always thought the fringe had the best of it.\u201d", "As parents, professors and graduates joined in the singing of Bates\u2019s most famous poem, many felt an intense pride in their connection to the graduates and this remarkable college, which has sent forth so many women who leave impressive marks on the world. As the hundreds of voices rounded the curve on \u201cAnd crown thy good with . . . ,\u201d the unknowing parents continued to \u201cbrotherhood,\u201d the word that was always supposed to stand in for women too, but never really did. Wellesley women long ago learned that words matter, and for decades, this has been the point in the song when their harmonious choral singing abruptly becomes a bellow as they belt out \u201csisterhood,\u201d drowning out the word that long excluded them and replacing it with a demand for recognition. It\u2019s one of the most powerful moments of commencement, followed every year by cheers, applause and tears, evoked by the rush of solidarity with women throughout time, and the thrill of claiming in one of the nation\u2019s most famous songs that women matter \u2014 even if the world they\u2019re about to enter doesn\u2019t always agree.", "In the last few years, a handful of graduates have changed that word once again, having decided that \u201csisterhood,\u201d no matter how well intended, is exclusionary, and so they instead call out \u201csiblinghood.\u201d A few trans men find even that insufficient, and in that instant, they roar the word that represents them best: \u201cbrotherhood,\u201d not as a sexist stand-in for all humankind, but as an appeal from a tiny minority struggling to be acknowledged.", "In truth, it\u2019s difficult to distinguish in the cacophony each of the words shouted atop one another. What is clear is that whatever word each person is hollering is immensely significant as a proclamation of existence, even if it\u2019s hard to make out what anyone else is saying."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/business/facebooks-bus-drivers-seek-union.html": ["They shuttle highly paid Facebook employees to and from the company\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley, yet many say their pay is so low that they can\u2019t afford to live in the area.

This was at Gazzaley\u2019s San Francisco lab, in a nook cluttered with multicolored skullcaps and wires that hooked up to an E.E.G. machine. The video game I was playing wasn\u2019t the sort typically pitched at kids or even middle-aged, Gen X gamers. Indeed, its intended users include people over 60 \u2014 because the game might just help fend off the mental decline that accompanies aging.", "It was awfully hard to play, even for my Call of Duty-toughened brain. Project: Evo, as the game is called, was designed to tax several mental abilities at once. As I maneuvered the surfboard down winding river pathways, I was supposed to avoid hitting the sides, which required what Gazzaley said was \u201cvisual-motor tracking.\u201d But I also had to watch out for targets: I was tasked with tapping the screen whenever a red fish jumped out of the water. The game increased in difficulty as I improved, making the river twistier and obliging me to remember turns I\u2019d taken. (These were \u201cworking-memory challenges.\u201d) Soon the targets became more confusing \u2014 I was trying to tap blue birds and green fish, but the game faked me out by mixing in green birds and blue fish. This was testing my \u201cselective attention,\u201d or how quickly I could assess a situation and react to it.", "After only two minutes of play, I was making all manner of mistakes, stabbing frantically at the wrong fish as the game sped up.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Gazzaley said, smiling broadly as he took back the iPad I was playing on. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to really push it.\u201d", "\u201cBrain training\u201d games like Project: Evo have become big business, with Americans spending an estimated $1.3 billion a year on them. They are also a source of controversy. Industry observers warn that snake-oil salesmen abound, and nearly all neuroscientists agree there\u2019s very little evidence yet that these games counter the mental deficits that come with getting older. Gazzaley, however, is something of an outlier. His work commands respect from even the harshest critics. He spent five years designing and testing the sort of game play I had just experienced, and he found that it does indeed appear to prompt older brains to perform like ones decades younger. (\u201cGame changer,\u201d the cover of Nature magazine declared when it published his findings last year.) Now Project: Evo is on its own twisty path \u2014 the Boston company that is developing it, Akili, which Gazzaley advises, is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration for the game. If it gets that government stamp, it might become a sort of cognitive Lipitor or Viagra, a game that your doctor can prescribe for your aging mind.", "In recent years, neuroscientists have begun to map, in increasing detail, just what happens as the brain ages. The picture is bleak. Beginning in our late 40s and 50s, our working memory dims, and we lose the ability to juggle simultaneous tasks. It becomes harder to screen out distractions, to stay focused while reading or shopping. Processing speed \u2014 that is, the brain\u2019s ability to react to stimuli \u2014 slows, which is one reason older people struggle to follow the speech of chattering children. Scientists have begun to trace the physical changes behind this decline. For example, the myelin sheathing that covers the brain\u2019s white matter degrades, and the brain has a harder time coordinating its different regions engaged in a mental task. This dropoff has nothing to do with Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia; this is normal aging in an otherwise healthy adult. \u201cIt\u2019s a rough life, being a nervous system over 60 or 70 years,\u201d says Jonathan King, who directs a cognitive-aging program at the National Institute on Aging.", "Since Gazzaley began his career two decades ago, in his 20s, he has been fascinated by the puzzle of aging. Back then, neuroscience was in the midst of the \u201cneuroplasticity\u201d revolution, the discovery that the mature brain can change and evolve. Scientists used to believe that once you became an adult, your brain\u2019s capabilities were fixed, like plaster. But in the 1990s and early 2000s, aided by new brain-scanning tools, they realized this wasn\u2019t true. If you start doing something that taxes your brain in productive ways, forcing it to repeatedly engage declining skills \u2014 learning a new language, for instance \u2014 those skills get measurably sharper. The problem, of course, is that most of us are pretty lazy. We\u2019re not often going to take up mentally difficult activities in our dotage.", "Video games seemed like one possible shortcut. Researchers were discovering that playing them appeared to improve some cognitive abilities in children: Avid players were better at noticing visual stimuli and shifting the focus of their attention, the very tasks that old brains find difficult.", "In 2005, Nintendo released Brain Age, a slightly tongue-in-cheek game that purported to \u201ckeep your mind in shape\u201d through a blitz of visual quizzes \u2014 like the famous Stroop Effect test, in which the word \u201cblue\u201d is printed in black, for example, and you have to correctly name the font\u2019s color. (Not as easy as it sounds.) The brain-training industry was born, and soon ads from companies like Lumosity were promising to \u201cchallenge your brain with scientifically designed training.\u201d Posit Science, a company founded by the neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, produced BrainHQ games meant to improve capacities like your \u201cuseful field of view,\u201d the scientific term for the width of your peripheral vision. (Yes, it too shrinks with age.)", "The big question about brain games is whether they sharpen everyday skills. If you regularly play a memory game \u2014 like Lumosity\u2019s version of the old classic Concentration \u2014 you\u2019ll get better at playing the game. But does it help you recall where you left your reading glasses? Does it improve your brain overall? Research has shown scant evidence of that. Even crossword puzzles \u2014 often touted as a pen-and-paper form of brain training \u2014 seem to suffer from this problem. All they do is make you better at doing crosswords.", "Gazzaley surmised that if a game prodded several different mental abilities simultaneously, learning to resolve the \u201cinterference\u201d produced by such multitasking would strengthen the brain generally. So he asked game designers from LucasArts, who made Star Wars video games, to do some freelance work for him. \u201cThey said, \u2018Well, you know, we\u2019ve been teaching teenagers how to kill aliens for almost 20 years now, and we\u2019re ready to do something different, do something of impact,\u2019 \u201d Gazzaley says.", "By 2009, their collaboration yielded NeuroRacer. A prototype of what became Project: Evo, it required players to pilot a car down a winding path at a constant speed while trying to keep from running off the road. At the same time, users had to pay attention to a stream of flashing icons and press a button on the game controller whenever a circle appeared. As you got better at playing it, the game got harder, in order to keep you at the edge of your abilities.", "To test how the game affected older minds, Gazzaley sorted 46 participants between the ages of 60 and 85 into three groups. One group played NeuroRacer three times a week for a month. Another played a simplified version without the multitasking: Players either drove the car or clicked on the circles but not both during the same game. The third group didn\u2019t play at all.", "The results were stark. Older adults who played the hardest version of NeuroRacer became very good at it \u2014 as good as 20-year-olds playing it for the first time. And crucially, there was \u201ctransfer.\u201d Standard laboratory tests used to gauge a person\u2019s working memory and ability to sustain attention showed that the NeuroRacer vets had \u201cimproved significantly.\u201d And those skills weren\u2019t the ones the game was specifically designed to focus on \u2014 their improvement was just a positive side effect. The players didn\u2019t merely become better at NeuroRacer; they also became sharper at other things. The control groups \u2014 whose members didn\u2019t play the game or who didn\u2019t drive and identify objects at the same time \u2014 didn\u2019t get the same boost. They just got older.", "Gazzaley could also see his subjects\u2019 brains change on E.E.G. readings. The electrical patterns of those who played the full NeuroRacer resembled those of 20-year-olds, just as their gaming performances had. Key measures of activity in the prefrontal cortex altered, suggesting improvement in what researchers call executive control. Measures of brain \u201ccoherence\u201d were better, too, indicating that different parts of the brain were in better communication with one another. Perhaps most remarkably, these gains held up over time. When Gazzaley brought the participants back into the lab six months later \u2014 during which time they hadn\u2019t played the game \u2014 the multitasking players still performed better on diagnostic tests than the control groups.", "The results sent a jolt through the academic-neuroscientist community. A Boston health care firm approached Gazzaley about producing a commercial version to \u201cmove this technology out of the lab into industry,\u201d he says, which led to the creation of Akili. Gazzaley embarked on fresh collaborations. One is with Zynga, the company responsible for the hit game FarmVille, which is helping design MediTrain, a game that promotes \u201cmindfulness\u201d meditation techniques.", "The lab where Gazzaley works is like a child\u2019s fantasy version of a research facility. There\u2019s a mood-lit game-playing room with a lipstick red chair and an 85-inch plasma TV, \u201cthe biggest, highest-quality TV you can buy.\u201d When I visited the place earlier this month, his 24-year-old research associate, Cammie Rolle, jumped and waved her arms in front of the screen, as if doing aerobics. An Xbox Kinect camera tracked her movements as she played Gazzaley\u2019s new game, Body Brain Trainer. Each jerk and leap controlled a horse on the screen, as she tried to avoid obstacles and lunged toward targets (vegetables and colors, in this case). The goal, Gazzaley said, was to see how physical activity might influence mental training. He hopes that forcing subjects to coordinate physical movements with mental pattern-matching will generate the sort of productive interference that, as in the case of NeuroRacer, strengthens multitasking and executive control.", "\u201cWe think the embodied cognition will create a faster learning curve,\u201d he said. It was certainly a workout. After two minutes of jumping and dodging, Rolle\u2019s heart rate was over 140. They won\u2019t know if it improved her brain, though, for another year.", "As eager as Gazzaley is to promote his research, he is also reflexively cautious.

The published research is a grab bag of contradictory findings: Some experiments find minimal improvements, others none. Often studies test games with such different emphases \u2014 working memory, field of view or mental speed \u2014 that the results can\u2019t be compared meaningfully. Findings from experiments with subjects who have conditions like A.D.D. don\u2019t necessarily apply to the elderly.

App stores are littered with brazen claims \u2014 Elevate-Brain Training, for example, is \u201cbased on extensive research.\u201d Ulman Lindenberger, a director at the Max Planck Institute, recently published a study that found that 100 days of cognitive training yielded a \u201crelatively minor\u201d improvement in working memory. Soon afterward, a German brain-training firm cited his paper on its website, despite the lack of any connection between his research and its product. The company even appropriated the Max Planck logo.", "This month, an international group of 30 scientists \u2014 including Lindenberger \u2014 became so fed up that they issued \u201cThe Consensus on the Brain Training Industry From the Scientific Community,\u201d a withering statement denouncing the hype by both companies and media. \u201cClaims promoting brain games,\u201d they wrote, \u201care frequently exaggerated and at times outright misleading.\u201d One of the group\u2019s organizers, Laura Carstensen, the director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, says, \u201cI started just feeling like we were obligated \u2014 we the scientific community in the aging world \u2014 to say something and to not just sit by and have this go on.\u201d She is particularly enraged by claims that games can forestall Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cI find that unconscionable, because there\u2019s zero evidence for that, and it is on top of the list of aging people\u2019s fears.\u201d Carstensen has heard from older people who assumed the games\u2019 benefits were proven, as well as from poor patients who were forgoing other daily items to pay monthly subscription fees for brain games.", "Carstensen and her colleagues recommend that people adopt more healthful habits, including regular physical activity, because a weak cardiovascular system limits blood flow to the brain. Active efforts to master new skills \u2014 a new sport, another language \u2014 may help, as does an active social life. None of these techniques, of course, have million-dollar industries intent on proving they\u2019re good for our brains.", "That said, Carstensen and other skeptics do not dismiss brain training entirely. If you\u2019re playing these games in moderation, they say, there isn\u2019t any harm. And maybe they help. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly possible that if you do this for some time that you will see some changes in your brain,\u201d Lindenberger says. \u201cI mean, why not?\u201d They all want to see more rigorous research done, and many cite Gazzaley\u2019s work as a model.", "Gazzaley himself signed the letter, though he pushed the group to use less pessimistic rhetoric. \u201cI really was a pain,\u201d he says. One concern was that excessively negative statements might scare off research-funding agencies. \u201cDo we really want to sabotage this?\u201d he asked them. \u201cDoes anyone actually think there\u2019s nothing here? My view is that from the work that we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s a signal. I\u2019m a cautious optimist.

Yet when it comes to his own BrainHQ games, Merzenich confidently argues that they are proven to work, noting that they have been used in many more studies than his competitors\u2019 products. \u201cFor a lot of people, in the state they\u2019re in, sitting down in front of your iPad or computer can save their bacon,\u201d he says. He too recommends leading an active life but says that \u201cfor time spent, there\u2019s nothing more efficient for driving neurological change\u201d than his games. His views make Merzenich a polarizing character in the field.

Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly, or Active, began in 1999 with nearly 3,000 healthy older adults. One group of the subjects played a crude speed-of-processing computer game, originally developed by Karlene Ball, the chairwoman of the psychology department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and later acquired by Posit Science. It flashed pictures for shorter and shorter durations and challenged players to identify them. These subjects received a total of only about 10 hours\u2019 worth of training over five weeks, with a few hours of follow-up \u201cbooster\u201d training nearly a year later and then again three years after that.", "Yet the benefits seemed to hold up.

If users forget to take their pills on time, LEDs in the bottle cap might light up as a reminder; if it goes unopened for hours, the bottle sends an alert by email or text. A 2010 trial found that users of these smart bottles had a 98 percent rate of taking meds on time, compared with 71 percent in a control group.

As a Bloomberg Businessweek cover put it this spring, \u201cFreeze Your Eggs, Free Your Career.\u201d (That assumes women don\u2019t land that family-unfriendly dream job after the eggs thaw.)", "There are no official statistics on how many women have undergone the procedure, but two of the country\u2019s oldest and largest programs \u2014 Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York in Manhattan and New York University Langone Medical Center \u2014 report that their cases have more than doubled in the last two years and that the age of the average freezer has dropped to about 36 from 39 nearly a decade ago. Other doctors say they\u2019ve seen a stream of even younger patients, some in their 20s.", "This is a positive development, since doctors have long urged women to freeze by their mid-30s, rather than wait until their egg quality is deteriorating. More women will have the option, as other companies surely follow Facebook and Apple\u2019s example, and as prices continue to drop. The cost of stimulating one\u2019s ovaries and surgically extracting anywhere from six to 10 eggs is typically around $10,000. Many clinics offer lower fees or multi-cycle discounts, and one of the biggest centers charges $12,500 for up to four cycles or 20 eggs, whichever comes first. But even with that many eggs, there\u2019s no guarantee.", "Women who are anxious to preserve their fertility during their prime baby-making years should take advantage of every opportunity to freeze. But despite egg freezing\u2019s new cool factor, they should never forget its power to disappoint."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/opinion/joe-nocera-amazon-plays-rough-so-what.html": ["Is Amazon a monopoly?", "That certainly is what Franklin Foer, the editor of The New Republic, thinks. In the magazine\u2019s current issue, he has written a lengthy polemic denouncing the company for all manner of sins. The headline reads: \u201cAmazon Must Be Stopped.\u201d", "\u201cShopping on Amazon,\u201d he writes, \u201chas so ingrained itself in modern American life that it has become something close to our unthinking habit, and the company has achieved a level of dominance that merits the application of a very old label: monopoly.\u201d", "Foer\u2019s brief is that Amazon undercuts competitors so ruthlessly and squeezes suppliers so brutally \u2014 \u201cin its pursuit of bigness\u201d \u2014 that it has become \u201chighly worrisome.\u201d Its founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, \u201cborrowed his personal style from the parsimonious Sam Walton,\u201d the founder of (shudder) Walmart, and Foer notes that pushing suppliers has always been the key to Walmart\u2019s low prices, just as it is for Amazon\u2019s.", "But, he says, when Amazon does it, the effect is somehow \u201cdarker.\u201d Why? Because \u201cwithout the constraints of brick and mortar, it considers nothing too remote from its core business, so it has grown to sell server space to the C.I.A., produce original television shows about bumbling congressmen, and engineer its own line of mobile phones.\u201d What, precisely, is darker about making TV shows about bumbling congressmen is left unsaid.", "And then, of course, there is the book business, which Amazon most certainly dominates, with 67 percent of the e-book market and 41 percent of the overall book market, by some estimates. Foer devotes a big chunk of his essay to Amazon\u2019s ongoing efforts to \u201cdisintermediate\u201d the book business, most vividly on display in its current battle over e-book pricing with Hachette, in which it is punishing Hachette by putting its books at a disadvantage on its website compared with other publishers\u2019 books. Foer worries about what Amazon\u2019s tactics will ultimately mean for book advances. And he fears that books will become commoditized \u2014 \u201cdeflating Salman Rushdie and Jennifer Egan novels to the price of a Diet Coke.\u201d", "What he doesn\u2019t say \u2014 because he can\u2019t \u2014 is that Amazon is in clear violation of the country\u2019s antitrust laws. As Annie Lowrey and Matthew Yglesias both pointed out in blog posts (at New York magazine and Vox respectively), there is no possible way Amazon can legitimately be called a monopoly. Lowrey notes that Amazon\u2019s sales amount to only \u201cabout 15 percent of total e-commerce sales.\u201d Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales are growing at least as fast as Amazon\u2019s. Meanwhile, as Yglesias points out, Amazon has to compete with far larger rivals, including not just Walmart, but Target and Home Depot in the brick-and-mortar world, and Google and Apple in the digital universe.", "The truth is that American antitrust law is simply not very concerned with the fate of competitors. What it cares about is whether harm is being done to consumers. Walmart has squashed many more small competitors than Amazon ever will, with nary a peep from the antitrust police. Even in the one business Amazon does dominate \u2014 books \u2014 it earned its market share fair and square, by, among other things, inventing the first truly commercially successful e-reader. Even now, most people turn to Amazon for e-books not because there are no alternatives but because its service is superior.", "\u201cIn confronting what to do about Amazon,\u201d Foer writes as his essay nears its conclusion, \u201cfirst we have to realize our own complicity. We\u2019ve all been seduced by the deep discounts, the monthly automatic diaper delivery, the free Prime movies, the gift wrapping, the free two-day shipping, the ability to buy shoes or books or pinto beans or a toilet all from the same place.\u201d", "Our complicity? In fact, in its two decades of life, Amazon has redefined customer service in a way that has delighted people and caused them to return to the site again and again. Does Amazon have a dark side? Yes, it does \u2014 primarily in the way it has historically treated its warehouse workers. But to say that Amazon has to be stopped because it is giving people what they want is to misunderstand the nature of capitalism.", "Let\u2019s be honest here: The intelligentsia is focused on Amazon not because it sells pinto beans or toilets, but because it sells books. That\u2019s their business. Amazon is changing the book industry in ways that threaten to diminish the role of publishers and traditional ways of publishing. Its battle with Hachette is a battle over control. It\u2019s not terribly different from the forces that ultimately disintermediated the music business.", "As an author, I\u2019m rooting for Hachette. The old system \u2014 in which the writer gets an advance, and the publisher markets the final product \u2014 works for me, as it does for most writers of serious nonfiction.", "But, am I going to stop using Amazon?

For many people it\u2019s also a to-do list and quasi-calendar, the central planner and task manager for your day. And though it is tremendously useful and will never die, email is also, for many people, completely annoying.", "So the Gmail team decided to rethink email. \u201cWe decided, \u2018What if we cleared our minds, started fresh, and built something new to help people get back to what mattered to them?\u2019\u201d said Alex Gawley, Gmail\u2019s product director, in an interview at Google\u2019s headquarters. \u201cWhat if we did more of the work for them?\u201d", "The program that Mr. Gawley and his team have come up with is Inbox, and Google on Wednesday plans to release a version for Android, iOS devices and the web on an invitation-only basis.

You\u2019ll sign into Inbox with your Gmail account and you\u2019ll see all your old messages there, and much of what you do in Inbox will be reflected in Gmail. But Google expects most people to use Inbox or Gmail, not both. In fact, both Mr. Gawley and Jason Cornwell, Gmail\u2019s lead designer, say they get their mail through Inbox, not Gmail.", "Google showed me an in-depth demo of Inbox, but I wasn\u2019t given a chance to use it on my own email. What I saw of it looked interesting. Inbox replaces email\u2019s familiar main screen \u2014 a list of subject lines and senders \u2014 with more thoughtfully designed previews of messages that share the overall aesthetic of a social-networking feed. When your friend sends you some photos, you see the pictures right on the main screen, and you can flip through and dismiss them without going into the message. ", "Inbox also relies on Google\u2019s data-mining prowess to improve these highlights. For instance, instead of showing you a message from your airline about your flight, it shows you real-time information about that flight gathered from the web. When you click on the highlight, you can always see the underlying message, but if the software does its job well, you won\u2019t have to click on the message.", "Finally, Inbox functions as a to-do list. You can create tasks and reminders that appear in your inbox alongside your messages. The tasks are super smart, pulling in relevant data to make them useful. If you type \u201ccall my dentist,\u201d it might populate the task with your dentist\u2019s phone number and only her office hours.", "Some of these features aren\u2019t completely novel. Inbox requires a series of gestures to navigate and sort your messages, a system that feels similar to that of Mailbox, an email start-up that was bought by Dropbox.

There was the muckraker Lincoln Steffens, who called himself a \u201cgraft philosopher\u201d as he traveled from city to city studying political machines at the turn of the last century. There was the historian Matthew Josephson, whose 1938 masterpiece, \u201cThe Politicos,\u201d traced the marriage of money with politics from its dalliances during the Grant administration until its final, grotesque consummation in William McKinley\u2019s electoral triumph of 1896.", "And now comes Zephyr Teachout, a professor at Fordham University Law School and a candidate in this year\u2019s Democratic primary for governor of New York. Her entry into the field, \u201cCorruption in America,\u201d includes plenty of the juicy stories that make the genre so much fun to read. We learn, for example, about a diamond-studded snuffbox that Louis XVI gave Benjamin Franklin, then our ambassador to France, and how the Revolutionary generation regarded this gift \u2014 the result of a noncontroversial custom in Europe \u2014 as a possible threat to republican virtue. We read about an officer of the Turkish government in the 1870s who agreed to sell the products of an American arms manufacturer to his government in exchange for a small consideration, and who then, having duly moved the units, went to court to have the deal enforced. Good stuff, all of it. You have probably heard pundits say we are living in an age of \u201clegalized bribery\u201d; \u201cCorruption in America\u201d is the book that makes their case in careful detail.", "As you might have guessed, Teachout\u2019s main target is the currently reigning money-in-politics doctrine of the Supreme Court, as defined mainly by Citizens United, the 2010 decision that struck down certain restrictions on political spending by corporations. Today\u2019s court understands \u201ccorruption\u201d as a remarkably rare malady, a straight-up exchange of money for official acts. Any definition broader than that, the justices say, transgresses the all-important First Amendment. Besides, as Justice Anthony Kennedy announced in the Citizens United decision, the court now knows that \u201cindependent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption\u201d \u2014 a statement that I guess makes sense somehow in law-land but sounds to the layman\u2019s ear like the patter of a man who has come unzipped from reality.", "The first few American generations, Teachout reminds us, saw things very differently; for them, corruption was a \u201cnational fixation.\u201d Drawing on Montesquieu and their understanding of ancient history, the founders fretted about the countless ways a republic might be undone from within. \u201cThey saw their task this way,\u201d Teachout writes: \u201cHow could they create a system that would be most likely to be filled with men of civic virtue but avoid creating temptations that might corrode that virtue?\u201d Their answer was to build structural barriers keeping public and personal interests separated, without getting lost in considerations of whether a forbidden activity did or did not amount to what our current court calls a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d", "The dings and the dents in their grand design started appearing almost immediately. In 1795, it was discovered that members of the Georgia Legislature had been bribed to hand over enormous stretches of land to speculators. The guilty were promptly booted from office, but then things got complicated. Was it possible for a state to take back land that a corrupt but duly elected legislature had given away? The Supreme Court eventually decided it wasn\u2019t \u2014 corruption was just too hard to define.", "And so have the debates gone, right down to our own day. We think of all the laws passed over the years to restrict money in politics \u2014 and of all the ways the money has flowed under and around those restrictions. And finally, it seems to me, we just gave up out of sheer exhaustion.", "According to Teachout, however, it\u2019s much worse than this. Our current Supreme Court, in Citizens United, \u201ctook that which had been named corrupt for over 200 years\u201d \u2014 which is to say, gifts to politicians \u2014 \u201cand renamed it legitimate.\u201d Teachout does not exaggerate. Here is Justice Kennedy again, in the Citizens United decision: \u201cThe censorship we now confront is vast in its reach. The government has \u2018muffle[d] the voices that best represent the most significant segments of the economy.\u2019 \u201d", "You read that right: The economy needs to be represented in democratic politics, or at least the economy\u2019s \u201cmost significant segments,\u201d whatever those are, and therefore corporate \u201cspeech,\u201d meaning gifts, ought not to be censored. Corporations now possess the rights that the founders reserved for citizens, and as Teachout explains, what used to be called \u201ccorruption becomes democratic responsiveness.\u201d", "Let me pause here to take note of another recurring peculiarity in corruption literature: an eerie overlap between theory and practice. If you go back to that \u201ccensorship\u201d quotation from Kennedy, you will notice he quotes someone else: his colleague Antonin Scalia, in an opinion from 2003. Google the quote and one place you\u2019ll find it is in a book of Scalia\u2019s opinions that was edited in 2004 by none other than the lobbyist Kevin Ring, an associate of Jack Abramoff who would later be convicted of corrupting public officials.", "As it happens, Teachout gives us a long and savory chapter on the legal history of lobbying. Once upon a time, lobbying was regarded as obviously perfidious; in California it was a felony; and contracts to lobby were regarded as reprehensible by the Supreme Court. Here is a justice of that body in the year 1854, delivering the court\u2019s decision in a case concerning lobbyists and lobbying contracts:", "\u201cThe use of such means and such agents will have the effect to subject the state governments to the combined capital of wealthy corporations, and produce universal corruption, commencing with the representative and ending with the elector. Speculators in legislation, public and private, a compact corps of venal solicitors, vending their secret influences, will infest the capital of the Union and of every state, till corruption shall become the normal condition of the body politic, and it will be said of us as of Rome \u2014 omne Romae venale.\u201d", "Well, folks, it happened all right, just as predicted. State governments subject to wealthy corporations? Check. Speculators in legislation, infesting the capital? They call it K Street. And that fancy Latin remark about Rome? They do say that of us today. Just turn on your TV sometime and let the cynicism flow.", "And all of it has happened, Teachout admonishes, because the founders\u2019 understanding of corruption has been methodically taken apart by a Supreme Court that cynically pretends to worship the founders\u2019 every word. \u201cWe could lose our democracy in the process,\u201d Teachout warns, a bit of hyperbole that maybe it\u2019s time to start taking seriously.", "CORRUPTION IN AMERICA\nFrom Benjamin Franklin\u2019s Snuff Boxto Citizens United\nBy Zephyr Teachout\n376 pp. Harvard University Press. $29.95."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/apples-ipad-problem-does-anyone-really-need-a-pricey-tablet/": ["What\u2019s the point of an iPad?

Apple will also probably add its Touch ID fingerprint scanner and Apple Pay, its online payment system, to the tablets. But are these features enough to give new life to the iPad?", "That remains a tricky question. Apple\u2019s iPad business is huge, and it isn\u2019t on the verge of death. Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst, has pointed out that Apple\u2019s iPad revenue exceeds $30 billion a year, a business bigger than McDonald\u2019s. But Apple reported slight declines in iPad sales in its last two quarterly earnings reports. That is a vivid contrast from just a few years ago, when the iPad line was growing faster than the iPhone, and it seemed poised to become Apple\u2019s next big thing. What happened?", "Many things. The iPad, which was always an in-between device, is under attack from all sides. Phones have become much more capable in the last few years, and much bigger, so the iPad seems superfluous. Meanwhile, most laptops are far cheaper than the iPad, and many are nearly as thin and light, too. Apple\u2019s rivals have also figured out ways to make pretty good tablets for little money. If you use your tablet mainly for watching media, for instance, Amazon will sell you a very good one that does just that for less than $100.

I know many people who love their iPads, but I\u2019ve heard from readers and friends who say their iPads just aren\u2019t as useful as other devices they carry. Sammy the Walrus IV, a clever, pseudonymous technology analyst who writes the blog AAPL Orchard, pointed out recently that part of the problem was the lack of innovation in iPad apps.

With the strain of romanticism that unites so many of the scientists that this book celebrates, he equates the postwar era with Wordsworth\u2019s description of those who witnessed the start of the French Revolution: \u201cBliss was it in that dawn to be alive.\u201d", "He also grew up just as the Computer Age began to explode. So he has aural, tactile experience of computer kits that had to be assembled at home, the punch cards needed to run room-size computers at college and the screeches of the first modems via telephone line. By the 1990s, he was helping to run a digital division at Time. A decade later, he was writing books, and his best work as a biographer reveals where his heart lies. \u201cEinstein: His Life and Universe,\u201d from 2007, is the most supercharged of his biographies, although he admitted to having difficulty explaining the physics.

He means to trace two parallel developments: the very different histories of the computing machine and the much more recent Internet. And he takes the computer back to when it was a gleam in the eye of Lord Byron, the poet. Byron is in here for two reasons. He was famously present when Mary Shelley conceived of \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d with its prospect of a man-made machine that might develop its own thoughts. But Byron\u2019s real gleam was his only legitimate child, the daughter who would become known as Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, born in 1815.", "Ada Lovelace\u2019s mid-19th-century writings were so brilliantly visionary about the potential of a general-purpose computer that she is acknowledged as a major tech-world hero. The United States Defense Department named a computer language after her; there is an Ada Lovelace Day in October (this year it falls on the 14th), a nifty Ada Lovelace Google Doodle and many books about her, including \u201cAda\u2019s Algorithm,\u201d a new biography by James Essinger, to be published on Ada Day his month. Most of this information can be found on Wikipedia, which was jump-started by Jimmy Wales, who named a daughter Ada in 2011.", "If there is one vital point to which Mr. Isaacson keeps returning throughout this linear and elegantly streamlined book, it is that no one individual, not even Mr. Wales, has truly achieved anything alone. All advances require genius, practicality and entrepreneurial ability, skills that don\u2019t necessarily come in the same package. Time after time, Mr. Isaacson reports stories in which the most advanced work is outrun by cannier innovators who pay attention to things like patents, or who think about the practical applications of the things they have devised.", "This book is slightly slow going at first, when its emphasis is on incremental advances through dated (although amazing) devices like the programmable weaving loom. Still, Mr. Isaacson\u2019s gifts as an enthusiast and explicator remain impressive. Treat Boolean algebra as a matter of either/or choices that can be executed by electrical circuits, and you move less dauntingly into the pioneering work being done at Bell Labs, Harvard and, most notably, Iowa State University, where a lone academic named John Vincent Atanasoff had by 1942 built a nearly functional prototype of a computer.", "But Atanasoff, in a mistake oft repeated here, didn\u2019t do much to protect his creation\u2019s future. He tried to patent it, but only casually. He allowed himself to be visited by John Mauchly, a more gregarious scientist who later appropriated parts of what he saw in Iowa and would go down in history as one of the computer\u2019s first inventors. Meanwhile, Atanasoff was drafted into the Navy in 1942 and left behind his machine, which was dismantled when storage space was needed. \u201cHis tale is evidence that we shouldn\u2019t in fact romanticize such loners,\u201d Mr. Isaacson says firmly.", "So this book leans far more heavily toward success stories. Some of the best of these feature women, including early programmers working frantically during World War II, like Grace Hopper, whose team achieved many great accomplishments and one unforgettable small one. The moth that got caught in one of its electromechanical relays associated computers with the term \u201cbug\u201d forevermore.", "As the book gallops forward, Mr. Isaacson must combine the good, the great and the ugly. They all figure in the story of the transistor, which featured William Shockley, the scientist who first saw the potential in silicon and became a Silicon Valley pioneer \u2014 but is now remembered for the racist theories that clouded his legacy. His work on the semiconductor, with two powerful collaborators, would never have led to such household popularity had there not been a Steve Jobs-like figure (Pat Haggerty at Texas Instruments, who shared Jobs\u2019s ability to sell products people had no idea they wanted) to put these brand-new devices, now called transistors, into radios, and truly rock the American teenager\u2019s world.", "The further \u201cThe Innovators\u201d goes, the more familiar its material is to the present-day reader. And the more interesting its exclusions become. When Mr. Isaacson gets to the Microsoft, Apple and Google eras, he mentions venture capitalists only when necessary and does not dwell on the huge amounts of money that came to complicate the joys of invention. And whether for aesthetic or moral reasons, social media are entirely absent from this book\u2019s timeline. Among possible future biographical subjects, Sergey Brin and Larry Page of Google are clearly the characters whom he finds most simpatico, and they could do worse than to have Mr. Isaacson tell their story. As this book so clearly demonstrates, he is a kindred spirit to the visionaries and enthusiasts who speed us so thrillingly into the technological future.", "THE INNOVATORS\nHow a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution\nBy Walter Isaacson\nIllustrated. 542 pages.

The literature, poetry and music of the time an artist was working, and short commentaries by curators, could be presented as audio clips.", "The goal of such technology, Ms. Stockmann said, is to \u201cgive you more points of access into the artwork, so that it keeps you in the moment of looking, almost as if someone is guiding you through the painting or sculpture.\u201d", "One futuristic vision, put simply, is of a digital docent.

As platforms, the thinking goes, they are just connectors, with no responsibility for what happens there.", "For websites, this is codified in law \u2014 they are not legally responsible for what their users publish, according to the Communications Decency Act, perhaps the most influential law in the development of the web. That is why Yelp avoids liability when people post inaccurate or abusive restaurant reviews, and why YouTube does not have to remove videos that some find offensive.", "The law protects online speech, not actions people take in the offline world. Yet its ethos has permeated Silicon Valley so deeply that people invoke it even for things that happen offline.", "\u201cThese folks grew up in a world where platforms are not responsible, and then when they go do stuff in the real world, they expect that to be the case,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington law school who studies cyber law.", "Take Airbnb\u2019s terms of service. \u201cAirbnb provides an online platform that connects hosts who have accommodations to rent with guests seeking to rent such accommodations,\u201d it says. \u201cAirbnb has no control over the conduct\u201d of hosts or guests, the terms continue, and \u201cdisclaims all liability in this regard.\u201d", "Yet it is one thing to say a company has no control over the conduct of online commenters, and another when its users are in people\u2019s homes or cars. Airbnb, like others, has been forced to learn the limits of its status as a platform. In response to reports of renters\u2019 damaging and ransacking homes, it added a round-the-clock hotline for people in unsafe situations and a policy covering $1 million in loss or damages.", "The second web business principle is to minimize the number of paid on-staff employees. Tech companies have long shunned the idea of hiring lots of sales staffers or call-center workers. Instead they automate ad sales with auction algorithms or offer help forums where other customers offer advice on their sites. When Instagram was acquired by Facebook, it employed 13 people; Kodak, in its heyday, employed more than 140,000.", "That mentality may be why new on-demand companies are running into trouble with workers. Most of these companies avoid having employees by using contract workers. But some are wondering whether the companies are pushing the definition of contract worker too far. Uber drivers have filed class-action lawsuits in Massachusetts and California, and advocates are pushing for things like benefits and disability compensation for workers at many start-ups.", "The third related principle is to automate everything \u2014 whether selling ads, flagging inappropriate content or assessing employee performance. That notion also meets its limits in the real world. When Brian Chesky, the co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, responded to complaints about vandalism, he emphasized that Airbnb had \u201calgorithms that identify suspicious behavior.\u201d That\u2019s nice, yet algorithms, when people\u2019s safety and well-being are involved, are not enough. Airbnb said it combined automation and human involvement with 100 people who reviewed suspicious activity.", "The belief that problems can be solved without involving people is probably why many of these companies did not meet with regulators and officials before starting services in new cities. And it has come back to haunt them. Luther Lowe, director of public policy at Yelp, had some basic advice for Uber that could apply to Airbnb, Lyft and others: Hire a lobbyist and meet with the mayor and the city council before setting up shop.", "Uber seemed to put that lesson into practice in August when it hired David Plouffe, an expert in grass-roots campaigning and the manager of President Obama\u2019s winning run in 2008, as a senior policy and strategy executive. \u201cOur roots are technology, not politics,\u201d Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, wrote about the hire. \u201cThe result is that not enough people here in America and around the world know our story, our mission and the positive impact we\u2019re having.\u201d", "DESPITE these three major differences between web companies and the ones that bridge the digital and physical worlds, they all share another guiding Silicon Valley principle: the belief that if enough people want to use a product, the company will succeed.", "Web companies like Google and Twitter grew as quickly as they could, trusting that they would figure out how to make money later. Business software companies hope that if employees start using a new software tool at work, the I.T. department will give in.

Banks offered Apple a lower rate for credit card transactions than usual, hoping that Apple users will supply them with more transactions.", "\u201cI would be very, very surprised if Jean Tirole\u2019s work was not sitting at the hearts of the people advising Apple and certainly MasterCard, Visa and American Express about how to think about that world,\u201d said Joshua Gans, a professor at University of Toronto who blogs about competition in the digital age.", "For regulators, tech companies have been a riddle in part because they do not follow the behavior of typical monopolies: Many do not charge for their products, and companies that offer entirely different products are nonetheless competitors.

There is no better way to get secular Iraqi and Syrian Sunnis to fuse with ISIS than have America bomb them all.", "ISIS needs to be contained before it destabilizes islands of decency like Jordan, Kurdistan and Lebanon. But destroying it? That will be hard, because it\u2019s not just riding on some jihadist caliphate fantasy, but also on deep Sunni nationalist grievances. Separating the two is the best way to defeat ISIS, but the only way to separate mainstream Sunnis from jihadists is for mainstream Sunnis and Shiites to share power, to build a healthy interdependency from what is now an unhealthy one.

So Baran dreamed up a less vulnerable alternative: a decentralized network that resembled a vast fishnet, with an array of small nodes that were each linked to a few others. These nodes could not only receive signals but also route them along to their neighbors, thereby creating countless possible paths for data to keep flowing should part of the network be destroyed.

Few authors are more adept at translating technical jargon into graceful prose, or at illustrating how hubris and greed can cause geniuses to lose their way.", "Having chosen such an ambitious project to follow his 2011 biography of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Isaacson is wise to employ a linear structure that gives \u201cThe Innovators\u201d a natural sense of momentum. The book begins in the 1830s with the prescient Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron\u2019s mathematically gifted daughter, who envisioned a machine that could perform varied tasks in response to different algorithmic instructions. (Isaacson takes pains throughout to salute the unheralded contributions of female programmers.) The story then skips ahead to the eve of World War II, when engineers scrambled to build machines capable of calculating the trajectories of missiles and shells. One of these inventors was John Mauchly, a driven young professor at Ursinus College. In June 1941, he paid a visit to Ames, Iowa, where an electrical engineer named John Atanasoff had cobbled together an electronic calculator \u201cthat could process and store data at a cost of only $2 per digit\u201d \u2014 a seemingly magical feat. Against the advice of his wife, who suspected that Mauchly was a snake, Atanasoff proudly showed off his ragtag creation. Soon thereafter, Mauchly incorporated some of Atanasoff\u2019s ideas into Eniac, the 27-ton machine widely hailed as the world\u2019s first true computer. The bitter patent fight that ensued would last until 1973, with Atanasoff emerging victorious.", "Mauchly is often demonized for stealing from that most romantic of tech archetypes, the \u201clone tinkerer in a basement\u201d who sketched out brainstorms on cocktail napkins. But Isaacson contends that men like Atanasoff receive too much adulation, for an ingenious idea is worthless unless it can be executed on a massive scale. If Mauchly hadn\u2019t come to Iowa to \u201cborrow\u201d his work, Atanasoff would have been \u201ca forgotten historical footnote\u201d rather than a venerated father of modern computing.", "Isaacson is not nearly as sympathetic in discussing the sins of William Shockley, who shared a 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for co-inventing the transistor. Shockley is the book\u2019s arch-villain, a glory hog whose paranoid tendencies destroyed the company that bore his name. (He once forced all his employees to take lie-detector tests to determine if someone had sabotaged the office.) His eight best researchers quit and went on to found Fairchild Semiconductor, arguably the most seminal company in digital history; Shockley, meanwhile, devolved into a raving proponent of odious theories about race and intelligence.", "The digital revolution germinated not only at button-down Silicon Valley firms like Fairchild, but also in the hippie enclaves up the road in San Francisco. The intellectually curious denizens of these communities \u201cshared a resistance to power elites and a desire to control their own access to information.\u201d Their freewheeling culture would give rise to the personal computer, the laptop and the concept of the Internet as a tool for the Everyman rather than scientists. Though Isaacson is clearly fond of these unconventional souls, his description of their world suffers from a certain anthropological detachment. Perhaps because he\u2019s accustomed to writing biographies of men who operated inside the corridors of power \u2014 Benjamin Franklin, Henry \u00adKissinger, Jobs \u2014 Isaacson seems a bit baffled by committed outsiders like \u00adStewart Brand, an LSD-inspired futurist who predicted the democratization of computing. He also does himself no favors by frequently citing the work of John Markoff and Tom Wolfe, two writers who have produced far more intimate portraits of \u201960s \u00adcounterculture.", "Yet this minor shortcoming is quickly forgiven when \u201cThe Innovators\u201d segues into its rollicking last act, in which hardware becomes commoditized and software goes on the ascent. The star here is Bill Gates, whom Isaacson depicts as something close to a punk \u2014 a spoiled brat and compulsive gambler who \u201cwas rebellious just for the hell of it.\u201d Like Paul Baran before him, Gates encountered an appalling lack of vision in the corporate realm \u2014 in his case at IBM, which failed to realize that its flagship personal computer would be cloned into oblivion if the company permitted Microsoft to license the machine\u2019s MS-DOS operating system at will. Gates pounced on this mistake with a feral zeal that belies his current image as a sweater-clad humanitarian.", "\u201cThe Innovators\u201d cannot really be faulted for the hastiness of its final pages, in which Isaacson provides brief and largely unilluminating glimpses at Twitter, Wikipedia and Google. There is no organic terminus for the book\u2019s narrative, since digital technology did not cease to evolve the moment Isaacson handed in his manuscript. As a result, any ending was doomed to feel dated. (There is, for example, but a single passing mention of the digital currency Bitcoin.)", "But even at its most rushed, the book evinces a genuine affection for its subjects that makes it tough to resist. Isaacson confesses early on that he was once \u201can electronics geek who loved Heathkits and ham radios,\u201d and that background seems to have given him keen insight into how youthful passion transforms into professional obsession. His book is thus most memorable not for its intricate accounts of astounding breakthroughs and the business dramas that followed, but rather for the quieter moments in which we realize that the most primal drive for innovators is a need to feel childlike joy.", "THE INNOVATORS\nHow a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution\nBy Walter Isaacson\nIllustrated. 542 pp. Simon & Schuster. $35."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/drones-vs-kidneys-google-autofill-on-the-economy/": ["If you were looking for a national collective conscience, you could do worse than to check out Google\u2019s autofill feature \u2013 when Google\u2019s search engine tries to guess what you\u2019re looking for by \u201cautofilling\u201d a few letters of a query into a fully formed question.", "Take a recent search for \u201cWho Is?\u201d The autofill suggests that Americans are very interested in ISIS, the brutal group of Sunni militants in Iraq and Syria, as well as The Bachelor, the reality TV show in which  a group of women compete to marry some guy they don\u2019t know.", "With the third quarter now behind us, Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, a New York broker-dealer, used autofill and other \u201coff the grid\u201d indicators, including Google Trends, to see how Americans feel about the economy.", "\u201cEvery quarter we take a break from all the standard economic indicators to look at a range of alternative data,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThe purpose here is to pose the question: Does the consensus view of the economy square with what real people do in their daily lives?\u201d", "Some conclusions from autofill: Don\u2019t be surprised if Dad comes home with a new drone and one kidney.", "Mr. Colas has been tracking Google autofill data for a while, and for most of the last three years the top three positions for completing the query, \u201cI want to buy\u2026\u201d have been won by \u201ca house,\u201d \u201ca car\u201d and \u201cstock.\u201d", "The fourth spot tends to vary with the news cycle, and in past quarters has included things like \u201ca gun,\u201d \u201ca dog\u201d and \u201cFacebook stock.\u201d", "\u201cGun\u201d has jumped around and in the past had the top spot, but hasn\u2019t reached the top four in a year.

This is called transfer pricing.

There\u2019s no easy line in summarizing my contribution and the contribution of my colleagues. It is industry-specific. The way you regulate payment cards has nothing to do with the way that you regulate intellectual property or railroads. There are lots of idiosyncratic factors. That\u2019s what makes it all so interesting. It\u2019s very rich.", "It requires some understanding of how an industry works. And then the reasoning is very much based on game theory. Usually we don\u2019t have a perfectly competitive market, so we use game theory, which describes situations with a small number of actors. And information economics, those are the tools. But then you go into the industries and try to think about the possible rules. It\u2019s not a one-line thing.", "Q. What drew you to this field? When you started in the late 1970s, industrial organization and regulation was not attracting a lot of top researchers.", "A. It was basically a meeting between topical issues about rethinking antitrust policy and regulatory economics and also a meeting with some key people. I started doing it when I was graduate student at M.I.T., with Drew Fudenberg who\u2019s now at Harvard and Eric Maskin who\u2019s at Harvard, who really worked with me on those topics and then later with Jean-Jacques Laffont. There were these people and there was this challenge. Nobody knew how to deregulate telecom or power companies.", "Q. Do you measure your success as an academic in terms of your ability to rewrite government policy? How much do you focus on shaping public policy?", "A. Not much. In a sense I\u2019m mainly a researcher. If my recommendations are applied, I\u2019m very happy about it, and I try to formulate them in simple ways. But you remember Keynes saying politicians and policy makers use economics that is defunct. There is something to that. You develop new ideas and they percolate or they don\u2019t. But my choice has been to stay in the ivory tower. I try to be applied. I think the work has influenced antitrust authorities. But I think my competitive advantage is really to try to think about new paradigms.", "Q. I\u2019m curious for your thoughts on the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d debate. Should governments prevent bandwidth providers from charging premiums?", "A. I haven\u2019t worked on net neutrality. It means several things. One of them is paying for bandwidth and congestion, and that\u2019s natural economics because we want firms to pay for the social costs of their choices. But people are afraid and the regulators are afraid that the bottlenecks will actually use their market power to expropriate from content providers, and that\u2019s why we need to remain careful. I follow it from afar. But I should pay attention to what I know and not talk more just because I won a Nobel Prize.", "Q. Another issue in the headlines is Amazon\u2019s battle with the publishing company Hachette. Is this an example of a two-sided market? Should governments be concerned about Amazon\u2019s ability to extract concessions from suppliers?", "A. Let\u2019s not talk specifically. I\u2019m worried that my new state might mean that people take everything I say seriously. ... In a two-sided market, sometimes one side is going to pay all. We\u2019ve seen that in software and Google, and it\u2019s very common and there are good reasons for that. And there\u2019s nothing inefficient and it has nothing to do with market power. When you have a small newspaper that\u2019s free and just charges for advertising, it\u2019s not preying on anyone. In terms of antitrust, those industries move very fast. You have a monopoly at some point in time and you must have the right conditions for entry, and the regulators have to look and be ready to intervene if it\u2019s suppressing innovation.", "Q. What are you working on now?", "A. One example which is very important is intellectual property. You may have followed the recent debates about patents that are not that important before they are incorporated into a standard and then become important just because they are chosen over alternatives for inclusion into the standard \u2014 they become \u201cstandard-essential.\u201d And then their owners can charge excessively high prices. With Josh Lerner at Harvard, we have proposed new rules to protect standards. It\u2019s fine to reward innovation. It\u2019s essential. But we want to reward important innovations. We don\u2019t want to reward patents which can command a lot of money just because they can be selected into the standard.", "Q. Do you think regulation is moving in the right direction? Are these increasingly complex regimes \u2014 some built on your work, some at odds with your work \u2014 improving our society, or getting in the way of innovation and growth?", "A. What we have been trying to do is to get regulation which is light enough in order to let innovation happen and to promote investment by the incumbents. Bad regulation can actually reduce growth quite a lot, can create a lot of problems. But we have to design rules to promote better regulation.

Now those winds are powering a wind farm whose grand promise and many problems are being closely followed across sub-Saharan Africa, where almost two-thirds of the population still has no access to electricity.", "This month, the 155th of the planned 365 turbines went up at the Lake Turkana Wind Power project, which when completed next year will provide 310 megawatts, or about a fifth of Kenya\u2019s generating capacity. The project is as ambitious as it is huge. It is the largest private investment in Kenya\u2019s history, with the wind farm covering 40,000 acres. It is also in one of the most remote corners of Kenya, roughly 750 miles from the main seaport of Mombasa, where the turbines arrive; 375 miles from the capital of Nairobi; and 265 miles from the nearest transmission grid. When construction began last year there were no paved roads anywhere near the lake \u2014 in fact, no infrastructure of any sort.", "It is what Kenya and other sub-Saharan countries need: abundant power that helps each nation meet its obligations under the Paris climate-change agreement, unleashes economic potential and lights dark homes. Yet the project also demonstrates the huge hurdles in undertaking large projects in a region of poor infrastructure, widespread corruption and weak financial markets. Since the project was proposed, Kenya has had a number of corruption scandals and a contested election that set off a wave of violence. In 2012 the World Bank decided not to support the project based on the argument that it would generate more power than Kenya needs. And local communities have filed a lawsuit, still pending resolution, to nullify the project\u2019s land titles.", "Still, the project went ahead. The African Development Bank took the World Bank\u2019s place; the European Investment Bank and various European development agencies joined in; the Kenyan government provided needed assurances; Denmark\u2019s Vestas Wind Systems signed on to provide the turbines; and a year ago Google, which has invested in clean-energy projects around the world, announced it would take a 12.5 percent stake once the project is finished.", "There\u2019s a lot riding on those desert winds.

About every art form there are those who\u2019ve memorably argued for shaking off critical yokes. (\u201cRead at whim! Read at whim!\u201d the poet Randall Jarrell used to thunder.) The committed gallerygoer long ago learned to sift through competing opinions and seek delight where he or she could find it.", "But \u201cHow to See\u201d is lovely to read, mostly, because Mr. Salle can actually write. In the mid-1970s, when he first arrived in Manhattan, he sold art criticism to various publications to pay the rent. He has good feelers and a sensitive, sunny style.", "He sends you racing to the internet to look up the work of painters he speaks so engagingly about. You will use Google because the small art reproductions in this book are in black and white; they\u2019re murky and unsatisfying.", "About the painter Dana Schutz, for example, he declares, \u201cSchutz is our pre-eminent painter of cluelessness.\u201d He\u2019s speaking about how she catches the \u201cphysical awkwardness, social infantilism and self-regard\u201d of certain men.", "He slowly builds a case for her work, noting among other things her singular subject matter. \u201cPaintings of people sneezing, yawning, being poked in the eye, shaving their pubic hair, or vomiting \u2014 as far as I know, none of these has been the subject of a painting before.\u201d", "Mr. Salle also happens to be enormously, and unpredictably, literate.

He\u2019s a witty writer who appreciates the wit of others.", "His range of reading takes you places other art writers have not. Speaking about today\u2019s young fiction writers, for example, he notes how \u201cthe parodists, inventors, miniaturists, and tinkerers are now coming into prominence, taking over from the arid metafictionists.\u201d", "He neatly pivots to link this observation to contemporary art: \u201cWriters like George Saunders, Ben Marcus, Sam Lipsyte, Sheila Heti, Ben Lerner, and Chris Kraus have clear parallels with painters Charline Von Heyl, Mary Weatherford, Joe Bradley, Chris Martin, Richard Aldrich, et al.

Mr. Salle is open about how he frequently writes about his friends and collaborators. There are often tidbits like this one, about the artist Urs Fischer\u2019s studio, which, \u201cshould you be lucky enough to drop in at the right time, produces daily a delicious organic lunch served family-style.\u201d", "That Mr. Salle is intimate with his friends\u2019 work allows him to make us more intimate with it. At other times you wish for a bit more bite in his observations, bite he is rarely willing to deliver about his companions. You wish he were more in touch with his inner troglodyte.", "This book has other small defects. He goes to the well too often for references to the same things. The movie critic Manny Farber\u2019s notion of \u201ctermite art\u201d is cited, for example, in four separate essays.", "He doesn\u2019t often argue out his opinions, and once in a while his critical discourse veers close to meaninglessness. When he speaks of how the sculptor Vito Acconci wishes to \u201cinterrogate the broader culture\u201d in his work \u2014 as hoary an art-criticism clich\u00e9 as exists \u2014 you may begin to interrogate your GPS device for a road out of here.", "But he grounds that same essay not just in canny observations about Mr. Acconci\u2019s work but in a story about how, as a student in 1974, he helped Mr. Acconci make a video.", "For the video, Mr. Acconci tied a string around his penis. About his own participation, Mr. Salle writes, \u201cI would yank the string on cue, giving the impression that the penis was a kind of Beckettian character in an absurdist drama; it would jerk itself upright to deliver a line or two before collapsing back again just out of frame.\u201d", "About Mr. Acconci\u2019s talking member, he says, \u201cIt had a lot of grievances to air.\u201d", "Mr. Salle\u2019s writing in \u201cHow to See\u201d puts me in mind of Frank O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems.

They should also be safe from hackers, with the companies identifying security weaknesses and issuing software updates. In time the government will need to develop mandatory regulations.", "Automakers and technology companies are in various stages of developing and testing self-driving cars. The car service Uber started a field trial of automated cars last month in Pittsburgh. The company says engineers will always be at the wheel ready to take control if something goes wrong. Google has been testing self-driving cars for years in California, and Ford recently said it planned to make self-driving cars available for an Uberlike fleet by 2021.", "Other companies, including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and General Motors, are taking an incremental approach by putting increasingly sophisticated automation systems into their conventional cars to make driving less monotonous and safer. Some newer cars, for example, can follow the vehicle in front of them at a safe distance on highways; others brake automatically to avoid collisions. But these technical features can introduce new risks. Drivers could become lulled into taking their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, and be unable to retake control if the software and sensors malfunction. That appears to be what happened with the Tesla crash in May.", "Automakers and technology companies might resist mandatory rules, but they shouldn\u2019t.

Selva of the Air Force, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said recently that the United States was about a decade away from having the technology to build a fully independent robot that could decide on its own whom and when to kill, though it had no intention of building one.", "Other countries were not far behind, and it was very likely that someone would eventually try to unleash \u201csomething like a Terminator,\u201d General Selva said, invoking what seems to be a common reference in any discussion on autonomous weapons.", "Yet American officials are only just beginning to contend with the implications of weapons that could someday operate independently, beyond the control of their developers. Inside the Pentagon, the quandary is known as the Terminator conundrum, and there is no consensus about whether the United States should seek international treaties to try to ban the creation of those weapons, or build its own to match those its enemies might create.", "For now, though, the current state of the art is decidedly less frightening. Exhibit A: the small, unarmed drone tested this summer on Cape Cod.", "It could not turn itself on and just fly off. It had to be told by humans where to go and what to look for. But once aloft, it decided on its own how to execute its orders.", "The software powering the drone has been in development for about a year, and it was far from flawless during the day of trials. In one pass over the mosque, the drone struggled to decide whether a minaret was an architectural feature or an armed man, living up to its namesake, Bender, the bumbling robot in the animated television series \u201cFuturama.\u201d", "At other moments, though, the drone showed a spooky ability to discern soldier from civilian, and to fluidly shift course and move in on objects it could not quickly identify.", "Armed with a variation of human and facial recognition software used by American intelligence agencies, the drone adroitly tracked moving cars and picked out enemies hiding along walls. It even correctly figured out that no threat was posed by a photographer who was crouching, camera raised to eye level and pointed at the drone, a situation that has confused human soldiers with fatal results.", "The project is run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa, which is developing the software needed for machines that could work with small units of soldiers or Marines as scouts or in other roles.", "Unlike the drones currently used by the military, all of which require someone at a remote control, \u201cthis one doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Maj. Christopher Orlowski of the Army, a program manager at Darpa. \u201cIt works with you. It\u2019s like having another head in the fight.\u201d", "It could also easily be armed. The tricky part is developing machines whose behavior is predictable enough that they can be safely deployed, yet flexible enough that they can handle fluid situations. Once that is mastered, telling it whom or what to shoot is easy; weapons programmed to hit only certain kinds of targets already exist.", "Yet the behavioral technology, if successfully developed, is unlikely to remain solely in American hands. Technologies developed at Darpa do not typically remain secret, and many are now ubiquitous, powering everything from self-driving cars to the internet.", "Since the 1950s, United States military strategy has been based on overwhelming technological advantages. A superior nuclear arsenal provided the American edge in the early days of the Cold War, and guided munitions \u2014 the so-called smart bombs of the late 20th century \u2014 did the same in the conflict\u2019s final decade.", "Those advantages have now evaporated, and of all the new technologies that have emerged in recent decades, such as genomics or miniaturization, \u201cthe one thing that has the widest application to the widest number of D.O.D. missions is artificial intelligence and autonomy,\u201d Mr. Work said.", "Today\u2019s software has its limits, though. Computers spot patterns far faster than any human can. But the ability to handle uncertainty and unpredictability remain uniquely human virtues, for now.", "Bringing the two complementary skill sets together is the Pentagon\u2019s goal with centaur warfighting.", "Mr. Work, 63, first proposed the concept when he led a Washington think tank, the Center for a New American Security. His inspiration, he said, was not found in typical sources of military strategy \u2014 Sun Tzu or Clausewitz, for instance \u2014 but in the work of Tyler Cowen, a blogger and economist at George Mason University.", "In his 2013 book, \u201cAverage Is Over,\u201d Mr. Cowen briefly mentioned how two average human chess players, working with three regular computers, were able to beat both human chess champions and chess-playing supercomputers.", "It was a revelation for Mr. Work. You could \u201cuse the tactical ingenuity of the computer to improve the strategic ingenuity of the human,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Work believes a lesson learned in chess can be applied to the battlefield, and he envisions a military supercharged by artificial intelligence. Brilliant computers would transform ordinary commanders into master tacticians. American soldiers would effectively become superhuman, fighting alongside \u2014 or even inside \u2014 robots.", "Of the $18 billion the Pentagon is spending on new technologies, $3 billion has been set aside specifically for \u201chuman-machine combat teaming\u201d over the next five years. It is a relatively small sum by Pentagon standards \u2014 its annual budget is more than $500 billion \u2014 but still a significant bet on technologies and a strategic concept that have yet to be proved in battle.", "At the same time, Pentagon officials say that the United States is unlikely to gain an absolute technological advantage over its competitors.", "\u201cA lot of the A.I. and autonomy is happening in the commercial world, so all sorts of competitors are going to be able to use it in ways that surprise us,\u201d Mr. Work said.", "The American advantage, he said, will ultimately come from a mix of technological prowess and the critical thinking and decision-making powers that the United States military prioritizes. The American military delegates significant decisions down its chain of command, in contrast to the more centralized Chinese and Russian armed forces, though that is changing.", "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that we have an advantage as we start the competition,\u201d Mr. Work said. \u201cBut how it goes over time, we\u2019re not going to make any assumptions.\u201d", "Experts outside the Pentagon are far less convinced that the United States will be able to maintain its dominance by using artificial intelligence. The defense industry no longer drives research the way it did during the Cold War, and the Pentagon does not have a monopoly on the cutting-edge machine-learning technologies coming from start-ups in Silicon Valley, and in Europe and Asia.", "Unlike the technologies and material needed for nuclear weapons or guided missiles, artificial intelligence as powerful as what the Pentagon seeks to harness is already deeply woven into everyday life. Military technology is often years behind what can be picked up at Best Buy.", "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, American defense contractors can be really cutting edge on some things and really behind the curve on others,\u201d said Maj. Brian Healy, 38, an F-35 pilot. The F-35, America\u2019s newest and most technologically advanced fighter jet, is equipped with a voice command system that is good for changing channels on the radio, and not much else.", "\u201cIt would be great to get Apple or Google on board with some of the software development,\u201d he added.", "Beyond the practical concerns, the pairing of increasingly capable automation with weapons has prompted an intensifying debate among legal scholars and ethicists. The questions are numerous, and the answers contentious: Can a machine be trusted with lethal force? Who is at fault if a robot attacks a hospital or a school? Is being killed by a machine a greater violation of human dignity than if the fatal blow is delivered by a human?", "A Pentagon directive says that autonomous weapons must employ \u201cappropriate levels of human judgment.\u201d Scientists and human rights experts say the standard is far too broad and have urged that such weapons be subject to \u201cmeaningful human control.\u201d", "But would any standard hold up if the United States was faced with an adversary of near or equal might that was using fully autonomous weapons? Peter Singer, a specialist on the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, suggested there was an instructive parallel in the history of submarine warfare.", "Like autonomous weapons, submarines jumped from the pages of science fiction to reality. During World War I, Germany\u2019s use of submarines to sink civilian ships without first ensuring the safety of the crew and passengers was seen as barbaric. The practice quickly became known as unrestricted submarine warfare, and it helped draw the United States into the war.", "After the war, the United States helped negotiate an international treaty that sought to ban unrestricted submarine warfare.", "Then came the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. That day, it took just six hours for the United States military to disregard decades of legal and ethical norms and order unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. American submarines went on to devastate Japan\u2019s civilian merchant fleet during World War II, in a campaign that was later acknowledged to be tantamount to a war crime.", "\u201cThe point is, what happens once submarines are no longer a new technology, and we\u2019re losing?\u201d Mr. Singer said.

There were boys playing ball in the street, while in the backyard, boys were skittering along the top of the fence while others were wrestling on the trampoline. The house itself is nothing special \u2014 a boxy contemporary, haphazardly furnished \u2014 but even by the elevated standards of Silicon Valley, the Lanzas\u2019 play space is extraordinary. It boasts a map of the neighborhood painted on the driveway, a fabulous 24-foot-long play river \u2014 an installation art piece, designed for children\u2019s museums \u2014 and a two-story log-cabin playhouse with a sleeping loft, whiteboard walls inside for coloring and really good speakers, blasting Talking Heads.", "Leo Lanza, who was 5 at the time, was taunting my kids, claiming they were too scared to climb 12 feet to the playhouse roof, using the toe holds, and then leap onto the trampoline, which has no surrounding netting. My daughter, Violet, the only girl there, continued to decorate the playhouse walls with a purple marker. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you get hurt,\u201d she responded airily. Her twin brother, Kieran, scrunched up his round face, turning pink. \u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d he wailed. \u201cI am not scared.\u201d", "My kids were in a prekindergarten program with Leo, the youngest of the three Lanza boys. I had heard a lot about Mike\u2019s house, a few miles from our own, but that Friday-afternoon pizza party, a year and a half ago, was the first time I had gone there.", "Through the glass doors of the kitchen, I could see Mike opening a bottle of wine for some guests. Mike is a well-known, if polarizing, figure in our community. An entrepreneur in his early 50s, he has a boyish grin, large hazel eyes and curly salt-and-pepper hair, and wears jeans and sneakers, like all the other middle-aged tech guys. After acquiring three Stanford degrees (a B.A., an M.B.A. and a master\u2019s in education) and selling a handful of modestly successful start-ups, Mike decided to focus on his ideas about parenting. He began writing a blog and giving talks and eventually self-published a book entitled \u201cPlayborhood,\u201d a phrase he coined to describe the environment he wanted for his kids. (He kept a hand in the tech world as well \u2014 an app he created, a map-based photo-sharing service called Streetography, is being released next week.)", "Mike is a deep believer in the idea that \u201ckids have to find their own balance of power.\u201d He wants his boys to create their own society governed by its own rules. He consciously transformed his family\u2019s house into a kid hangout, spreading the word that local children were welcome to play in the yard anytime, even when the family wasn\u2019t home. Discontented with the expensive, highly structured summer camps typical of the area, Mike started one of his own: Camp Yale, named after his street, where the kids make their own games and get to roam the neighborhood.", "\u201cThink about your own 10 best memories of childhood, and chances are most of them involve free play outdoors,\u201d Mike is fond of saying. \u201cHow many of them took place with a grown-up around? I remember that when the grown-ups came over, we stopped playing and waited for them to go away. But moms nowadays never go away.\u201d", "In Mike\u2019s worldview, boys today (his focus is on boys) are being deprived of masculine experiences by overprotective moms, who are allowed to dominate passive dads. Central to Mike\u2019s philosophy is the importance of physical danger: of encouraging boys to take risks and play rough and tumble and get \u2014 or inflict \u2014 a scrape or two. Central to what he calls mom philosophy (which could just be described as contemporary parenting philosophy) is just the opposite: to play safe, play nice and not hurt other kids or yourself. Most moms are not inclined to leave their children\u2019s safety up to chance. I certainly am not.", "Mike had invited me to drop the kids off \u2014 not to hover. But I could see Leo brandishing a long rubber tube, as if he were about to whack my son, who looked worried. Beneath the pleasantries, it was clear that Mike thought I was putting my son at risk of turning into what used to be called a sissy \u2014 a concept whose demise he regrets. And I was of the opinion that Mike was putting his son at risk of being a bully, a label Mike thinks is now used to pathologize normal, healthy, boyish aggression.", "Mike came out to the yard, his wineglass in one hand and a piece of cheese in another. His wife, Perla Ni, a lawyer who directs a nonprofit, was working late. Where Mike has a loud, large and boisterous presence (a neighbor once compared him to a Labrador retriever, happily trampling everyone\u2019s shrubbery), Perla is quiet, petite, deliberate and self-contained. The only child of Chinese immigrants, she wants her sons to have considerably more fun than she had.", "\u201cUh, can you keep an eye on them?\u201d I asked Mike, reluctantly gathering my stuff to leave. \u201cThe society of 5-year-olds is fragile and may fall into savagery!\u201d", "\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he replied affably. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in that Rousseau theory \u2014 what\u2019s it called?\u201d", "\u201cSomething about a Noble Savage?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m more a believer in the truth of \u2018Lord of the Flies.\u2019\u2009\u201d My smile was thin and conveyed, For the love of God, can you please put your drink down and watch the kids?", "His smile told me he wanted me to leave already.", "In 2006, when their oldest son, Marco, was 2, Mike and Perla began what proved to be a two-year house search in Menlo Park and neighboring Palo Alto. They were yearning for the kind of classic neighborhood that Mike recalled from his childhood on the East Coast in Scott Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh. They were living in San Francisco, but they wanted to move out of the city to a playborhood \u2014 a version of American kid life featured in shows like \u201cThe Little Rascals\u201d and \u201cLeave It to Beaver,\u201d in which kids build forts and ride bikes outside, unsupervised \u2014 free, skirting danger, but ultimately always lucky. (The oddness of needing a neologism for what so recently would simply have been considered a \u201cneighborhood\u201d only reinforces his point.) Mike drove around deserted street after street: The kids were off at Lego robotics classes, Kumon learning centers or diving practice or squirreled away with their screens.", "Despite having achieved a higher socioeconomic status for his family than he had as a kid, Mike felt his sons were at risk of having a worse childhood. Growing up in a middle-class Italian-American family in the 1960s and \u201970s, Mike rated school as boring-to-O.K., whereas after-school play time with the gang was awesome.", "Like many places, Silicon Valley is sports-crazy, with kids participating in year-round travel clubs and working with private coaches. But Mike feels that organized team sports fail to teach the critical life skills that he and his friends learned in pickup games they had to referee themselves. They were forced to resolve their own disputes, because if they didn\u2019t, the game would end. Their focus was not on winning and losing, as when adults are in charge, he says, but simply on keeping the game going.", "Mike recalls how his gang was often short of a quorum for games. There were two other boys their age, but one was deaf and the other, he says, was \u201cwhatever the P.C. way to describe what used to be called \u2018mentally retarded.\u2019\u2009\u201d Since they didn\u2019t want to \u201cstoop all the way to girls,\u201d he says, giving me a smile, they found ways to change the rules to accommodate the two boys with special needs in their game \u2014 \u201cnot because a grown-up forced\u201d them to be inclusive, Mike says, but because they were motivated to be.", "Then, when Mike was in seventh grade, his family moved to a better house in an upscale development nearby, and the fun ended. Though the new house wasn\u2019t far from the old one \u2014 all Mike would have had to do was walk up the hill to play with his old friends \u2014 he instead spent his afternoons watching TV, drinking Coke and munching on saltines. He didn\u2019t blame his parents; it was bad luck \u2014 an unpredictable anomaly \u2014 that the new development wasn\u2019t a playborhood. But today it would simply be the norm. Playborhoods have all but disappeared.", "\u201cEveryone complains about kids not having enough free time, and being addicted to technology,\u201d Mike says. \u201cThere are a million studies documenting the negative effects of lack of free play in children. Well, we know the harms. I asked myself: What am I going to do about it for my kids?\u201d", "He analyzed the problem like an entrepreneur, by thinking of children as consumers and seeing their time as a scarce resource. Playing outside has to compete with screen time. (A typical 2-to-10-year-old child spends at least a couple of hours a day on screens; tweens spend more than four.) Parents who limit screen time, as local families often do, tend to compensate by piling on extracurricular activities and tutors.", "Even if a boy wanted to play outside, Mike explains, with whom would he play? At any given hour, there might be a 30 percent chance that some kid was playing outside. But the so-called network effect, in which children influence one another\u2019s behavior, means that 30 percent might as well be zero, because it is low enough that no boy can count on it and so will default to his screen \u2014 causing the percentage to drop lower. That is, kids don\u2019t play outside because other kids don\u2019t play outside. Playing outside becomes like Betamax \u2014 it\u2019s just obsolete. But in the case of a playborhood, the vicious circle transforms into a virtuous one: When there\u2019s always another kid to play with, most kids want to play.", "As part of Mike\u2019s quest for a playborhood, he began doing research and visiting neighborhoods in different parts of the country that he thought might fit his vision. The first place he visited was N Street in Davis, Calif., a cluster of around 20 houses that share land and hold regular dinners together. Children wander around freely, crossing backyards and playing in the collective spaces: Ping-Pong table, pizza oven and community garden. Mike told me the story of Lucy, a toddler adopted from China by a single mom who lived on N Street. When Lucy was 3, her mother died of cancer. But before she died, her mother gave every house a refrigerator magnet with a picture of Lucy on it. While the founders of N Street formally adopted Lucy, the entire community supported her. Mike pointed out that the childhood Lucy was having on N Street may be akin to one she might have enjoyed in a village in rural China, but it was extraordinary in suburban America. Lucy could wander around fearlessly, knowing she had 19 other houses where she could walk right in and expect a snack.", "Mike spent some time in the Lyman Place neighborhood in the Bronx, where grandmothers and other residents organized to watch the streets \u2014 so dangerous that children were afraid to play outside \u2014 and block them off in the summer to create a neighborhood camp, staffed by local teenagers and volunteers. Mike also found his way to Share-It Square in Southeast Portland, Ore., a random intersection that became a community when a local architect mobilized neighbors to convert a condemned house on one corner into a \u201cKids\u2019 Klubhouse\u201d: a funky open-air structure that features a couch, a message board, a book-exchange box, a solar-powered tea station and toys.", "Mike was aware of limits to the analogies. Those playborhoods were in lower- and middle-class communities; he and Perla had settled on a house in the Allied Arts area of Menlo Park, where the median home price is $2 million. (And the houses in neighboring North Palo Alto and Atherton cost even more.) Mike found himself up against the fact that in America, the ethos of wealth and the ethos of community are often in conflict: Part of what the wealthy feel they are buying is privacy and the ability to be choosy about whom they socialize with. Mike was determined that his kids would not only know their neighbors but would also see them, every day.", "In order to achieve this, Mike decided he had to corral his neighbors to sign on to his platform. He designed big neon-yellow plastic signs like those used to warn of wet floors, emblazoned with an icon of children playing and the word Playborhood. He invited kids to parties and gave the signs to their parents, to put in their yards and on the road in front of their houses so their children could \u201creclaim the streets from cars.\u201d (We had the sign in our driveway, but my husband accidentally ran over it, and the shards of yellow plastic remained there for months \u2014 a good reminder, he said, of what happens to children who play in the street.)", "Mike also made another simple-but-radical move: In a neighborhood in which front yards are for admiration only, Mike installed a picnic table, close to the sidewalk, where he and his family often sat, so that people walking by would have to talk to them. Mike put a white board on the fence and started projecting videos and slide shows onto it, in hope of luring neighborhood children. And it worked: Dogs stop to drink at a fountain made from a large, flat millstone in the shape of a hockey puck, children wander over to the play river and people pause to read the quotes on the mosaics he had an artist design. One is from the children\u2019s book \u201cThe Big Orange Splot\u201d: \u201cOur street is us and we are it. Our street is where we like to be, and it looks like all our dreams.\u201d", "Mike has influenced our family as well. My kids and I made friends on our block by playing a game from Camp Yale in which we asked neighbors to contribute one ingredient to what turned out to be an apple-pear-blueberry-strawberry cobbler; when it was baked, we brought each of them a piece. My daughter liked the game so much, she recently asked to make her birthday cake that way. Then, when our next-door neighbors generously passed along their trampoline, I spread the word that other children were welcome to play in our yard anytime. Sometimes visitors will be surprised when my children aren\u2019t home and they hear shrieks of laughter coming from our yard, as neighborhood kids bounce and squirt water guns they filled in our fountain, and I feel grateful to Mike for his vision.", "Mike always talks about just wanting his boys to have a normal childhood, while complaining that his idea of normal is no longer normal. His free-time-is-for-goofing-around ethos is particularly anomalous in Silicon Valley. With all due respect to Westchester, Silicon Valley may have the densest concentration in the country of former engineers, executives and other highly educated women who have renounced work in favor of what they call uber-parenting \u2014 and they want results. Just as Silicon Valley leads the way in smartphones, Silicon Valley parents think they should be producing model kids, optimized kids, kids with extra capacity and cool features: kids who have start-ups (or at least work at one); do environmental work in the Gal\u00e1pagos; speak multiple languages; demonstrate a repeatable golf swing; or sing arias. To a comical extent, parents here justify the perverted ambition through appeals to research (enlarging the language center of the brain and so forth) while ignoring research on the negative effects on children of being micromanaged.", "\u201cWhat strikes me is that there is this extraordinary level of anxiety,\u201d Mike told me. \u201cParents don\u2019t have fundamental faith in their offspring.\u201d He dislikes the vast expansion of the role of parenting into every aspect of children\u2019s lives, including curating their children\u2019s hobbies with excruciating care, and he says he aspires to be \u201cthe opposite of a tiger parent.\u201d \u201cAs a libertarian, one of the biggest problems we have in American society is that children don\u2019t have enough freedom\u201d \u2014 children thrive on benign neglect. \u201cLook, there is always a power struggle between children and adults,\u201d he says. \u201cOne way to see the present is that the children have been decimated. It\u2019s not good for children that adults have so much control over them.\u201d", "Local parents often talk about the rash of suicides among Palo Alto high school students in recent years. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty clear to me since I moved here eight years ago that kids are just not happy here,\u201d Mike says, and \u201cthe suicides are just the extreme examples of the broader problem.\u201d He believes \u201cthe poor quality of children\u2019s lives around here\u201d stems from their lack of autonomy. Basic developmental psychology posits that if children develop a fundamental sense that they (not their parents) are masters of their own destiny, they will be successful adults, and that without that belief they will flounder: It\u2019s easy to want to rid yourself of a life that doesn\u2019t feel truly your own.", "Research suggests that students with controlling \u201chelicopter\u201d parents are less flexible and more vulnerable, anxious and self-conscious, as well as more likely to be medicated for anxiety or depression. Similarly, children whose time is highly structured \u2014 crammed with lessons and adult-supervised activities \u2014 may have more difficulty developing their own \u201cexecutive function\u201d capabilities, the ability to devise their own plans and carry them out. Conversely, the more time children spend in free play, the better they develop these capabilities.", "Mike says he often feels alienated when he\u2019s talking to other parents. The common currency of conversation \u2014 rather than sports, politics or weather \u2014 is the achievements of your children. \u201cI have exactly nothing to say in these conversations,\u201d Mike says. \u201cAm I going to brag my kids are jumping on their trampoline, or went to the store by themselves? Parents don\u2019t measure themselves according to their kids\u2019 independence, as they used to, but according to accomplishments. To me, that\u2019s part of how I judge myself.\u201d", "Reactions to Mike in the neighborhood are mixed. When the Lanzas first moved in, Mike had the idea that the neighbors on both sides should take down the fences between their yards to facilitate play. But unlike on N Street, none of them agreed. Mike complained to me that a neighbor asked Marco to stop climbing into her yard to see her son, even though her son wanted to see Marco. Many neighbors disapprove of boys playing pickup games in the streets and of the younger kids biking alone. Leo was allowed to ride around the neighborhood on his own when he was 5, and two years ago, when Nico was in first grade, he was allowed to bike a mile and a half to school alone.", "Mike believes his children have grown by taking risks. \u201cMarco is naturally physically cautious, and now he is working on a back flip onto the trampoline,\u201d Mike tells me. \u201cI\u2019m proud of that. He\u2019s worked his way up. Other kids learn to take risks at our house.\u201d", "In the spring of last year, Mike installed 10-foot ladders in each of his sons\u2019 bedrooms so they could climb through a hole in their ceilings into the finished attic. Perla was not enthusiastic. (\u201cShe\u2019s not into the man-cave stuff,\u201d Mike says.) She was worried they would fall. And indeed, once, when Leo was playing in the attic, he tumbled down the hatch and hit his head. \u201cTo me, it was a bump on the head, which is a normal part of being a kid,\u201d Mike said. But Perla saw it as a head injury and took him to the hospital for a scan. \u201cHe was fine,\u201d Mike said, rolling his eyes.", "Mike tells me that people sometimes ask him if he is afraid of lawsuits in the event of an injury on his property. He would never let fear of being sued dictate how he lives his life, he says.", "What about second-degree manslaughter, I asked: an accident enabled by negligence, if, say, another child \u2014 or even one of his own \u2014 broke his neck leaping from the playhouse onto the trampoline. (Unenclosed trampolines are a staple of personal-injury law; an estimated 85,000 children under 14 were hurt on trampolines last year.) Does he ever worry about that?", "He flashed me a look, then snorted with laughter.", "One day last February, Peter Gray, a professor of psychology at Boston College and a fan of Mike\u2019s ideas, spent a day observing the Lanza boys at play. Gray says that when he gives talks on the critical importance of free play in normal development, audience members point out that they are sold on the idea, but that all the kids are on their screens. He always tells them about Mike\u2019s playborhood to show how parents can change their local culture.", "As part of Gray\u2019s research, he accompanied Mike to meet the kids at school. Mike biked home with the younger kids while Gray and I biked after Marco and a friend as they rode their skateboards to the park. They amused themselves en route by doing tricks on strangers\u2019 stoops. At the park, they wobbled down steep cement curves with older and more skilled skaters as dusk set in.", "\u201cAll mammals engage in dangerous play,\u201d Gray told me. \u201cDangerous play is how kids learn how to titrate fear. Not everyone has to learn quadratic equations\u201d \u2014 which, he points out, most people forget the minute they leave school anyway \u2014 \u201cbut at some point in our lives, we will all be in stressful situations and we need to be able to keep our cool. Sometimes there are accidents,\u201d he added, \u201ckid goats fall off cliffs while playing, or whatever, but they\u2019re rare. If the instinct wasn\u2019t of evolutionary benefit, the behavior would have been rooted out.\u201d", "\u201cWell, mother goats don\u2019t die of heartbreak the way we do,\u201d I said peevishly.", "He conceded that among humans, mothers in many societies have a tendency to worry. \u201cBut there were no helicopter hunter-and-gatherer moms!\u201d he said pointedly. \u201cKids were with their moms until they were 4, and then they were on their own with the other kids, practicing through play the intricate skills they need to survive: finding their way through the jungle, making weapons and identifying food sources.\u201d", "I still recall the visceral shock I felt after I picked my kids up at the Lanzas\u2019 house at the end of the pizza party, having left them alone for all of an hour and a half. On the way home, Kieran announced that he and Leo had climbed out on the roof together \u2014 twice, in fact, once at the party and once at a previous play date.", "\u201cThe roof? The Lanzas\u2019 roof? Is there a railing? Were you with a grown-up?\u201d", "The Lanzas have multistory house, with a sloped top and a narrow, flat area perhaps 25 feet off the ground. If you tumbled off the back, you\u2019d land on the grass or perhaps on the stone patio. Falling from either side, you would be impaled on the fence or fall into the neighbor\u2019s yard. From the front you\u2019d hit the concrete driveway, car, picnic table or fountain.", "\u201cWe climbed up through a window in the attic!\u201d Kieran said with a mixture of pride and wonder. \u201cWith no grown-up!\u201d", "I was so certain it was a tall tale that I was embarrassed to ask Mike when I saw him at school drop-off.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry you were uncomfortable with it,\u201d he replied flatly, as we stood outside preschool. \u201cBut as you know, I don\u2019t worry about things like that.\u201d", "Perla was more equivocal, and last spring, when she invited us to play at the house, she assured me that the hatch to the roof \u2014 a skylight that opens \u2014 had been closed. In June we went to the Lanzas\u2019 for an all-day party celebrating Leo\u2019s seventh birthday in the morning and Marco\u2019s 12th in the afternoon. At one point I went looking for Kieran and wandered up to the attic. Kieran wasn\u2019t there, but I found a cluster of small boys in the process of climbing down from the roof through the open hatch. The youngest seemed to be about 4. They looked at me as if I were about to scold them.", "I already knew Mike\u2019s perspective. \u201cWhat are the chances of falling off the roof?\u201d he argued vociferously when we tried previously to hash it out. Have I ever known anyone who has fallen off a roof? Anyway, he said, it\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t give his kids any limits: They are not allowed to play ball or tag up there.", "\u201cYou trust them?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cI want to trust them,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m O.K. with things happening that I don\u2019t want to happen. My oxygen is when my kids are having fun. I\u2019ve ingrained it in their minds not to run on the roof. It\u2019s a constant struggle for me, but I feel I am reaching a higher level of parenting if I can honestly trust them. And I believe they care about keeping my trust.\u201d", "It was clear that we conceived of risk in entirely different ways. He thinks of risk in terms of probability: How likely is it that any given child will plummet to his death? Google has an answer to that question (about 150 children in the United States die from falls from roofs, windows and balconies annually), but I know we would regard that number quite differently. Mike\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t curtailed by statistics, anyway. There\u2019s a quirky, utopian libertarian quality to Mike\u2019s philosophy; he is a man guided above all by his theory of how life should be. For him, low-probability events are very unlikely and therefore dismissible; for me, they are tragedies that befall someone. I think of playing on the roof more like entering a lottery in which, if everyone\u2019s kid plays on the roof, someone\u2019s kid won\u2019t grow up \u2014 and I don\u2019t want a ticket. The real question is: Do you believe that the child who falls could be yours?", "At the end of the party, I decided I should check out the roof. I found Kieran, and we climbed out of the attic and stepped onto the roof. I spent the first few seconds evaluating the chance that someone would survive the drop (remote), but then I succumbed to the heady feeling of power of looking down on the world. It was like being in the spire of a castle in a children\u2019s book: the quilt of houses, yards and streets, dotted with green lawns and light blue swimming pools \u2014 the neighborhood transformed into a picture of itself, like the maps on Mike\u2019s walls. Down below I saw the play river, the fountain and the mosaics in the driveway and, in the street, the kids kicking a ball, forcing cars to make way for them. I saw the animation in the boys\u2019 slender bodies: the power of making the grown-up world momentarily bend around them.", "I held Kieran\u2019s hand tightly and decided never to play there again."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/books/review/inside-the-new-york-times-book-review-beth-macys-truevine.html": ["Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music", "In The New York Times Book Review, Edward E.

They had dreadlocks and dogs and dirty clothing emblazoned with hand-drawn anarchy symbols. Reichardt faltered for a moment, and then crossed the street. She told me that she suspected one of them had begun shooting up on a garage roof next door to the house where she was staying. \u201cMy instinct is to call the cops,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then it\u2019s like, God, whose side am I on?\u201d", "The scene would have played differently in one of Reichardt\u2019s films. Her moment of hesitation would have been barely perceptible; her lines would have been cut. The camera might have lingered sympathetically on the pockmarked face of one teenager before panning back to Reichardt\u2019s. Her reaction would have been inscrutable.", "Reichardt, who is 52, has made a career of silence and suggestion \u2014 of casting an attentive but unobtrusive gaze on people who can never quite seem to win. She is interested, she says, in characters \u201cwho don\u2019t have a net, who if you sneezed on them, their world would fall apart.\u201d", "Like her films, Reichardt is short and lean and soft-spoken. It is difficult not to feel brash in her company. You want to whisper, and whatever intimacy is established seems tenuous. The vibration of a cellphone is enough to break the spell. We met at the small cottage Reichardt rents for a few months each year in Portland, where she socializes with a small coterie of artists, including her occasional writing partner, the Oregon-based novelist Jon Raymond, and Todd Haynes, who has executive-produced five of her six feature films. Reichardt regularly shoots her films in this corner of the country, using the backdrop of Oregon\u2019s conifer forests, high deserts and shabby strip malls to portray lives led on society\u2019s outer rim. \u201cThe characters are just sort of an extension of the landscape they\u2019re in,\u201d Reichardt said, after we sat down to lunch at the kind of self-conscious cafe that would never appear in one of her movies. \u201cThey\u2019re a product of the places they\u2019re from and their troubles \u2014 their everyday troubles.\u201d", "Whether set on a cooperative farm (\u201cNight Moves,\u201d a 2013 eco-terrorism thriller) or in a desolate parking lot (\u201cWendy and Lucy,\u201d a recession-era character study), her films are all, in their own strange way, westerns. The shots are rife with the genre\u2019s archetypal motifs \u2014 horses, trains, buttes \u2014 and the quiet stories she tells, of lonesome, seminomadic searchers struggling to maintain dignity in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, fill the screen as forcefully as any film that John Wayne was ever in. Reichardt\u2019s protagonists tend not to be men, however, but emotionally inarticulate women, whose problems the supposedly civilizing force of frontier justice never proves strong enough to fix.", "While a lone man can be a hero \u2014 readily and right from the start \u2014 a lone woman is cause for concern. Despite their painterly settings and near-silent soundscapes, Reichardt\u2019s films are animated by a sustained unease. The viewer anticipates a threat that could but never quite does progress to a state of emergency. A car crash produces no injuries. A nocturnal encounter with intoxicated homeless men does not result in sexual violence. An old man gives every indication he could die at any moment but does not. The menace is durational and transforms the audience into participants in a kind of endurance art. It\u2019s the low-grade but unrelenting sense of hazard that is a woman\u2019s experience of merely moving through the world, an anxiety so quiet and constant it can be confused for nothing more than atmosphere.", "The daughter of a crime-scene detective and an undercover narcotics agent, Reichardt grew up in Miami, which she alternately describes as \u201csurvivors playing canasta,\u201d a \u201ccultural void\u201d and \u201cthe place, from the third grade on, I fantasized about getting out of.\u201d Thurston Moore, of Sonic Youth, who was born in the same hospital as Reichardt and spent his early years in South Miami, once told her that he saw an ad in a local paper that read, \u201cIf anyone\u2019s ever heard of the Clash, please call me.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d Reichardt said, \u201cis the best description of the Miami I grew up in.\u201d", "She dropped out of high school after 11th grade, worked in a clog shop for a while and a record store for a little longer and eventually caught a ride to Boston in the middle of winter. \u201cI had never seen snow before, and I was there in my little Miami clothes,\u201d Reichardt said. \u201cIn my mind it was a blizzard, but it was probably just snowing.\u201d She arrived at a friend\u2019s empty apartment, settled in and, as she recalls, \u201cwas sitting there pondering how my new life was going to go\u201d when she heard a knock at the door. \u201cThere were two people there,\u201d Reichardt says. \u201cNow I understand the get-up, but there they were in Salvation Army granny clothes and combat boots and he had his shaved head.\u201d She had never seen such people and couldn\u2019t even tell how old they were. \u201cThey were like, \u2018We live across the street and our freezer\u2019s broken and we have some hamburger meat in that fridge.\u2019 And I looked, and indeed there was hamburger meat in the fridge. And they said, \u2018So you want to come have spaghetti with us?\u2019\u2009\u201d", "The dinner was Reichardt\u2019s first introduction to any sort of life outside the mainstream. She began sleeping on her neighbors\u2019 couches, attending their parties. She took night classes to get access to equipment, which she used to film their projects; the films, in turn, became her application to art school. After graduating from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, she moved to New York City and, after a few years, began writing her first feature film, \u201cRiver of Grass.\u201d", "Reichardt once described \u201cRiver of Grass,\u201d which was met with positive if not career-catalyzing reviews, as \u201ca road movie without the road, a love story without the love and a crime story without the crime.\u201d It was released in 1994, a full 12 years before her next movie. She spent half that time couch-surfing, including a few months in Hollywood, trying and failing to get something made in a place that, as she realizes now, required skills like pitching and schmoozing that she didn\u2019t even knew existed. \u201cI came back to New York thinking: This is torturous. What do I even like about this?\u201d she said. \u201cThe answer, it turned out, was: I like holding my camera. I like shooting and thinking about frames.\u201d", "She went back to making short Super 8 films, mostly shot outside. \u201cThey were really not good,\u201d she insists. Still, one made it to the Venice Film Festival. \u201cOf course my producer and I weren\u2019t invited to any of the parties,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we sat on the riverbank and watched these parties that were happening on boats. It really was an epiphany. I thought, This is exactly where I want to be: not at the party but on the bank of a river, with my friend, looking on at it.\u201d", "She used $30,000 she inherited from a great-aunt to make \u201cOld Joy,\u201d a misanthropic buddy film shot on 16-millimeter and co-starring the indie-rock musician Will Oldham. Since then, Reichardt has worked continuously, releasing a new film every two or three years. For her, this pace is an act of self-preservation. \u201cI\u2019m not great with the production of real life \u2014 the car, the insurance, the dentist \u2014 all those things that seem to mount up if you don\u2019t have a project and become the meat of your day,\u201d she told me.", "If Reichardt\u2019s ineffectual years in Hollywood taught her anything, it was the value of identifying undesirable ways of working and living \u2014 and then developing the confidence to avoid them. She lives alone in a rent-stabilized apartment in New York and maintains a normal person\u2019s sense of money. \u201cIt\u2019s still like a house,\u201d she says when the budgets for her pared-down productions come up. In exchange for working outside the system, she has earned the privilege of final cut. \u201cNobody comes into my editing room, ever,\u201d she told me. \u201cArt by committee is a really bad idea.\u201d", "\u201cCertain Women,\u201d her latest film and arguably the most precise expression of Reichardt\u2019s vision to date, is a triptych based on three short stories by the Montana-raised author Maile Meloy. It follows a small-town lawyer (Laura Dern) trying fruitlessly to convince a man injured on a contracting job that making a claim against his former employer would be hopeless; an unhappily married couple (Michelle Williams plays the wife) in the midst of harvesting sandstone for a weekend house; and a recent law-school graduate (Kristen Stewart) who becomes the object of fixation for a reclusive female ranch hand. Though each restrained vignette is connected by only a blink-and-you-miss-it narrative delicacy, an active loneliness unites the characters, whose inner desolation seems at least in part a reaction to the barren winter plains of southern Montana. Like so many of Reichardt\u2019s protagonists, each of the women is a \u201cfigure of repose,\u201d to quote Robert Warshow\u2019s famous essay \u201cThe Westerner\u201d \u2014 people whose \u201cmelancholy comes from the \u2018simple\u2019 recognition that life is unavoidably serious.\u201d", "Williams, who has acted in three of Reichardt\u2019s films, characterizes the director\u2019s work as \u201c38 things buried under the semblance of nothing.\u201d When she first read the script for \u201cCertain Women,\u201d she thought there were pages missing. \u201cAs an actor, you cling to things like back story, what your character says and does,\u201d Williams told me. \u201cBut silent communication is actually how we experience our lives. ... We go along all day without saying anything that you can really pin something to, nothing someone could point to and say, \u2018Hey, it hurt me when you said this.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Like the Dardenne brothers or the Italian Neo-Realists or a mud-encrusted Robert Altman on the set of \u201cMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,\u201d Reichardt is devoted to showing the texture of genuine hardship. She is preoccupied with the cruelty of inattention and the rote motions that make up a person\u2019s day. Where does someone who lives in a car brush her teeth each morning? What does someone working two jobs look like, move like at the end of the day, knowing she\u2019s about to get up and do it all again?", "Reichardt, as if in solidarity with her characters, is herself made uncomfortable by comfort. She embraces a grueling production process that mimics the precarious existences she shows on-screen. When critics and cinephiles lament the demise of low-budget filmmaking, they\u2019re almost always talking about projects that cost many times more than Reichardt\u2019s. \u201cCertain Women,\u201d which was made for around $2 million, is by far her most expensive film to date. Her 2006 movie, \u201cOld Joy,\u201d cost $100,000; \u201cWendy and Lucy,\u201d from 2008, $300,000.", "\u201cYou can romanticize it \u2014 and maybe it is adding something \u2014 but it also just means that I\u2019m not getting paid, and I\u2019m in my 50s,\u201d she jokes. Gus Van Sant likes to remind Reichardt that with more money come new problems. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s absolutely true,\u201d she acknowledges, \u201cbut I think I\u2019d like to try some of those other problems.\u201d", "Of her many inhospitable sets, the one for \u201cMeek\u2019s Cutoff,\u201d a re-enactment of an ill-fated Oregon Trail journey and Reichardt\u2019s only \u201ctrue\u201d western, was the most hostile. There were rattlesnakes and tornado-speed winds; it was 110 degrees during the day and 20 degrees at night. Actors came down with heatstroke and hypothermia. \u201cGoogle is not research,\u201d she said. \u201cResearch is a lived thing.\u201d", "Reichardt elicits unparalleled performances in part by creating conditions under which actors cannot act. Frequent appearances by animals force improvisational gestures, as does bad weather on set, which is incorporated into scenes instead of avoided through expensive scheduling changes. It was well below freezing and gray when \u201cCertain Women\u201d began filming in Montana last spring, and by lunch the camera crew was in tears. Nobody but the actors and a limited crew were present \u2014 no studio executives, no onlookers. \u201cNo one really wants to sit out in 18-degree weather and see what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Reichardt explained. \u201cThey\u2019re hard places to get to by design, and it makes for an insular, private world.\u201d", "Last October, five months after filming had wrapped, I visited Reichardt at Skywalker Ranch, George Lucas\u2019s Arcadian 6,000-acre estate in Northern California, where various rooms and buildings \u2014 sound-editing suites, mixing stages, screening rooms \u2014 are routinely rented out by Hollywood postproduction crews.", "With the state-of-the-art technology and all the parking lots hidden from sight, the grapevine-trellised campus looked like a wellness spa or the location of a rigorously hashtagged six-figure wedding. Guests can swim, ride bikes, drink proprietary wine and eat gourmet meals prepared with vegetables grown on the premises. She was grateful for it, but the entire setup agitated her. It was too nice.", "Reichardt was there to get through a few efficient days in the studio with Kent Sparling, a sound designer with whom she worked on \u201cNight Moves.\u201d The two had already clocked nearly 100 hours side by side in foam-padded rooms, and their rapport was one of affectionate bickering. Like everyone else who comes into contact with Reichardt, Sparling \u2014 who is known for being exacting about his work and whose credits include films as diverse as \u201cLost in Translation\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons Movie\u201d \u2014 seemed almost careless by comparison.", "The rural Montana that Reichardt captured on camera six months earlier now needed to sound as subtly correct as it looked. The bird calls were a source of unyielding tension. In an attempt to muffle out a line of dialogue spoken by a child, Sparling suggested inserting some chirps. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little peeper bird,\u201d he offered, while scanning his list of audio files. Reichardt asked, \u201cDoes that exist in Montana?\u201d Sparling groaned. \u201cAre we really going there?\u201d Reichardt nodded. He played the clip and then said, \u201cI think the peeper\u2019s too quiet anyway.\u201d They went on like this: Sparling playing warblers, Reichardt looking up online the ones she liked to see if they were regionally and seasonally appropriate. A pheasant was proposed, as was a grouse. \u201cWe\u2019re near a river, so maybe there\u2019s a wood duck?\u201d Reichardt wondered aloud. Sparling played her a wood duck. The quack was boisterous, almost funny. Reichardt, perhaps the only person in the world who could find a bird call gauche, yelped. \u201cGod, no, not the duck!\u201d", "Sparling, impatient, suggested a bird from Florida, and Reichardt laughed. \u201cWhat was the first conversation I ever had with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt was, \u2018Do you care about birds?\u2019 Wasn\u2019t that the first question I ever asked when I met you? I\u2019m pretty sure it was.\u201d", "Slowly, slowly throughout the morning they finessed their way through seconds of footage. Tinkering with the rumble of a truck engine, Reichardt instructed: \u201cLet\u2019s embrace it but not embellish it.\u201d While editing a conversation that takes place inside a car, she argued with Sparling about how best to retain both the dialogue and the sounds of the road. \u201cLet\u2019s get the air and the wind and the trees and the gravel and the tires and just forget about what they say,\u201d Sparling joked punishingly. \u201cYou want your unbuttered toast buttered!\u201d Reichardt smiled, and said, \u201cWell, yeah, a little bit.\u201d", "They continued. Noises that Reichardt turned down or cut out included a single wind chime, a barely audible breeze, the rustling of a tent. The already-quiet scene grew quieter, stiller. At one point, the sound of a tarp wrinkling was inappropriately amplified. No moviegoer would notice it, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Despite initial adjustments, the whirring was still apparent. Reichardt asked Sparling to lower the levels again; he did, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Reichardt looked despondent. In a signal of forfeit, she sighed, shrugged and said, \u201cMaybe the world is just too loud.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/10/06/business/06reuters-markets-twitter.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/09/30/us/ap-us-self-driving-cars-california.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/04/business/ap-us-business-highlights.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/technology/daily-report-googles-slow-response-to-amazons-echo-is-a-warning.html": ["Google, for all its financial success and world-beating technology, has a problem: It often lags or is never even a player in markets it could have dominated.", "As Daisuke Wakabayashi and Nick Wingfield write, that\u2019s been the case with artificially intelligent home appliances.

This relationship has become stronger as Google search data has gotten richer.", "The order in which candidates are searched also seems to contain information that the polls can miss.

The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version \u2014 the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as \u201ccreator\u201d or \u201cinnovator\u201d \u2014 were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy\u2019s anthem \u201cFight the Power\u201d and Parliament\u2019s \u201cFlash Light\u201d across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon. As the sun began to set, volunteers handed out plaid blankets so people could stretch out on the ground.", "The event felt like the swan song of the first president who seemed to get it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the value of start-up culture. A friend in attendance that day told me that she thought Obama wanted us to feel \u201csome ownership, that tech doesn\u2019t have to be far away or out of our lives.\u201d He wants to leave behind a \u201cnation of makers,\u201d she said. Megan Rose Dickey, who covered the event for TechCrunch, wrote that it left her \u201coptimistic that maybe our country can change and learn to do the right thing.\u201d", "In many ways, Obama is America\u2019s first truly digital president. His 2008 campaign relied heavily on social media to lift him out of obscurity. Those efforts were in part led by a founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who believed in the Illinois senator\u2019s campaign so much that he left the start-up to join Obama\u2019s strategy team. After he was elected, he created a trifecta of executive positions in his administration modeled on corporate best practices: chief technology officer, chief data scientist, chief performance officer. He sat for question-and-answer sessions on Reddit, released playlists of his favorite songs on Spotify and used Twitter frequently, even once making dad jokes with Bill Clinton. He stoked deep and meaningful connections with scores of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.", "Obama routinely pushed policy that pleased the tech-savvy, including his successful effort to keep broadband suppliers from giving preferential treatment to bigger web companies over individuals. Even his tech-specific fumbles seem unlikely to mar his permanent record: The rocky debut of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace that cost more than $600 million to build and crashed almost immediately after it went live, was later brushed off as a technical difficulty. And his administration\u2019s pressure on Silicon Valley companies to aid its cybersecurity efforts hasn\u2019t seemed to dampen their enthusiasm for him. Obama used his ties to the tech sector to foster diplomacy: Last year, he took Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, with him to Cuba as an economic endorsement of the revolutionary powers of start-ups to change the world.", "South by South Lawn presented an image of America as a start-up and technology as a small-batch industry, full of dreamers and inventors. I was invited to moderate a panel, \u201cHow Do We Fix Real Problems With Technology?\u201d As much as I enjoyed our conversation, the premise felt flawed. \u201cFixing\u201d problems with technology often just creates more problems, largely because technology is never developed in a neutral way: It embodies the values and biases of the people who create it. Crime-predicting software, celebrated when it was introduced in police departments around the country, turned out to reinforce discriminatory policing. Facebook was recently accused of suppressing conservative news from its trending topics. (The company denied a bias, but announced plans to train employees to neutralize political, racial, gender and age biases that could influence what it shows its user base.) Several studies have found that Airbnb has worsened the housing crises in some cities where it operates. In January, a report from the World Bank declared that tech companies were widening income inequality and wealth disparities, not improving them.", "For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We\u2019ve seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone. (In August, for instance, WhatsApp announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook, its parent company, and its suite of products \u2014 news that gave some Americans pause but caused German regulators to intervene on behalf on their citizens.)", "As Obama's presidency winds down, Silicon Valley and Washington seem to be getting closer. Just a few days after South by South Lawn, The Washington Post reported that Facebook was quietly talking to White House officials about rolling out a controversial app called Free Basics. On the surface, Free Basics sounds fantastic: It promises free mobile internet for those who can\u2019t afford expensive data plans. But only Facebook and Facebook-approved services would be available through the app, and the app can collect data on those who sign up, both to increase the company\u2019s user numbers and maintain the growth needed to impress shareholders. The same service sparked outrage when Facebook tried to introduce it in India last year; officials believed it would create an unfair marketplace and the potential for discriminatory practices. Fusion recently reported that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gave a company called Geofeedia access to information that helped law-enforcement agencies monitor and target minority activists. The close ties between our government and tech companies have led to changes that Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times technology columnist, told me \u201cwill have big effects for a long time, and we\u2019ll say they started under Obama.\u201d", "None of this was mentioned at South by South Lawn. Instead, speakers heralded the power of the tech community. John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader, gave a rousing talk that implored listeners to \u201cget in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise.\u201d Clay Dumas, chief of staff for the Office of Digital Strategy at the White House, told me in an email that the event could be considered part of a legacy to inspire social change and activism through technology. \u201cIn his final months in office,\u201d he wrote, \u201cPresident Obama wants to empower the generation of people that helped launch his candidacy and whose efforts carried him into office.\u201d", "I left the event as the gorgeous afternoon unfurled into a balmy evening, still unsure what to make of it. But a few days later, during a speech at Carnegie Mellon, Obama seemed to reckon with his feelings about the potential \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the tech world. The White House can\u2019t be as freewheeling as a start-up, he said, because \u201cby definition, democracy is messy. And part of government\u2019s job is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\u201d But he added that he didn\u2019t want people to become \u201cdiscouraged and say, \u2018I\u2019m just not going to deal with government.\u2019\u2009\u201d Obama was the first American president to see technology as an engine to improve lives and accelerate society more quickly than any government body could. That lesson was apparent on the lawn. While I still don\u2019t believe that technology is a panacea for society\u2019s problems, I will always appreciate the first president who tried to bring what's best about Silicon Valley to Washington, even if some of the bad came with it."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-samsungs-exploding-products-and-twitters-fizzling-deal.html": ["Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.", "Farhad: Hello, Mike!

And secondly, what\u2019s your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?

You have two minutes.", "CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.", "You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?", "And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women\u2019s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.", "I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country\u2019s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.", "That\u2019s how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.", "And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That\u2019s the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.

Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?", "TRUMP: Well, first of all, it\u2019s great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.

I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don\u2019t think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.

They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they\u2019re people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that\u2019s very, very important.", "I don\u2019t think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It\u2019s all about the Constitution of \u2014 of \u2014 and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.", "WALLACE: We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.", "Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, \u201cThe Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\u201d And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What\u2019s wrong with that?", "CLINTON: Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country.", "But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t mean that I want people who shouldn\u2019t have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.", "And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There\u2019s other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.", "You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn\u2019t accept that reasonable regulation, but they\u2019ve accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people\u2019s lives and defending the Second Amendment.", "WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton\u2019s answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms? TRUMP: Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly \u2014 and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.", "WALLACE: Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?", "CLINTON: Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.", "But there\u2019s no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there\u2019s an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.", "And, you know, look, I understand that Donald\u2019s been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby\u2019s on his side. They\u2019re running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we\u2019re going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we\u2019re going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.", "WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?", "TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.", "I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am \u2014 I don\u2019t know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I\u2019m very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it\u2019s the earliest endorsement they\u2019ve ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I\u2019m very honored by all of that.", "We are going to appoint justices \u2014 this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.", "WALLACE: Well, let\u2019s pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that\u2019s the issue of abortion.", "TRUMP: Right.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes \u2014 in fact, states \u2014 a woman\u2019s right to abortion?", "TRUMP: Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.", "WALLACE: But I\u2019m asking you specifically. Would you like to...", "TRUMP: If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.", "WALLACE: But what I\u2019m asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn \u2014 you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?", "TRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that\u2019s really what\u2019s going to be \u2014 that will happen. And that\u2019ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?", "CLINTON: Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it\u2019s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what\u2019s happening right now in America.", "So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.", "Donald has said he\u2019s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\u2019s rights to make their own health care decisions.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton... CLINTON: And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.", "WALLACE: I\u2019m going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?", "CLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.", "The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.", "TRUMP: Well, I think it\u2019s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.", "Now, you can say that that\u2019s OK and Hillary can say that that\u2019s OK. But it\u2019s not OK with me, because based on what she\u2019s saying, and based on where she\u2019s going, and where she\u2019s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that\u2019s not acceptable.", "CLINTON: Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.", "You know, I\u2019ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I\u2019ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.", "WALLACE: All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...", "TRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.", "WALLACE: All right. Let\u2019s move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.", "Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you\u2019re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?", "Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.", "TRUMP: Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.", "In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of \u2014 I mean, these are unbelievable people that I\u2019ve gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They\u2019re coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.", "Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border \u2014 as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they\u2019ve ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what\u2019s going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.", "I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have \u2014 it\u2019s with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems \u2014 the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It\u2019s just pouring and destroying their youth. It\u2019s poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are \u2014 right now, we\u2019re getting the drugs, they\u2019re getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute \u2014 we cannot give amnesty.", "Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones \u2014 we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We\u2019re going to get them out; we\u2019re going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we\u2019ll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we\u2019re going to get them out.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?", "CLINTON: Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.", "And you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to rip families apart. I don\u2019t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.", "We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here\u2019s what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.", "I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it\u2019s an idea that would rip our country apart.", "I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they\u2019re most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.", "When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn\u2019t even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we\u2019re not paying for that wall.", "So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.", "WALLACE: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up...", "TRUMP: Chris, I think it\u2019s...", "WALLACE: OK.", "TRUMP: I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It\u2019s a disaster.", "Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn\u2019t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.", "WALLACE: Well, let me \u2014 wait, wait, sir, let me...", "TRUMP: We are a country of laws. We either have \u2014 and by the way...", "WALLACE: Now, wait. I\u2019d like to hear from...", "TRUMP: Well \u2014 well, but she said one thing.", "WALLACE: I\u2019d like to hear \u2014 I\u2019d like to hear from Secretary Clinton.", "CLINTON: I voted for border security, and there are...", "TRUMP: And the wall.", "CLINTON: There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.", "But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.", "Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can\u2019t exploit them and undercut Americans\u2019 wages.", "And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: \u201cYou complain, I\u2019ll get you deported.\u201d", "I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump?", "TRUMP: President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They\u2019ve been deported. She doesn\u2019t want to say that, but that\u2019s what\u2019s happened, and that\u2019s what happened big league.", "As far as moving these people out and moving \u2014 we either have a country or we don\u2019t. We\u2019re a country of laws. We either have a border or we don\u2019t.", "Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it\u2019s very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They\u2019re on line. They\u2019re waiting. We\u2019re going to speed up the process, big league, because it\u2019s very inefficient. But they\u2019re on line and they\u2019re waiting to become citizens.", "Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.", "WALLACE: I want to...", "TRUMP: But what she doesn\u2019t say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to...", "CLINTON: We will not have open borders. That is...", "WALLACE: Well, let me \u2014 Secretary...", "CLINTON: That is a rank mischaracterization.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...", "CLINTON: We will have secure borders, but we\u2019ll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president...", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton.", "CLINTON: ... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we\u2019ve learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. \u201cMy dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\u201d So that\u2019s the question...", "TRUMP: Thank you.", "WALLACE: That\u2019s the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders? CLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.", "But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what\u2019s really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.", "This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.", "CLINTON: So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We\u2019ve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.", "WALLACE: Well?", "TRUMP: That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?", "WALLACE: Hold on \u2014 hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we \u2014 this is going to end up getting out of control. Let\u2019s try to keep it quiet so \u2014 for the candidates and for the American people.", "TRUMP: So just to finish on the borders...", "WALLACE: Yes?", "TRUMP: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.", "And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won\u2019t even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.", "Now we can talk about Putin. I don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.", "He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019re in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads \u2014 1,800, by the way \u2014 where they expanded and we didn\u2019t, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she\u2019s playing chicken. Look, Putin...", "WALLACE: Wait, but...", "TRUMP: ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.", "CLINTON: Well, that\u2019s because he\u2019d rather have a puppet as president of the United States.", "TRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.", "CLINTON: And it\u2019s pretty clear...", "TRUMP: You\u2019re the puppet!", "CLINTON: It\u2019s pretty clear you won\u2019t admit...", "TRUMP: No, you\u2019re the puppet.", "CLINTON: ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.", "So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We\u2019ve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17 \u2014 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...", "CLINTON: And I think it\u2019s time you take a stand...", "TRUMP: She has no idea whether it\u2019s Russia, China, or anybody else.", "CLINTON: I am not quoting myself.", "TRUMP: She has no idea.", "CLINTON: I am quoting 17...", "TRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.", "CLINTON: ... 17 intelligence \u2014 do you doubt 17 military and civilian...", "TRUMP: And our country has no idea.", "CLINTON: ... agencies.", "TRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.", "CLINTON: Well, he\u2019d rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: She doesn\u2019t like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump...", "TRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump...", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: He\u2019s outsmarted her every step of the way.", "WALLACE: I do get to ask some questions.", "TRUMP: Yes, that\u2019s fine.", "WALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don\u2019t know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?", "TRUMP: By Russia or anybody else.", "WALLACE: You condemn their interference?", "TRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of course I \u2014 I don\u2019t know Putin. I have no idea.", "WALLACE: I\u2019m not asking \u2014 I\u2019m asking do you condemn?", "TRUMP: I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn\u2019t be so bad.", "Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it\u2019s Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the \u201cstart up\u201d that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can\u2019t believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can\u2019t. The Russians can\u2019t believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.", "And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They\u2019ve taken over. We\u2019ve spent $6 trillion. They\u2019ve taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen in any government whatsoever.", "WALLACE: We\u2019re a long way away from immigration, but I\u2019m going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.", "TRUMP: And she always will be.", "CLINTON: I \u2014 I find it ironic that he\u2019s raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He\u2019s...", "TRUMP: Wrong. CLINTON: ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don\u2019t we use them, which I think is terrifying.", "But here\u2019s the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There\u2019s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that\u2019s why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.", "TRUMP: I have 200 generals...", "WALLACE: Very quickly.", "TRUMP: ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the \u2014 we\u2019re defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century.", "All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford \u2014 she took that as saying nuclear weapons.", "WALLACE: OK.", "TRUMP: Look, she\u2019s been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.", "CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m just quoting you when you were asked...", "TRUMP: There\u2019s no quote. You\u2019re not going to find a quote from me.", "CLINTON: ... about a potential nuclear \u2014 nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind...", "TRUMP: And defend yourselves.", "CLINTON: ... of language \u2014 well...", "TRUMP: And defend yourselves. I didn\u2019t say nuclear. And defend yourself.", "CLINTON: The United States has kept the peace \u2014 the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to be able to keep the peace.", "WALLACE: We\u2019re going to \u2014 no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.", "TRUMP: Yes.", "WALLACE: We\u2019re going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent\u2019s plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.", "CLINTON: Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.", "I want us to do more to help small business. That\u2019s where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not \u2014 who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.", "I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That\u2019s why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.", "And we\u2019re going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We\u2019re going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.", "That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald\u2019s plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.", "So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.", "WALLACE: Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton\u2019s?", "TRUMP: Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I\u2019m a big proponent. We\u2019re going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public\u2019s going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan.", "TRUMP: But I\u2019d like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I\u2019m \u2014 not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren\u2019t they paying?", "She immediately \u2014 when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren\u2019t the NATO questioned \u2014 why aren\u2019t they paying? Because they weren\u2019t paying.", "Since I did this \u2014 this was a year ago \u2014 all of a sudden, they\u2019re paying. And I\u2019ve been given a lot \u2014 a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they\u2019re starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We\u2019re protecting people, they have to pay up. And I\u2019m a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up.", "She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it\u2019s awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.", "We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama\u2019s regime, we\u2019ve doubled our national debt. We\u2019re up to $20 trillion.", "So my plan \u2014 we\u2019re going to renegotiate trade deals. We\u2019re going to have a lot of free trade. We\u2019re going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.", "You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back.", "I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can\u2019t make a great deal \u2014 then we\u2019re going to terminate NAFTA and we\u2019re going to create new deals. We\u2019re going to have trade, but we\u2019re going \u2014 we\u2019re going to terminate it, we\u2019re going to make a great trade deal.", "And if we can\u2019t, we\u2019re going to do it \u2014 we\u2019re going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We\u2019re going to cut business taxes massively. They\u2019re going to start hiring people. We\u2019re going to bring the $2.5 trillion... WALLACE: Time, Mr. Trump.", "TRUMP: ... that\u2019s offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump?", "TRUMP: ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.", "CLINTON: Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...", "TRUMP: You can\u2019t.", "CLINTON: ... the fact is, he\u2019s going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we\u2019ve ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.", "I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I\u2019m going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.", "Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.", "So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That\u2019s the kind of approach that will work.", "WALLACE: Secretary...", "CLINTON: Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we\u2019ve tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.", "TRUMP: Correct.", "WALLACE: Thank you, sir.", "You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn\u2019t get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more \u2014 even more of the Obama stimulus?", "CLINTON: Well, it\u2019s a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I\u2019ve never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.", "I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession.", "So now we\u2019ve dug ourselves out of it, we\u2019re standing, but we\u2019re not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work.", "That\u2019s why what I have put forward doesn\u2019t add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We\u2019re beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We\u2019ve got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that\u2019s what I believe I will be able to do.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don\u2019t add up, that your idea, and you\u2019ve talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...", "TRUMP: Over a 10-year period.", "WALLACE: ... growth is unrealistic. And they say \u2014 you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that\u2019s unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?", "TRUMP: So I just left some high representatives of India. They\u2019re growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.", "We are growing \u2014 our last report came out \u2014 and it\u2019s right around the 1 percent level. And I think it\u2019s going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.", "Look, our country is stagnant. We\u2019ve lost our jobs. We\u2019ve lost our businesses. We\u2019re not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.", "I\u2019ve visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I\u2019ve gotten to know so many \u2014 I\u2019ve developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what\u2019s happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what\u2019s happened to these people in these communities.", "Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn\u2019t really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that\u2019s ever been signed by our country.", "Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn\u2019t call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.", "WALLACE: I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...", "TRUMP: And that will be as bad as NAFTA. WALLACE: ... which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly.", "CLINTON: Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn\u2019t meet my test. I\u2019ve had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I\u2019m against it now. I\u2019ll be against it after the election. I\u2019ll be against it when I\u2019m president.", "There\u2019s only one of us on this stage who\u2019s actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that\u2019s Donald. He\u2019s shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.", "But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I\u2019ve stood up against it as secretary of state.", "Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump?", "CLINTON: That\u2019s the kind of approach that is just not going to work.", "TRUMP: Well, let me just say \u2014 let me just say.", "CLINTON: We\u2019re going to pull the country together. We\u2019re going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we\u2019re going to enforce those agreements, and we\u2019re going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Mr. Trump.", "TRUMP: Let me ask a simple question. She\u2019s been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn\u2019t you do it over the last 15, 20 years?", "CLINTON: No, I voted.", "TRUMP: You were very much involved \u2014 excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it\u2019s bad experience, because what you\u2019ve done has turned out badly.", "For 30 years, you\u2019ve been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I \u2014 make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn\u2019t mind.", "The problem is, you talk, but you don\u2019t get anything done, Hillary. You don\u2019t. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don\u2019t know. It\u2019s gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.", "CLINTON: Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it\u2019s been debunked numerous times.", "CLINTON: But I think it\u2019s really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.", "In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women\u2019s rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.", "TRUMP: Give me a break.", "CLINTON: And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d So I\u2019m happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I\u2019ve done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I\u2019ll let the American people make that decision.", "TRUMP: Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It\u2019s a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company.", "And if we could run our country the way I\u2019ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it.", "And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when \u2014 we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she\u2019s going to get rid of ISIS. She\u2019s going to get rid of nobody.", "WALLACE: All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you\u2019d never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.", "Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up \u2014 you deny this \u2014 why would they all make up these stories?", "Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first.", "TRUMP: Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people \u2014 I don\u2019t know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.", "Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She\u2019s the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people \u2014 they paid them $1,500, and they\u2019re on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.", "I would say the only way \u2014 because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn\u2019t even apologize to my wife, who\u2019s sitting right here, because I didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t know any of these \u2014 I didn\u2019t see these women.", "These women \u2014 the woman on the plane, the \u2014 I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it\u2019s her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they\u2019re telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.", "And I\u2019ll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn\u2019t, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally \u2014 it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.", "CLINTON: Well...", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?", "CLINTON: At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that\u2019s exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.", "TRUMP: I did not say that. I did not say that.", "CLINTON: In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes \u2014 sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes.", "TRUMP: I did not say that.", "WALLACE: It\u2019s her two minutes.", "CLINTON: He went on to say, \u201cLook at her. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d About another woman, he said, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be my first choice.\u201d He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her \u201cdisgusting,\u201d as he has called a number of women during this campaign.", "Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn\u2019t know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That\u2019s who Donald is.", "I think it\u2019s really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don\u2019t want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.", "America is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump...", "TRUMP: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.", "(LAUGHTER)", "Nobody has more respect...", "WALLACE: Please, everybody.", "TRUMP: And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.", "She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn\u2019t fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.", "What happened to the FBI, I don\u2019t know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She\u2019s lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He\u2019s going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That\u2019s really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?", "CLINTON: Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it\u2019s not just about women. He never apologizes or says he\u2019s sorry for anything.", "So we know what he has said and what he\u2019s done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.", "TRUMP: Wrong.", "CLINTON: He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers \u201cpeople who aren\u2019t captured.\u201d He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn\u2019t be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.", "So it\u2019s not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.", "And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what\u2019s at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.", "TRUMP: So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It\u2019s on tape.", "WALLACE: During the last...", "TRUMP: The other things are false, but honestly, I\u2019d love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I\u2019d love to talk about other things...", "WALLACE: OK.", "TRUMP: ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.", "WALLACE: In this bucket about fitness to be president, there\u2019s been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I\u2019d like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have.", "Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.", "Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn\u2019t what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn\u2019t it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?", "CLINTON: Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country\u2019s interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that\u2019s been proven.", "But I am happy, in fact I\u2019m thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does. You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate \u2014 I know I don\u2019t have the time to do that.", "But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that\u2019s about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association...", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton...", "CLINTON: ... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is \u2014 this is an open discussion.", "CLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you...", "WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?", "CLINTON: Well, but there is no \u2014 but there is no evidence \u2014 but there is...", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: I think that it\u2019s been very well...", "WALLACE: Let\u2019s ask Mr. Trump.", "CLINTON: There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...", "TRUMP: It\u2019s been very well studied.", "CLINTON: ... and the high rankings...", "(CROSSTALK)", "WALLACE: Please let me Mr. Trump speak.", "TRUMP: ... and it\u2019s a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.", "WALLACE: Please let Mr. Trump speak.", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: It\u2019s a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women\u2019s rights? So these are people that push gays off business \u2014 off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.", "So I\u2019d like to ask you right now, why don\u2019t you give back the money that you\u2019ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don\u2019t you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.", "Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what\u2019s happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?", "CLINTON: Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent \u2014 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I\u2019m very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I\u2019d be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.", "But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.", "We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we\u2019re going to keep working to help Haiti...", "WALLACE: All right.", "CLINTON: ... because it\u2019s an important part of the American experience.", "TRUMP: They don\u2019t want you to help them anymore.", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: I\u2019d like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent \u2014 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don\u2019t get anything. I don\u2019t buy boats. I don\u2019t buy planes. What happens \u2014 the money goes to them.", "WALLACE: Wasn\u2019t some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?", "TRUMP: No, it was \u2014 we put up the American flag. And that\u2019s it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.", "WALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...", "TRUMP: There was. There was. And, by the way...", "WALLACE: ... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.", "TRUMP: ... the money \u2014 the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses \u2014 the money that you\u2019re talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.", "WALLACE: I want to get into one...", "CLINTON: But, of course, there\u2019s no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn\u2019t released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can\u2019t prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We\u2019ve got them all out there.", "But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. You know, half of all immigrants \u2014 undocumented immigrants in our country \u2014 actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing.", "WALLACE: I want...", "TRUMP: So let me just tell you very quickly, we\u2019re entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.

But you won\u2019t change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...", "CLINTON: Made with Chinese steel.", "TRUMP: But I will tell you, I sat there...", "(LAUGHTER)", "... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you\u2019re going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump...", "TRUMP: If you don\u2019t like what I did, you should have changed the laws.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.", "Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you \u2014 his words \u2014 \u201cwill absolutely accept the result of this election.\u201d Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely \u2014 sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?", "TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I\u2019m not looking at anything now. I\u2019ll look at it at the time.", "What I\u2019ve seen \u2014 what I\u2019ve seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don\u2019t even care. It\u2019s so dishonest. And they\u2019ve poisoned the mind of the voters.", "But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they\u2019re going to see through it. We\u2019ll find out on November 8th.

So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people \u2014 tell you one other thing. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run. It\u2019s crooked \u2014 she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.", "And just in that respect, I say it\u2019s rigged, because she should never...", "WALLACE: But...", "TRUMP: Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.", "WALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country \u2014 in fact, one of the prides of this country \u2014 is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you\u2019re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you\u2019re not prepared now to commit to that principle?", "TRUMP: What I\u2019m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\u2019ll keep you in suspense. OK?", "CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that\u2019s horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.", "The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn\u2019t get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.", "TRUMP: Should have gotten it.", "(LAUGHTER)", "CLINTON: This is \u2014 this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it\u2019s funny, but it\u2019s also really troubling.", "WALLACE: OK.", "CLINTON: So that is not the way our democracy works. We\u2019ve been around for 240 years. We\u2019ve had free and fair elections. We\u2019ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you\u2019re whining before the game is even finished...", "(APPLAUSE)", "WALLACE: Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks.", "CLINTON: ... it just shows you\u2019re not up to doing the job. And let\u2019s \u2014 you know, let\u2019s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating \u2014 he\u2019s talking down our democracy.

This doesn\u2019t do any good for anyone. Let\u2019s please continue the debate, and let\u2019s move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.", "The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that\u2019s something that whichever of you ends up \u2014 whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.", "Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn\u2019t come back or isn\u2019t replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.", "CLINTON: Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is in our interest, and I don\u2019t think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.", "The goal here is to take back Mosul. It\u2019s going to be a hard fight. I\u2019ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.", "I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real \u2014 a really successful military operation. But we know we\u2019ve got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.", "So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That\u2019s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don\u2019t let terrorists buy weapons. If you\u2019re too dangerous to fly, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun.", "And I\u2019m going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will \u2014 would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?", "TRUMP: Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we\u2019re fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.", "About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they\u2019re going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we\u2019re going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about \u2014 how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They\u2019ve all left.", "The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we\u2019re now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we\u2019re going in to get it.", "But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she\u2019s running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That\u2019s why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they\u2019re going in.", "But who\u2019s going to get Mosul, really? We\u2019ll take Mosul eventually. But the way \u2014 if you look at what\u2019s happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.", "But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they\u2019re smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid \u2014 the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that\u2019s going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they\u2019ve wanted to do forever, but we\u2019ve made it so easy for them.", "So we\u2019re now going to take Mosul. And do you know who\u2019s going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they\u2019re making \u2014 I mean, they are outsmarting \u2014 look, you\u2019re not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn\u2019t have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.", "WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.", "TRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.", "CLINTON: Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn\u2019t support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I\u2019ve said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...", "TRUMP: Wrong.", "CLINTON: ... a very clear fact that...", "TRUMP: Wrong.", "CLINTON: ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google \u201cDonald Trump Iraq.\u201d And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.", "TRUMP: Wrong.", "CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.

And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there \u2014 in fact, there are...

And they are being slaughtered...", "WALLACE: Yes.", "TRUMP: ... because of bad decisions.", "WALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that \u2014 that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who\u2019ve been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?", "TRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It\u2019s a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the \u2014 from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what\u2019s happened.", "And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what\u2019s happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she\u2019s going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He \u2014 he aligned with Russia.", "He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.", "Now they have \u2014 he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.

And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, you have talked about \u2014 and in the last debate and again today \u2014 that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it\u2019s going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.", "And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you\u2019re going to get into a war \u2014 his words \u2014 with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone \u2014 first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?", "CLINTON: Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I\u2019m well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.", "This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.", "We\u2019ve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.", "But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He\u2019s made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let\u2019s be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.", "And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we\u2019ve got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.", "WALLACE: Folks, I want to get into our final segment.", "TRUMP: But I just have to...", "WALLACE: Real quick.", "TRUMP: It\u2019s so ridiculous what she \u2014 she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they\u2019re in 32 countries.", "WALLACE: OK.", "TRUMP: We should have \u2014 wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don\u2019t want the cease-fire anymore.", "We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn\u2019t there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way \u2014 and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.", "WALLACE: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton \u2014 no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.", "Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That\u2019s the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.", "TRUMP: Well, I say they\u2019re wrong, because I\u2019m going to create tremendous jobs. And we\u2019re bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we\u2019re bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don\u2019t have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we\u2019re taking back jobs. We\u2019re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don\u2019t make our product anymore. It\u2019s very sad. But I\u2019m going to create a \u2014 the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We\u2019ve given it up. We\u2019ve become very, very sloppy.", "We\u2019ve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don\u2019t use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don\u2019t use those people. Those are the people \u2014 these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.", "We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave \u2014 they made a campaign contribution and they\u2019re dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.", "But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they\u2019ll make a lot of money. And we\u2019ll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton?", "CLINTON: Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, \u201cYou know, before you and President Obama were there,\u201d I think it\u2019s important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.", "You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \u201cYou know, I alone can fix it,\u201d as he said on the convention stage.", "But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I\u2019m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it\u2019s one of the issues we\u2019ve got to come to grips with.", "So when I talk about how we\u2019re going to pay for education, how we\u2019re going to invest in infrastructure, how we\u2019re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I\u2019ve made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.", "And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We\u2019ll have what economists call middle-out growth. We\u2019ve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That\u2019s where growth will come from. That\u2019s why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.", "And I think that\u2019s the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...", "TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, we\u2019ve heard \u2014 we\u2019ve heard this before, Hillary.", "CLINTON: I started off with \u2014 my dad was a small-business man.", "TRUMP: We\u2019ve heard this before.", "CLINTON: And I think it \u2014 you know, it\u2019s a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.", "WALLACE: Time.", "TRUMP: Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?", "WALLACE: Well, no, sir, because we\u2019re running out of time...", "TRUMP: Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I\u2019ve been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.", "WALLACE: OK.", "TRUMP: And frankly, now we\u2019re going to do it right.", "WALLACE: All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal \u2014 a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare\u2019s going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.", "So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is \u2014 and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?", "TRUMP: I\u2019m cutting taxes. We\u2019re going to grow the economy. It\u2019s going to grow at a record rate of growth.", "WALLACE: That\u2019s not going to help in the entitlements.", "TRUMP: No, it\u2019s going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It\u2019s destroying our country. It\u2019s destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.", "You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year \u201917, it is a disaster. If we don\u2019t repeal and replace \u2014 now, it\u2019s probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It\u2019s \u2014 the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they\u2019re going to go up over 100 percent.", "And I\u2019m really glad that the premiums have started \u2014 at least the people see what\u2019s happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can\u2019t get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.", "WALLACE: And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain \u2014 will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?", "CLINTON: Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That\u2019s part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald\u2019s, assuming he can\u2019t figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...", "TRUMP: Such a nasty woman.", "CLINTON: ... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.", "But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.", "And I\u2019ll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after...", "TRUMP: Your husband disagrees with you.", "CLINTON: ... the long-term health care drivers. We\u2019ve got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.", "WALLACE: This is \u2014 this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you\u2019re going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven\u2019t prepared closing statements.", "So I\u2019d like you each to take \u2014 and we\u2019re going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s your turn to go first.", "CLINTON: Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I\u2019m reaching out to all Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, and independents \u2014 because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.", "You know, I\u2019ve been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life\u2019s work.", "That\u2019s what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.", "WALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.", "Mr. Trump?", "TRUMP: She\u2019s raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn\u2019t work that way.", "But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It\u2019s called \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d We\u2019re going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don\u2019t take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can\u2019t happen.", "Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.", "All she\u2019s done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we\u2019ll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.

He wanted to avoid having rivals copy his new machinery \u2014 the equivalent of high tech in its day \u2014 that allowed him to cut crystal more cheaply and quickly than they could.", "Crystal is almost identical to glass, but it includes another ingredient \u2014 lead \u2014 that adds extra sparkle. It is notoriously difficult to shape into small fragments. Mr. Swarovski\u2019s machines set his crystal apart because of their ability to create tiny, uniform cuts, which give off more light than rivals\u2019 products.", "\u201cOne hundred and twenty years ago, we were the Google of the age,\u201d said Taro Nordheider, a Swarovski executive vice president who was hired five years ago from McKinsey & Company to help with the company\u2019s transformation.", "Over the decades, the company shifted with the times. After World War I, Swarovski branched out into precision drilling tools. After World War II, it added binoculars and telescopes. And when sales to fashion designers and other companies flagged in the 1980s, the company opened retail stores to sell jewelry and figurines directly to shoppers worldwide.", "Eventually, Swarovski became complacent, Mr. Nordheider said. It was unprepared in 2008 when the global financial crisis hit and the company was suddenly confronted with a wave of Chinese competitors selling high-end crystals at a fraction of the usual cost, thanks mostly to cheap labor. By 2010, Swarovski had laid off almost 2,000 workers and begun rethinking how to operate in a world where price, not pedigree, was the name of the game.", "In 2012, Mr. Langes-Swarovski started outlining a new strategy to the company\u2019s 79 family shareholders. At dinners, board meetings and social gatherings, he told them that despite Swarovski\u2019s decades of success, things had to change. The company, Mr. Langes-Swarovski said, needed to channel his great-great-grandfather\u2019s engineering roots to cut costs, respond faster to new ideas and, most important, embrace technology that had become part of people\u2019s everyday lives.", "The 2012 bankruptcy filing of Kodak, which was founded in 1888 (just seven years before Swarovski), underlined his point, several Swarovski executives said. \u201cEstablished companies tend to lose over time, especially when they\u2019re successful,\u201d Mr. Langes-Swarovski said.", "Resistance came mostly from older family shareholders who had benefited from profits produced by the company\u2019s traditional crystal business, according to several family shareholders and executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Yet because Mr. Langes-Swarovski\u2019s generation now dominated daily management of the company, and his father, Gernot Langes-Swarovski, remained the largest shareholder, he was able to push ahead.", "The revamp began with small steps. Starting in 2013, a team of engineers spent a combined 50,000 hours and almost $5 million to build a production line that made smaller batches of crystals, at a cheaper price, to compete better with Chinese rivals and to meet demand for smaller orders.", "Swarovski\u2019s tech development, marketing and sales teams also were given more independence to try new ideas. In 2014, one engineer \u2014 part of an 80-person research-and-development team in Wattens \u2014 stumbled onto a way to turn a Swarovski crystal into a solar cell. After some tweaks, including making the crystal round and thinner to meet jewelry standards, Swarovski signed a deal with Misfit, which sells smartwatches and other wearable gadgets, to build the world\u2019s first solar-powered fitness tracker. It went on sale in early 2015.", "Taking the concept further, Swarovski\u2019s scientists, spurred by the Misfit deal, created another crystal this year that changed color when touched, using sensors built into the crystal. The technique was on display at the Met Gala in May when the actress Freida Pinto wore a crystal-studded gown designed by Tory Burch, the first time Swarovski\u2019s color-changing technology had been used in a fashion design.", "\u201cWe created a solar cell that isn\u2019t boring,\u201d said Michael Hutter, head of the applied research group behind the technology. \u201cWe want to be the missing link between the tech and fashion industries.\u201d", "The new devices are a tech-tinged extension of Swarovski\u2019s longstanding marketing strategy for the fashion world. In the past, it has worked with design houses such as Christian Dior to affix crystals to dresses and jewelry. In the company\u2019s corporate archive, Swarovski earrings worn by Marilyn Monroe in \u201cGentlemen Prefer Blondes\u201d sit side by side with an oversize necklace once worn by Beyonc\u00e9.", "Last summer, Mr. Langes-Swarovski and a dozen mebers of his management team flew to Silicon Valley for a weeklong field trip. They met with Google and start-ups including Diamond Foundry, which is building man-made diamonds, as well as with the San Francisco 49ers.", "At Levi\u2019s Stadium, they saw how Wi-Fi hot spots and beacon technology \u2014 devices that sent custom smartphone messages to fans, including directions to the nearest concession stand or bathroom \u2014 had been built throughout the 75,000-seat arena. Such lessons, executives said, could be handy at Swarovski\u2019s over-the-top corporate museum (complete with the world\u2019s largest crystal and a huge waterfall designed to look like a giant) in Wattens.", "The building, basically an all-singing, all-dancing amusement park to sell Swarovski merchandise to visitors, included avant-garde artworks and an outdoor lake with artificial clouds dotted with crystals floating above on almost invisible wires.", "\u201cWhen I heard about their visit, I was a bit confused,\u201d said Brian Hoffman at StartX, a Silicon Valley tech incubator linked to Stanford University, who met with Swarovski\u2019s team for about an hour. \u201cTheir industry is not one you typically associate with technology or innovation.\u201d Swarovski\u2019s executives peppered him with questions, he said, about how best to work with outside developers and to adapt to the latest online shopping habits.", "Emanuel Riccabona, a Swarovski executive who took part in the West Coast visit, said the management team members left California with their heads spinning \u2014 and a plan to build a wider digital community with Swarovski sitting at the center. That included creating a new e-commerce service aimed at making the company an online hub for third-party jewelers \u2014 a relatively cheap way to sell more jewelry, bags and other fashion items without having to invest in costly new retail stores.", "In part, that new endeavor competes with the likes of Etsy, where a community of fashion-conscious buyers already can find an almost limitless supply of custom jewelry. But Swarovski hopes to use its global brand, and significant financial resources, to entice high-end designers and retailers (and high-end shoppers) onto its own site.", "\u201cNow we think about online platforms, not just products,\u201d said Roland Harste, who runs Swarovski\u2019s e-commerce division. The online service, which began in May, currently receives fewer than a million visitors a month, a relatively small number compared with online giants like Amazon.", "Design houses including Oscar de la Renta already use the site, though people are still sent to third-party websites to complete transactions. Now, Swarovski takes a cut of each purchase, but it plans to move all digital sales onto its own platform soon.", "Another lesson from the Silicon Valley trip, which was arranged by a former senior executive at Apple who is now advising Swarovski, was to focus more on partnerships that could give the company access to new tech ideas and trends. Such collaborations were not previously part of the company\u2019s DNA.", "That led to an investment of roughly $5 million to refurbish Swarovski\u2019s original manufacturing plant into the co-working office for start-ups, Destination Wattens, named after the village of 8,000 people. The 19th-century building also houses a Fab Lab, or high-tech D.I.Y. space including 3-D printers, robotic arms and other equipment used by local schools, Swarovski apprentices and anyone else who wants to tinker.", "In its first year, the space has focused mostly on building a community of 20-something programmers and other digital natives willing to move to this village. Swarovski plans to invest eventually in some of the start-ups, as well as to run its own tech programs. Such so-called corporate incubators have become popular during the recent tech boom, as traditional companies have looked for ways to tap into new ideas before they upend their industries.", "So far, few partnerships have resulted. The Fraunhofer Society, a German foundation that has turned scientific projects into business ideas, opened a three-person office here in September, but much of the refurbished factory remains empty.", "For Lukas Kinigadner, a Wattens native who once worked at the Swarovski factory, the company\u2019s willingness to be more collaborative is a change from his childhood, when there were few job opportunities beyond crystal making. Today, Mr. Kinigadner, 32, is running his own text-recognition start-up, Anyline, which he began in 2013 and which now employs 23 people in the Swarovski co-working space and in Vienna.", "He decided to set up shop here, he said, partly because of his local roots \u2014 but also because the rent is so much more affordable than in the city. \u201cWhen we started out, it would have been impossible to do it from here,\u201d he said.", "In February, his start-up received more than $200,000 in investments from a separate Swarovski family fund. \u201cPeople now recognize that something is going on here with technology,\u201d he said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/04/technology/ap-us-tec-google-event-glance.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/arts/music/soy-yo-sarai-gonzalez-empowering-latinas.html": ["A few months ago, Sarai Gonzalez\u2019s proudest distinction was being a funny older sister.

They repeatedly describe change on the timescales they are looking at as \u201cirreversible\u201d. There is a potent sense in which this is true: once a change has happened it cannot be made not to have happened; once they have risen, neither carbon-dioxide concentrations nor sea levels can be made not to have risen.

But rather than discuss the impossibility of predicting or modeling human decisions or capabilities, the authors choose not to address the issue at all, and this undercuts the seriousness of their undertaking. When there is a huge source of uncertainty in your analysis you should be explicit about it. You should try to assess the limits it puts on the salience of your results and what might be done about those limits.

AT&T and Time Warner will most likely try to avoid an F.C.C. review by selling off the small number of broadcast television assets owned by Time Warner.", "Yet some say that even if Mr. Wheeler does not directly review the deal, his regulations have created new restrictions for AT&T and other broadband companies at a time when they are trying to find new growth beyond their internet businesses.", "In only three years at the helm of the F.C.C., Mr. Wheeler has redrawn the regulatory landscape for internet companies and telecom businesses by making the federal government a stronger watchdog. He declared broadband an essential communications platform as important as the phone \u2014 and that put internet service providers like AT&T under rigorous government oversight for the first time.", "The reclassification of broadband as something akin to a utility came as part of the February 2015 passage of net neutrality rules, which ensure that web users will get to any legal web content without paying extra tolls to internet service providers.

He was publicly criticized by the late-night television host John Oliver, and protesters sat in the driveway at his home, after he released weaker early versions of net neutrality rules. The F.C.C. was flooded with millions of comments protesting the rules.", "President Obama, who in late 2014 posted a video message in favor of treating broadband more like a utility, was crucial to the change.

It was July 28, 2014, little more than a week after Eric Garner was killed on Staten Island, less than two weeks before Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., and police departments around the country were facing a new era of public scrutiny. Wagers, who has a Ph.D. in criminal justice from Rutgers, was the Seattle department\u2019s new chief operating officer, a 42-year-old civilian in jeans and square-rimmed glasses. He\u2019d left his wife and two kids in Virginia and come alone to Seattle, a city he didn\u2019t know \u2014 where it rained but cultural norms, he\u2019d read, didn\u2019t allow you to use an umbrella \u2014 because the job was what he called \u201cthe chance of a lifetime.\u201d Seattle was the first big-city police department in a decade to have come under what is known as a consent decree \u2014 police reform by federal fiat \u2014 after a string of violent police actions against black, Latino and Native American people were caught on camera in 2009 and 2010. Wagers and his new boss, Chief Kathleen O\u2019Toole, herself just arrived in Seattle, would use the best new thinking and the best new technology to lead the turnaround. And then Wagers would go home.", "O\u2019Toole\u2019s eighth-floor conference room, which has views of City Hall and Elliott Bay and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains, was packed with top police and city officials. All eyes were on a lawyer from the city attorney\u2019s office named Mary Perry. A former naval officer in her 60s, Perry was small and soft-spoken and favored pearls, and she was the city\u2019s unrivaled expert in the seemingly mundane intricacies of the state\u2019s Public Records Act. She was briefing the room on the potential fallout from a landmark case she had just argued and lost before the Washington State Supreme Court. The case stemmed from a series of public-records requests by a reporter for the local television station KOMO, Tracy Vedder, who began filing them after the same high-profile incidents that would lead to the consent decree. She asked for user manuals to the department\u2019s new system of in-car dashboard cameras, then for lists of dashcam recordings, then for some of the recordings themselves. After the department denied every one of them, Vedder sued it for violating the Public Records Act.", "The act, which dates to 1972, when governments ran on paper and our modern torrent of electronic data was unimaginable, is one of the strongest in the country. Washington State agencies cannot deny requests for records because the requester is anonymous or the request is too broad, nor can they deny requests simply in order to protect an individual\u2019s privacy; instead, agencies must redact only the details deemed sensitive under state code \u2014 for example, some addresses, sometimes the face of a minor \u2014 and disclose the rest. Before the court, Perry had argued that a different law, the state\u2019s Privacy Act, which allows departments to withhold recordings until related criminal or civil cases are resolved, should take precedent and the Seattle Police should be allowed to broadly deny Vedder\u2019s requests until the relevant statute of limitations ran out. The court disagreed.", "As Perry now told Wagers and the officials gathered in the chief\u2019s conference room, Seattle and other departments across the state were operating in a new reality. Only in cases under actual, pending litigation could the police withhold video footage from the people. This presented several problems. The first was logistical and financial: Seattle Police were sitting on more than 1.5 million individual dashcam and surveillance videos, or about 300,000 hours and 350 terabytes total. Before releasing any footage, someone in the department had to review and redact it in accordance with the specific privacy exemptions the state code did have. The process was manual, a painstaking, frame-by-frame ordeal. By one estimate, 169 people would have to work for a year just to fulfill the department\u2019s existing video requests, and the department added 2,000 new video clips daily. Perry feared that the new flood of data, especially but not exclusively video, could bankrupt Seattle if someone requested it all. \u201cIt\u2019s like being on the Titanic,\u201d she later told me, \u201cand you\u2019ve got a teaspoon to bail.\u201d", "The second problem was privacy. Dashcam videos were already a concern, but Seattle had also been considering using body cameras. In fact, the Police Department was now preparing a small pilot program involving a dozen officers from a single precinct to test the hardware. Any footage that bodycams gathered, Perry warned, would also be subject to the Public Records Act. The department would have even more video to manage and release, but most worrisome was how fundamentally different, and more intrusive, this video would be. Unlike dashcams, bodycams, which are attached to an officer\u2019s uniform or purpose-built glasses, can go into homes and hotel rooms. Unlike dashcams, their default view during an arrest, or during a simple conversation with a victim or witness or informant, is an intimate close-up. Many people think of body cameras as a tool for police accountability, but the primary subject of their surveillance isn\u2019t the police \u2014 it\u2019s the public.", "\u201cI believe in open government, I really do,\u201d Perry told me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think people have really wrapped their heads around all the implications.\u201d If the bodycam pilot was deemed a success, and the city expanded the program to the rest of its 850 front-line officers, all of them now walking surveillance cameras, what then?", "Wagers left the meeting stunned. \u201cI like to think I can walk into a room, take a complex problem and break it down into its component parts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meeting, I walked out thinking: Wow, this is complicated. This is messy.\u201d", "In 2011, three years before Wagers joined the department, a 20-year-old programmer named Tim Clemans set the record for consecutive daily visits to Seattle\u2019s Space Needle. \u201cThe main reason I go everyday,\u201d he wrote in an online journal documenting his record attempt, \u201cis because on July 7, 2010, I attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge. The Space Needle changed me from a depressed, shy and lazy kid to a happy, outgoing, disciplined young man who has a reason to live.\u201d", "Clemans lived with his parents in a small, suburban house south of Seattle, sleeping in a bedroom decorated with a picture of the Space Shuttle and a free calendar from a local Chinese buffet. His bed was a mattress on the floor, and his electronic devices \u2014 computers, radios, keyboards \u2014 dominated the room. Clemans, who has sandy blond hair and wide blue eyes and walks with the stooped gait of someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer, taught himself to code HTML at age 8. Home-schooled as a teenager to escape bullying, he was editing web pages for a hospital, where a friend from his parents\u2019 church worked, by 14. He taught himself basic JavaScript and CSS, and he learned the programming language Python after he showed up at a mathematics lab at the University of Washington and offered to volunteer in exchange for high-school credit. \u201cI just went there,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m very impulsive, and I don\u2019t like rules.\u201d", "Day 1 of his record attempt was a fluke. He was in the vicinity of the Space Needle and bored, so he took the elevator to the top. Something about being able to see the whole city at once captivated him. The next day, Clemans bought a $50 season pass. He learned of the previous record \u2014 60 consecutive days \u2014 and vowed to beat it. He came daily by bus and foot, an hourlong commute, often arriving early and staying late into the night.", "The Space Needle blooms out of the grounds of the 1962 World\u2019s Fair, a site north of downtown that is now known as Seattle Center. It is 605 feet tall. You enter through a plaza choked with Korean tourists and Andean flute musicians and Marine marching bands, then shuffle up a ramp to the east, above the gift shop and not far from a lineup of idling tour buses. Before handing over your ticket, you are asked to pose for a photo, then board one of three external elevators. When the elevator starts its ascent and the city comes into view, the people inside either fall silent or gasp out loud.", "From the observation deck, you can see mountains in four directions, water in two and, just to the south, a forest of skyscrapers. You also see a tangle of cranes; a city increasingly built by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates is booming. There are parks, markets, hidden gardens, tiny houses, tiny cars. Bulk carriers glide into port. Seaplanes land and take off. Helicopters float by. The lights of the radio towers on adjacent Queen Anne Hill, a seeming stone\u2019s throw away, blink on and off. Inside, a giant digital wall displays a shifting collage of visitor selfies, along with tourists\u2019 names and cities of origins. A joystick controls a high-definition camera mounted somewhere on the tower, allowing anyone to pan and zoom in on the unsuspecting people below, like a drone operator.", "The Space Needle became Clemans\u2019s office and his sanctuary. He brought his laptop, stuffing it into his backpack along with a toothbrush and toothpaste and self-help and business books, and got online with a wireless card. He exercised by walking laps around the outer deck. He offered to take tourists\u2019 photos, posed with them and answered their questions. He wrote code and blog entries. He stared at the city.

However, I\u2019m really good at meeting this one particular goal, going to the Space Needle every day. I\u2019ve been able to do so for 108 days straight for one simple reason: Going to the Space Needle everyday is more important than anything else. I have to do it. So when I\u2019m trying to achieve a goal, I just have to remember it\u2019s more important than anything else.\u201d", "After almost 160 days, Clemans had an altercation with a Space Needle employee. Before he could get on the elevator, she asked him to pose for a photo in the booth at the top of the ramp, just like the tourists. He had been asked to do it a hundred times. It was senseless, and it enraged him. \u201cI blew up at her,\u201d he says. Just like that, the world-record holder was banned from the Space Needle for life.", "Adrift, he disappeared from public view. He worked on code, dabbled in robotics and considered a career as a paramedic. He was pulled over for reckless driving and hired a lawyer known for his successful dashcam requests and, he claims, the video didn\u2019t entirely match the police report, so the court reduced the charges. He met a woman on OKCupid, getting her attention by suggesting that they go build sand castles together.", "One day in September 2014, Clemans was with his girlfriend when he read on his laptop that KOMO had prevailed over Seattle in the state\u2019s Supreme Court in June: Police video had to be released on demand. The Justice Department had just started its investigation of Ferguson, but Clemans\u2019s concerns were closer to home. KOMO posted only snippets. \u201cI was just mad that they were getting all this video but not making it all available,\u201d he recalls. He turned to his girlfriend and told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do police data as a hobby.\u201d", "\u201cIt was like a D.D.O.S. attack,\u201d Wagers says, comparing Clemans\u2019s first email to a distributed denial of service attack, in which hackers send so much traffic to a website that it crashes. \u201cIt was going to seize up the system.\u201d The request was simple, but it was just what Perry had warned about: Clemans wanted every single video the Seattle Police Department ever recorded, everything not tied up in an investigation. That September, Clemans sent similar messages to almost every police department in the state. Worried the police would retaliate if they could find him, he used an untraceable email address: policevideorequests@mail2tor.com.", "Some police departments started sending videos immediately, some proposed installment plans and some announced they were delaying their bodycam programs. In Poulsbo, a town of 9,500 people across the Puget Sound from Seattle, the mayor desperately emailed her local state legislator and asked him to do something about the cameras and the Public Records Act.", "Unlike its smaller counterparts, the Seattle department did not give its unknown nemesis any footage. Clemans responded by programming a bot. It scraped the department\u2019s website for new case numbers, then automatically requested the corresponding police reports, firing off emails 10 times a day. The more the authorities denied him, the more his appetite grew. He asked the University of Washington for all its records dating back to \u201cthe formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.\u201d He filed requests with another 60 state agencies, demanding every email they had ever sent \u2014 600 million messages in all, according to a state estimate. The Department of Agriculture informed Clemans it would need 132 years to complete the job.", "Wagers decided to try a different approach. At Rutgers, he had been schooled in the reformist ideals of community policing. Like the longtime New York City police commissioner William J. Bratton \u2014 whose work when he led the Los Angeles Police Department was the subject of Wagers\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation and who, as it happened, was Chief O\u2019Toole\u2019s boss when he led the Massachusetts Metropolitan District Commission Police \u2014 Wagers liked to quote Sir Robert Peel, the founder of London\u2019s bobbies, who in the early 19th century established an Anglo-Saxon tradition of policing distinct from the militaristic us-versus-them Continental model. Peel taught that good policing was about building and holding public trust. \u201cIt\u2019s about engagement,\u201d Wagers told me. \u201cWe respond. We engage. It sounds kind of trite, but it\u2019s a different way of thinking.\u201d His new plan for dealing with Clemans, he says, \u201cwas like any other response to the community: We engage.\u201d", "On Twitter, Wagers followed @PoliceVideo, an account that then belonged to the still-anonymous requester. The next day, the account tweeted at Wagers, asking him why the department was giving PowerPoint presentations to city leaders about the coming bodycam pilot program but not sharing the slides with the public. \u201cScrew it,\u201d @PoliceVideo tweeted when Wagers was too slow to respond. \u201cPutting in the request now. Wish you guys would just publish this stuff.\u201d", "But Wagers offered to \u201cdo you one better,\u201d and he tweeted a phone number. \u201cHere\u2019s my cell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI give it out to everyone. Call me & happy to answer questions.\u201d It was 6:57 p.m. One minute later, Wagers\u2019s phone rang. It was Clemans. He still didn\u2019t give his real name \u2014 he had been overwhelmed by media interest in his transparency fight \u2014 but readily accepted when Wagers invited him to lunch.", "The next day, Clemans met Wagers and Mary Perry at Police Headquarters. They ordered a pizza. Perry tried to explain that it was technically impossible for the department to release all its archived video anytime soon. Clemans countered with an idea he had. He called it \u201coverredaction.\u201d If the system was paralyzed by the need for frame-by-frame redactions, he wondered, why not automatically redact everything? That is, instead of jockeying with requesters, painstakingly reviewing each video, blurring out the protected parts and burning the results onto DVD after DVD, the department could just use software to lightly blur everything, then proactively publish each blurred video online. Push, not pull. Viewers would be able to make out enough to know if footage merited a specific records request and a more precise manual redaction, and they would presumably ask for only the segments they thought they needed; and no longer would the department be buried under its own video. He agreed to drop his mass requests if the department would try it out.", "In fact, Clemans said, he had stayed up all night writing a very rough version of the overredaction code and printed it out. He showed them what he had done.", "The pilot program, set to be rolled out in December 2014, would garner considerable national attention. After Ferguson, expectations that bodycams could reduce police violence and ensure accountability were high. In polls taken over the next year, 87 percent of Americans and 89 percent of Seattle residents supported their use. When President Obama announced an initiative to distribute $75 million so police departments around the country could buy more of them, he declared that the cameras would \u201cenhance trust between communities and police.\u201d A widely cited study by University of Cambridge researchers, undertaken in Rialto, Calif., in 2012 and 2013, found that when officers wore the cameras, use of force dropped by 59 percent compared to the previous year, complaints against the police by 88 percent. By now Wagers understood more about the hidden costs of bodycams \u2014 to individual privacy, to the overworked staff of the public-disclosure unit \u2014 but he and O\u2019Toole began avidly pursuing a federal grant nonetheless. \u201cIf research continues to show that they reduce the use of force, reduce complaints, produce positive impacts,\u201d he said, \u201cthen there\u2019s a moral cost to not using bodycams.\u201d", "The cameras that Seattle planned to use in its pilot program \u2014 which would be worn on patrol by a dozen officers in its East Precinct, their video uploaded to a server at the end of every shift \u2014 were from two local companies: Vievu, which was founded by a former Seattle SWAT officer, Steve Ward, in 2007, and its main rival, Axon, a division of Taser that is responsible for the reliable spike in the parent company\u2019s stock after major police shootings. Together the two companies dominate a market that analysts believe will soon be worth a billion dollars a year, with much of the value coming from software and storage. Both Vievu and Axon offered bundles that paired their cameras with editing programs that ran in the cloud, processing them on computers maintained by Amazon Web Services or Microsoft\u2019s Azure, which are also Seattle-area companies.", "But neither bundle came cheap. The millions of dollars that major police departments were beginning to spend on bodycam contracts were millions they weren\u2019t spending on better training or new officers, and neither company had come close to perfecting automated redaction, without which Seattle Police would simply be collecting more footage without any better way to share it with requesters. Seattle needed an end-to-end software fix, Wagers realized, and Seattle was also a city full of programmers. So the day before the pilot program started, he also tried another experiment: With help from Clemans, he held the department\u2019s first-ever hackathon.", "The overflow crowd of 80 people was \u201cstraight out of central casting,\u201d Wagers says. \u201cSkinny jeans. Hoodies. People who had sued the department. People I know I\u2019d seen on the protest line the previous week.\u201d Clemans demonstrated his overredaction program: the world as if filmed through a beer glass, fuzzy but familiar, in which it was still possible (too possible, some worried) to tell who was tall and who was short and who was male and who was female and who was black and who was white and who was running and who was chasing. It was well received, and several programmers in the room offered to help Clemans improve the algorithm. But Clemans, volunteering his time and his skills, would be the linchpin. The pilot would run for six months, and if it went well, 12 officers would soon become 850.", "The next day, on Dec. 20, as TV stations aired reports on the department\u2019s innovative approach to transparency, the bodycam pilot began. Clemans and the department soon developed a rhythm: Some of the videos coming in from the East Precinct were saved to U.S.B. sticks, and Clemans, unpaid and on food stamps at the time, came downtown by bus to pick them up. He processed them on his bedroom computer, tweaking the overredaction program as he went, trying to code in the right balance of concealment and transparency.", "Even as he helped run Seattle\u2019s experiment in open government, Clemans continued to receive hundreds of hours of dashcam and bodycam video from other police departments around the state, much of it unredacted. And, just as he had promised to do in his records requests, he was continuing to upload it \u2014 unredacted \u2014 to YouTube. The first videos he posted show, with perfect clarity, drunken-driving stops from the towns Renton and Tukwila, south of Seattle, and include disturbing footage of a young white man being shocked with a Taser in the dark beneath the tree where he had just crashed his car, the scene illuminated by flashing lights. In another video, two officers rush to help a man suffering from a heart attack on a freeway overpass, saving his life. Others depict foot chases or friendly interactions with homeless people, and they gave Clemans more respect for the police and the difficulties they face every day. \u201cPolicing is just really hard,\u201d he says. But he didn\u2019t watch all the footage himself, because he didn\u2019t have time and new projects beckoned.", "I watched more than a dozen hours of the video. There were no shootings. Most of it was routine police work, which may be why it was so disturbing to see online. In one set of videos that Clemans posted, a well-dressed white mother of two is pulled over late on a Friday night. She is composed until she fails a sobriety test. Then she pleads for a chance to call the babysitter \u2014 according to Facebook, where I found her because the video also revealed her name, she has a young daughter and younger son \u2014 before breaking down in loud screams and sobs in the back of a patrol car.", "Elsewhere in the state, also on YouTube, a body camera captures the inside of a woman\u2019s home as she explains how her accused stalker has been ignoring a restraining order. A father pleads with two officers to check in on his adult daughter, who he says has intellectual disabilities and has become involved with a man he believes is dangerous. Two college roommates accuse each other of theft and intimidation in their living room. A white woman apparently overdosing on meth, who cries out that she\u2019s pregnant, is restrained and given medical attention. A middle-aged black man opens his apartment door for a group of officers who inform him that he has been screaming all night. Slurring his words, he admits he\u2019s suffering from PTSD and that he has a history of heroin use. He refuses to let them take him to the hospital. He refuses even when an officer reminds him that he has been screaming like this off and on for a month. But now you can hear the fear in his voice. \u201cAm I screaming right now?\u201d he wonders.", "One of the first bodycam videos that Clemans uploaded shows a young black woman sitting on a bed in a hotel room. The officer wearing the camera is a disembodied voice but for a fleeting glimpse of his face and torso in a mirror. His manner is professional and sympathetic, and he says he doesn\u2019t want to arrest her. \u201cWill I be charged?\u201d she asks. \u201cLet\u2019s get to that later,\u201d he says. He asks her if she would be willing to talk to a counselor. \u201cSo you can get some other kind of job so you don\u2019t have to do this anymore, O.K.?\u201d he says. \u201cOur ultimate goal is that there is no prostitution, O.K.?\u201d", "He begins filling out a form \u2014 Escort Face Sheet \u2014 on a clipboard. She answers every question, sharing the intimate details of her life. She tells him about her relationship with her boyfriend, her clashes with her strict father, her time as a runaway, her drift from strip clubs to Backpage.com escort ads, her few regular johns. She claims she\u2019s new to this work. She explains that she charges per hour or half-hour. She has a dog, she says. She can rely on her parents in times of need, she says. She gives him their street address. She gives him her full name. She shares her private email address and phone number. She shares all this with the camera too.", "When the interview is done, she asks about it. Is the image clear? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear, yeah,\u201d the officer says, but \u201cif the press wanted it, we can redact faces \u2014 can blur out the faces and whatnot.\u201d Body cameras are new to his city, and he doesn\u2019t know that what he just told her isn\u2019t entirely true. A lawyer will decide that the video is in no part exempt from the Public Records Act, and the officer will later be shocked to see it on YouTube. He will try and fail to have it taken down. The woman in the video is easy to find in her other internet life. She\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, where she chats with friends and posts images of dresses and animals and nail polish. You can visit her parents\u2019 house on Google Street View.", "Body cameras can be knocked loose when the police rush a suspect, as the world learned in July when Alton Sterling was killed in Baton Rouge, La. Officers can likewise forget or claim to forget to turn the cameras on in time to record an incident in full, as protesters saw after they forced the police to release the inconclusive, partial bodycam footage of Keith Lamont Scott\u2019s shooting in Charlotte, N.C. But for slow-moving scenes like this one, in the hotel room with the young woman who seems to trust the officer with her privacy, the technology works almost too well. Bryce Newell, an information-science researcher now at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who did his fieldwork in Washington, interviewing Clemans and Wagers and riding along with officers as they tested their new bodycams, gave a clever name to the problem they posed in a society demanding transparency: \u201ccollateral visibility.\u201d", "One of the first people revealed to the public by Clemans\u2019s transparency quest was Clemans himself. His mass records requests had drawn the interest of local reporters, who started filing requests of their own to the Police Department, seeking his identity. After they got his phone number, Clemans pre-emptively outed himself, embracing the role of tech seer. He published a letter in January 2015 explaining his mission on the website of the Seattle Privacy Coalition. \u201cI pushed the envelope,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso we as a society can once and for all address accurately recording of the truth, who should have access to the truth and what we are to do with the truth.\u201d He told the local news site Crosscut that the Public Records Act did need to be amended. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change until it becomes a massive problem,\u201d he said. He told Seattle Weekly that his experience with police videos had convinced him that certain things shouldn\u2019t be made public. He left the footage on YouTube precisely to make that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to deal with this until they have an emotional reaction,\u201d he said.", "The designated voice of the people in Seattle\u2019s police-reform process is the Community Police Commission, a board of local leaders \u2014 black, white, Latino, Native American \u2014 that was created as part of the city\u2019s settlement with the Justice Department. It represents the people the consent decree, and body cameras, were most meant to protect. On a cloudy Saturday in January 2015, with the pilot program underway, the commission invited Wagers to a community meeting on the city\u2019s south side to take part in a public discussion of how bodycams would be used and whether, a flier read, \u201cthey will, in fact, increase police accountability.\u201d", "Wagers stood before the crowd, about a hundred people in all, and gave a brief technical overview of the pilot program. Then an officer from East Precinct demonstrated how the bodycam worked, briefly filming the crowd as he did so. After that, one commissioner, David Keenan, a local lawyer, asked a group of waiting panelists to state, one after the other, when, exactly, the cameras should be on, and to answer a simple question about the evidence they create: Why do we want it? That is, whom does it serve? \u201cShould it only be used if there\u2019s an accusation against a police officer?\u201d he asked. \u201cShould it be used by criminal investigators and by defendants and by prosecutors?\u201d", "The growing national welter of contradictory state laws and department policies signals that there is no settled answer. Some allow officers to view it before writing their reports. (That was the central issue earlier this month in Portland, Ore., that caused protesters to storm its City Hall, where police officers met them with bursts of pepper spray.) Some do not. Some treat all bodycam videos as public records; some limit their release. Some mandate a quick deletion of police video; some have no requirements to delete it at all. Some restrict the use of facial recognition software; most allow it. A technology meant for one purpose, once unleashed, is soon used for many others.", "One commissioner, Jay Hollingsworth of the Mohegan tribe, the chairman of the John T. Williams Organizing Committee, named for a hard-of-hearing Native American whose 2010 shooting was partly captured on dashcam, answered Keenan\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d question simply: Bodycams should always be on. To his right, another commissioner, Jennifer Shaw, the deputy director of the A.C.L.U. of Washington, said that she agreed in theory but that her organization supported the cameras only if they were used exclusively for police accountability. Next, Ron Smith, a detective who then headed the Seattle Police Officers\u2019 Guild, said that he was also in favor of bodycams because he believed they would exonerate officers from complaints. But the cameras went into homes and on lunch and bathroom breaks, and officers absolutely had to be able to switch them on and off.", "At the end of the table were two activists, Marissa Johnson and Dan Bash. Johnson later became nationally known for leaping onstage at a Bernie Sanders rally, claiming the candidate\u2019s microphone and telling him he needed to do more to acknowledge the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThis conversation about bodycams is a complete and utter farce,\u201d she said. Forget the policy details. She did not consent to being recorded at all. She did not trust the police to do the right thing with the footage. Most of all, she did not trust prosecutors to use it to prosecute officers. \u201cWhy do I need a home video of my abuse that\u2019s going to be filmed by my oppressor?\u201d she asked.", "An uncomfortable silence filled the room. Then Hollingsworth announced that the other panelists had made him change his mind, leaving the two employees of the Police Department, Wagers and Smith, two white men, the only people onstage who clearly supported bodycams. The mood became tense, and members of the crowd interrupted the next speaker and soon assumed control of the room, taking turns denouncing police brutality and glaring at Smith, who was eventually escorted to his car by another officer.", "Three weeks later, the commission, the voice of the people, called for Seattle to delay full deployment of bodycams until the state law could be rewritten. \u201cThis is a new technology,\u201d the commission said in a news release, \u201cwhich may have unintended consequences.\u201d", "Much of the moral case for bodycams, that they reduce police violence, rests on a single experiment: the 2012 Rialto study that Wagers referenced. Rialto is a city of almost 100,000 people, most of them Latino but with significant black and Pacific Islander minorities, that sits in the desert and sprawl east of Los Angeles. Its population is much smaller and more diverse than Seattle\u2019s, its police force is much smaller and its murder rate is significantly higher. Of its 115 sworn police officers at the time of the study, 54 regularly conducted patrols, and all 54 were issued body cameras courtesy of Taser. For a full year, half of the front-line officers on a given 12-hour shift were randomly assigned to wear their cameras, while the other half served as the control. The data from nearly 1,000 shifts and 50,000 hours of police-public interactions showed that when officers wore bodycams, they were less likely to use batons, Tasers, firearms and pepper spray or to have confrontations that resulted in police-dog bites, and they were far less likely to receive civilian complaints about their conduct.", "In an essay published shortly after the White House announced its $75 million in bodycam funding in 2014, two authors of the study, Barak Ariel and Alex Sutherland, hypothesized that it was not cameras alone that drove the positive results; it was the fact that before every interaction with a citizen, officers in the trial were required to announce that they were recording. There may have been a \u201cself-awareness effect\u201d: Both parties were reminded at the moment of contact that they were under surveillance and that they should behave accordingly. One question was whether the effect would hold up if officers did not announce the cameras\u2019 presence. Another was whether it would hold up when the cameras lost their novelty.", "Ariel and Sutherland also worried about anyone basing decisions on a single study, which, no matter how rigorous, could well be a fluke, \u201cthe statistical equivalent of \u2018luck,\u2019\u2009\u201d they wrote. The Rialto sample was small. The notable drop in citizen complaints, for instance, was from 28 in the yearlong period before the study to 3 while it was underway. At least 40 reasonably scientific studies have followed Rialto, but many, according to a recent survey carried out by George Mason University, have yet to be published.", "Rialto suggests a drop in the use of force. A study from Arizona suggests a drop in arrests but a rise in citations. A separate Arizona study, along with one from London, suggests a rise in arrests. When Temple University researchers recently sifted through a Washington Post database of 986 deadly shootings of civilians by police in 2015, they found that when officers wore body cameras, civilians were 3.64 percent more likely to die. The increase was more pronounced, 3.75 percent, in the deaths of African-Americans and Hispanics and a barely measurable 0.67 percent in the deaths of Caucasians and Asians. They hypothesized that a different kind of self-awareness was at work: Officers, aware of their bodycams and more certain their use of deadly force would be seen as justified, were less likely to hesitate.", "After Rialto, Ariel and Sutherland set out to replicate their influential study on a much larger scale, collaborating with eight large and small police departments covering two million citizens in the United States and Britain. Their resulting analysis of 2.2 million officer hours, published this May, seems to validate their concerns that Rialto offered an incomplete picture. It found that police use of force actually went up by an astonishing 71 percent when officers could turn their cameras on and off at will and went down (by 37 percent) only when they recorded nearly every interaction with the public from start to finish. A second analysis of the same data, published late last month, supports Rialto\u2019s finding that citizen complaints drop significantly, almost to zero, when bodycams are present, while underscoring the authors\u2019 warning that more research is needed to understand how and why and under what conditions. \u201cIt may be that in some places it\u2019s a bad idea to use body-worn cameras,\u201d Ariel said in announcing the May results, \u201cand the only way you can find that out is to keep doing these tests in different kinds of places.\u201d", "The Seattle Police Department introduced its new YouTube channel, \u201cS.P.D. BodyWornVideo,\u201d on Feb. 23, 2015, less than two weeks after the Community Police Commission warned about unintended consequences in its news release. Featuring footage from the pilot program, with the images automatically blurred and the audio muted, it was a national first, and tens of thousands of people tuned in. The earliest videos were of Seattle\u2019s explosive Martin Luther King Day demonstrations the previous month, and they appeared on the channel as a kind of fever dream. Protesters, rendered in fog and grayscale and digitally stripped of their voices, were mostly unrecognizable as they marched onto a freeway demanding justice for Michael Brown and were arrested and shackled on the ground and then trundled into police cruisers.", "The videos didn\u2019t shake the local opposition to bodycams, and they didn\u2019t meet the standards of the state Public Records Act \u2014 if asked, Seattle would have to provide more precisely redacted versions \u2014 but they met a national need for positive news about the police. The YouTube channel was featured on the \u201cToday Show,\u201d and the department\u2019s innovation was the subject of coverage, some skeptical and some not, by The Guardian, Vice News, \u201cMarketplace,\u201d \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and The New York Times. The tech press couldn\u2019t get enough. One well-reported article in the online publication Backchannel called Clemans \u201cthe body-cam hacker who schooled the police.\u201d", "Wagers began receiving calls and email from departments around the country. The future of policing, he saw, was now more than ever reliant on what technology the police could afford to buy from companies like those that built modern Seattle. He pledged that Clemans\u2019s code, once completed, would be open-source and freely shared so that smaller agencies, which didn\u2019t have the staff to handle video-records requests, let alone the money for bundled bodycam contracts, could stay on the cutting edge. In one overredaction test, the department processed 2,400 videos in three hours on rented Amazon Web Services computers in the cloud, a task that would have gummed up the public-disclosure unit of the Seattle Police for weeks had the files been redacted manually. The computer rental cost the department $1.20 \u2014 40 cents an hour \u2014 Wagers marveled. To meet the demands of the Public Records Act, all Clemans needed to do was get his algorithm to redact only faces and other private details, rather than the full frame.", "Clemans was now an employee: The department had offered him a six-month contract at $22.60 an hour. But when the pilot program ended in July, and the question of whether to expand it loomed, he still had not perfected his code. He was trying to solve a problem, mostly by himself, that teams of professional engineers at Taser and its rivals have yet to fully crack. Distracted, he noticed other inefficiencies at Police Headquarters and he felt increasingly compelled to fix them. After visiting the understaffed 911 center, then in the news for its slow response times, he came up with a new idea: a program that automatically highlighted the most pressing calls, allowing dispatchers to be more efficient. But the captain in charge of the 911 center didn\u2019t welcome his intrusion, and he belittled the idea at a tense late-August meeting brokered by their superiors. Clemans, by his own admission, \u201cgot really mad.\u201d He swore at the captain. He yelled until he had to be escorted from the building. And just like that, in an echo of his Space Needle blowup, he was exiled from headquarters. He made a threat on his way out: \u201cI\u2019m going to P.D.R.\u201d \u2014 public-disclosure request \u2014 \u201cthe [expletive] out of you,\u201d he shouted.", "In September 2015, when Seattle won a $600,000 Justice Department grant to expand the bodycam program to the rest of the police force, which the mayor pledged to more than match, Clemans wasn\u2019t there to help celebrate. He was working remotely, back in his bedroom or hunched over a laptop at the Starbucks he now frequented on the 40th floor of Columbia Center, the tallest building in town, where the views were stunning and free.", "Days after the grant announcement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch came to Seattle to declare it a national model for police reform. The federal monitor overseeing the consent decree, who had previously lauded the overredaction experiment when calling for rapid deployment of bodycams, now praised the department\u2019s systematic approach to investigating any use of force \u2014 a significant change from the cursory reporting of the past. Wagers, meanwhile, was helping Chief O\u2019Toole to select his replacement. He had by then been in Seattle and away from his wife and children for more than a year.", "On Oct. 29, 2015, a week after Wagers announced he was leaving the department, Clemans texted in his own resignation. He no longer believed the department could ever truly be transparent on its own, he told me. His time inside the department, far from co-opting him, had weaponized him after his blowup with the 911 captain: He knew even better which records to request. He wrote a new bot capable of sending the department up to 10,000 requests in 24 hours. He asked for 911 records, \u201ctables & columns of all databases,\u201d all front-facing dashcam video from 2014 and \u201call computer codes written by Tim Clemans.\u201d Over the next few days, he piled on, requesting \u201call roll-call notes,\u201d text records from the department\u2019s license-plate scanners, the source codes of key department software and \u201call Outlook calendars of supervisors, managers & command staff.\u201d He also started building a website where he would publish it all, which he called the People\u2019s NSA. He expanded his demands to include every public record in every format \u2014 paper, tape or digital \u2014 the City of Seattle had. He soon asked 39 neighboring cities for the same. By the end of 2015, according to a study on public-records requests he obtained via a public-records request, Clemans had filed 2,272 requests to the Seattle Police Department alone, making him again its No. 1 antagonist. One day at her office, Mary Perry showed me a printout of the latest ones, five pages long. \u201cWe\u2019re being crippled,\u201d she said. Wagers was on his way home, Clemans was making more demands than ever and she was back where she started.", "This summer, I joined Clemans at a Black Lives Matter march in Seattle. He was there to watch the police as protesters demanded justice for Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, whose deaths were captured not by bodycams but by citizens\u2019 phones.

Over the long term, Fox thinks it needs to get bigger. That thinking comes from Fox\u2019s unsuccessful $80 billion takeover bid for Time Warner in 2014.

Special board committees at both companies are evaluating the proposed reunification; the companies split in 2006.", "On Monday, some analysts and media executives said that they expected the AT&T-Time Warner deal to accelerate those considerations. The AT&T-Time Warner deal underscores the old industry adage that content is king, they said. The agreement also highlighted the need for entertainment companies to band together so that they would have more heft in negotiations with the larger and larger cable, satellite and wireless companies.", "But while such a deal may be crucial for the survival of Viacom, which has struggled mightily, the same may not be true for CBS, which is in more of a position of strength.

Because of a zoning quirk, about 30 percent of the third and fifth floors could not be built on.

Through friends, he met Mr. Barasch, a former marketing manager for Google.", "At that time, in 2009, the High Line, a freight railroad line converted to a park, had just opened on the west side of Manhattan.

Strawberries grew ripe enough to eat. Not all survived, though. Hop plants died and a coffee plant grew so spindly it was removed.", "Mr. Ramsey\u2019s favorite is a scrappy green ash tree that was found growing between two bricks on the rooftop in June and relocated below.

And what if mine is bad?", "RON: Credit scores are how lenders figure out whether to lend you money and what kind of interest rate to charge. It\u2019s based on your credit report, which shows how or if you\u2019ve paid your bills on time and how much you\u2019ve borrowed. It\u2019s also wrong a fair bit of the time.

What would I do then?", "RON: You\u2019d find a brokerage firm and set up an individual retirement account or a Roth I.R.A. there. Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity or Vanguard are good places to look.", "TIM: Staying on this idea of saving, I am finally at a place where I have saved a (tiny) amount of money in my savings account. But now, it\u2019s just kind of sitting there. What should I do with it?", "RON: No need to do anything with it as long as it\u2019s for short- or medium-term use. It\u2019s good to have an emergency fund in case some kind of unexpected something comes up. There are online savings accounts that earn about 1 percent, and that\u2019s a fine place to park your money since you know you\u2019ll get all of it back at some point.", "Some people do invest outside of their retirement accounts, but I\u2019d probably focus more on putting that money away for retirement or use it for paying down student loans, perhaps.", "TIM: Oof, you had to mention student loans here, didn\u2019t you? Fine, let\u2019s talk about student loans.", "RON: Sorry. Two-thirds of people coming out of college have them.", "TIM: I have about $13,000 left on a few student loans, each with around 5 to 7 percent interest. 1. Are those decent rates? Should I consider \u201crefinancing,\u201d which is a term I have heard many times but understood zero times? And 2. Is it better for my long-term financial health to pay off my student loans by increasing my monthly payments as much as I can, or is it better to save/invest in other ways?", "RON: Refinancing means taking those loans, turning them into one new loan and paying a single interest rate. That interest rate might be lower than 5 percent, if you have a good credit score. But it might not. Also, that new rate might be variable, which means it could change (go up, most likely) over time. Your current loans are probably fixed \u2014 the interest rate doesn\u2019t change. But with debt that small, a change in interest rates doesn\u2019t save you much money \u2014 and the new loan may tempt you with lower monthly payments over a longer period of time (that is, longer than it\u2019s supposed to take to pay off your current loans).", "So if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a bit of extra money, it\u2019s tough to know whether to put that toward a) a bigger emergency fund, maybe enough to pay three months of expenses if you lost your job or got injured, b) more retirement savings or c) paying down student loan debt faster. I wrote about it here.", "TIM: So let\u2019s talk about credit card rewards.", "RON: This one is making quite the splash now, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend it unless you\u2019re already a big spender.", "The most important thing \u2014 LET\u2019S USE THE ALL-CAPS KEY HERE \u2014 do not mess around with credit card rewards unless you\u2019re paying your bill on time (every month) and in full (every month). Late fees and interest charges will cost you more than you\u2019ll gain from any card reward.", "TIM: Is it a good strategy to use a rewards card on day-to-day purchases and pay off the balance every month?", "RON: Look, I do it, so it would be hypocritical of me to tell you not to.", "But there\u2019s some pretty good evidence that people who do all their everyday spending on cards spend more than they would if they used cash.", "That evidence comes from professors who ... still use their rewards cards, though! I wrote about them here.", "TIM: Yes, I can verify that theory.", "RON: Ha. Well, then, boring debit cards for you.", "The card industry is trying reallllly hard to get you to use credit instead of debit. Why? Two reasons. 1) The merchants pay more to the banks to accept their credit cards than they do to accept their debit cards, in general. 2) If you spend more than you have, then you start paying interest.

Antitrust officials have muscled up in recent years, blocking dozens of deals across industries including pharmaceuticals and retail. Other prominent telecommunications deals have imploded even after huge lobbying efforts, most notably Comcast\u2019s attempt to buy Time Warner Cable in 2014 and AT&T\u2019s bid in 2011 to buy T-Mobile, a cellular telephone competitor.", "Issues that led to the collapse of those deals seem even more prevalent now, as the nation closes out a presidential campaign that has featured candidates from both parties \u2014 most notably Donald J.

AT&T\u2019s storied lobbying operations were long led by Mr. Cicconi, who retired last month. Mr. Cicconi in the past worked closely with Wayne Watts, who served for decades at AT&T, including as general counsel, and retired last year.", "Together, Mr. Cicconi and Mr. Watts shepherded more than a half-dozen blockbuster mergers in the last two decades.", "The company is offering some clues about how it will position the deal. Unlike a \u201chorizontal\u201d merger, which unites competing companies in the same line of business, this transaction would not reduce the number of options for consumers, AT&T executives have said.", "AT&T also said it would not withhold Time Warner shows from competitors. It plans to create an advertising-based video business for mobile devices, similar to the ad business of the web giants Google and Facebook.", "The biggest advantage AT&T may have is the likelihood that the deal may face little scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory agency that typically gets involved if there are transfers of telecom or broadcast licenses. If Time Warner divests the one Atlanta broadcast station it owns, that would make the F.C.C.\u2019s jurisdiction moot. The merger would be reviewed under a new administration, potentially with new antitrust officials picked by the next president.", "Even so, it will not be easy. Michael J.

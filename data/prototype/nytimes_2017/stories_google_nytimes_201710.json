Pointing at the black cylindrical device, I explained that the speaker, also known as the Amazon Echo, was a bit like Siri but smarter. \u201cYou can ask it anything you want,\u201d I said nonchalantly.", "Grace leaned forward toward the speaker. \u201cHello, Alexa, my name is Gracie,\u201d she said. \u201cWill it rain today?\u201d The turquoise rim glowed into life. \u201cCurrently, it is 60 degrees,\u201d a perky female voice answered, assuring her it wouldn\u2019t rain.", "Over the next hour, Grace figured out she could ask Alexa to play her favorite music from the film \u201cSing.\u201d She realized Alexa could tell jokes, do math or provide interesting facts. \u201cHey, Alexa, what do brown horses eat?\u201d And she soon discovered a whole new level of power. \u201cAlexa, shut up,\u201d she barked, then looked a little sheepish and asked me if it was O.K. to be rude to her. So she thought the speaker had feelings?", "By the next morning, Alexa was the first \u201cperson\u201d Grace said hello to as she bounded into the kitchen wearing her pink fluffy dressing gown. My preschooler who can\u2019t yet ride a bike or read a book had also quickly mastered that she could buy things with the bot\u2019s help, or at least try to.", "\u201cAlexa, buy me blueberries,\u201d she commanded. Grace, of course, had no idea that Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, was the corporate behemoth behind the helpful female assistant, and that smoothing the way when it came to impulse buys was right up Alexa\u2019s algorithmic alley.", "Grace\u2019s easy embrace of Alexa was slightly amusing but also alarming. My small experiment, with my daughter as the guinea pig, drove home to me the profound shift in our relationship with technology. For generations, our trust in it has gone no further than feeling confident the machine or mechanism will do what it\u2019s supposed or expected to do, nothing more, nothing less. We trust a washing machine to clean our clothes or an A.T.M. to dispense money, but we don\u2019t expect to form a relationship with them or call them by name.", "Today, we\u2019re no longer trusting machines just to do something, but to decide what to do and when to do it. The next generation will grow up in an age where it\u2019s normal to be surrounded by autonomous agents, with or without cute names. The Alexas of the world will make a raft of decisions for my kids and others like them as they proceed through life \u2014 everything from whether to have mac and cheese or a green bowl for dinner to the perfect gift for a friend\u2019s birthday to what to do to improve their mood or energy and even advice on whom they should date. In time, the question for them won\u2019t be, \u201cShould we trust robots?\u201d but \u201cDo we trust them too much?\u201d", "With some trepidation, I watched my daughter gaily hand her decisions over. \u201cAlexa, what should I do today?\u201d Grace asked in her singsong voice on Day 3. It wasn\u2019t long before she was trusting her with the big choices. \u201cAlexa, what should I wear today? My pink or my sparkly dress?\u201d", "In April, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a $199 Alexa add-on that features a hands-free selfie camera controlled by your voice. The device doesn\u2019t just hear you, it sees you. According to Amazon, the Style Check feature uses \u201cmachine-learning algorithms with advice from fashion specialists\u201d to judge different outfits, awarding them an overall rating to decide which is \u201cbetter\u201d based on \u201ccurrent trends and what flatters you.\u201d", "The images it takes of you happen to be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud until you delete them. And while the fashion-savvy assistant helps you decide what to wear, it has an ulterior motive: to sell you clothing, including choices from one of Amazon\u2019s own apparel lines, such as Lark & Ro and North Eleven, started in 2016.", "It\u2019s these kinds of intersections \u2013 like this small collision between robot \u201chelpfulness\u201d and a latent commercial agenda \u2014 that can make parents like me start to wonder about the ethical niceties of this brave new bot world. Alexa, after all, is not \u201cAlexa.\u201d She\u2019s a corporate algorithm in a black box.", "Grace doesn\u2019t like it when I tell her what to wear. How would she feel about Alexa judging her? Would she see it as helpful or crushing? This could well be one of our parenting tasks in the near future \u2014 preparing our children for the psychological repercussions of such personal interactions with computer \u201cpeople.\u201d", "Still, the next generation is likely to feel very differently about machines than we do. In a study conducted by M.I.T. Media Lab, 27 children, aged between 3 and 10, interacted with A.I. devices and toys including Alexa, Google Home, Julie (a chatbot) and, finally, Cozmo (a robot in the form of a toy bulldozer). The researchers asked the children how they felt about the devices in terms of intelligence, personality and trust. The younger children seemed to see the agents as real people and asked them personal questions: \u201cHey, Alexa, how old are you?\u201d and \u201cWhat are you?\u201d Some thought the device had multiple personalities. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know the answer,\u201d said one child, wisely. \u201cAsk the other Alexa.\u201d", "Almost 80 percent of the children thought Alexa would always tell the truth. Some of the children believed they could teach the devices something useful, like how to make a paper plane, suggesting they felt a genuine, give-and-take relationship with the machines.", "How do we teach our children to question not only the security and privacy implications but also the ethical and commercial intentions of a device designed by marketers?", "Our kids are going to need to know where and when it is appropriate to put their trust in computer code alone. I watched Grace hand over her trust to Alexa quickly. There are few checks and balances to deter children from doing just that, not to mention very few tools to help them make informed decisions about A.I. advice. And isn\u2019t helping Gracie learn how to make decisions about what to wear \u2014 and many more even important things in life \u2014 my job? I decided to retire Alexa to the closet."], "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/13/opinion/sunday/Silicon-Valley-Is-Not-Your-Friend.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/07/opinion/sunday/who-invented-zero.html": ["Carbon dating of an ancient Indian document, the Bakhshali manuscript, has recently placed the first written occurrence of the number zero in the third or fourth century A.D., about 500 years earlier than previously believed. While the news has no practical bearing on the infrastructure of zeros (and ones) underlying our high-tech civilization, it does remind us how indebted we are for this invention. But to whom is this debt owed? And how should it be repaid?", "Chauvinistic politicians might loudly trumpet India\u2019s role (as they have, more controversially, in the case of the Pythagorean theorem), but the history of zero remains unsettled enough to still be the subject of continuing quests. The Babylonians used it as a placeholder, an idea later developed independently by the Mayans. The Chinese, at some point in time, indicated it by an empty space in their counting-rod system. Some claim the Greeks flirted with the idea but, finding the concept of the void too frightening in their Aristotelian framework, passed it on to the Indians. The Hindus are generally acknowledged as being the first to formulate it as an independent number \u2014 the key to using it in mathematical calculations or binary code. What\u2019s clear is that this history is dominated by non-European civilizations. Truly an alt-right nightmare.", "Obviously, there were no intellectual property rights in force back then. Had there been a patent office, it might have ruled, as courts do now, that mathematical advances uncover pre-existing knowledge rather than create anything new \u2014 and are hence unpatentable. The conundrum of whether mathematics is discovered or invented is as old as Plato. Certainly, zero displays this duality: The void is as old as time, but it was a human innovation to harness it with a symbol.", "In recognition of this innovation, and ignoring all practicalities, suppose someone, somehow, had figured out how to put a price tag on zero. The royalties generated would be staggering \u2014 imagine the tab for just your personal use alone! This might lead to a significant redistribution of wealth, most of it going to the developing world.", "One difficulty is splitting the payments, since no one could claim exclusive \u201cownership\u201d of zero\u2019s creation. I asked my \u201cHistory of Mathematics\u201d class to come up with an exact breakdown based on zero\u2019s provenance, something that, coincidentally, we had just discussed when the carbon dating news broke. Not unexpectedly, India fared best, with 42 percent of the proceeds, though students directed it be split with neighboring countries \u2014 after all, the manuscript was found in what is now Pakistan (I can already hear the Indian ministers howl their protests).", "Babylon ended up with 18 percent, which if allotted to Iraq, the present-day country of its location, might be just compensation for the years of war endured. Greece came next, with a surprising 15 percent \u2014 perhaps my class felt the country was getting shortchanged for all its other mathematical contributions. The Mayans raked in 14 percent, which means Mexico would be rolling in so much money from its share that it might be the one clamoring (and paying) for a wall. My class\u2019s most left-leaning group declared it wouldn\u2019t disburse the money at all, \u201cso as not to encourage capitalism.\u201d", "Of course, the exercise was pure fantasy for many reasons; any compensatory scheme would be dead on arrival based on the mention of \u201creparations.\u201d And yet it highlighted the fact that there were cultures and peoples that parented zero, whose descendants may not be doing as well now. If not financial recompense, is at least some enhanced ethical responsibility toward them owed?", "If so, the primary onus might fall on tech companies, arguably the biggest users of this resource. Right now, their prize target is India, with Microsoft, Google and Facebook all vying to bring its enormous population online. These giants might point out that they\u2019re already being altruistic by offering free connectivity, through schemes that will plug in rural areas, vitalize the economy and transform the country \u2014 and just happen to add hundreds of millions of potential customers to their rosters for a variety of ads and e-products. Could it be a coincidence that Microsoft, for instance, has also been investing heavily in future cloud services, cybersecurity and e-commerce for India?", "Think of it. The companies will use the indigenously developed resource of zeros and ones (the Arabs got their numerals from India, after all), package them into new services and products, and sell them back. India has lived through such irony before. The British Empire took her raw cotton and sold it back as finished garments, destroying the local textile industry and helping lower India\u2019s share of the world gross domestic product to 3 percent from 23 percent.", "Fortunately, the parallel flounders. The finished e-products will mostly be manufactured in India, even if backed by foreign investment. Also, the country is wiser: It will not succumb easily to a new cyber-colonialism. Last year, under a broader \u201cnet neutrality\u201d decision, the government banned Facebook\u2019s \u201cFree Basics\u201d plan, which offered free Wi-Fi but only to websites of the company\u2019s choosing (Facebook, undeterred, is already marketing a replacement). This year, it also declined a bid from Microsoft to offer connectivity through old television bands. Instead, under pressure from Indian cellular operators, the bands will be auctioned off.", "Whether Indian tech companies will prevail remains to be seen. What\u2019s clear is that vigorous market competition is underway to control all those zeros and ones. Despite my liberal student group\u2019s disapproval, zero encourages capitalistic forces, after all.", "In fact, zero is essential to much of human endeavor; it has become a fundamental part of our legacy, too seemingly immutable for any kind of compensatory reckoning. And yet the Bakhshali manuscript reminds us that zero wasn\u2019t always at hand. Rather, it was the intellectual product of cultures perhaps far different from our own, of peoples and regions that may have subsided but could once again rise to dominance."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/briefing/catalonia-japan-mugabe.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

Mr. Levandowski left Google six months before Uber\u2019s acquisition of Ottomotto, and has been at the center of accusations that he stole information about Google\u2019s self-driving technology and used it at Uber.", "The due diligence report, conducted by the cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg from March 2016 to August 2016, paints one of the clearest pictures of the timeline of events leading up to Uber\u2019s acquisition of Ottomotto and exactly how much Uber knew of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s attempts to retain and access information taken from Google.", "The document\u2019s release is the latest salvo in the lawsuit between the two biggest players in the nascent self-driving car industry.

Waymo has asked for the court to postpone the trial, scheduled for Oct. 10, as it looks into the report and other recent disclosures from Uber.", "But the report does not appear to clearly answer a main question in the case: Whether or not Uber used any of the designs or technology Mr. Levandowski took with him from Google in Uber\u2019s own self-driving car project.", "What the report details instead is a history of Mr. Levandowski\u2019s meeting with Uber executives while he was still employed at Google but suggesting working together in some capacity. Mr. Levandowski eventually partnered with Lior Ron, a Google colleague, and pitched the idea for Ottomotto to a group of Google employees over barbecues and a ski trip to Lake Tahoe.

What is not as well known is that they are also testing vehicles inside computer simulations of these same cities. Virtual cars, equipped with the same software as the real thing, spend thousands of hours driving their digital worlds.", "Think of it as a way of identifying flaws in the way the cars operate without endangering real people. If a car makes a mistake on a simulated drive, engineers can tweak its software accordingly, laying down new rules of behavior. On Monday, Waymo, the autonomous car company that spun out of Google, is expected to show off its simulator tests when it takes a group of reporters to its secretive testing center in California\u2019s Central Valley.", "Researchers are also developing methods that would allow cars to actually learn new behavior from these simulations, gathering skills more quickly than human engineers could ever lay them down with explicit software code. \u201cSimulation is a tremendous thing,\u201d said Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, one of the artificial intelligence labs exploring this kind of virtual training for autonomous vehicles and other robotics.", "These methods are part of a sweeping effort to accelerate the development of autonomous cars through so-called machine learning. When Google designed its first self-driving cars nearly a decade ago, engineers built most of the software line by line, carefully coding each tiny piece of behavior. But increasingly, thanks to recent improvements in computing power, autonomous carmakers are embracing complex algorithms that can learn tasks on their own, like identifying pedestrians on the roadways or predicting future events.", "\u201cThis is why we think we can move fast,\u201d said Luc Vincent, who recently started an autonomous vehicle project at Lyft, Uber\u2019s main rival. \u201cThis stuff didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago when Google started.\u201d", "There are still questions hanging over this research. Most notably, because these algorithms learn by analyzing more information than any human ever could, it is sometimes difficult to audit their behavior and understand why they make particular decisions. But in the years to come, machine learning will be essential to the continued progress of autonomous vehicles.", "Today\u2019s vehicles are not nearly as autonomous as they may seem. After 10 years of research, development and testing, Google\u2019s cars are poised to offer public rides on the streets of Arizona. Waymo, which operates under Google\u2019s parent company, is preparing to start a taxi service near Phoenix, according to a recent report, and unlike other services, it will not put a human behind the wheel as a backup. But its cars will still be on a tight leash.", "For now, if it doesn\u2019t carry a backup driver, any autonomous vehicle will probably be limited to a small area with large streets, little precipitation, and relatively few pedestrians. And it will drive at low speeds, often waiting for extended periods before making a left-hand turn or merging into traffic without the help of a stoplight or street sign \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t avoid these situations altogether.", "At the leading companies, the belief is that these cars can eventually handle more difficult situations with help from continued development and testing, new sensors that can provide a more detailed view of the surrounding world and machine learning.", "Waymo and many of its rivals have already embraced deep neural networks, complex algorithms that can learn tasks by analyzing data. By analyzing photos of pedestrians, for example, a neural network can learn to identify a pedestrian. These kinds of algorithms are also helping to identify street signs and lane markers, predict what will happen next on the road, and plan routes forward.", "The trouble is that this requires enormous amounts of data collected by cameras, radar and other sensors that document real-world objects and situations. And humans must label this data, identifying pedestrians, street signs and the like. Gathering and labeling data describing every conceivable situation is an impossibility. Data on accidents, for instance, is hard to come by. This is where simulations can help.", "Recently, Waymo unveiled a roadway simulator it calls Carcraft. Today, the company said, this simulator provides a way of testing its cars at a scale that is not possible in the real world. Its cars can spend far more time on virtual roads than the real thing. Presumably, like other companies, Waymo is also exploring ways that its algorithms can actually learn new behavior from this kind of simulator.", "Mr. Pratt said Toyota is already using images of simulated roadways to train neural networks, and this approach has yielded promising results. In other words, the simulations are similar enough to the physical world to reliably train the systems that operate the cars.", "Part of the advantage with a simulator is that researchers have complete control over it. They need not spend time and money labeling images \u2014 and potentially making mistakes with these labels. \u201cYou have ground truth,\u201d Mr. Pratt explained. \u201cYou know where every car is. You know where every pedestrian is. You know where every bicycler is. You know the weather.\u201d", "Others are exploring a more complex method called reinforcement learning. This a major area of research inside many of the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence labs, including DeepMind (the London-based lab owned by Google), the Berkeley AI Research Lab, and OpenAI (the San Francisco-based lab founded by Tesla\u2019s chief executive Elon Musk and others). These labs are building algorithms that allow machines to learn tasks inside virtual worlds through intensive trial and error.", "DeepMind used this method to build a machine that could play the ancient game Go better than any human. In essence, the machine played thousands upon thousands of Go games against itself, carefully recording which moves proved successful and which didn\u2019t. And now, DeepMind and other leading labs are using similar techniques in building machines that can play complex video games like StarCraft.", "That may seem frivolous. But if machines can navigate these virtual worlds, they can make their way through the physical world.", "Inside Uber\u2019s autonomous car operation, for example, researchers have trained systems to play the popular game Grand Theft Auto, with an eye toward applying these methods, eventually, to real world cars. Training systems in simulations of physical locations is the next step.", "Bridging the gap between the virtual and the physical is no easy task, Mr. Pratt said. And companies must also ensure that algorithms don\u2019t learn unexpected or harmful behavior while learning on their own. That is a big worry among artificial intelligence researchers.", "For this and other reasons, companies like Toyota and Waymo are not building these cars solely around machine learning. They also hand-coded software in more traditional ways in an effort to guarantee certain behavior. Waymo cars don\u2019t learn to stop at stop lights, for example. There is a hard and fast rule that they stop.", "But the industry is headed toward more machine learning, not less. It provides a better way to train the car to do tasks like identifying lane makers, said Waymo\u2019s vice president of engineering Dmitri Dolgov.

It happened early in his junior year of high school, while he was taking three Advanced Placement classes, running on his school\u2019s cross-country team and traveling to Model United Nations conferences. It was a lot to handle, but Jake \u2014 the likable, hard-working oldest sibling in a suburban North Carolina family \u2014 was the kind of teenager who handled things. Though he was not prone to boastfulness, the fact was he had never really failed at anything.", "Not coincidentally, failure was one of Jake\u2019s biggest fears. He worried about it privately; maybe he couldn\u2019t keep up with his peers, maybe he wouldn\u2019t succeed in life. The relentless drive to avoid such a fate seemed to come from deep inside him. He considered it a strength.", "Jake\u2019s parents knew he could be high-strung; in middle school, they sent him to a therapist when he was too scared to sleep in his own room. But nothing prepared them for the day two years ago when Jake, then 17, seemingly \u201cran 150 miles per hour into a brick wall,\u201d his mother said. He refused to go to school and curled up in the fetal position on the floor. \u201cI just can\u2019t take it!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand!\u201d", "Jake was right \u2014 his parents didn\u2019t understand. Jake didn\u2019t really understand, either. But he also wasn\u2019t good at verbalizing what he thought he knew: that going to school suddenly felt impossible, that people were undoubtedly judging him, that nothing he did felt good enough. \u201cAll of a sudden I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so afraid.\u201d His tall, lanky frame succumbed, too. His stomach hurt. He had migraines. \u201cYou know how a normal person might have their stomach lurch if they walk into a classroom and there\u2019s a pop quiz?\u201d he told me. \u201cWell, I basically started having that feeling all the time.\u201d", "Alarmed, Jake\u2019s parents sent him to his primary-care physician, who prescribed Prozac, an antidepressant often given to anxious teenagers. It was the first of many medications that Jake, who asked that his last name not be used, would try over the next year. But none seemed to work \u2014 and some made a bad situation worse. An increase in dosage made Jake \u201cmuch more excited, acting strangely and almost manic,\u201d his father wrote in a journal in the fall of 2015. A few weeks later, Jake locked himself in a bathroom at home and tried to drown himself in the bathtub.", "He was hospitalized for four days, but soon after he returned home, he started hiding out in his room again. He cried, slept, argued with his parents about going to school and mindlessly surfed the internet on his phone. The more school he missed, the more anxious he felt about missing school. And the more anxious he felt, the more hopeless and depressed he became. He had long wanted to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but now that felt like wishful thinking.", "Not every day was bad. During spring break in 2016, Jake\u2019s father wrote: \u201cJake was relaxed and his old sarcastic, personable, witty self.\u201d A week later, though, Jake couldn\u2019t get through a school day without texting his mother to pick him up or hiding out in the nurse\u2019s office. At home, Jake threatened suicide again. His younger siblings were terrified. \u201cIt was the depth of hell,\u201d his mother told me.", "That summer, after two more hospitalizations, Jake\u2019s desperate parents sent him to Mountain Valley in New Hampshire, a residential treatment facility and one of a growing number of programs for acutely anxious teenagers. Over the last decade, anxiety has overtaken depression as the most common reason college students seek counseling services. In its annual survey of students, the American College Health Association found a significant increase \u2014 to 62 percent in 2016 from 50 percent in 2011 \u2014 of undergraduates reporting \u201coverwhelming anxiety\u201d in the previous year. Surveys that look at symptoms related to anxiety are also telling. In 1985, the Higher Education Research Institute at U.C.L.A. began asking incoming college freshmen if they \u201cfelt overwhelmed by all I had to do\u201d during the previous year. In 1985, 18 percent said they did. By 2010, that number had increased to 29 percent. Last year, it surged to 41 percent.", "Those numbers \u2014 combined with a doubling of hospital admissions for suicidal teenagers over the last 10 years, with the highest rates occurring soon after they return to school each fall \u2014 come as little surprise to high school administrators across the country, who increasingly report a glut of anxious, overwhelmed students. While it\u2019s difficult to tease apart how much of the apparent spike in anxiety is related to an increase in awareness and diagnosis of the disorder, many of those who work with young people suspect that what they\u2019re seeing can\u2019t easily be explained away. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had kids who didn\u2019t want to come in the door or who were worried about things,\u201d says Laurie Farkas, who was until recently director of student services for the Northampton public schools in Massachusetts. \u201cBut there\u2019s just been a steady increase of severely anxious students.\u201d", "For the teenagers who arrive at Mountain Valley, a nonprofit program that costs $910 a day and offers some need-based assistance, the center is usually a last resort after conventional therapy and medications fail. The young people I met there suffered from a range of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Though OCD and PTSD are considered anxiety disorders at Mountain Valley and other treatment centers, they were moved into separate categories in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.)", "Mountain Valley teenagers spend a lot of time analyzing \u2014 and learning to talk back to \u2014 their anxious thoughts. During one group session in the summer of 2016 in a sunlit renovated barn with couches, a therapist named Sharon McCallie-Steller instructed everyone to write down three negative beliefs about themselves. That\u2019s an easy exercise for anxious young people (\u201cOnly three?\u201d one girl quipped), but McCallie-Steller complicated the assignment by requiring the teenagers to come up with a \u201cstrong and powerful response\u201d to each negative thought.", "She asked for volunteers. First, residents would share their negative beliefs and rebuttals with the group. Then others would act those out, culminating in a kind of public performance of private teenage insecurity.", "Jake raised his hand. By then, he was in his third month at Mountain Valley, and he looked considerably less anxious than several of the newcomers, including one who sat slumped on a couch with his head in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m free to play the part of terrible, evil thoughts for anyone who needs them,\u201d Jake said with a smile. He had already spent weeks challenging his own thinking, which often persuaded him that if he failed a single quiz at school, \u201cthen I\u2019ll get a bad grade in the class, I won\u2019t get into the college I want, I won\u2019t get a good job and I\u2019ll be a total failure.\u201d", "At Mountain Valley, Jake learned mindfulness techniques, took part in art therapy and equine therapy and, most important, engaged in exposure therapy, a treatment that incrementally exposes people to what they fear. The therapists had quickly figured out that Jake was afraid of failure above all else, so they devised a number of exercises to help him learn to tolerate distress and imperfection. On a group outing to nearby Dartmouth College, for example, Jake\u2019s therapist suggested he strike up conversations with strangers and tell them he didn\u2019t have the grades to get into the school. The college application process was a source of particular anxiety for Jake, and the hope was that he would learn that he could talk about college without shutting down \u2014 and that his value as a person didn\u2019t depend on where he went to school.", "Though two months in rural New Hampshire hadn\u2019t cured Jake of anxiety, he had made significant progress, and the therapy team was optimistic about his return home for his senior year. Until then, Jake wanted to help other Mountain Valley teenagers face their fears.", "Among them was Jillian, a 16-year-old who, when she wasn\u2019t overwhelmed with anxiety, came across as remarkably poised and adultlike, the kind of teenager you find yourself talking to as if she were a graduate student in psychology. Jillian, who also asked that her last name not be used, came to Mountain Valley after two years of only intermittently going to school. She suffered from social anxiety (made worse by cyberbullying from classmates) and emetophobia, a fear of vomit that can be so debilitating that people will sometimes restrict what they eat and refuse to leave the house, lest they encounter someone with a stomach flu.", "Jillian listened as Jake and other peers \u2014 who, in reality, liked her very much \u2014 voiced her insecurities: \u201cI can\u2019t believe how insignificant Jillian is.\u201d \u201cI mean, for the first three weeks, I thought her name was Susan.\u201d \u201cIf she left tomorrow, maybe we wouldn\u2019t even miss her.\u201d", "At the last one, Jillian\u2019s shoulders caved, and her eyes watered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she said, looking meekly at McCallie-Steller.", "\u201cIf it\u2019s too much, you can stop,\u201d the therapist said, but Jillian considered the offer only long enough to reject it. She straightened her back. \u201cNo, I feel like I need to do this,\u201d she announced. \u201cI have a week and a half left. If I can\u2019t get through something like this here ...\u201d", "Her voice trailed off, but the implication was clear: The real world would be much more anxiety producing \u2014 and much less forgiving.", "Anxiety is the most common mental-health disorder in the United States, affecting nearly one-third of both adolescents and adults, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. But unlike depression, with which it routinely occurs, anxiety is often seen as a less serious problem.", "\u201cAnxiety is easy to dismiss or overlook, partially because everyone has it to some degree,\u201d explained Philip Kendall, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple University in Philadelphia. It has an evolutionary purpose, after all; it helps us detect and avoid potentially dangerous situations. Highly anxious people, though, have an overactive fight-or-flight response that perceives threats where there often are none.", "But sometimes there are good reasons to feel anxious. For many young people, particularly those raised in abusive families or who live in neighborhoods besieged by poverty or violence, anxiety is a rational reaction to unstable, dangerous circumstances. At the Youth Anxiety Center\u2019s clinic in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which serves mostly poor and working-class Hispanic youth, teenagers would object to the definition of anxiety I heard often at Mountain Valley: \u201cThe overestimation of danger and the underestimation of our ability to cope.\u201d", "\u201cThe fears can be very real for our kids,\u201d explained Carolina Zerrate, the clinic\u2019s medical director. \u201cOftentimes their neighborhoods are not safe, their streets are not safe and their families can feel unsafe if there\u2019s a history of trauma and abuse.\u201d The contemporary political climate can also feel \u201cincredibly unsafe for the community of kids we serve,\u201d Zerrate adds, explaining that many have undocumented family members.", "And yet addressing anxiety is low on the priority list in many economically disadvantaged communities. Kids who \u201cact out\u201d are often labeled defiant or aggressive, while those who keep to themselves \u2014 anxiety specialists call them \u201csilent sufferers\u201d \u2014 are overlooked or mistaken for being shy. \u201cIf you go to a public school in a struggling urban area, teachers will talk about drugs, crime, teen pregnancy, violence,\u201d Kendall says. \u201cWhen you start to talk about anxiety, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, those are the kids we like!\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Teenagers raised in more affluent communities might seemingly have less to feel anxious about. But Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University who has studied distress and resilience in both well-off and disadvantaged teenagers, has found that privileged youths are among the most emotionally distressed young people in America. \u201cThese kids are incredibly anxious and perfectionistic,\u201d she says, but there\u2019s \u201ccontempt and scorn for the idea that kids who have it all might be hurting.\u201d", "For many of these young people, the biggest single stressor is that they \u201cnever get to the point where they can say, \u2018I\u2019ve done enough, and now I can stop,\u2019\u2009\u201d Luthar says. \u201cThere\u2019s always one more activity, one more A.P. class, one more thing to do in order to get into a top college. Kids have a sense that they\u2019re not measuring up. The pressure is relentless and getting worse.\u201d", "It\u2019s tempting to blame helicopter parents with their own anxiety issues for that pressure (and therapists who work with teenagers sometimes do), but several anxiety experts pointed to an important shift in the last few years. \u201cTeenagers used to tell me, \u2018I just need to get my parents off my back,\u2019\u2009\u201d recalls Madeline Levine, a founder of Challenge Success, a Stanford University-affiliated nonprofit that works on school reform and student well-being. \u201cNow so many students have internalized the anxiety. The kids at this point are driving themselves crazy.\u201d", "Though there are cultural differences in how this kind of anguish manifests, there\u2019s considerable overlap among teenagers from different backgrounds. Many are anxious about school and how friends or teachers perceive them. Some obsess about family conflicts. Teenagers with OCD tend to worry excessively about what foods they should eat, diseases they might contract or whatever happens to be in the news that week. Stephanie Eken, a psychiatrist and the regional medical director for Rogers Behavioral Health, which runs several teenage-anxiety outpatient programs across the country and an inpatient program in Wisconsin, told me that in the last few years she has heard more kids than ever worry about terrorism. \u201cThey wonder about whether it\u2019s safe to go to a movie theater,\u201d she said.", "When I asked Eken about other common sources of worry among highly anxious kids, she didn\u2019t hesitate: social media. Anxious teenagers from all backgrounds are relentlessly comparing themselves with their peers, she said, and the results are almost uniformly distressing.", "Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids\u2019 digital habits \u2014 round-the-clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers \u2014 were partly to blame for their children\u2019s struggles. To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree. At Mountain Valley, I listened as a college student went on a philosophical rant about his generation\u2019s relationship to social media. \u201cI don\u2019t think we realize how much it\u2019s affecting our moods and personalities,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media is a tool, but it\u2019s become this thing that we can\u2019t live without but that\u2019s making us crazy.\u201d", "In his case, he had little doubt that social media made him more self-conscious. \u201cIn high school, I\u2019d constantly be judging my self-worth online,\u201d he told me, recalling his tortured relationship with Facebook. \u201cI would think, Oh, people don\u2019t want to see me on their timeline.\u201d", "While smartphones can provoke anxiety, they can also serve as a handy avoidance strategy. At the height of his struggles, Jake spent hours at a time on his phone at home or at school. \u201cIt was a way for me not to think about classes and college, not to have to talk to people,\u201d he said. Jake\u2019s parents became so alarmed that they spoke to his psychiatrist about it and took his phone away a few hours each night.", "At a workshop for parents last fall at the NW Anxiety Institute in Portland, Ore., Kevin Ashworth, the clinical director, warned them of the \u201cillusion of control and certainty\u201d that smartphones offer anxious young people desperate to manage their environments. \u201cTeens will go places if they feel like they know everything that will happen, if they know everyone who will be there, if they can see who\u2019s checked in online,\u201d Ashworth told the parents. \u201cBut life doesn\u2019t always come with that kind of certainty, and they\u2019re never practicing the skill of rolling with the punches, of walking into an unknown or awkward social situation and learning that they can survive it.\u201d", "Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who researches adolescent mental health and psychological differences among generations, used to be skeptical of those who sounded an alarm about teenage internet use. \u201cIt seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens, and there wasn\u2019t much evidence for it,\u201d she told me. She searched for other possible explanations, including economic ones. But the timing of the spike in anxious and depressed teenagers since 2011, which she called one of the sharpest and most significant she has seen, is \u201call wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy was improving by the time the increase started.\u201d", "The more she looked for explanations, the more she kept returning to two seemingly unrelated trend lines \u2014 depression in teenagers and smartphone adoption. (There is significantly more data about depression than anxiety.) Since 2011, the trend lines increased at essentially the same rate. In her recent book \u201ciGen,\u201d and in an article in The Atlantic, Twenge highlights a number of studies exploring the connection between social media and unhappiness. \u201cThe use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s enough for an arrest \u2014 and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.\u201d", "Last fall, at a high school near the New Hampshire-Vermont border, I watched Lynn Lyons, a psychotherapist and author, deliver bad news to a packed auditorium of teachers and counselors. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting the job done,\u201d she said, pacing the stage at Fall Mountain Regional High School, where she had been asked to lead a professional-development training session about anxiety.", "More than a decade ago, the school would have been unlikely to invite her to speak. Anxiety was barely on the radar of most educators back then, according to Denise Pope, another founder of Challenge Success, the Stanford-affiliated nonprofit. Pope remembers facing skepticism when she sounded the alarm about growing anxiety among teenagers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to convince them anymore,\u201d she told me. \u201cSchools are coming to us, eager for help.\u201d", "A gregarious speaker, Lyons kept her audience entertained by calling anxiety \u201cthe cult leader\u201d \u2014 for its ability to convince people of falsehoods about themselves \u2014 and telling funny stories about overinvolved parents. But her main point was clear: In a seemingly well-meaning effort to help kids avoid what makes them anxious, administrators actually make anxiety worse. \u201cAnxiety is all about the avoidance of uncertainty and discomfort,\u201d Lyons explained. \u201cWhen we play along, we don\u2019t help kids learn to cope or problem-solve in the face of unexpected events.\u201d", "She pointed to the increasing use of \u201c504 plans,\u201d a popular educational tool that allows for academic accommodations for students with physical or mental disabilities. Though 504 plans for anxiety vary by student, a typical one might allow a teenager to take more time on homework and tests, enter the school through a back door \u2014 to avoid the chaos of the main entrance \u2014 and leave a classroom when feeling anxious.", "Lyons believes in the necessity of 504 plans, and she is in agreement with many of the recommendations of Challenge Success, including later school start times, less homework and more project-based learning. But Lyons worries that too many 504 plans are \u201cavoidance-based and teach zero skills.\u201d She gave the example of a plan that allows a student to leave a classroom anytime he feels overwhelmed. Often, a teenager \u201ccan go wherever he wants and stay there for as long as he thinks he needs,\u201d she said. Instead, she argued, a school should have a policy in place for the student to seek out a guidance counselor or nurse and do some role-playing that helps the student \u201cexternalize his worry,\u201d similar to how Mountain Valley teenagers are taught to observe their thinking and talk back to it. Then the student should return to his regular classroom as soon as possible, Lyons said.", "\u201cIf anxiety could talk, it would say, \u2018You know, let\u2019s just get out of here. We don\u2019t have to do this!\u2019\u2009\u201d Lyons said from the stage. \u201cBut in order to retrain the brain, in order to create that message that says that even though I\u2019m uncomfortable I can do this, we need to stop treating these anxious kids like they\u2019re so frail, like they can\u2019t handle things.\u201d", "Lyons sees a connection between how some schools deal with anxious students and what she worries is a generation of young people increasingly insistent on safe spaces \u2014 and who believe their feelings should be protected at all costs. \u201cKids are being given some really dangerous messages these days about the fact that they can\u2019t handle being triggered, that they shouldn\u2019t have to bear witness to anything that makes them uncomfortable and that their external environments should bend to and accommodate their needs,\u201d she told me.", "Among many teachers and administrators I spoke to, one word \u2014 \u201cresiliency\u201d \u2014 kept coming up. More and more students struggle to recover from minor setbacks and aren\u2019t \u201cequipped to problem-solve or advocate for themselves effectively,\u201d a school counselor in suburban Oregon told me. In the last few years, the counselor said, she has watched in astonishment as more students struggle with anxiety \u2014 and as more of those \u201cstop coming to school, because they just can\u2019t.\u201d", "Some schools have taken drastic measures to accommodate what one administrator called \u201cour more fragile students.\u201d At Roxbury High School in Roxbury Township, N.J., there are two dedicated classrooms for anxious teenagers, including one next to a mural of Edvard Munch\u2019s painting \u201cThe Scream.\u201d These students typically avoid the mammoth school cafeteria in favor of eating lunch in one of the classrooms, as they did on the day of my visit last May. They had just finished gym class, an anxiety-producing event for some even as the school did all it could to reimagine the concept. Music blasted throughout the gym as the teenagers halfheartedly played something vaguely approximating a game of volleyball. The ball was allowed to bounce once before being struck \u2014 not that anyone was keeping score.", "I couldn\u2019t help wondering what Lyons, and other therapists I spoke to who worry that schools inadvertently worsen anxiety, would think of this approach. Some of the programs\u2019 teenagers hoped to go to college, where no special classrooms would await them. How was this preparing them for that?", "\u201cSome will say that this feeds the monster,\u201d concedes Patricia Hovey, director of special services at Roxbury High. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to start where the kids are, not where you are or where you want them to be. We\u2019ve got to get them in the building. Many of our students simply don\u2019t come to school if they have to spend all day in\u201d general-education classes. Once the students are in school, Hovey explained, staff members can help them build the confidence and skills to eventually transition to Roxbury\u2019s regular classes \u2014 and stand a chance at navigating college or a job once they graduate.", "Even with the promise of a special classroom, getting anxious kids to Roxbury High each morning demands a herculean effort from the program\u2019s teachers and therapists. During my visit, I watched them text and call several no-show students in an effort to coax them out of bed. They also regularly communicate with parents, talking them through what to say to a teenager who refuses to leave his room. Paul Critelli, one of the program\u2019s teachers, told me that many parents feel overwhelmed trying to get two or three kids ready for school each morning, and that their instinct is often to \u201csacrifice the anxious kid\u201d in order to avoid morning hysterics and keep the family train running on time.", "Mostly, though, Critelli wants to talk to the anxious students. \u201cWhat\u2019s the issue today?\u201d I heard him ask during a phone call with a sophomore boy, who had missed his scheduled bus and was presumably speaking to Critelli from underneath his sheets. The call was a \u201cHail Mary,\u201d as Critelli put it, because while he suspects that the boy sleeps with the phone \u201cright next to his face,\u201d he rarely responds when he\u2019s feeling anxious. \u201cI appreciate you picking up \u2014 you don\u2019t normally do that,\u201d Critelli told him, mixing in positive affirmation with a call to action. The school would be sending another bus, and Critelli expected him to be on it.", "Critelli looked for any opportunity to push students out of their comfort zones. During an informal study period after lunch, I watched him confiscate cellphones he said the teenagers were using to \u201chide from, control and avoid\u201d their feelings; scoff at a student who claimed to be too anxious to return a book to the school library; and challenge a particularly reserved boy who said he had nothing to work on.", "Critelli looked at him incredulously. \u201cDude, you\u2019re failing physics,\u201d Critelli said. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t have anything to do?\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do \u2014 I\u2019m going to fail,\u201d the student mumbled.", "\u201cSo you\u2019re just accepting that you\u2019re going to fail?\u201d The boy looked at his hands. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d Critelli continued. \u201cYou can email your teacher and say, \u2018What can I do to improve my grade? What extra work can I do?\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Critelli surveyed his classroom of anxious teenagers. \u201cI\u2019d love to see you advocate for yourselves!\u201d", "Jake is a remarkably minimalist emailer and texter, eschewing exclamation points and emojis in favor of an almost old-fashioned formality. It can be challenging to gauge his moods that way, so I checked in with him regularly by phone in the months after he left Mountain Valley. He usually sounded content when we spoke, an impression confirmed by his parents, who were relieved by the changes they saw in him. In the fall of his senior year, Jake was regularly attending school \u2014 on some days he \u201ceven enjoyed it,\u201d he told me with a laugh.", "While he was careful not to overschedule himself, anxiety still sometimes overtook him. One weekend, he had to leave a Model United Nations conference after he became anxious and his stomach started cramping. \u201cThat was really disheartening, but when I struggle now it doesn\u2019t last long, and I can usually get myself out of it pretty quickly,\u201d he said, by talking back to his negative thoughts.", "Jake also confessed to some worry about his application to attend U.N.C. He had decided to be transparent with the school about his anxiety disorder, partly because it helped explain his junior-year absences and grades and partly because the months he had spent challenging his beliefs and ideas at Mountain Valley perfectly fit the application essay prompt: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea.", "In 650 thoughtful and sometimes uncharacteristically dramatic words, Jake explained that in middle school he had \u201caced the tests and seemed to many as the bright future of the American ideal.\u201d But then came high school and fear of failure, the debilitating worry that he might not be good enough. He explained that going to treatment helped him change his perspective on learning and life. \u201cJust being able to type this very essay would have been impossible months ago due to my fear of judgment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCollege is the next step in my journey to find a true sense of self, both academically and personally. The future has reopened its doors.\u201d", "The doors had not reopened quite as wide for Jillian, whom I visited on an oppressively humid spring afternoon in Florida. It was a school day, but Jillian wasn\u2019t at school. Instead, she was on the screened-in back patio of the townhouse where she lives with her mother, Allison. A talented artist, Jillian loves theater and special-effects makeup design, and she was hard at work on an outfit for a \u201cWalking Dead\u201d costume contest at a local car dealership.", "While she painted her costume to make it appear blood-soaked, we half-watched an episode of the Netflix series \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d on her laptop. Jillian told me she could relate to many of the series\u2019s themes, including cyberbullying. In middle school, she made a profile page on ASKfm, a social-networking site favored at the time by mean girls and their unsuspecting prey. Jillian was quickly targeted. \u201cI\u2019d get 30 mean questions or messages a day,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them were like, \u2018Just kill yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Nothing like that happened at the small private high school Jillian attended after leaving Mountain Valley. Though the school is known for its flexibility and willingness to work with nontraditional students, Jillian still struggled to feel comfortable there. She didn\u2019t want to open up and be known as \u201cthe anxious girl.\u201d There were other students at school who had severe anxiety and depression \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s like the flu broke out here with anxious kids this year,\u201d the headmaster told me \u2014 but Jillian didn\u2019t feel comfortable hanging out with them, either. Several had yet to go to treatment, and \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backward,\u201d she told me. But the end result, unsurprisingly, was that most students never got to know Jillian.", "Her longtime pattern of missing school began again. She had the tools to challenge her anxious thoughts, but using them every day proved exhausting. \u201cThere\u2019s feeling a weight on your chest, and there\u2019s the feeling of 16 people sitting on top of each other on your chest,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019d wake up, it was absolute dread.\u201d", "Needing to get to her job 40 minutes away each morning, Allison, who had sold her previous house in order to afford Mountain Valley, had little time to coax Jillian out of bed. They argued constantly. Jillian thought her mother \u2014 who was severely depressed during a year when Jillian was younger and especially needed support \u2014 could be insensitive. Allison struggled with when (and how hard) to push her daughter. She knew Jillian had a serious disorder, but she also knew it wouldn\u2019t get better by letting her hide out in her room. Allison also couldn\u2019t be sure when Jillian was genuinely paralyzed by anxiety and when she was \u201cmanipulating me to get out of doing whatever she didn\u2019t feel like doing,\u201d she said.", "\u201cThe million-dollar question of raising an anxious child is: When is pushing her going to help because she has to face her fears, and when is it going to make the situation worse and she\u2019s going to have a panic attack?\u201d Allison told me. \u201cI feel like I made the wrong decision many times, and it destroyed my confidence as a mother.\u201d", "Allison sometimes wondered how her own anxiety issues might have genetically predisposed her daughter to anxiety. Allison had done enough Google searches to know that anxious teenagers tend to come from anxious parents. Research points to hereditary genes that predispose children to an anxiety disorder, and studies have found that an overbearing or anxious parenting style can induce anxiety and risk-aversion in kids. In the parents\u2019 workshop I attended in Oregon, Ashworth, the therapist, spent a lot of time urging family members to work on their own anxiety issues.", "He also cautioned parents not to accommodate their children\u2019s avoidance strategies. Families of children with OCD will routinely open doors for them, cook only the two or three specific foods they\u2019ve agreed to eat and avoid saying certain words or sounds. Families of socially anxious kids will let them stay in the car while they go shopping, order for them at restaurants and communicate with a teacher because they\u2019re afraid to. \u201cSo many teens have lost the ability to tolerate distress and uncertainty, and a big reason for that is the way we parent them,\u201d Ashworth said.", "While Ashworth can be blunt, he is also disarming and funny, with a self-deprecating sense of humor that appeals to both parents and their cynical children. Like many therapists who work with anxious teenagers, he tries to model a \u201clet\u2019s not take life \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 too seriously\u201d approach. He also has an almost endless empathy for the challenges that these teenagers and their families face. He knows, for example, that raising a severely anxious child can feel counterintuitive. How, for example, do you set and enforce limits with an anxious teenager? If you send him to his room, \u201cyou\u2019ve just made his day,\u201d Ashworth told the parents in his workshop, who nodded knowingly.", "Though Jillian had returned from Mountain Valley a more confident person with a nuanced understanding of her issues (and with her emetophobia largely under control), treatment didn\u2019t solve her school struggles. As she fell further behind, her morning battles with her mother became increasingly untenable. In consultation with the school, Allison agreed to let Jillian drop out and study for the G.E.D. But Allison wasn\u2019t happy about it; she considered it a momentary concession. \u201cWe basically said, \u2018O.K., anxiety, you win.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Jillian was relieved never to have to set foot in another high school. \u201cI\u2019m just a lot more relaxed now,\u201d she told me in her messy bedroom, where the walls were adorned with \u201cStar Wars\u201d posters and the bookshelf overflowed with young-adult fiction and sci-fi, as well as a worn copy of \u201cChicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.\u201d Near her bed were two prescription bottles \u2014 one for Prozac and another for Klonopin, a benzodiazepine tranquilizer. Jillian had been prescribed a number of drug combinations over the years, and while none were panaceas, she believed she would be \u201ca lot worse if I wasn\u2019t taking them.\u201d", "Though she spoke to a therapist once or twice a week online, Jillian otherwise ignored the structured daily schedule \u2014 including yoga, studying and cleaning her room \u2014 that she had agreed to with her mother. Jillian told me she often felt lonely at home, and she spent much of her days texting friends from around the country, some of whom she met at \u201cStar Wars\u201d conventions or on social media.", "At the same time, Jillian was trying to make new friends. I watched her joke with fellow contestants at the costume contest (where she walked away with a $250 prize), and she was practically a social butterfly at a film event she attended with her mother. Bored with our company after the screening, Jillian spotted two teenagers talking to each other in a corner.", "\u201cO.K., I\u2019m going to go mingle,\u201d she announced.", "On a busy weekday morning last May, a new crop of Mountain Valley residents were discovering that a key component of their treatment would involve repeatedly making fools of themselves. On the Dartmouth College campus, eight teenagers wore hand-painted white T-shirts that read \u201cAsk Me About My Anxiety\u201d and \u201cI Have OCD.\u201d They were encouraged by the therapy team to come up with scenarios that would make them uncomfortable. One teenager considered approaching random guys on campus and saying, \u201cYou must be a Dartmouth football player.\u201d Later that afternoon, a second group of teenagers arrived. One feigned a panic attack at Starbucks. Another ordered nonsensically at a restaurant.", "\u201cWhat do we need to do to make your anxiety higher?\u201d McCallie-Steller, the therapist, asked several teenagers as they prepared for their morning of exposure therapy. First developed in the 1950s, the technique is an essential component of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety, which a vast majority of researchers and clinicians believe is the most effective treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. In a large 2008 study of anxious youth published in The New England Journal of Medicine, more improved using CBT (60 percent) than the antidepressant Zoloft (55 percent), though the most effective therapy (81 percent) was a combination of the two.", "But while exposure therapy has been proved highly effective, few teenagers receive it. \u201cWe\u2019re much more likely to medicate kids than to give them therapy,\u201d says Stephen Whiteside, director of the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Program at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cAnd when we do give them therapy, it\u2019s unlikely to be exposure. With a few exceptions, we\u2019re not treating people with what actually works best.\u201d", "Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard. Anxious people aren\u2019t typically eager to feel more anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s also uncomfortable for many therapists,\u201d Whiteside told me. \u201cMost people go into therapy or psychology to help people, but with exposure therapy you\u2019re actually helping them feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s not much fun for anybody. It\u2019s much easier to sit in a therapist\u2019s office and talk about feelings.\u201d", "Researchers are trying to better understand how exposure works in the brain and to fine-tune its application for anxiety treatment. At U.C.L.A., scientists at the school\u2019s Anxiety and Depression Research Center discovered that the more anxious a person feels going into an exposure exercise, and the more surprised he or she is by the result, the more effective it is at competing with an original negative association or traumatic memory. (That\u2019s why McCallie-Steller did her best to ramp up the teenagers\u2019 anxiety before they began their exposure work.) Other researchers are focused on virtual-reality-aided exposure therapy, which allows people to encounter the sources of their anxiety in a therapist\u2019s office.", "For two Mountain Valley 14-year-olds on the main quad at Dartmouth, the sources of their distress were numerous. One, a brown-haired boy who embarrassed easily, suffered from a dispiriting combination of social anxiety, OCD, binge-eating and depression. It was a lot to work on in three months, and he was often overwhelmed by the magnitude of the project. On this day, he had agreed to tackle his social anxiety by sitting next to a stranger on a park bench and striking up a conversation.", "Earlier, another Mountain Valley teenager took part in a similar exercise, during which the stranger opened up about his own struggles with anxiety. The teenagers were sometimes surprised that others could relate to their issues. As one girl handed out fliers about anxiety on campus, she sometimes asked people, \u201cCan I tell you about anxiety?\u201d More than a few students \u2014 including one who looked as if he might actually be a Dartmouth football player \u2014 responded with some version of \u201cTrust me, I know all about it.\u201d", "The brown-haired boy was highly anxious about his exposure. He bombarded the therapist, Bryan Randolph, with questions in a seeming attempt to run out the clock until they had to return to Mountain Valley. \u201cCan I just sit on the bench for a minute?\u201d he asked Randolph. \u201cAnd can I sit down and then start talking? I mean, do I need to ask, \u2018Do you mind if I sit there?\u2019 It\u2019s weird to just sit there, have a conversation, then get up and come running back to a group of people.\u201d", "\u201cEven better \u2014 let\u2019s make it weird,\u201d Randolph told him.", "The boy shook his head. \u201cMaybe the guy\u2019s on break and doesn\u2019t want to be bothered.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Randolph said. \u201cHe might hate you. He might get real mad at you.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s terrifying,\u201d the teenager confessed. \u201cAnd what if we\u2019re so close on the bench that we\u2019re touching?\u201d", "\u201cThat would be awkward,\u201d Randolph said with a half-smile.", "The boy craned his neck to get a better look at the man. \u201cIs he sitting in the middle of the bench?\u201d", "\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 he might be,\u201d Randolph told him. \u201cBut are you going to \u2018what if\u2019 this to death, or are you going to do it?\u201d", "He eventually shuffled off toward the stranger, allowing Randolph to turn his attention to the other 14-year-old, Thomas, who stood sheepishly on a nearby corner holding his sign: \u201cI\u2019ve Been Bullied. Ask Me.\u201d The \u201cAsk Me\u201d was hard to make out, because Thomas had also included many of the insults peers have hurled at him over the years, including \u201cB*tch,\u201d \u201cF*ggot,\u201d \u201cUr Fat\u201d and \u201cKill Yourself.\u201d Holding the sign on a busy corner had been Thomas\u2019s idea; he thought it might ratchet up his anxiety and force him to interact with strangers, while having the potential added benefit of educating people about bullying.", "Randolph and I watched dozens of students walk by, some giving Thomas\u2019s sign a glance but most never slowing their stride. He had been bullied for years, and now he was being ignored. I felt anxious just looking at him.", "Eventually, an attractive couple in their mid-20s stopped to read the sign. They smiled, Thomas beamed and after a minute or two of conversation they all hugged. \u201cOh, my God, that was the greatest,\u201d Thomas announced upon his return.", "I asked him what they\u2019d talked about. \u201cThe muscular dude said he\u2019s been bullied, too, in middle school, and that bullies get nowhere in life,\u201d Thomas told us. \u201cThen the girl said, \u2018You\u2019re really brave. Can I give you a hug?\u2019\u2009\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s not what you were expecting, huh?\u201d Randolph said. \u201cInstead of being mean to you, people actually treated you with compassion.\u201d", "\u201cYeah, it was awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel so good!\u201d", "The brown-haired boy, meanwhile, returned from his brief visit to the bench: \u201cIt was sooooo awkward,\u201d he reported. \u201cThe guy just kept texting.

The interaction with smoke can cause chemical compounds to form within the grapes. At first, these compounds may be undetectable by taste or smell. They may become volatile during fermentation, or it may not be until much later, months or years, that they become evident.", "Winemakers cannot simply wash the grapes.

Frog\u2019s Leap depends on naturally occurring yeast to ferment its red grapes, Mr. Williams said, but manufactured yeast can be purchased that is said to either mask the smoke taint \u2014 if it exists \u2014 with fruity flavors or curtail the release of the smoky flavors.", "In addition, the grapes can be handled more delicately than usual. Ordinarily, Frog\u2019s Leap would pump the fermenting juice over the grape skins regularly to extract as much color, flavor and texture as possible. The skins remain with the juice until fermentation is complete, and then they are pressed to extract a little bit more. But with these grapes, Mr. Williams suggested, Frog\u2019s Leap could do fewer pumpovers and press the skins before fermentation is complete. This might lead to other issues, like a loss of color and flavor.", "Still other decisions loom. Producers may decide to use more heavily charred barrels to age these wines. The char will cause the wine to taste more oaky, but, since oak contains the same active compound found in smoke taint, albeit in a more agreeable form, it might mask any potential flaw.", "Ultimately, if a wine proves unsatisfactory, many producers will sell it off, either to be bottled as a proprietary wine for wine clubs or other institutions, or on the bulk-wine market. They will earn something, but not nearly what they would have if they were bottling the wine themselves.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll have to make hard decisions if we want to make great wines,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cThirty percent of our cabernet business is a big hit.\u201d", "Reminders of the fires are all over the wine country.

Twenty years ago, he was diagnosed with sleep apnea, a condition in which one\u2019s slumber is repeatedly interrupted by temporary cessations in breathing.

He woke up 287 times, though he was unaware of these serial awakenings until his doctor informed him of them. McGirr\u2019s apnea was alleviated by a device known as a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) system, a nose-nozzle contraption that makes its wearer look a little like Darth Vader unmasked. Yet just as McGirr was poised to overcome a lifetime\u2019s worth of exhaustion, he and his wife, already the parents of a young son, had twins.

He turns, for example, to Charles Dickens, whose difficult relationship with sleep presented itself in both his nonfiction (his vivid 1861 essay \u201cNight Walks\u201d details the after-hours strolls he took through London as a restless younger man) and in his novels. Dickens\u2019s first, \u201cThe Pickwick Papers,\u201d features a character, Joe, who suffers from a form of sleep apnea, \u201ca fat and red faced boy in a state of somnolency who divided his time into small allotments of sleeping and eating.\u201d", "In Thomas Edison, McGirr finds a forebear of today\u2019s tech entrepreneurs, a brilliant but arrogant man who regarded sleep and nightfall as nuisances to be vanquished. \u201cFor Edison, there were never enough hours in the day,\u201d McGirr writes. \u201cSo he made more.\u201d The long-lasting incandescent light bulb, which Edison perfected in 1879, was as much a profound upending of the natural order as it was a huge technological advance \u2014 the first step on the path to our current age of screen addiction, overlong workdays and sleep deficits.", "McGirr ranges far and wide in his considerations of sleep and sleeplessness, from his esoteric take on classical Greco-Roman literature (\u201cIf \u2018The Odyssey\u2019 is a book about getting home to bed, \u2018The Aeneid\u2019 is a book about getting out of it\u201d) to the story of an Australian woman who died after taking the anti-insomnia drug zolpidem, marketed as Stilnox in her country and as Ambien in ours.

He presides over Berkeley\u2019s Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab, where he and his team, along with their peers at other institutions, have made significant strides over the last 20 years in understanding the restorative powers of sleep, and, correspondingly, the dire consequences of not getting enough of it. The upshot: \u201cSleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day \u2014 Mother Nature\u2019s best effort yet at contra-death.\u201d Someone should put that last phrase on a T-shirt.", "As information-dense as \u201cWhy We Sleep\u201d is, Walker is adroit at presenting his findings and their implications in language accessible to the lay reader. A healthy night\u2019s sleep lasts about eight hours, and is divided between REM (rapid-eye movement) sleep, in which the brain is as active as it is when its owner is awake, and NREM (non-REM) sleep, a deeper sleep state that predominates in the first half of the night. Both of these states (and there are further sub-states within NREM sleep) serve a multitude of purposes. NREM sleep, for example, is crucial to memory retention, and to acquiring and refining our motor skills. REM sleep plays a role in our abilities to overcome negative feelings, read other people\u2019s emotions and solve problems.", "Like McGirr, Walker observes that the last 100-odd years of industrialization, urbanization and purported progress have been hell on sleep. Only in his case, he has all manner of statistics and clinical studies to back him up. It really is true that you\u2019ll have a harder time falling asleep after reading a book on an LED device than you will after reading one printed on old-fashioned paper; the blue light emitted by an iPad suppresses your brain\u2019s natural release of melatonin, the hormone that induces sleepiness, by over 50 percent. Then there are the deleterious effects that sleep deprivation has on such physiological functions as the brain\u2019s regulation of blood pressure; per Walker, adults aged 45 and older who get fewer than six hours of sleep a night are 200 percent more likely to suffer a heart attack or a stroke than those who get their full sleep allotment.", "One especially winning attribute of Walker is that he\u2019s not a scold. He frames his suggestions for more healthful sleep habits not as a series of eat-your-Wheaties admonitions, but as wondrous, uplifting improvements in quality of life. (Among the most simple and effective: \u201cEstablish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends.\u201d) And he offers attaboy praise to companies that have evolved out of the machismo-infused all-nighter ethos of yore and into a more enlightened approach to employee wellness. Nike and Google come in for kudos for incorporating \u201cnap pods\u201d into their offices and for having adopted a more flexible approach to employee work hours, acknowledging that some people are \u201cmorning larks,\u201d naturally disposed to rise and do their best work early, while others are \u201cnight owls,\u201d more inherently inclined to thrive on the late shift.", "Very occasionally, Walker\u2019s zeal tips into zealotry. He implies that women should abstain completely from alcohol consumption during pregnancy, noting that just a glass or two of wine will temporarily inhibit a fetus\u2019s REM sleep and that \u201cevery hour of REM sleep appears to count\u201d \u2014 a speculation that gives short shrift to the expectant mom and the benefit that a moment\u2019s relaxation might bring her. But, generally, \u201cWhy We Sleep\u201d mounts a persuasive, exuberant case for addressing our societal sleep deficit and for the virtues of sleep itself.

Thankfully, Richtel, a science and technology reporter for The New York Times, ignores this potential comparison and gets down to the nuts and bolts of his story, which he assembles with transcendentalist ease.", "We descend into the covert inner sanctum at Google X, where our nation\u2019s brightest geeks toil over secret projects within secret projects. We fly to Tanzania during a mysterious pandemic, wander a ski town-turned-ghost town and an unmarked bunker in the Nevada desert. Martin \u2014 and the reader \u2014 have little clue what is causing people to dissolve into a state of catatonia with fixed pupils and flailing limbs until we pick up on the anxiety running through Richtel\u2019s narrative like one of Trent Reznor\u2019s dark guitar chords: \u201cWasn\u2019t this what was happening everywhere?

Though at first glance the solution appears to be only another mastermind who has commandeered technology for personal gain, Richtel leaves us with the more sinister suggestion that the true villain is us and there\u2019s nothing to be done about it.

Ignatius is a Washington Post columnist who has long covered the C.I.A., and he happily takes us for a jaunt through a world of anonymous hotel rooms and conference tables across Beijing and Vancouver and Dubai, where decisions to take someone off \u201cthe shelf\u201d (i.e., bring him or her back into action) are blankly relayed and executed. American start-ups on the brink of game-changing innovation are visited by a C.I.A. officer, a \u201clean, putty-faced man with a bad haircut\u201d who quietly demands for the United States government to be their only client. Operatives aspire to the \u201chighest art\u201d of their profession: to \u201cappear ordinary.\u201d", "Here, the ostensible enemy is a mole inside the C.I.A. known as Rukou, or the Doorway, whom the C.I.A. must ferret out and eliminate, all the while keeping the Chinese away from their technological breakthroughs \u2014 a Sisyphean exercise if ever there was one.", "The mood is mournful and restrained. The C.I.A.\u2019s vibe feels like a highway motel with thin walls, a smell of chlorine, a vending machine where your Twix gets stuck on the glass.

Yet, when the villain is revealed, there is little move toward accountability, only continued silence and deceit. Evil is left to its own devices, out of reach. Matthias is shaken and powerless.

Is Molly the good one simply because she is the real Molly, the more advanced Molly? Do we root for her only because we are privy to her thoughts, and thus understand her better than we understand the mute monsters who come lurching out of the dark, the ones whose stories are unknown to us? The book exposes the arbitrary way we choose sides, perceiving a hero and villain through the murky lens of what is personal and understandable.", "The book works best as a metaphor. For most of us, our most pernicious villain is our self. To keep our higher selves thriving, we must do what Molly does daily \u2014 slay our lesser, reptilian selves, the ones who thrive on fear, ego, conflict. In this book, just as in the others, there is no grand confrontation, no ultimate obliteration of evil. There is only an exhausted d\u00e9tente, a passing of the baton from the killer to the killed. The villain becomes the hero.", "We are left with a portrait of villainy that feels, like the customer service number for an app, extremely hard to pin down. Villainy is no longer the fixed force of yesteryear. It has no face and no center; it\u2019s spread out across everything. It is confusing and exhausting. And it triumphs, time and again, for it causes heroes to throw up their hands and simply wander off mid-battle, numbed by the apparent futility of it all.

Its greatest value is in documenting hard-to-reach places like war zones, but the tools can be used wherever there\u2019s an abundance of visual evidence.

The files can come from social media uploads or submissions from witnesses themselves (most cellphone videos log the hour, minute and second they were recorded in file data).", "The process can be as simple as comparing a video with Google Street View to identify camera location or extracting file data with a smartphone app \u2014 or as difficult as analyzing each frame of a video and the amplitude and frequency of every second of audio.", "For our video investigation on the Mandalay Bay shooting, published over the weekend, I gathered and annotated dozens of videos and audio clips recorded at various locations \u2014 inside the festival, at the hotel itself and on Las Vegas Boulevard and Giles Street, where the police responded and concertgoers fled. And I searched social platforms and downloaded clips that were verified by wire services, ending up with well over an hour of footage and two hours of police scanner and fire scanner audio.", "The bursts of gunfire, 12 in all, served as scaffolding for the timeline. And by analyzing and lining up the audio waveforms of 30 videos filmed by concertgoers, the Las Vegas police and bystanders, my colleague Barbara Marcolini and I reconstructed as closely as possible the complete 10 minutes of the assault.", "Traditional reporting and information-rich visuals and graphics provided additional clarity and precision.

Although Novell and WordPerfect began there in the 1970s, and Overstock.com and Omniture, a web analytics company founded by Mr. James, were among the successful companies born during the dot-com boom, outside investors had traditionally ignored Utah. As a result, start-ups largely grew by bootstrapping, the term commonly used for self-funding. And that in turn contributed to their success.", "\u201cFounders viewed their companies like they\u2019re building the family business or a farm \u2014 they\u2019re building them to keep,\u201d said Ryan Smith, the founder of Qualtrics, a data analytics company that focuses on surveys and other research for corporate and academic clients. \u201cWith no outside funding, there\u2019s no lifeline and you have to figure it out on your own.\u201d", "One reason for the growth, said Mark Gorenberg, a venture capitalist with Zetta Venture Partners in San Francisco, is the emphasis that some start-ups have placed on data analytics \u2014 a growing field that has helped put the state on the map. E-commerce companies, as well as those specializing in medical devices and cloud computing, have also flourished.", "As the local tech community has grown, local venture capital firms have formed in the state, providing seed money as well as participating in later funding rounds.

Many company founders are members, and while the church does not directly invest in individual companies, said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the church, the emphasis on family permeates many start-ups in the area.", "Some say the Mormon culture fosters a collaborative spirt among the area\u2019s tech community, and the founders of unicorns regularly get together. Last month, for example, several founders worked until 3 a.m. at Mr. Smith\u2019s home, organizing a January conference meant to coincide with the Sundance Film Festival in Utah \u2014 an effort to create a tech and entertainment conference similar to the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex.", "Mr. Smith\u2019s father, Scott, started Qualtrics in 2002 to help businesses measure customer and client satisfaction; the younger Mr. Smith joined the nascent company while an undergraduate at Brigham Young University after doctors diagnosed cancer in his father (who has since recovered). His older brother Jared, an executive at Google, joined several years later.", "The company, which has received funding from Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital and Insight Venture Partners, now has a valuation of $2.5 billion. Mr. Smith said it had annual revenue above $250 million, with corporate clients including Microsoft and Marriott International.", "At Pluralsight, a company focusing on tech training, the trajectory was similar. Aaron Skonnard, its chief executive, founded the company with three others, each putting in $5,000 to initially develop in-person training programs.", "The four traveled worldwide for their programs until Mr. Skonnard realized that it would be more efficient to train clients online; by 2011, the company had begun offering only virtual training, walking away from half of its $1.5 million in revenue. But the switch paid off. Pluralsight began receiving outside funding in 2012 from venture capital firms such as Insight Venture and Iconiq Capital. The company, now valued at more than $1 billion, estimated that revenues will reach $190 million this year.", "Only Domo, which Mr. James founded in 2010, has had a more typical trajectory. His track record at Omniture, which went public in 2006 and was later purchased by Adobe for $1.8 billion, allowed him to secure outside financing more quickly. Domo, which provides a cloud-based platform for executives to gain access to a range of data, has received roughly $684 million in funding from investors including BlackRock, Greylock Partners and Benchmark Capital.", "Now, the start-ups are dealing with the challenges to growth that others in tech face: recruiting new engineers and programmers, as well as seasoned executives.", "It is one area where the companies outwardly compete, especially as they seek to improve their diversity. And the hiring needs can be significant. Pluralsight, for example, this month announced plans to add 2,400 new jobs over the next decade and move from Farmington to a new campus south of Salt Lake City, closer to the other tech companies.", "The local universities have played an important role in fostering homegrown talent. Brigham Young, the private university affiliated with the Mormon Church, and the public University of Utah have programs intended to develop young entrepreneurs.", "But as demand for talent has grown, it has also meant companies have needed to recruit outside Utah.", "Their pitch often involves promoting the accessibility of outdoor activities, including hiking and skiing. Jaunts to Park City, the ski town, are common, and many choose to settle in that area. Besides, the office spaces of many of these companies typify the start-up ethos: abundant food, table tennis and pool tables, and, at Qualtrics, even an indoor basketball court.", "The companies emphasize their philanthropic efforts. Pluralsight, for example, recently pledged $10 million for computer science education. Qualtrics is spending at least $10 million over three years to sponsor the Utah Jazz basketball team\u2019s jerseys, which, in lieu of its corporate brand, will display the logo for \u201c5 for the Fight,\u201d the company\u2019s global effort to encourage cancer research donations.", "The companies also talk up the growth of their competitors, to assure recruits that many opportunities exist within the state if an employee \u2014 at any level \u2014 wants to make a move. There are more than 4,000 tech companies in the state, according to figures from the governor\u2019s office; Mr. James, who employs 810 people at Domo, sometimes suggests that those interviewing speak to others in the region.", "\u201cI want them to know that re-deployability isn\u2019t an issue,\u201d he said.", "The efforts have paid off, Mr. Smith said. This year alone, his company has hired 150 people who moved from outside the state.", "Joy Driscoll Durling, the chief information and digital enablement officer at Vivint Smart Home, was working at Adobe in California when she had the opportunity to move to Utah, where Adobe established offices after its acquisition of Omniture.", "\u201cNo one in my family could believe I was even considering it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut my family and I appreciate the outdoors.\u201d", "And while they briefly considered returning to the Bay Area, they have stayed because of both work-life balance and the career opportunities. In March, Ms. Durling left Adobe and joined Vivint, which provides home security and automation products.", "Apart from lifestyle, the potential for an initial public offering helps with recruiting \u2014 and legitimacy. Farrah Kim, a spokeswoman for CB Insights, said the best \u201cway to jump-start a start-up ecosystem is for a cluster of big exits to emerge,\u201d whether through deals or I.P.O.s.", "Four of the unicorns are considering I.P.O.s, according to the founders, although none would talk about specific plans. The choppy performance of the recent I.P.O.s of Snap and Blue Apron has not appeared to deter them. (Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Blackstone, which owns Vivint Home, plans to pursue either an I.P.O. or a merger for the company.

It learned, for example, that its early designs were too open plan, with 16 to 24 engineers in team-based spaces. Engineers found those spaces noisy and distracting, and concentration suffered. Too much openness can cause workers to \u201cdo a turtle,\u201d researchers say, and retrench and communicate less \u2014 colleagues who retreat into their headphones all day, for example.", "Today, there are more private spaces, and the team areas hold only eight to 12 engineers. \u201cThat\u2019s the sweet spot for Microsoft,\u201d Mr. Ford said.", "The company thinks it is working. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud software business has surged in the last few years, as has the company\u2019s stock price. Mr. Ford said about 20 percent of the workplaces have been redone on Microsoft\u2019s campus in Redmond, Wash., and the surrounding area. Within five years, he said, he expects the renovated share to reach 80 percent.", "Offices, he said, will not disappear entirely, but they will be reserved mainly for people who regularly have confidential conversations, like lawyers and top executives.", "Companies renovating their work spaces often tap into a growing body of research on building design and worker well-being and productivity. Research at the University of Oregon concluded that exposure to sunlight and outdoor views correlated to about 6 percent fewer sick days than those without. Research done by Craig Knight, a British organizational psychologist, concluded that \u201cempowered offices\u201d \u2014 in which workers can choose their conditions \u2014 can increase productivity on cognitive tasks by 25 percent or more.", "And at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, scientists found that well-ventilated offices can significantly improve a person\u2019s ability to perform challenging tasks like developing strategy or responding to a crisis.", "But companies can also save money, by using a little less space than conventional offices do.", "Worker space is now about 150 square feet per person, down from 225 square feet in 2010, estimates Tim Venable, senior vice president for research at CoreNet Global, a commercial real estate association. But the hybrid design saves less than entirely open designs, which usually have workbench settings and in which the amount of space can drop to as low as 60 square feet per worker.", "\u201cThere can be huge value to people coming together, but the real reason a lot of corporations have gone to bench seating is money falling to the bottom line,\u201d said Mr. Lathrop of Steelcase.", "Another space saver has been getting people to work from home, a trend for years in corporate America. But that trend is reversing, as companies recognize that offices can be creative clusters.", "IBM, for example, recently called 5,000 of its at-home employees back to offices, though one in five workers in North America still work from home full time, the company said.", "Since 2014, IBM has spent $380 million renovating its work spaces in the United States, which now bear all the hallmarks of the new hybrid design \u2014 open spaces, whiteboard walls, no offices, sit-or-stand desks, huddle rooms and phone rooms.", "IBM, said Mr. Cuevas, vice president for real estate strategy and operations, offers employees up to 10 different space configurations. In January, the company also remade its headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., with senior executives departing wood-paneled offices for smaller, side-by-side glass ones without doors.", "While G.E. executives wait for the company\u2019s new headquarters to be built in Boston, they are working in temporary offices nearby, designed according to the new principles. The contrast with the cavernous offices and silent hallways of the old headquarters in suburban Connecticut could scarcely be more striking \u2014 open spaces, sit-or-stand desks, and no parking spaces. (Workers are urged to take public transportation.)", "Face-to-face conversations have replaced endless email chains, so decisions are made faster, said Ann Klee, vice president for the Boston development and operations. Still, openness has its limits. Sometimes, she concedes, you do have to ask colleagues to use their \u201cindoor voices.\u201d More quiet rooms are being added to the new headquarters design.", "The Boston Consulting Group has also adopted the new design, with two goals in mind: prompt people to come to the office rather than avoid it, and encourage more \u201ccasual collisions\u201d that might spur workers to trade ideas and build relationships.", "Its old Midtown Manhattan office was a traditional space with offices housing one, two or four people each. \u201cLots of doors, lots of pillars, nowhere to really hang out, and people had lunch delivered to their desks,\u201d said Ross Love, a senior partner in New York.", "The new space, in the Hudson Yards development on the Far West Side of Manhattan, is a hybrid open design. Since the firm moved in last November, most consultants have been coming into the office substantially more often than they did to the old building.", "To measure informal interactions, Boston Consulting hired a start-up in the emerging field of workplace analytics, Humanyze, a spinoff from the MIT Media Lab. It monitored workers\u2019 physical movements, meetings and patterns of communication.", "Two tests were conducted of about 100 employees, before and after the move. In the new space, workers spent an additional four to five hours a week in short, unplanned interactions.

I type on an Eames chair, eat with Arne Jacobsen cutlery and rest tired eyes on the colored squares of Josef Albers. But when I step out from my white-cube apartment, I find a different kind of pleasure that\u2019s equally thrilling: My New York neighborhood is full of Victorian tenements covered in a riot of decoration, from carved heads and scallop shells to flower garlands and twisting columns that don\u2019t hold anything up. I dare anyone to resist their splendor.", "I also dare anyone to find that particular joy on any of the newer streetscapes being built in New York, or across the planet. It\u2019s true that Hudson Yards, almost finished on the Far West Side of Manhattan, has no shortage of eccentric buildings \u2013 Shanghai on the Hudson, you might call it. Stairs that go nowhere make one structure look like an image by M. C. Escher; angled roofs and slanting facades turn office towers into steel-and-glass origami. But all this flamboyance has almost nothing to do with the kind of decoration that makes old tenements and brownstones such a pleasure.", "Instead, it belongs to what I call architecture\u2019s New Ornamentalism, a movement committed to visual play at the level of entire structures and whole facades, which appear to sway and swoop.", "Buildings become giant baubles plopped into an otherwise dull cityscape, like extravagant \u201cJetsons\u201d-age sculptures. Several books that celebrate this trend take pains to say that it is absolutely not about \u201cdecoration\u201d \u2013 \u201cmere\u201d decoration, they mean, of the kind that almost no one can resist when they walk down a Victorian street.", "Right here in New York, however, in the middle of a landmark 19th-century district, there is one recent, rare example of a structure that dares to embrace its neighbors\u2019 surface ornateness and buck the trend toward bauble buildings.", "\u201cIt was a real struggle to allow ourselves to use decoration,\u201d said Todd Poisson, a partner at BKSK Architects. Sitting in the firm\u2019s sleek, ornament-free offices in the Flatiron district, he was recalling the early stages of work on a building the firm recently designed at 529 Broadway in SoHo.", "Sneaker fiends may know it as Nike\u2019s grand new home, but design fans should soon be recognizing it as one of the most exciting and intelligent structures to be built for decades, anywhere. It is also one of the few that revives the old, pre-Modernist joy that we find in the ornate.", "The new building sits on the site of the long-demolished Prescott House, a wildly decorative hotel built in 1852, when masonry was still what held a building up and windows pierced it at their peril.", "Next door stands an equally ornamented building from 1872 that used that moment\u2019s new cast-iron construction to make facades that were almost wall-to-wall window. (The building is now best known as the home of the Judd Foundation.)", "Rather than ignore those precedents, BKSK decided to make the new structure into a visual essay on the varied flamboyance that had come to the street before it.", "One end of the building\u2019s wide facade is built around the kind of narrow window openings that had been required by the Prescott\u2019s brick construction; they have elaborate terra-cotta surrounds that pay homage to the Prescott\u2019s ornate lintels and sills.", "The other end of the same frontage has the much wider piercings that were the goal of SoHo\u2019s cast-iron architecture. And in the 16 rows of windows in between, BKSK lets us watch the facade\u2019s openings as they transform from the ones used in 1852 to the ones from two decades later.", "The surrounding decoration stretches and compresses to suit the ever-changing fenestration. Halfway down the building, that decoration even turns a somersault as a band of ornate terra cotta goes from sitting flat on the facade above the narrow embrasures to becoming a protruding cornice over the wider ones.", "Like any of the greatest old tenements, the new building has more details than can be cataloged; its plenty recalls the abundance of the natural world. Casting the facade\u2019s terra-cotta panels demanded 1,380 different molds; the lacework patterns baked onto its windows look just as varied, like anemones on a reef.", "But maybe the most notable thing about BKSK\u2019s nod to a more decorated past is that the result belongs entirely to the present. The facades of 529 Broadway feel novel \u2014 not retrospective \u2014 in their exuberant detailing.", "Alina Payne is an architectural historian at Harvard known for her deep research into ornament. But when I reached her to talk through the possibility of a revival in surface decoration, even she took a minute to take in the idea.", "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about excrescences,\u201d she said with a laugh, using a word more likely to apply to tumors or warts than to appealing detailing. Her language made clear how hard it still is, in her world, to see Victorian-style fripperies as legitimate.", "In 1910, as the Victorian era was passing into history, the pioneering Modernist Adolf Loos published an influential essay titled \u201cOrnament and Crime,\u201d contending that a love of decorative detail, such as architects had deployed since ancient Greece and before, was actually a sign of a weak, disordered, \u201cprimitive\u201d \u2013 even felonious \u2013 mind.", "Professor Payne explained that those ideas still have sway, at least subconsciously, among many of today\u2019s most serious architects. She imagines that most 21st-century studios may still not have enough distance from Victorian models.", "Professor Payne also suggested that Modernism may have truly come of age only quite recently, with new technologies and materials that have allowed it to realize its full potential. Today\u2019s computers permit flights of modern form that a Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe \u2013 even an Alvar Aalto or Oscar Niemeyer \u2013 could never have achieved.", "A New Ornamentalism, Professor Payne explained, may in fact be limited by the same software that has allowed it to flourish. The standard tools of digital design seem better suited to warping an entire building or texturizing a whole facade than to adding a flood of unique, tantalizing decorations.", "That\u2019s why BKSK did not deploy just the standard computer assisted design programs that form and deform bauble buildings. The firm also borrowed software from filmmaking and video gaming to guarantee the complexity of the building\u2019s terra-cotta adornments. Programs often used to manipulate images of people and possessions put BKSK\u2019s architects in a \u201cmind-set,\u201d said Mr. Poisson, to treat their decorations as characters in a story or actors on a stage \u2013 not a bad metaphor, as well, for how Victorian ornament functioned.", "But the most important thing to recognize in the decoration at 529 Broadway is that it isn\u2019t \u201cwry or tongue-in-cheek,\u201d said Harry Kendall, a partner at BKSK. Architects had tried to revive ornamentalism once before, in the 1980s, with postmodernism. But that movement\u2019s decorative gestures \u2013 a modern skyscraper topped with a neo-Classical pediment; a concrete library shaped like the Roman Coliseum \u2013 were clearly ironic, with a wink and a nod to past pleasures in ornament rather than with a true commitment to updating those pleasures for modern use.", "Postmodern architecture had something about it that could seem condescending, maybe even snide \u2013 at very least insiderish \u2013 and this kept the movement from flourishing. If it had an afterlife, it was in the reactionary, pseudo-Victorian housing developments that have been ringing our cities for the last several decades. Those may reflect the true pleasure that nonexperts take in ornament, but they don\u2019t acknowledge that the best decoration has always managed to speak of its era.", "\u201cThere\u2019s rote decoration \u2013 but this is un-rote decoration,\u201d said Mr. Kendall, as he clicked through slides of his firm\u2019s Broadway building.", "Nineteenth-century developers were hardly compelled to cover their facades in ornaments. Mr. Kendall imagines instead that they were subject to a social compact that was all about adding \u201ctactile pleasure to the civic fabric\u201d \u2013 garland by garland, building by building and street by street, until the whole city seemed to come alive. That \u201cfractal\u201d quality is just what has been lost with the New Ornamentalism, according to the Harvard professor Antoine Picon. By treating each new building as its own \u201cheroic surge,\u201dhe told me, \u201cwe\u2019ve impoverished, in some sense, the various scales at which cities function.\u201d", "Although 529 Broadway is a joy to look at, its decoration runs more than skin deep. In its fine, thoughtful and varied detail, the building speaks to passing New Yorkers at a scale that seems to respect them as individual, embodied citizens.", "It conveys a sense of generosity, with each ornament conjuring up the moment when one human being made the decision to put it there, as an aesthetic offering to others. The facade\u2019s details invite a closer approach and a dialogue about what they\u2019re up to; they ask for interpretation and understanding, like letters in an alphabet you only just grasp.", "As Professor Picon has pointed out, that\u2019s in contrast to bauble buildings that are meant to appeal to our precognitive selves by overwhelming the senses. Such buildings are conceived as a stimulus meant to produce an instant response \u2013 a conception, Professor Payne has noted, that is particularly suited to a globalized consumer culture that prefers that everyone react the same way.", "Today\u2019s technologies turn whole buildings into ornament, at costs that only the mighty can bear, whereas the new technologies of the 19th century let mass-produced ornament spread to every stratum of society.", "BKSK would like to see that model revived. \u201cWe feel really liberated by the successful composition of 529 Broadway,\u201d Mr. Kendall said.", "\u201cIt has us looking for new opportunities to use decoration.

Made-up sob stories about family farms broken up to pay inheritance taxes, magical claims about self-financing tax cuts, and so on go all the way back to the 1970s.

Both the depth and the breadth of the dishonesty make it hard even for those of us who do this for a living to keep track.", "In fact, when I set out to make a list of the bigger lies, I thought there would be six or seven, and was surprised to come up with ten.", "So I thought it might be useful, both for myself and for others, to put together a crib sheet: a fairly long-form description of ten big lies Trump and allies are telling, what they\u2019ve said, and how we know that they are lies. I\u2019m probably missing some stuff, and for all I know some new big lie will have been tweeted out by the time this is posted. But we do what we can. So here we go.", "Lie #1: America is the most highly-taxed country in the world", "This is a Trump special: he\u2019s said it many, many times, most recently just this past week. Each time, fact-checkers have piled on to point out that it\u2019s false. Here\u2019s taxes as a percentage of GDP, from the OECD:", "The blue bar is the US; the red bar the average for advanced countries.", "Why does Trump keep repeating what even he has to know by now is a flat lie? I suspect it\u2019s a power thing: he enjoys showing that he can lie repeatedly through his teeth, be caught red-handed in his lie again and again, and his followers will still believe him rather than the \u201cfake news\u201d media.", "Lie #2: The estate tax is destroying farmers and truckers", "Tales of struggling family farms disbanded because they can\u2019t afford the taxes when the patriarch dies have flourished for decades, despite the absence of any examples. I don\u2019t mean examples are rare: I mean that advocates of estate tax repeal haven\u2019t been able to come up with a single example at least since the late 1970s, when exemption levels were raised to the equivalent of around $2 million in today\u2019s dollars.", "Lately Trump has added a new twist, portraying the estate tax as a terrible burden on hard-working truckers. For who among us doesn\u2019t own an $11 million fleet of trucks?", "The reality, as this graphic from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, is that only a small number of very large estates pay any tax at all, and only a tiny fraction of those tax-paying estates are small businesses or family farms:", "In fact, since transportation and warehousing are only 3 percent of GDP and farming less than 1 percent, it seems quite possible that this year only 2 or 3 truckers and not a single farmer will pay any estate tax.", "Lie #3: Taxation of pass-through entities is a burden on small business", "Most businesses in the United States, at least for tax purposes, aren\u2019t what we normally think of as corporations subject to profits taxes. Instead, they\u2019re partnerships, sole proprietorships, and S corporations whose earnings are simply \u201cpassed through\u201d: counted as part of their owners\u2019 personal income and taxed accordingly.", "Trump wants to change that, and let owners simply pay a 1525 percent tax on the earnings of pass-through entities, with no further taxes owed. This is being billed as a reduction in the burden on hard-working small business owners.", "But as the Tax Policy Center explains, many middle-income households who own pass-through entities aren\u2019t running businesses; they generally derive only a small fraction of their income from these entities:", "Rather, they may receive occasional income from the rental of a vacation home, or from the sale of odds and ends on eBay, that they report as business income.", "High-income owners of such entities, by contrast, get a lot of money from them \u2013 but they\u2019re not struggling small business people:", "This high-income group is made up of doctors, lawyers, consultants, other professionals, and, at the very highest end, partners in hedge funds or other investment firms.", "And these are, of course, the people who would gain massively from the Trump proposal. The vast majority of Americans are in a tax bracket of 15 percent or less, so even if they control a pass-through entity, the Trump tax break is worth nothing to them:", "High-income individuals, however, would gain a lot by paying 1525 percent instead of the much higher rates they pay at the margin \u2013 39.6 percent right now. And they\u2019d also have a strong incentive to rearrange their affairs so that more of their income pops up in their pass-throughs. This wouldn\u2019t be small-business creation; it wouldn\u2019t add jobs; it would just be tax avoidance. That\u2019s what happened when Kansas tried something similar, and played a big role in the state\u2019s fiscal disaster.", "So this isn\u2019t a tax break for small business, it\u2019s a tax break for, surprise, wealthy individuals.", "Lie #4: Cutting profits taxes really benefits workers", "Tax incidence is a headache-inducing subject at best, and my sense is that even the tax policy experts have gotten behind the curve in thinking through the implications of global capital markets for the subject. But I think there\u2019s a way to cut through at least some of the confusion.", "Think about what happens if you cut the taxes on corporate profits. The immediate impact is that (duh) corporations have more money. Why would they spend that extra money on hiring more workers or increasing their wages?", "Not, surely, out of the goodness of their hearts \u2013 and not in response to worker demands, because these days nobody cares what workers think.", "Now, they might be inclined to invest more, increasing the demand for labor and therefore raising wages indirectly while competing pre-tax profits down. But there are a couple of major slippages in this story.", "First, a lot of corporate profits aren\u2019t a return on physical capital and won\u2019t be competed down if capital gets cheaper. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others derive their profits from technological advantages, brand name, and market power; cutting the taxes on those profits just leaves their owners with more money.", "Second, to raise wages a tax cut must raise the overall stock of capital, which means it must lead to higher total investment spending. Where does the money for that increase in investment come from? The tax cuts are unlikely to raise national saving.", "The money might come from abroad, via capital inflows. But the flip side of those capital inflows would be a bigger trade deficit \u2013 hardly what the proponents of tax cuts are advertising \u2013 and in any case running trade deficits on the required scale is a much more problematic thing than people seem to realize. The dollar would have to rise sharply \u2013 and the strength of the dollar would itself deter foreign investment, very much slowing the process of wage rise.", "So for an extended period \u2013 at least 5 years, probably much more \u2014 cutting profits taxes is good for owners of corporations. Workers, not so much.", "Lie #5: Repatriating overseas profits will create jobs", "For tax reasons, corporations hold a lot of money in overseas tax shelters. Tax cutters always claim that lower rates and/or an amnesty will bring that money home and create a lot of jobs.", "So, first of all, there isn\u2019t really a Scrooge McDuck-type pile of cash hidden overseas, ready to be put to work if the taxman will let it. Those overseas accounts are just an accounting device, which have very little real effect. Many of the companies with big overseas hoards also have plenty of idle cash at home; what\u2019s holding them back is a lack of perceived opportunities, not cash flow. And even those who don\u2019t have surplus cash can easily borrow at near-record low interest rates; remember, they can always use the overseas cash to secure their loans.", "And we have solid empirical evidence here. In 2004 the U.S. enacted the Homeland Investment Act, which offered a tax holiday for repatriation of foreign earnings by U.S. multinationals. Careful study of its effects tells us that", "Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D \u2014 even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders.", "Lie #6: This is not a tax cut for the rich", "Trump says it isn\u2019t, so that\u2019s that, right? Oh, wait.", "Actually, if you look at the major provisions of the Unified Framework, the big items are (i) Cuts in corporate taxes (ii) Pass-through tax cut (iii) elimination of the estate tax (iv) cut in top marginal rate. All these strongly favor very high incomes \u2013 and everything else is small change. Hence the Tax Policy Center estimate:", "Administration flacks and defenders are accusing TPC of reaching conclusions without adequate information; but the administration is making lots of assertions about what its plan will do, with apparently no more information than the center. Furthermore, given the general shape of the plan there\u2019s no way it can fail to be very much a gift to the already very rich.", "Lie #7: It\u2019s a big tax cut for the middle class", "See Lie #6 above. All the big provisions benefit the rich, not the middle class. What\u2019s left is mostly small change \u2013 and some of it, like ending deductibility of state and local taxes and other deductions, actually raises taxes on a substantial number of middle-class Americans.", "In total, by 2027, according to TPC, 80 percent of the tax cut goes to the top 1 percent; only 12 percent to the middle three quintiles.", "Lie #8: It won\u2019t increase the deficit", "OK, we\u2019re looking at big cuts in corporate taxes, elimination of the estate tax, lower rates on high-income individuals, and a massive new tax-avoidance loophole. How can this not increase the budget deficit?", "The only answer would be if the tax proposal eliminated vast swathes of the existing set of tax deductions, massively broadening the tax base. It doesn\u2019t. The only even halfway biggish thing here is the state and local deductibility end \u2013 and that is already in very big political trouble. This is a multi-trillion-dollar budget buster, unless it summons up deep voodoo. But \u2026", "Lie #9: Cutting taxes will jump-start rapid growth", "Insistence in the magical power of tax cuts is the ultimate zombie lie of U.S. policy discussion; nothing can kill it. And we know why: there\u2019s a lot of money behind the proposition that great things will happen if you cut the donors\u2019 taxes. It\u2019s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.", "Still, for the record: Reagan cut taxes, and although his administration began with a terrible recession, there was a fast recovery thereafter. Some of us think Paul Volcker had more to do with both the recession and the recovery than anything coming from the White House; but in any case we have more evidence.", "For Bill Clinton raised taxes, amid cries from the right that he would destroy the economy. Instead he presided over a boom that surpassed Reagan in every dimension. For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t think this boom was Clinton\u2019s doing. But it certainly refuted the proposition that cutting taxes is both necessary and sufficient for prosperity.", "Then Bush the younger cut taxes, and there were many hosannahs about the \u201cBush boom.\u201d What he actually got was a lackluster recovery, followed by an epic crash.", "Finally, Obama inherited the aftermath of that crash, and despite scorched-earth opposition from Republicans the economy gradually clawed its way back. Then in 2013 Obama first raised taxes substantially, then implemented the Affordable Care Act, again amid cries of disaster from the right. The economy did fine.", "Oh, and there were the recent state-level experiments. Sam Brownback slashed taxes in Kansas, promising an economic miracle; all he got was a fiscal crisis. Jerry Brown raised taxes in California, amid predictions of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 disaster; the economy boomed, and the main problem is a housing shortage.", "There is nothing, nothing at all, in this history that would make any open-minded person believe that the Trump tax plan will cause dramatically accelerated growth.", "Lie #10: Tax cuts will pay for themselves", "If tax cuts don\u2019t generate an economic miracle, it\u2019s hard for them to generate a revenue surge that makes up for lower rates. True, some hidden money may come out of the woodwork and show up as taxable income, even if GDP doesn\u2019t rise. But this effect hasn\u2019t historically been anywhere big enough to offset the direct losses from lower taxes. Reagan\u2019s tax cuts led to deficits, Clinton\u2019s tax hike to surpluses; Jerry Brown presided over California\u2019s fiscal revitalization, Sam Brownback over a fiscal crisis that eventually prompted the legislature to overrule him and raise taxes again.", "So there we are: ten big tax-cut lies. That was pretty exhausting, actually \u2013 and as I said, I\u2019ve probably missed a few, and/or Trump will invent some new ones. But I hope this ends up being a useful reference."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/podcasts/the-daily/john-kelly-rohingya-myanmar.html": ["Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher", "\u201cI\u2019m not quitting today.

It simply broadens the offering and it may broaden the destinations that you can go to, but in fact that fragmentation at some point is going to implode.\u201d", "Mr. Katzenberg believes he is offering something that will start the next leg of growth in the industry.", "Executives who have seen Mr. Katzenberg\u2019s plan, including Robert A.

Several media executives pointed to Nielsen data showing that traditional television still accounts for the bulk of the video viewing among people over 18 years old in the United States. (The country is far behind other nations in video mobile viewing.)", "And of course there is the question of what kind of content consumers want to watch on a phone. So far, most short-form content has been relatively cheap to produce, because of lower production quality, and customers have willingly watched it. Who\u2019s to say they are craving HBO-level production quality? And many viewers are happy to watch Netflix on a mobile device and press pause on their favorite show or movie and return to it later.", "But Mr. Katzenberg says that to think about it like that is backward. There is always an opportunity to create a premium product, he said, and there will be \u201ca pretty meaningful subset of people who would actually pay for it.\u201d", "To Mr. Katzenberg, the idea is too obvious not to pursue. \u201cYou have an installed base of one and a half billion people who watch 45 minutes of video on a smartphone every day,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is where I say to you, \u2018They\u2019re drinking water.

How come we passed by these structures without appreciating their design?\u201d", "He spoke to his colleagues, and they set out to investigate the most striking structure they saw in person. The Harrat Khaybar was more than 550 miles from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. So they took a plane to a nearby city, rented a car and set out for the volcanic domes. In order to navigate the rocky terrain, they had to do much of their exploration on foot through the lava field.", "\u201cThe question we always discuss while investigating them is, why here?

And minimizing risk with minimal effort is a boon to anyone who cares about online security.", "\u201cI am a big fan of this,\u201d said John Sabin, a former hacker for the National Security Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the easiest and most secure multifactor for the masses.\u201d", "The physical keys are an evolution of two-factor authentication, an extra security layer to ensure that your password is being entered by you.

So if you rely on Apple Mail to gain access to your Gmail on an iPhone, or if you use Microsoft Outlook for getting into Gmail on a PC, you\u2019re out of luck. Google says its goal is to eventually allow third-party apps to work with the program, but it is also up to other companies to update their apps to support the keys.", "Despite the drawbacks, security researchers agree that the Advanced Protection Program is a solid piece of security and relatively painless to use, even for everyday use for people outside high-security jobs.", "Mr. Sabin, the former N.S.A. hacker, who is now a director of network security at GRA Quantum, a security consulting firm, said the physical keys had pros and cons. On one hand, if you lose a key, a hacker would have a hard time figuring out which account it was associated with.", "On the other hand, if you lose the keys or don\u2019t have the keys around when you need to log in to a new device, it takes longer to regain access to your account. Google has put in place more elaborate recovery steps for Advanced Protection users, including additional reviews and requests for details about why users have lost access to their account. In our test, we answered security questions to try to recover an account, and Google said it would review the recovery request and respond within a few days.", "Runa Sandvik, the director of information security at The New York Times, said the keys were not much of a hassle. She said Google\u2019s requirement of using two keys meant you essentially had a spare: If you lose one key, you can get into your account with the remaining key.", "But she noted that the keys could get annoying if you used many devices and constantly needed to carry the keys around to log in to your account. That may be an issue for people who work in the technology industry, but most people probably use only one computer and one phone.", "Ms. Sandvik, who has been testing Google\u2019s program to assess whether to recommend it to the newsroom, said she had not yet discovered vulnerabilities in the security key system outside of the slim possibility that a hacker gained possession of both your password and your key.", "\u201cIt\u2019s something that is relatively easy to set up once you have both keys,\u201d Ms. Sandvik said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason you shouldn\u2019t turn this on.\u201d", "While the security keys are easy to set up and provide tough security, they may be disruptive to your productivity if you rely on apps that are incompatible with the keys.", "It took a few minutes for us to migrate to Google\u2019s apps from Apple\u2019s and integrate them into our newsroom workflow, which already relies on Google\u2019s mail, messaging and cloud storage services. But using the keys required sacrificing an important feature \u2014 Apple\u2019s V.I.P. alerts, which notify you when people you deem important email you. Google\u2019s iOS apps for Gmail and Inbox lack a similar feature. For people with flooded inboxes, lacking V.I.P. alerts makes sifting through emails time-consuming.", "Another example of how the keys can stifle productivity: Many employers still require using the Microsoft Outlook app for email, which won\u2019t work with the keys.", "If using Google\u2019s security program would disrupt your work, you may want to wait for more companies to update their apps to support the keys, which rely on a standard called FIDO, for Fast Identity Online. Mr. Sabin predicts that many apps will follow Google\u2019s lead.", "If you decide to wait, don\u2019t procrastinate on turning on traditional two-factor authentication that relies on text messages.

Even if you may not have heard of it, IAC has been battling giants online for a long time. The company grew out of the media tycoon Barry Diller\u2019s television holdings of the 1990s; over the last two decades, IAC created a string of digital brands that tried to find some foothold outside the fiefs of the giants. Among them are Expedia, Match.com, Tinder, Ask.com and Vimeo.", "Some of these companies became the biggest brands in their categories, while others were also-rans that came up short against the day\u2019s tech giants.

It clearly aims big and isn\u2019t going for second place. But it has also internalized a kind of working method that recognizes the Five as more-or-less permanent fixtures of the internet.

On top of that, Waymo has sued Uber, alleging theft of trade secrets.", "The future of Uber, of ride-hailing and of autonomous vehicles in America is hazy.

Two dates \u2014 one recent and one long ago \u2014 help explain this: Dec. 15, 1890, and May 23, 2017, are the two most important days in the history of privacy. The first signifies its creation as a legal concept, and the latter, while largely overlooked at the time, symbolizes something close to its end.", "On Dec. 15, 1890, the future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis and the attorney Samuel Warren published an article in the Harvard Law Review, \u201cThe Right to Privacy,\u201d which argued for the recognition of a new legal right to, in their words, \u201cbe let alone.\u201d The article was spurred by a new technology called the instantaneous photograph, which made it possible for anyone walking down the street to find their image in the newspaper the next day.", "That argument forms the basis for the way we approach our rights to privacy to this day. The proposed right to \u201cbe let alone\u201d made a fundamental distinction between being observed, which can accompany any act made in public, versus being identified, a separate and more intrusive act. We consent to be observed constantly; we rarely consent to be identified.", "Today, however, this distinction has eroded, thanks to the rapid advance of digital technologies and the accompanying rise of the field broadly called data science. What we have thought of as privacy is dying, if not already dead.", "For example, in 2012, the United States Supreme Court in U.S. v. Jones evaluated the constitutionality of police investigators\u2019 placement of a GPS tracker on the Jeep of a suspected drug trafficker to monitor his movements for a month without a warrant. The court determined that this tracking of the defendant\u2019s public movements had crossed the line from public observation to private identification and had therefore violated his expectations of privacy. It held that sustained monitoring, even in public, exceeded the bounds of simple observation and that the government\u2019s surveillance was therefore unconstitutional.", "Just five years later, this argument makes much less sense: \u201cSustained monitoring\u201d is now a part of our digital lives.

Doing so allows it to show evidence to advertisers that its online ads lead users to make purchases in brick-and-mortar stores. Google\u2019s new program is now the subject of a Federal Trade Commission complaint filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center in late July.", "Google may be the first to formally make this link, but it is hardly alone. Among technology companies, the rush to create comprehensive offline profiles of online users is on, driven by the need to monetize online services offered free.", "In practice, this means that we can no longer expect a meaningful difference between observability and identifiability \u2014 if we can be observed, we can be identified. In one recent study, for example, a group of researchers showed that aggregate cellular location data \u2014 the records generated by our cellphones as they anonymously interact with nearby cell towers \u2014 can identify individuals with 73 percent to 91 percent accuracy.", "And even without these advanced methods, finding out who we are and what we like and do has never been easier. Thanks to the trails created by our continuous online activities, it has become nearly impossible to remain anonymous in the digital age.", "So what to do?", "The answer is that we must regulate what organizations and governments can actually do with our data. Simply put, the future of our privacy lies in how our data is used, rather than how or when our data may be gathered. Excepting those who opt out of the digital world altogether, controls on data gathering is a lost cause.", "This is part of the approach now being taken by European regulators. One of the cornerstones of the European Union\u2019s new regulatory framework for data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., is the idea of purpose-based restrictions on data. In order for an organization or public authority to use personal data gathered in the European Union, it must first specify what that data is going to be used for. The G.D.P.R. sets forth six broad categories of acceptable purposes, including when an individual has directly consented to a specific use for the data to when data processing is necessary for the public interest. If data is issued for an unauthorized purpose, legal liability ensues. The G.D.P.R. is far from perfect, but it is on to something big.", "This method stands in stark contrast to the way data is protected in the United States, which might best be characterized as a \u201ccollect data first, ask questions later\u201d approach. Sure, American technology companies disclose their privacy policies in a terms-of-service statement, but these disclosures are often comically ambiguous and widely misunderstood.", "Many privacy advocates will no doubt find it hard to stomach that the way we think about protecting our data is outdated.

I am not referring to airports in some foreign country; I am referring to our airports here in the United States. I know, because it happened to me.", "Earlier this month, I was returning to San Francisco from a trip to Armenia and Greece. Without a single question, but with careful scrutiny of my face and Middle Eastern features, an agent from the Department of Homeland Security at San Francisco International Airport ordered me to a room in the back of the terminal. As I headed to the detention area, I had many thoughts racing through my head. The biggest one, however, was practical: How does detaining, based on his appearance, a San Francisco prosecutor who has spent most of his professional career advancing public safety, make America safer?", "After about an hour of waiting, my interrogator came to ask me some questions. He asked me about my trip to Armenia, whether I had attempted to sneak into Turkey or Syria during my vacation, whether I had visited any refugee camps and whether I had joined any groups like ISIS. These are astoundingly ignorant questions. For one thing, I am an Armenian-American whose family escaped the Lebanese Civil War over 35 years ago. As a descendant of the Armenian Genocide, a genocide perpetrated by Turks, there is absolutely no logical reason I would sneak into Turkey from Armenia (especially since Turkey has blockaded that border). Furthermore, as an Armenian, I am a Christian, and as Armenians in Syria and Iraq have experienced, meeting with jihadist groups would have led to my kidnapping and possible beheading.", "It wasn\u2019t until some time into my questioning that the officer asked what I did for a living. I told him I was a prosecutor in the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office, a fact that could have been revealed with a simple Google search. My detention ended shortly after that information came to light. What never came to light, however, is why they detained me in the first place. They never gave me a straight answer, and I have very few avenues for recourse. My detention was well within the rules.", "The ham-handed nature of my interrogation is worth recounting, because it points to the nature of racial profiling, and its widespread use at our borders. Even if I had been a Muslim American, what connection would my appearance or religion have to my potential risk to national security?", "To answer that question, one must first try to understand why racial profiling occurs. It is born from misplaced and unjustified fear, among other more morally bankrupt reasons. That fear creates racist policies in our country, and not just at our borders: You can see it in the over-policing of predominantly African-American neighborhoods, the over-incarceration of African-Americans, the calls for mass deportations of Latino immigrants and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. In each case, one\u2019s identity, or skin color, or religion is taken as sufficient evidence of a dangerous intent. Some will try to disavow the racism by saying that these traits are simply a convenient proxy, but it amounts to the same thing. If you detain Muslims at the airport because of a stereotype about Muslims and terror, the problem isn\u2019t them.", "I am not saying there should not be extensive security at airports. As someone in law enforcement, I believe wholeheartedly that there should be. But the current policy of detaining people at airports based on the way they look is not only unconstitutional, it also fails to make us safe. Racial profiling fails all of us because we all know danger comes from people who can look like anyone. Profiling also loses the hearts and minds of the citizens the government is supposed to be working for. It begets the question: If my country does not love me, why should I continue to love my country? And if I as a public servant am beginning to have that question creep in my mind, what are others thinking on our streets and in our airports?", "I went back and forth about writing this. Perhaps, it would have been in my best interest to let the incident go. However, I\u2019ve been racially profiled at the airport before \u2014 and so have my brother, my father and most likely hundreds if not thousands of other American citizens who look just like me. I\u2019ve also been profiled in the streets. These experiences are part of why I became a prosecutor: to find a way to be part of the solution rather than complain about the problem. But these experiences are taxing. I can\u2019t change my face, I can\u2019t change my features, nor should I have to fly overseas in a tuxedo to make airport authorities feel more at ease.", "We are a nation of laws, and no policy should be above some level of accountability and scrutiny. And, at the very least, as an American citizen, I should be constitutionally entitled to know why I have been detained. The minute we stop being a nation of laws is when we no longer are the United States of America."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/opinion/diversity-tech-women-silicon-valley.html": ["OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Discussing her work at Apple at an event last week about fighting racial injustice, Denise Young Smith, the company\u2019s vice president of diversity and inclusion, said, \u201cThere can be 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men in a room and they\u2019re going to be diverse, too, because they\u2019re going to bring a different life experience and life perspective to the conversation.\u201d", "That\u2019s right: a dozen white men, so long as they were not raised in the same household and don\u2019t think identical thoughts, could be considered diverse. After a furor erupted, Ms. Smith clarified her comments in an email to her team that was obtained and published by TechCrunch. It reads in part, \u201cUnderstanding that diversity includes women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. people, and all underrepresented minorities is at the heart of our work to create an environment that is inclusive of everyone,\u201d and \u201cI regret the choice of words I used to make this point.\u201d", "But Ms. Smith wasn\u2019t the first to endorse the view in her initial statement. Those of us in the tech industry know that the idea of \u201ccognitive diversity\u201d is gaining traction among leaders in our field. In too many cases, this means that, in the minds of those with influence over hiring, the concept of diversity is watered down and reinterpreted to encompass what Silicon Valley has never had a shortage of \u2014 individual white men, each with their unique thoughts and ideas. This shift creates a distraction from efforts to increase the race and gender diversity the tech industry is sorely lacking.", "This overlaps with the sentiments expressed in a screed by a Google software engineer that critiqued the company\u2019s race and gender diversity efforts and ascribed the unequal representation of women in tech to \u201cbiological causes.\u201d It included the line, \u201cViewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity.\u201d", "To be sure, cognitive diversity and viewpoint diversity are important. But working to increase them alone won\u2019t do anything to address the well-documented shortcomings that plague tech companies. Whether companies do it intentionally or not, I worry that they will adjust the definition of diversity so that, conveniently, it\u2019s already achieved.", "If our focus shifts to cognitive diversity, it could provide an easy way around doing the hard work of increasing the embarrassingly low numbers of blacks and Latinos in the ranks of employees, in leadership roles, as suppliers and vendors, and on boards. The leadership of Apple, where Ms. Smith works, was only 3 percent black and 7 percent Hispanic in 2016. A recent report by Recode found that women made up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and no more than 27 percent of technical roles at major tech companies. The percentages of black and Latino employees in leadership was even more dismal, ranging from 4 percent to 10 percent.", "The shift toward focusing on viewpoint or cognitive diversity may trace its roots back to the 1978 Supreme Court decision Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which set the stage for schools to consider race in admissions because of the educational benefits of diversity, rather than to redress prior discrimination. It is understandable that because the public discourse around affirmative action shifted along these lines, some came to believe that any kind of diversity \u2014 including cognitive diversity \u2014 must be equally valuable. But that means that the most meaningful ways through which this is formed (cultural, religious, sexual orientation, socioeconomic, ability and especially gender and racial differences) may be forgotten.", "If this happens, we could lose an important check on the tendency of people who work at tech companies to hire more people like themselves. According to the Society for Human Resources Management, employee referrals accounted for over 30 percent of all hires in 2016. Employees typically recommend people similar to them in racial identity and gender, so it requires dedicated effort to recruit and hire people who don\u2019t already have identities that match up with those of current employees. Counting up variations of \u201cviewpoints\u201d \u2014 however one might do so \u2014 won\u2019t achieve that. And, to potential applicants from underrepresented groups, statements about \u201ccognitive diversity\u201d will send an unwelcoming message about a company\u2019s real priorities for inclusion.", "As my former Facebook colleague Regina Dugan said recently, even if cognitive diversity is a company\u2019s ultimate goal, \u201cwe can\u2019t step away from the idea that diversity also looks like identity diversity.\u201d The effort to hire people with different points of view must not come at the expense of hiring members of actual underrepresented communities who add tangible, bottom-line value \u2014 and who deserve to work in tech as much as anyone.", "Ms. Smith said in the email clarifying her remarks, \u201cOur commitment at Apple to increasing racial and gender diversity is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d That kind of diversity \u2014 the old-fashioned kind, that still remains elusive \u2014 is what I hope my industry won\u2019t abandon."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/briefing/rex-tillerson-megyn-kelly-saudi-arabia.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

But in the twilight of a long and storied career, as he fights a virulent form of brain cancer, the 81-year-old senator has found a new voice.", "In twin speeches \u2014 one in July, where he issued a call to bipartisanship in the Senate, and another in Philadelphia this past week, where he railed against \u201chalf-baked, spurious nationalism\u201d \u2014 Mr. McCain has taken on both his colleagues and President Trump. In the process, his friends and fellow senators say, he has carved out a new role for himself on Capitol Hill: elder statesman and truth-teller.", "\u201cEven if John were not ill, with his experience and age, there is a part of you that I think begins to focus on your legacy,\u201d said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a close friend of Mr. McCain\u2019s. But with cancer, Mr. Biden said, \u201che\u2019s in the fight of his life, and he knows it.\u201d", "Having won re-election last year, Mr. McCain was already free to speak his mind. Were he to run again in 2022, he would be 86, and friends say that his 2016 campaign was almost certainly his last.", "But colleagues see a shift since his diagnosis.", "\u201cDo I hear in his voice a little bit more expression of grander ideals? I do,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cWith all that\u2019s happened to him, and the knowledge of where he is, I sense a little bit more of that.\u201d", "In Philadelphia, the National Constitution Center awarded Mr. McCain its Liberty Medal, honoring his lifetime of public service. The senator\u2019s acceptance speech was a treatise on his expansive view of America\u2019s role in the world \u2014 a role that, he fears, is being diminished by Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership.", "\u201cThe international order we helped build from the ashes of world war, and that we defend to this day, has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history,\u201d Mr. McCain said.", "He went on to deplore as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d those who would \u201cabandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe,\u201d in favor of \u201csome half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.\u201d", "The speech grew out of a book Mr. McCain is writing with Mark Salter, his longtime speechwriter and co-author. It was not aimed directly at Mr. Trump, Mr. Salter said, but at the philosophy of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, and his hard-charging right-wing website, Breitbart News.", "\u201cIn my view, and McCain\u2019s too, these guys at Breitbart are crackpots,\u201d Mr. Salter said.", "Another element of the speech \u2014 Mr. McCain\u2019s gratitude for a life well lived \u2014 was equally important to the senator, Mr. Salter added, but it got lost in the media frenzy around the address.", "Mr. Biden said he took the speech as a pointed message, if not to Mr. Trump, then to the nation. \u201cI think he was delivering a message to the country, to his colleagues and to any of the opinion makers that would listen, and that is, \u2018Look, this is serious stuff, our role in the world is not guaranteed, democracy is not guaranteed, we know how to do this and, damn it, we\u2019d better focus and know what\u2019s at stake.\u2019\u201d", "The president, though, took it personally.", "\u201cPeople have to be careful, because at some point, I fight back,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m being nice. I\u2019m being very, very nice. But at some point, I fight back, and it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d", "To which Mr. McCain, a former Navy captain who was tortured during more than five years as a prisoner in Vietnam, shot back: \u201cI have faced tougher adversaries.\u201d", "Mr. Biden found the tit-for-tat laughable. \u201cThe idea that Trump is going to intimidate John McCain? Give me a break,\u201d he said.", "Mr. McCain, who was the Republican nominee for president in 2008, has never been a fan of Mr. Trump, who once derisively referred to the senator\u2019s time as a prisoner of war by saying, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. McCain at first grudgingly supported Mr. Trump, and then revoked his endorsement after the release of an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which Mr. Trump boasted that he had sexually assaulted women.", "Now, \u201cthere\u2019s not a relationship\u201d between the two men, said John Weaver, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McCain. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they had one that got soured, or they had one that has not improved. There is not one.\u201d", "In a brief hallway conversation in a Capitol corridor this past week, Mr. McCain put it this way: \u201cI\u2019m doing what I think is right for the country. I don\u2019t work for Donald Trump, and I don\u2019t work for his administration.\u201d", "He has turned his tongue on his colleagues as well. In July, in a dramatic return to Congress after surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye, he delivered a harsh critique of the Senate as he called for Democrats and Republicans to work together.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues, because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle,\u201d Mr. McCain said.", "That speech was \u201cthe kind of speech one gives when they\u2019re leaving,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who has served for decades in the Senate with Mr. McCain. \u201cI think in many ways it was a catharsis for him, and I think that he doesn\u2019t know how much longer he has. I hope he has a long, long time. But I think he\u2019s decided, I\u2019m going to make every moment count.\u201d", "If Mr. McCain views himself as a guardian of the Senate as an institution, it is perhaps because he practically grew up in the chamber.", "In 1977, four years after his release from the Vietnamese prison known as the Hanoi Hilton, the Navy assigned Mr. McCain to be its Senate liaison. He traveled around the world with lawmakers \u2014 including Mr. Biden, then a senator from Delaware \u2014 arranging their schedules and sometimes even carting their luggage.", "He was elected in 1982 to the House and in 1986 to the Senate, where he now has the only job he ever wanted other than president: chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.", "Today, he is one of the few Republicans who regularly crosses the aisle, on matters ranging from immigration to health care. In July, he cast the final vote \u2014 a dramatic thumbs down \u2014 as a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was defeated.", "The reaction to his health care vote \u201csurprised him,\u201d Mr. Biden said, \u201chow much impact it had in giving courage to others of his own party.\u201d", "Last week, Mr. McCain joined Senator Ben Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, in scolding the Trump administration for missing a deadline to impose sanctions on Russia, intended as punishment for Russia\u2019s tampering with the 2016 presidential election.", "And on Wednesday, he became the first Republican to sign on to legislation that would force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing online advertising, another acknowledgment of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 campaign. Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat and chief sponsor of the measure, sees Mr. McCain expanding his reach.", "\u201cI think he\u2019s speaking out on much broader issues,\u201d she said.", "As he walks the halls of the Capitol, often surrounded by reporters \u2014 he once famously referred to the news media as \u201cmy base\u201d \u2014 Mr. McCain is his usual irreverent, prickly self. To a reporter who missed his speech in July, he said wryly: \u201cIt was one of the great speeches ever given. People thought about William Jennings Bryan when they saw that speech.\u201d", "When a Fox News correspondent asked if he would oppose everything Mr. Trump asked him to do, the senator snapped, \u201cWhy would you say something that stupid?\u201d", "Ask how he is feeling, and he will issue a brusque reply \u2014 \u201cfine, fine, I\u2019m fine\u201d \u2014 before brushing aside further inquiry. But he has grown thinner in recent weeks, and sometimes looks fatigued. Those who know him well see the cancer treatment wearing on him. He is characteristically matter-of-fact about the future.", "As he said on CNN last month, \u201cEvery life has to end one way or another.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/briefing/california-macarthur-foundation-world-cup.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

Opponents of those measures complain that big companies have skirted their tax obligations, leaving small firms and individuals to make up the difference.", "European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.", "On Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon. The ruling was tied to an agreement between the country and the company that the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, said dated to 2003.", "The order resembles a similar move the commission made last year, when it directed Ireland to reclaim around $15.2 billion from Apple.", "Ireland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.", "That earned Ireland a forceful rebuke from Ms. Vestager.", "A year later, \u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \u201cmore conflictual waters,\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.", "Although litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.", "At the time of the ruling, Europe\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\u201d", "The Irish Department of Finance said that it \u201chas never accepted the commission\u2019s analysis\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \u201cwholly unnecessary step.\u201d", "Apple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past. The original decision has also drawn the ire of the United States Treasury Department.", "In the case of Amazon, the commission said Wednesday that Luxembourg had reduced its tax bill for more than eight years, from 2006 to 2014, and had conferred on the company a selective advantage. The arrangement essentially capped the amount of tax that the retailer paid, and relied on a method known as transfer pricing.", "Typically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.", "Ms. Vestager said the arrangement had \u201cno valid economic justification\u201d and that the company had been able to \u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\u201d", "Amazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.", "\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\u201d", "Amazon said it would study the commission\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.", "In a statement, Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry also contested Ms. Vestager\u2019s ruling. \u201cAs Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid,\u201d it said.", "It is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \u201cillegal state aid.\u201d", "The investigations are among several in which commission officials have looked into the affairs of Silicon Valley companies. Regulators in Brussels are challenging Google and Qualcomm over alleged antitrust violations, and officials in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers\u2019 data.", "Ms. Vestager has made taxes a priority of her term as Europe\u2019s competition commissioner. In that time, she has penalized Starbucks in the Netherlands and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. But Luxembourg has been a particular target: In 2015, she told the country to claw back about \u20ac30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit, while a case considering Luxembourg\u2019s treatment of McDonald\u2019s is also continuing.", "\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re done,\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\u201d", "A broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.", "A push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany.

Mike is off this week, so Nicole Perlroth, who covers cybersecurity, took his place.", "Farhad: O.K., it was a big week in tech. We should probably start with the thing we\u2019ve been talking about every week for, what, 300 years now? Facebook and Russia. In a report this week, a couple of our colleagues found that when Russian operatives set out to sow civil unrest in America on Facebook, they turned to an obvious source \u2014 political messages posted by Americans.", "The Russians created Facebook pages that had names like \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d and \u201cBlacktivist,\u201d and they populated their pages with videos and memes created by Americans \u2014 for instance, a hoax story about Muslim men collecting welfare checks for multiple wives. I found the story fascinating because the whole thing is so banal. You have this picture of foreign spies using James Bond-type technology to go after an enemy\u2019s political system. Nope, turns out they went about it exactly how you or I might do it \u2014 they found some videos online and posted them on Facebook.", "Nicole: Yup. It turns out the Kremlin has found their sweet spot in the ugly fault lines in American politics. They\u2019ve truly exploited our country\u2019s political grievances, cultural resentments, news literacy and diminishing faith in once-trusted institutions like the news media to bring out the worst in us, simply by creating some Facebook pages. Who would have thought that Russians would be behind a pro-Texas fan page disseminating pro-secessionist Texas messages, or a \u201cBlacktivist\u201d page advocating for more protests against racial inequality?", "Farhad: It wasn\u2019t just Facebook. Google disclosed this week that Russian operatives also bought ads on its platform to interfere with the 2016 race. The amounts were small \u2014 about $4,700 in ads from the Russian government \u2014 but they added to the overall story line, which is that the tech giants\u2019 platforms are being used in ways they probably had never foreseen.", "Nicole: Did we really think Russia was going to try to hack election databases in 21 states, and pour that many resources into Facebook and not touch Google, the No. 1 source of information for most Americans?", "It\u2019s frustrating that this is only coming out now, but to be fair, much of the Russian activity was not exactly obvious. The silver lining is that we may finally be getting some answers. This week, the House Intelligence Committee said it would turn over Russian Facebook ad content, after meeting with Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.", "Farhad: Let\u2019s turn to another story about Russian spies, this one not at all banal. The United States recently discovered that a Russian antivirus company, Kaspersky Lab, had been compromised by the Russian government. The software was essentially being used as a kind of search engine for spying \u2014 the Russians could search through the files of people who\u2019d installed the software, and in some cases it led them to classified documents, including from an employee of the National Security Agency who had stored files on a home computer.", "That\u2019s pretty amazing by itself. But what was most amazing was how the spying was discovered \u2014 because Israeli spies were watching the Russians spy on the Americans, as you and Scott Shane reported. That\u2019s crazy! Can you explain how it went down?", "Nicole: My reporting can basically be summed up as: Spies were spying on spies spying on spies\u2019 spying. Are you with me?", "Farhad: Er\u2026.", "Nicole: So in 2014, the Israeli government hackers managed to compromise Kaspersky Lab, a Russian antivirus company with 400 million users, many of them in Western Europe and the United States.", "Here I should mention that some two dozen American federal agencies used Kaspersky\u2019s software, including some of the most critical agencies like the Department of Energy, which oversees our nuclear program. Kaspersky was so thoroughly \u201cowned\u201d by the Israelis, that nearly a year later when Kaspersky\u2019s researchers discovered the intrusion, its own researchers called the Israeli attack code \u201cthe best we have ever seen.\u201d", "As it turns out, the Israelis were so deep inside Kaspersky\u2019s systems that they watched \u2014 in real time \u2014 as Russian spies used Kaspersky\u2019s systems effectively as a Google search box for American classified government programs. The Israelis caught Russian spies searching any computer that contained Kaspersky\u2019s software for the words \u201cTop Secret,\u201d in a sense abusing Kaspersky\u2019s deep access to the innards of more than 400 million people\u2019s machines to search for American government classified programs.", "In at least one case, the spies struck gold: They discovered a trove of highly classified National Security Agency programs on an agency employee\u2019s personal computer. Apparently the employee had installed the Kaspersky software on his home computer, not knowing that in doing so he was giving Russians full access to some of the N.S.A.\u2019s most coveted programs for penetrating foreign networks.", "Israel was able to capture all of this in real time and provided the N.S.A. with evidence in the forms of screenshots and other documentation, which is how the N.S.A. learned the source of this particular leak. The tip also prompted tons of internal discussions and studies within the United States intelligence community, which eventually led to a government ban on Kaspersky products last month.", "Farhad: Kaspersky is a real mystery in this. They\u2019ve denied any wrongdoing, but is it plausible that they wouldn\u2019t have had an idea that their tools had been infiltrated by the Russian government?", "Nicole: This is the mystery indeed. I sent Kaspersky a detailed list of questions that gave them ample opportunity to offer any explanations. But they declined to answer any of those questions. Instead they put out a short vague statement and sent me a Rihanna GIF on Twitter.", "There are still some possible technical explanations for how Russia could have used Kaspersky as a backdoor without Kaspersky\u2019s knowledge. But most counterintelligence experts, including one we quoted from the Central Intelligence Agency, insist there is no way these kinds of broad scans for United States intelligence could have been conducted without Kaspersky\u2019s knowledge.", "And even if Kaspersky was not complicit, these experts say, that would still mean Kaspersky is either grossly incompetent or horrendously compromised. As a security company, neither is optimal.", "Farhad: That\u2019s been quite the week! Thanks for joining me, Nicole. See you!", "Nicole: Ciao!

In addition to political committees, grass-roots mobilization nonprofits and legal watchdog groups, there are for-profit companies providing technological help to the new groups \u2014 essentially forming a new liberal ecosystem outside the confines of the Democratic Party.", "While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations \u2014 and with relatively meager overall budgets \u2014 they are beginning to attract attention from the left\u2019s most generous benefactors.", "\u201cWe\u2019re in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,\u201d said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. \u201cThere may be groups that have been around that don\u2019t rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.\u201d", "The Democracy Alliance has helped shape the institutional left, steering more than $600 million since its inception in 2005 to a portfolio of carefully selected groups, including pillars of the Clinton-aligned establishment like the think tank Center for American Progress and the media watchdog Media Matters.", "But this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fall\u2019s election.", "The Democracy Alliance distributed a \u201cresistance map\u201d to its donors in July including new groups focused on converting the anti-Trump energy into electoral wins, such as Flippable, Swing Left and Sister District, as well as legal watchdog groups and others focused on mobilizing protesters, such as Women\u2019s March and Indivisible.", "Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.", "Yet Indivisible has also received funding from the tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, as well as foundations or coalitions tied to Democracy Alliance donors, including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler, the New York real estate heiress Patricia Bauman and the oil heiress Leah Hunt-Hendrix.", "And an advocacy group funded by the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a founding member of the Democracy Alliance and one of the most influential donors on the left, is considering a donation in the low six figures to Indivisible.

When I did, she was cursing under her breath at her faulty inner compass. She has lived most of her life in Manhattan. She likes grids.", "The route she was practicing began at the Centre Pompidou, where she was performing with the experimental theater company the Wooster Group, of which she has been a member for nearly two decades. It ended at a friend\u2019s apartment off the Boulevard St.-Germain. The rest of the company was lodged in the Marais, and McDormand had been concerned about the state of their accommodations. She likes to be sure that her co-stars are comfortably situated and has been known to inspect and then personally redecorate cast quarters in advance of their arrival. On one of the Wooster Group\u2019s previous Paris tours, the hotel was less than clean, and though no one could call McDormand high maintenance, she has no patience with squalor. \u201cWe\u2019re avant-garde.

She is 60 and sexy in the manner of women who have achieved total self-possession. She eschews makeup unless she is working, doesn\u2019t dye her hair and despises the nips, tucks and lifts that have become routine for women of her profession. Her clothes are well made \u2014 she loves clothes \u2014 but utilitarian and comfortable. On this day she was wearing loose-legged cropped pants, black-and-peach sneakers, a navy sweater and a thin headband shoved in and out of uncombed hair as the mood struck.", "She doesn\u2019t do press junkets, and for most of the 20 years since she won a Best Actress Academy Award for playing Marge Gunderson, the tremendously pregnant, improbably cheerful police detective in \u201cFargo,\u201d she has refused interviews. Her publicist explained to me that his job is to politely tell people to go away.", "\u201cI was never that involved in the machine of press and publicity as an actor because I\u2019ve always kind of worked on the margins of my profession,\u201d she explained as we made our way toward the river, reoriented at last. \u201cAnd then when my son was younger and it did get a little bit more intrusive, I tried to come to terms with how I was personally going to handle someone coming up to me on the street and wanting some part of my time.\u201d We turned onto the Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol, and the river enlarged itself on the horizon. \u201cNow what I do \u2014 because this is how I live \u2014 when someone approaches me and says, \u2018Can I have your autograph,\u2019 I say: \u2018No, I\u2019ve retired from that part of the business. I just act now.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "She paused in the street. \u201cI say: \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019\u2009\u201d She peered into my eyes and grasped my arm. \u201cI touch them. I look at them. I have a real exchange,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not an actor because I want my picture taken. I\u2019m an actor because I want to be part of the human exchange.\u201d", "Just then, a young Frenchwoman walked up to us and said, \u201c\u2009\u2018Fargo\u2019? \u2018Fargo\u2019! Oh, j\u2019adore \u2018Fargo\u2019!\u201d It all transpired as McDormand had described: She refused the picture and the autograph but asked the woman what her name was, made extended eye contact and allowed herself to be hugged. The woman was elated.", "McDormand turned back to me triumphant. \u201cSee? The exchange.\u201d", "Over the course of her 36-year career, McDormand has played women who are attractive but rarely beautiful, magnetic but thorny \u2014 and, she notes, they\u2019re usually the supporting player in a man\u2019s story. To this day she is best known for Marge, but Marge had much less screen time than people remember. Her slightly daffy good-heartedness serves as the foil for the murderous men who occupy most of \u201cFargo.\u201d A peculiar number of McDormand\u2019s early roles were female accessories to men with violent tendencies: the Lois Lane to a disfigured and enraged anti-superhero in \u201cDarkman\u201d; the brutally beaten wife in \u201cMississippi Burning\u201d; the wife of a Korean War veteran who attempts suicide in \u201cChattahoochee.\u201d", "Her first film role was Abby in the Coen brothers\u2019 noirish debut, \u201cBlood Simple.\u201d (This was kismet; the Coen brothers, then unknown, went on to create some of McDormand\u2019s best roles, and she and Joel Coen married.) Abby is a proper ing\u00e9nue, a young Texan woman with wide eyes and fluffy curls and a habit of softly telling men she loves them when she is afraid they might hurt her. In \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d McDormand is in her mid-20s, dewy and golden blond, and she seems to occupy brighter, warmer light than anyone else in her scenes. She is addictive to watch, which obscures the fact that, as she pointed out to me, Abby is fairly two-dimensional. \u201cThe one thing that I\u2019ve always been able to offer them is a complexity that fills out an idea they have of something,\u201d she said of the Coen brothers in an interview for the Criterion Collection\u2019s release of \u201cBlood Simple\u201d in 2016.", "This ability to suggest a fascinating inner life just out of the viewer\u2019s reach made McDormand\u2019s career as a character actress. She takes marginal characters and makes them the most robust people in the movie. So it was with the fierce, Goethe-quoting widow in \u201cAlmost Famous,\u201d who gets a scant few scenes but earned McDormand an Oscar nomination; the hapless gym employee who wants a butt lift in \u201cBurn After Reading\u201d; the molelike film editor in \u201cHail, Caesar!\u201d", "McDormand explained to me that had she stayed in the theater, she would have played all the canonical leading women, but in Hollywood her looks disqualified her. \u201cI was too old, too young, too fat, too thin, too tall, too short, too blond, too dark \u2014 but at some point they\u2019re going to need the other,\u201d she told me. \u201cSo I\u2019d get really good at being the other.\u201d Years of hearing this type of thing from casting directors have provoked in her a defiant renunciation of vanity and a deep, though intermittent, self-consciousness. She\u2019ll state her weight in a public interview but avoids looking at the monitor when filming. \u201cI\u2019d much rather not be aware of how fat my ass looks,\u201d she said. She wants the work that is given to stars, but she hates to have her photo taken. She doesn\u2019t own a full-length mirror.", "In the last 10 years, something shifted for McDormand: Right as she hit the age when most actresses begin disappearing for lack of roles or moving to the edges of story lines, she moved to first billing. For decades, she excelled at the work of embroidering the lives of women who aren\u2019t deemed appealing enough to watch for two hours straight, and rather than aging into a different acting type, she has taken it upon herself to put peripheral women at the center.", "In 2009, she optioned Elizabeth Strout\u2019s novel \u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d shortly before it won the Pulitzer Prize. She and a friend, the screenwriter Jane Anderson, embarked on a long adaptation for HBO. \u201cShe later admitted to me that it made her nervous; she didn\u2019t know if she could carry a film,\u201d Anderson told me. McDormand kept asking to take Olive out of scenes, to make her a supporting part. \u201cI said, \u2018Fran, it\u2019s called \u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d! She can\u2019t be a side character.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "\u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d is a four-hour peregrination inside one woman\u2019s life \u2014 a postmenopausal woman who\u2019s not the Queen of England or an aging rock star or a mother suffering picturesquely from dementia, but a starchy middle-school math teacher living in Down East Maine. Olive is furious and uncompromising, agitated by her husband, who is \u201coppressively nice\u201d (McDormand\u2019s words), puzzled and disappointed by her son, ill at ease with emotion and bewildered by social niceties. She burps uncontrollably and spares no one the truth. She\u2019s moral, she cares, but still she\u2019s unable to be what the people closest to her need: warm, compromising, wifely, motherly.", "The project was the first work McDormand ever produced for herself, after a long career in which her only power, as she describes the actor\u2019s lot, was the power to say no. It was also her first concentrated effort to create a female story that felt as complex as real women\u2019s lives. \u201cI became interested in educating people in the variety of ways in which women can express their emotion. Which is much easier to do in a large role than in a supporting role to a male protagonist. In general, the women in a supporting role to a male protagonist \u2014 cry a lot.\u201d McDormand insisted on Olive\u2019s right not to cry and battled the director, Lisa Cholodenko, over whether Olive should break down at several key moments in the series. The women were already comfortable working together. Cholodenko, who directed McDormand in \u201cLaurel Canyon\u201d (2002), prevailed, pleading that the audience needed an opportunity to feel affection for the character. (McDormand privately made a list for me of which moments of crying were authentically Olive, and which were her doing what she was told.) The balance they struck worked: \u201cOlive Kitteridge\u201d won eight Emmys in 2015, including the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie award for McDormand.", "This fall, she will be the star of a film featuring another caustic antiheroine, who was written just for her: Mildred in Martin McDonagh\u2019s \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d McDormand plays a mother whose daughter has been raped and murdered, and who has made it her mission to terrorize the local Police Department until they give the case the attention it deserves.", "Mildred is a difficult character \u2014 she\u2019s violent, sometimes in baffling ways. She\u2019s foulmouthed and enraged, pitiless and a bit demented. She stomps around town in a car mechanic\u2019s jumpsuit with the back of her head shaved, ready to scorch the earth. McDormand is imposing in the role mostly because of her stillness. Her back is ramrod straight inside her jumpsuit. She doesn\u2019t walk; she strides. \u201cI really played it like a man,\u201d she said. \u201cI completely based the character upon John Wayne and John Ford movies, because that\u2019s a two-hour arc. Those characters can come out of nowhere, they don\u2019t need a lot of background, you don\u2019t have to explain why they\u2019re like that, they just are the way they are.\u201d", "McDonagh thought of Mildred more as a Marlon Brando character. \u201cWe both liked her,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe both loved her, but didn\u2019t want to do anything to make her more likable or lovable. For once, we don\u2019t have to show the female side or the light side or the nurturing, mothering side. We both said, \u2018[expletive] that, we\u2019re doing something different this time.\u2019\u2009\u201d Whether or not you buy the notion that rage and violence are incompatible with \u201ca female side,\u201d whether you like the notion that the actor\u2019s way into Mildred was to \u201cplay it like a man,\u201d there\u2019s something surprising about seeing a female protagonist like Mildred. Nothing is done to make her grief soft or even to imply that she was a very good mother in the first place. She isn\u2019t made for viewing pleasure or to teach a lesson; she\u2019s just there, hurling Molotov cocktails at the world.", "One evening after rehearsal with the Wooster Group, McDormand walked to a cafe across from the Centre Pompidou for a drink with Kate Valk, who was directing the production, and the Wooster Group\u2019s founder and director, Elizabeth LeCompte. McDormand intends to die onstage with these women, or so she said over drinks. In 1999, after seeing one of the group\u2019s productions, she approached LeCompte to ask if she could join them. She didn\u2019t want to accept film jobs that would take her away from her young son. People kept stopping her in the grocery store asking her to do the \u201cFargo\u201d accent, and the Wooster Group, a pioneer of avant-garde theater, was appealingly removed from the machine of Hollywood celebrity. \u201cI need to work, and I need a home,\u201d McDormand said. LeCompte agreed.", "\u201cEarly Shaker Spirituals\u201d is McDormand\u2019s favorite of the productions she has done with the group. In it, five of the group\u2019s female members (LeCompte, McDormand, Cynthia Hedstrom, Bebe Miller and Suzzy Roche) recreate a field recording of Shaker spirituals made in 1976 at one of the last remaining Shaker colonies, in Maine. \u201cThese women are not trying to sing pretty,\u201d McDormand said. \u201cKate always has to remind me not to make it pleasant. You fail if you try to make a pleasant sound.\u201d", "In rehearsal, as in life, her body is kinetic and restless. The company was brushing up the performance after a long break, and whenever someone made an error, McDormand\u2019s mouth twisted or her eyes betrayed intense perception and restrained irritation. Throughout rehearsal, she was rapt but funny, keeping one ear tuned toward Valk\u2019s mood at all times while finding moments to touch or joke with the cast and crew. She was the goody-two-shoes and the class clown wrapped up in one.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s perfect about the union of the Wooster Group and the Shakers is that both are matriarchal, both are about discipline and rigor and work,\u201d McDormand explained to me over drinks with Valk and LeCompte. LeCompte had a glass of Sancerre, McDormand had a glass of viognier and Valk had a smoothie. \u201cIts foundation is postmenopausal women. The five of us, Liz being the oldest and in a position of power, and Kate directing us \u2014 so it\u2019s six postmenopausal women. And what you gain after menopause is the power of invisibility. You become sexually invisible to both men and women. You gain the power of not giving a [expletive].\u201d", "\u201cAnd we love the music,\u201d Valk added.", "McDormand nodded, looking pensive. \u201cAnd I love the bonnet.\u201d", "A preposterously muscled young man walked by, and McDormand followed him with her eyes. \u201cThat physiognomy is part of what\u2019s happening with gender equality right now. Men are trying to indicate that they are still marketable procreators \u2014 it\u2019s like plumage.\u201d", "Valk agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s like that great documentary on the American wood duck. And all the things that male wood ducks do.\u201d", "The conversation shifted to my presence. LeCompte and Valk were curious about what McDormand had gotten herself into. \u201cAre they going to take photographs of you?\u201d Valk wanted to know. She turned to me. \u201cIs she going to be a cover girl?\u201d", "McDormand made a face. \u201cNo. No. They never \u2014\u201d She stopped. \u201cI\u2019m not a cover-type person.\u201d Before anyone could protest, she changed the subject: She thought perhaps a bird had pooped in her wine.", "She signaled the waiter and caught my eye. \u201cDo you think you can tell him that a bird pooped in my wine and I\u2019d like a little extra?\u201d The waiter arrived.", "\u201cMonsieur, un oiseau a ...\u201d I hesitated, forgetting the French verb and realizing too late that the bird had also targeted my phone, which was sitting near her wine.", "\u201cMERDE,\u201d McDormand interjected loudly, pointing at her glass. The waiter\u2019s eyes widened and he bowed lightly, excising it from between bowls of olives and salted nuts.", "McDormand sat back, satisfied. She reached for my sullied phone and wiped its face with her napkin. \u201cNow let\u2019s see if we get charged for the merde.\u201d", "Shortly after returning from Paris, I received an email from her with the subject line \u201cMy head shot.\u201d It contained a photograph of her floating naked in a lake. She doesn\u2019t like having her picture taken, she wrote, but this might suit the magazine\u2019s purposes. Two months after that, she sent me a picture of herself at the dinner table with a head of cauliflower perched atop her like a crown.", "In reply to the lake picture, I sent her the poet Mary Ruefle\u2019s essay \u201cPause.\u201d Hot flashes are the least of menopause, Ruefle tells the young woman she imagines might be reading. You will want to drive a knife through your heart; you will want to leave your lover, no matter how much you have loved them. You will feel as though your life is over, because it is. You will realize for the first time that your whole life people have looked at you because you are a woman and people look at women \u2014 but now, suddenly, you are invisible. But then something magical happens:", "You are a woman, the ten years [of menopause] have passed, you love your children, you love your lover, but there are no longer any persons on earth who can stop you from being yourself. ... You would never want to be a girl again for any reason at all, you have discovered that being invisible is the biggest secret on earth, the most wondrous gift anyone could ever have given you.", "\u201cShe got it perfectly,\u201d McDormand wrote back a few hours later. \u201cAround 46 years of age, I became concerned that I may slaughter my family. I was perimenopausal when Pedro\u201d \u2014 her son \u2014 \u201cwas in the throes of adolescence and at the mercy of testosterone poisoning. I continue to have three hot flashes daily, one bout of cold sweats per night, and have reveled in my invisibility for 10 years. So there.\u201d", "Recently, at a benefit for her local radio station, McDormand introduced herself this way: \u201cHello. My name is Frances Louise McDormand, formerly known as Cynthia Ann Smith. I was born in Gibson City, Ill., in 1957. I identify as gender-normative, heterosexual and white-trash American.\u201d She explained: \u201cMy parents were not white trash. My birth mother was white trash.\u201d", "McDormand was the last and, she thinks, ninth child to be taken in by Noreen and Vernon McDormand. Vernon was a pastor with the Disciples of Christ who had a talent for starting new outposts of the church. He and Noreen moved between working-class communities in the South and the Midwest every few years, and because Noreen was never able to carry a pregnancy to term, the couple fostered children wherever they went. They adopted two, a son and a daughter, through the foster system. In the late \u201950s, they adopted their third, a 1-year-old named Cynthia, who, as far as anyone knows, was born to a young woman in Vernon\u2019s parish. They changed her name to Frances.", "In her late teens, McDormand was offered the chance to meet her birth mother, and she refused. The anger she felt at being unwanted had become too important a part of her psychology, she thought. Still, she sounds proud when she calls herself \u201cwhite trash\u201d like her birth mother, and she has spent much of her career playing women who, in one way or another, resemble that description.", "She describes her upbringing with the McDormands as \u201ckind of Norman Rockwell-y\u201d: hymn singing, spaghetti dinners, summer Bible camps run by her father. Though Noreen often worked full time as a receptionist and had lots of kids to take care of, she strived to make a homemade dessert every night, often elaborate cakes, like a three-tiered Lady Baltimore. McDormand\u2019s favorite was more d\u00e9class\u00e9: angel food cake with orange-juice icing. The family moved mostly between small agricultural communities like Hillsboro, Ky., Statesboro, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn., where they lived in a neighborhood that was built over the town dump. McDormand, then in second grade, found that this provided excellent treasure hunting.", "Their longest stay was in Monessen, Pa., a steel town near Pittsburgh, where, she told the public-radio benefactors, the mill \u201cglowed and thrummed, day and night.\u201d The working-class women she plays are familiar to her from childhood. \u201cThose are the people that held me and raised me, and the work ethic I have,\u201d she says. That\u2019s why she shows up herself for lighting and camera set up, though it is expected that hired stand-ins endure the technical rehearsals. McDormand does her hair and makeup too, if it\u2019s efficient. \u201cI\u2019m a member of the company, I\u2019m not outside of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI like being right in the middle of everything. It\u2019s isolating and vulnerable.\u201d", "It was at Monessen High School that she acted for the first time, as Lady Macbeth. She was 14, and an English teacher had the students put on scenes from Shakespeare after school. \u201cI spent a lot of time alone reading books, and this was the first time that literature took me into a public place where I could share it with other people,\u201d she told me. She started acting in school plays, never as the lead but as the colorful characters, the ones who came out screaming or fainting. She went to Bethany College in West Virginia, because it was affiliated with the Disciples of Christ and she could get a scholarship. There, she became the only theater major in her class, drove vans across the border into Pennsylvania so her classmates could buy birth control and steadily worked her way through her post-hometown to-do list: sex, drugs, profanity.", "At 24, newly graduated from Yale\u2019s M.F.A. program in acting, she was offered a role in \u201cBlood Simple,\u201d which marked the beginning of her professional career as well as of her 33-year partnership with Joel Coen. From the start, they met each other\u2019s instincts with unquestioning courtesy. \u201cIt was a revelation that I could have a lover who I could also work with and I wasn\u2019t intimidated by the person,\u201d McDormand told me. In past relationships, she struggled against feeling subservient, trapped in fraught sexual power dynamics. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t happen with Joel. It was: Wow! Really! Oh, my God! I can actually love and live \u2014 not subvert anything, not apologize for anything, not hide anything.\u201d", "Though they moved in together almost right away, they waited 10 years to marry, and until recently her wedding band was a ring once owned by Coen\u2019s first wife, which McDormand adopted, thinking it shouldn\u2019t go to waste. In 1995, they adopted a baby from Paraguay, whom McDormand still refers to by his full name: Pedro McDormand Coen. Pedro is now 24, a personal trainer and, lately, a grip on his father\u2019s movie sets, but McDormand still likes to tell stories about the outfit he wore on his first day of first grade. Jane Anderson described their household as haimish. \u201cShe\u2019s a great homey cook,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou go to her house and she\u2019ll whip up a great pork chop and a salad and she\u2019ll throw it down and set a beautiful table and make you a good pot of English tea and a cookie.\u201d Joel will \u201cshow up to your house and bring a pie in a wonderful antique pie carrier that Fran found somewhere.\u201d", "The McCoens, as McDormand sometimes refers to her marriage unit, now maintain two residences: an apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where they\u2019ve lived for decades, and a 1,300-square-foot house in what McDormand would prefer me to call An Unnamed Town in the Pacific Northwest. This is where McDormand spends most of her time, and she forbade me to specify even a state, not so much because she worries people will track her down but because she feels protective of her Unnamed Town. She is involved in local efforts to protect affordable housing, and with the local radio station. The cheesemonger runs around the counter to give her a hug when she comes in.", "The day before I flew there to visit her, McDormand decided, after some deliberation, that I was not invited to her house. \u201cIt is mine,\u201d she emailed me, \u201cand I also don\u2019t like articles where actors reveal their private lives.\u201d This was part of a longer missive about her complex relationship to anger, and the pain of being adopted, so I pushed back. She was unmoved. Her reply was a link to the online portfolio of the architect who helped them with their last renovation and a dare: \u201cGuess which is ours.\u201d", "So we hiked. McDormand had instructed me to meet her in the parking lot of a nearby cafe, and when I arrived she was sitting straight as a soldier, dressed in her \u201chiking skirt\u201d (ankle length, denim). We hopped into her car and drove to a nearby freshwater spring to fill our water bottles, which she stuck in a backpack packed with cheese and apples for our lunch. As we carved our path up the mountain, she told me about her next project with Jane Anderson, based on a trilogy of Conrad Richter novels published between 1940 and 1950 called \u201cThe Awakening Land,\u201d which they\u2019re adapting into another mini-series. She\u2019ll play the oldest iteration of the main character, Saird, a pioneer woman who gives birth to a stillborn baby and, while still covered in blood, throws herself on top of a wild turkey and wrings its neck so her other children won\u2019t starve. McDormand clapped with glee. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great? What actor wouldn\u2019t want to play that?\u201d We sat on some rocks in the forest, and she began unloading plastic bags of cheese and crackers from her knapsack.", "\u201cLook at this,\u201d she said, handing me an apple. It was a variety called a Pink Pearl, which a neighbor had brought her. Its skin was a pale, nearly translucent yellow. She fished out her pocketknife and cut into it, revealing brilliant pink and white swirls. \u201cHave you ever seen anything like that?\u201d", "I told her I thought I knew the answer to the question I was about to ask, but: Why these roles? Why these women?", "\u201cWhat kind of women?\u201d", "\u201cOh, profane women. Or rageful, or violent.\u201d", "\u201cI mean, I know I\u2019m profane. And outspoken. But I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re fun!\u201d She chewed and thought. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that they\u2019re angry. It\u2019s more \u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cMy politics are private, but many of my feminist politics cross over into my professional life. Because I portray female characters, so I have the opportunity to change the way people look at them. Even if I wasn\u2019t consciously doing that, it would happen anyway, just because of how I present as a woman, or as a person. I present in a way that\u2019s not stereotypical, even if I\u2019m playing a stereotypical role.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t subtract that from myself anymore. I could when I was younger.\u201d", "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs that just what happens with age?\u201d", "\u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding seriously, and took a bite of Pink Pearl. \u201cThat\u2019s another great thing about getting older. Your life is written on your face.\u201d", "If you are a woman who has risen to new levels of fame and recognition by, paradoxically, renouncing any interest in what we could call the male gaze \u2014 or the industry gaze, or the fan gaze \u2014 then there\u2019s something profoundly discomfiting about the prospect of being profiled for a magazine. Four months into our meetings, McDormand wrote to say she didn\u2019t think I should be writing about her at all, but that she\u2019d like to get together to brainstorm a more worthy subject. At our next meeting, she informed me that she wouldn\u2019t be sitting for any photographs to accompany this article. \u201cI don\u2019t do those. You have to use pictures of me from what I do. Like my characters. Then I\u2019m not promoting me.\u201d", "She eventually agreed to be photographed but asked that the session be as unlike a typical shoot as possible: no hair person, no makeup artist, no wardrobe. Initially, when asked to talk about the \u201cconcept,\u201d she had suggested a \u201cno-concept concept.\u201d Later, she allowed that she might wear some plants in her hair. It would be interesting to appear like the spirit of a Shaker woman floating around Lower Manhattan.", "On the appointed morning in August, she blew like a friendly hurricane into the photo studio in TriBeCa one minute early. She surveyed the variety of flower crowns laid out on the props table, picked up a wreath of cotton branches and set it on her head. \u201cHow cool is THIS,\u201d she shouted, looking in the mirror. \u201cBut it\u2019s not at all me.\u201d The faux peonies, daisies, sea grasses and laurel went the way of the cotton. She took the young stylist who had made the wreaths cozily by his arm and thanked him for his work. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. But they\u2019re not right for me. It looks great on you, though! You should wear it.\u201d She set the daisies on his head and announced the return of the no-concept concept. \u201cJust me. Just me as myself.\u201d", "McDormand-as-herself was dressed in wide-leg bluejeans, a tank top with no bra, a long-sleeve T-shirt, Birkenstock sandals and a giant denim jacket. Out of her backpack she produced two other options: a bandanna and a long white nightgown. \u201cI wore it last night, but I ironed it,\u201d she said.", "Even with as few people on set as possible and without all the accouterments of a cover shoot, McDormand seemed to be gritting her teeth. She shifted under the lights in her tank top and bare feet like a child. Someone turned on the music she\u2019d requested (\u201cSmooth,\u201d by Santana), and she swayed a little, uncertainly. She caught my eye across the room and made a small motion, asking me to dance too, where I was standing, so she wouldn\u2019t be all alone up there. We bopped awkwardly to Santana while she tried to ignore the camera.", "There is a stunning un-self-consciousness that overtakes her characters when they are alone. In these moments on film, you can see the face fall open and reveal a whole person, whoever she is when she\u2019s turned inward, unwatched. Her ability to go to this place in front of a camera is one of her singular talents. I had been curious whether that might happen this morning, a sort of reverse-engineered revelation as Fran performed Fran. But if that moment came, it was distinguishable only to the camera, and perhaps to the photographer. As the hours passed, McDormand kept the room in a state of mild panic. She stood there at one point in her nightgown with a sweater on her head. She sent the wreath stylist to cut pieces of boxwood she had noticed on the building\u2019s roof terrace, and then winked at me as he went. She turned around so the back of her head faced the camera and announced that she wanted to try a few like this. \u201cThis is my angle,\u201d she said.", "\u201cI never do this,\u201d she kept saying to the photo team. All morning: \u201cI never, ever do this.\u201d", "\u201cThen why are you doing it?\u201d someone finally asked.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d She said. She seemed to really consider the question. \u201cI guess I want more work.\u201d", "At the end of the day, the group went outside for some exterior shots in the alley behind the studio, and McDormand spotted three teenage boys hanging out on the sidewalk.", "She called to them: Would they come sit and chat while she was photographed? \u201cIt\u2019s for a magazine,\u201d she explained. At first, the boys were hesitant. \u201cDon\u2019t want to get famous too soon,\u201d one of them said with a little smile.", "\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, and she reached out her hand. \u201cI have to have my photo taken. Just come and sit with me so I don\u2019t have to be in the picture alone.\u201d They relented and perched next to her for a few minutes while she asked them about their clothes, their school, what their names were, what they liked to do. It had begun to rain lightly, but McDormand was happy, scooched in, well lit but mostly obscured by the three lanky bodies. She chatted keenly with her co-stars, a member of the company, as if none of the rest of us were there."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/technology/farhad-and-mike-tech-regulation-is-coming.html": ["Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.

But you\u2019ve probably heard of his older brother: Dan Brown, the author of blockbuster page-turners including, of course, \u201cThe Da Vinci Code.\u201d", "Gregory won\u2019t be able to hide for long, though. His brother\u2019s fact-heavy novels often send readers racing to Google, and the latest book, \u201cOrigin,\u201d devotes an entire chapter to one of Gregory\u2019s pieces: \u201cMissa Charles Darwin.\u201d", "In the acknowledgments, Dan goes so far as to write that Gregory\u2019s \u201cinventive fusion of ancient and modern in \u2018Missa Charles Darwin\u2019 helped spark the earliest notions for this novel.\u201d", "That \u201cfusion\u201d refers to the form of \u201cMissa Charles Darwin,\u201d which follows the tradition of five-movement Latin Masses but substitutes much of the sacred text with excerpts from \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d and other Darwin writings. The juxtapositions can be bracing, like \u201cKyrie eleison\u201d (\u201cLord have mercy\u201d) followed by the brutal line \u201cLet the strongest live and the weakest die.\u201d", "The piece may sound like Renaissance polyphony, but its score also nods to modern science, transcribing the DNA of Darwin\u2019s finches for the opening melody, for example, and adapting into musical variations genetic concepts like insertion, mutation and deletion.", "\u201cThere\u2019s this exploration of the edges of things,\u201d Gregory Brown said in an interview in Boston. \u201cWhether that edge is science and music, or religious and scientific, or sacred and secular.\u201d", "In a telephone interview, Dan Brown said that he\u2019s \u201calways looking for big themes,\u201d and when he first heard the mass performed in 2011 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., \u201cit got me thinking about creationism and this sort of battle between science and religion.\u201d", "He followed the idea until it became \u201cOrigin,\u201d a thriller \u2014 starring his signature protagonist, the Harvard \u201csymbologist\u201d Robert Langdon \u2014 about a brazen scientist whose discovery about the source of life on Earth and the future of humanity threatens to upend the world\u2019s religious order.", "\u201cMissa Charles Darwin\u201d appears late in the book, after a wild night for Langdon that begins with a clandestine encounter inside a Richard Serra sculpture and ends at a computing center that holds the key to life\u2019s origins. He enters the center and hears Gregory\u2019s \u201cChristian-style mass,\u201d in which devout voices take their place alongside a celebration of natural selection.", "\u201cThis piece of art that fuses science and religion and makes them beautiful \u2014 I thought at that point in the novel, it was just this moment when you needed to rest and see that these two can intertwine,\u201d Dan Brown said.", "Spirituality and science often did overlap as the Brown brothers grew up. Their father, a math teacher, was an Escher obsessive who told them folk stories about clever mathematicians, and they turned pages for their mother, a church organist who provided Gregory\u2019s first exposure to sacred music. He, in turn, began college as an aspiring scientist, and traveled to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where he was awe-struck by a vermilion flycatcher and Lonesome George, the last known tortoise of his species.", "\u201cYou get the sense that it hasn\u2019t changed much since Darwin was there,\u201d he said.", "Studying geology also gave him a sense of the planet\u2019s long, slow timeline. He ended up with \u201cthis feeling about time and our place on Earth that I\u2019d never had before,\u201d he said, which works its way into the \u201cCredo\u201d movement of \u201cMissa Charles Darwin.\u201d", "Halfway through college, he had a change of heart and pursued music. He later sang at Westminster Choir College and wrote vocal works that put him in contact with the Grammy-nominated quartet New York Polyphony, which gave the mass\u2019s first performance in 2011.", "Craig Phillips, the group\u2019s bass, first had the idea for \u201cMissa Charles Darwin\u201d and said he was inspired by \u201cjust how beautiful, lyrical and poetic\u201d the prose is in \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\u201d", "Mr. Phillips culled the text from Darwin\u2019s writings. \u201cIt\u2019s almost built for a musical setting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so lofty and majestic.\u201d", "Dan Brown didn\u2019t tell his brother that the mass had made its way into \u201cOrigin\u201d until he finished writing the chapter.

But how do we select what we remember?", "He said there are two main kinds of memories: explicit, which are created through conscious experience, and implicit, which form when past experiences affect us, sometimes without our knowledge, as in reacting with fear in dangerous situations or getting sweaty palms when you see a dog if you were once bitten.", "Memory is a fallible thing, changing over time. Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context.

On Tuesday the government and the group overseeing the land announced that they were partnering with an Alphabet subsidiary, Sidewalk Labs, to develop the site.", "They want it to embody the city of the future, a technological test bed for other communities around the world, \u201cthe world\u2019s first neighborhood built from the internet up.\u201d", "The Sidewalk Labs proposal in the competitive bid for the project floated all kinds of technological dreams: a thermal energy grid that would be carbon neutral, sensors that separate waste from recycling, modular buildings that convert from retail to housing, monitors that track noise and pollution, self-driving transit shuttles, shared-ride taxibots, adaptive traffic lights, delivery robots, heated bike paths and sidewalks that melt snow on their own.", "In theory, each of these ideas would be best tested across more than just one building or street, and all of them would be more easily implemented together. Once you cover your traffic lights in sensors, it\u2019s easier to turn them into air-quality monitors, too; as long as you\u2019re redesigning streets around driverless cars, you can also think about what the delivery robots need.", "The prospect of a city designed by technologists, at least as a thought experiment until now, has made some nervous, urbanists especially. The tech industry is better known in its Silicon Valley backyard for contributing to rather than solving urban problems like unaffordable housing and traffic. And its corporate campuses are mostly models of how not to build cities, with mega office parks (and spaceship designs) dependent on cars and detached from their neighboring communities.", "There\u2019s no small contradiction in having tech founders muse about how to build better cities from places that bear little resemblance to lively cities at all.", "The tech industry also thrives by working in ways that can be incompatible with public-sector city building. It\u2019s hard to \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d in government, and public funds don\u2019t allow for the failure rates that venture capital does. New tech products are often targeted to early adopters, and they spread to the rest of us later. But you can\u2019t do that with innovations in public service; if the tech savvy get the nicer bus routes or the new Wi-Fi kiosks first, that raises equity issues for the rest of the city.", "There\u2019s also the hitch that cities are inherently organic and unpredictable. They resist omniscient engineering. And past efforts at doing that \u2014 whether through the urban renewal of individual neighborhoods or the wholesale development of utopias \u2014 have invariably failed for that reason.", "Many intractable urban problems are in fact not engineering problems at all, including the ones that most look like it. Housing is very expensive in a place like San Francisco not because we haven\u2019t developed the right engineering methods to build it more cheaply. Unaffordable housing is largely a political problem \u2014 we haven\u2019t developed the societal consensus to build enough of it.", "Sidewalk Labs, to its credit, has internalized many of these criticisms. The company, formed by Google two years ago, has pointedly been based in New York City and not Silicon Valley. It\u2019s staffed by both technologists and government alums. Its leader, the former New York City deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff, openly acknowledges the gulf between technologists and city government types. And Sidewalk Labs says it wants to bridge the two.", "\u201cWe all collectively see cities as about friction: good friction and bad friction,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff told me not long after Sidewalk Labs started. \u201cGood friction is serendipity, it\u2019s opportunity, it\u2019s diversity, it\u2019s seeing 40 different nationalities on the subway as you commute in the morning. Bad friction is congestion, it\u2019s pollution.\u201d", "The technologist\u2019s temptation may be to try to build a city from scratch, with none of that friction. And especially without the greatest friction of all, politics. In Toronto, Sidewalk Labs is looking at something between a blank slate and New York City: a sizable plot of land to develop that\u2019s still part of a city large enough that any successful ideas could ultimately spread.", "Because it\u2019s looking at a neighborhood and not just a typical developer\u2019s parcel, Sidewalk Labs can play with all the infrastructure that connects those parcels \u2014 the utility grid, the street network, the sidewalks. But there would be no point in doing all that if there weren\u2019t thousands of people nearby ready to move in, as is the case in rapidly growing Toronto.

But A.I. may also put millions of people out of work, and some worry that it could wreak global havoc. (Seriously; Elon Musk worries A.I. could spark World War III.)", "More immediately, there\u2019s the threat of ever-growing corporate control over much of what we do. Over the next few weeks, starting today, I\u2019m writing a series of columns about the group I like to call the Frightful Five: Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which make up half of the top 10 most valuable companies on the American stock market, and which collectively influence just about everything else that happens in tech, as well as the rest of the global economy.", "These companies are not evil; they\u2019re all led and staffed by smart, well-meaning people who believe that technology can radically improve the world. But as I argue in the series, we have not, as a society, come to grips with the scope of their control over our lives. And we don\u2019t have many good ways to limit it, if we decided that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do.", "A lot of these worries aren\u2019t new.

You should see my house: I\u2019ve outfitted it with every kind of doodad you can imagine, including cameras that record everything we do, lights that switch on by voice, a toilet you have to plug in and, once, an electronic trashcan.

The story\u2019s headline claimed, incorrectly, that the F.B.I. had linked the shooter with the \u201cDaesh terror group.\u201d", "Google and Facebook blamed algorithm errors for these.", "A Google spokesman said, \u201cThis should not have appeared for any queries, and we\u2019ll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future.\u201d", "A Facebook spokesman said, \u201cWe are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused.\u201d", "But this was no one-off incident. Over the past few years, extremists, conspiracy theorists and government-backed propagandists have made a habit of swarming major news events, using search-optimized \u201ckeyword bombs\u201d and algorithm-friendly headlines.

Twitter faces tough questions about harassment and violent threats on its platform, and is still struggling to live down a reputation as a safe haven for neo-Nazis and other poisonous groups. And Google also faces questions about its role in the misinformation economy.", "Part of the problem is that these companies have largely abrogated the responsibility of moderating the content that appears on their platforms, instead relying on rule-based algorithms to determine who sees what. Facebook, for instance, previously had a team of trained news editors who chose which stories appeared in its trending topics section, a huge driver of traffic to news stories. But it disbanded the group and instituted an automated process last year, after reports surfaced that the editors were suppressing conservative news sites. The change seems to have made the problem worse \u2014 earlier this year, Facebook redesigned the trending topics section again, after complaints that hoaxes and fake news stories were showing up in users\u2019 feeds.", "There is also a labeling issue. A Facebook user looking for news about the Las Vegas shooting on Monday morning, or a Google user searching for information about the wrongfully accused shooter, would have found posts from 4Chan and Sputnik alongside articles by established news organizations like CNN and NBC News, with no obvious cues to indicate which ones came from reliable sources.", "More thoughtful design could help solve this problem, and Facebook has already begun to label some disputed stories with the help of professional fact checkers. But fixes that require identifying \u201creputable\u201d news organizations are inherently risky because they open companies up to accusations of favoritism. (After Facebook announced its fact-checking effort, which included working with The Associated Press and Snopes, several right-wing activists complained of left-wing censorship.)", "The automation of editorial judgment, combined with tech companies\u2019 reluctance to appear partisan, has created a lopsided battle between those who want to spread misinformation and those tasked with policing it. Posting a malicious rumor on Facebook, or writing a false news story that is indexed by Google, is a nearly instantaneous process; removing such posts often requires human intervention. This imbalance gives an advantage to rule-breakers, and makes it impossible for even an army of well-trained referees to keep up.", "But just because the war against misinformation may be unwinnable doesn\u2019t mean it should be avoided. Roughly two-thirds of American adults get news from social media, which makes the methods these platforms use to vet and present information a matter of national importance.", "Facebook, Twitter and Google are some of the world\u2019s richest and most ambitious companies, but they still have not shown that they\u2019re willing to bear the costs \u2014 or the political risks \u2014 of fixing the way misinformation spreads on their platforms.

But self-driving vehicle proponents like Mr. Musk envision a world where those cars would all but eliminate traffic accidents, unleash our productivity and allow the old and disabled to travel freely.", "Most Americans look at that future, though, and say \u2014 not so fast.", "While companies like Alphabet, General Motors and Tesla are investing billions of dollars to turn lofty goals for driverless cars into reality, the Pew Research Center found that most people surveyed did not want to ride in them and were not sure whether the vehicles would make roads safer or more dangerous (39 percent vs. 30 percent). And 87 percent favored requiring that a person always be behind the wheel, ready to take control if something goes wrong.", "It might be tempting for corporate executives and proponents to dismiss these concerns as part of humanity\u2019s aversion to change and argue that this resistance will soften once people see the benefits of self-driving technologies. That would be a mistake.", "People have good reason to doubt grand promises about world-changing technology. They have lost countless hours to unreliable software and had their personal data hacked. They have been let down by companies that hid safety defects (General Motors and Takata) or lied about emissions (Volkswagen).", "Further, experts warn that the hype around automated cars is belied by the struggles these machines have in the rain, or when tree branches hang too low, or on bridges or on roads with faded lane markings.", "Yet, members of Congress, encouraged to do so by auto and tech lobbyists, have proposed bipartisan bills that would let industry roll out automated cars more quickly by exempting them from existing safety regulations, like those that govern the performance of steering wheels, airbags and brakes, and by directing the Department of Transportation to come up with new rules instead.", "Lawmakers have to do better than that if they care about what the public is saying. A bill passed by the House last month would let manufacturers sell up to 25,000 automated cars a year without meeting all federal safety standards, and up to 100,000 cars after three years. The companies would not even have to establish that their cars are as safe as conventional vehicles before the number of exemptions increased.", "A bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee is a bit better. It would require a safety evaluation before raising the cap on exemptions. It would also limit the total number to 80,000.", "A larger problem with both bills is that they would do nothing to increase the size of the budget or staff of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is responsible for overseeing the industry and will have to write new rules for self-driving cars.", "The agency has been underfunded for years and has struggled to investigate auto defects and improve safety standards. Worse still, President Trump has proposed cutting the agency\u2019s operations and research budget by $24 million, or 7.5 percent, in the 2018 fiscal year.", "Today, the agency is woefully unprepared to regulate self-driving cars, particularly at the scale proponents hope to see down the line. More electrical engineers, programmers and cybersecurity specialists who can evaluate such cars have to be hired.", "Among other challenges, the agency has to come up with standards for what happens when a highly automated car has to hand control back to a human driver. The results could be devastating if drivers are distracted because they place too much trust in their cars.", "The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that one reason the Tesla, a Model S operating in its Autopilot mode, crashed into a tractor-trailer illegally crossing in front of it was \u201coverreliance on automation.\u201d", "States and cities that wish to regulate self-driving cars will also be disappointed. The House and Senate bills, as a further boon to industry, would prohibit such action. Unaddressed, though, is the fact that those governments still would largely retain oversight of traffic laws and would be forced to answer their own complicated questions: When an automated car violates traffic rules, should a police officer write a ticket for the owner or the carmaker? Should states require automakers to carry liability insurance, as they do for drivers? California last week proposed rules attempting to answer some of these questions.", "There\u2019s no doubt that a driverless future would profoundly change society, even in ways we\u2019re not even considering yet. People might stop buying cars because services like Uber, once its cars are automated, would be cheaper to use. That could cause mass unemployment for taxi drivers and greatly reduce car sales, potentially hurting the economy. It would also make parking garages and parking spaces superfluous, freeing up valuable real estate.", "More people might decide to live, say, 100 miles from their workplaces because algorithms would make traffic flow more smoothly and allow people to nap, work or watch Netflix while commuting.", "Cities could be forced to put up barriers separating cars from pedestrians, who might feel emboldened to walk into traffic believing that cars would automatically stop for them.", "Yet Mr. Musk\u2019s point about the hazards of human drivers is well taken: If automated cars make the roads safer \u2014 as seatbelts, airbags and other innovations have done \u2014 millions of lives may be saved. More than 37,000 people were killed in crashes in the United States last year alone.", "Automakers, lawmakers and regulators need to do more to perfect this technology, and reassure the public.

The Coach Inc. rebranding follows Google\u2019s decision to restructure and name its holding company Alphabet in 2015 and Tribune Publishing Company\u2019s reinvention as Tronc last year. Next up will reportedly be the Weinstein Company, as it attempts to distance itself from its disgraced co-founder, Harvey Weinstein.", "But in Coach\u2019s case, the change also reflects what has become an escalating race to create the first American Fashion Group \u2014 or, as Mr. Luis styles it, \u201cthe first New York Fashion Group.\u201d", "The name change, after all, follows Coach\u2019s 2015 acquisition of the Stuart Weitzman shoe label for up to $574 million and its purchase of Kate Spade for $2.4 billion in May. And in July, Coach\u2019s rival Michael Kors acquired Jimmy Choo (a brand that Coach was reportedly also considering acquiring) for $1.2 billion. John Idol, the Kors chief executive, told The New York Times that it was \u201cthe beginning of a strategy that we have for building a luxury group that really is focused on international fashion brands.\u201d", "By rebranding Coach Inc., Mr. Luis is hoping to send a signal to potential targets in the $80 billion global premium fashion market that \u201cthis is a home that is not limited to any category, channel or geography.\u201d", "While Mr. Luis declined to say how many more threads he anticipated adding to his particular tapestry, he did note that one of the requirements for the new name was that it demonstrate inclusivity.", "\u201cWe embrace our differences, whether they be race, gender, sexual orientation or belief systems,\u201d he said. Mr. Luis added that while Tapestry was currently composed of brands based in the United States, he was open to acquisitions in Europe and Asia.", "To that end, the name was also intended to clarify the differences between not only Tapestry and Kors but also Tapestry and potential European competitors like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (the owner of brands like Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, and the world\u2019s largest luxury group by sales), Kering (Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, among others) and Richemont (Chlo\u00e9, Ala\u00efa, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels).", "\u201cI\u2019m not here because I\u2019m anyone\u2019s son,\u201d Mr. Luis said by way of example \u2014 an apparent veiled swipe at Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, whose father, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, founded that group.", "Then he said, \u201cWe are not a group that believes there is a single country where products have to be designed or manufactured,\u201d a reference to the insistence by European groups on the importance of origin \u2014 that there is equity in \u201cmade in France\u201d or \u201cmade in Italy.\u201d Finally, Mr. Luis said Tapestry would include the results of each of its brands in its annual reports, as opposed to lumping them together into a single entity, as LVMH and Kering do with some of their brands.", "Still, Tapestry is following in Kering\u2019s steps in at least one way: In 2013, the French group, too, changed its name (it had been PPR), to reflect its transformation from retail and luxury to a luxury and sports lifestyle group.", "That choice involved an invented word (pronounced like \u201ccaring\u201d) that refers to the word for \u201chome\u201d in Brittany, France, where Mr. Pinault\u2019s family is from. It was in line with other notable rebrandings like Andersen Consulting\u2019s switch to Accenture (a shortening of \u201caccent on the future\u201d) and Kraft\u2019s move to Mondelez (a combination of \u201cmonde\u201d and \u201cdeliz\u201d).", "Mr. Luis said it was important for Coach to find a name that, unlike those moves, \u201cwasn\u2019t too corporate-y or made up, that was easy for everyone to understand.\u201d", "The search took two to three months and was conducted by the Carbone Smolan Agency.

Programmers have raised over $3.2 billion this year by selling their own virtual currencies to investors. That is 3,000 percent more than the amount raised using coin offerings in 2016.", "Coin offerings are a way for start-ups or online projects to raise money without selling stock or going to venture capitalists \u2014 essentially a new form of crowdfunding.", "The programmers raise money by creating and selling their own virtual currency, generally with rules similar to well-known virtual currencies like Bitcoin. The new tokens are usually designed so that they can be used only on a computing service the programmers are building.", "Filecoin, which raised $257 million in the largest coin offering to date, is being designed to pay for storage on a global cloud storage network that the creators of Filecoin are promising to build. BET, another coin, is being designed to serve as the chips in an online casino its programmers are promising to build.", "\u201cPromising to build\u201d is the operative phrase here, because in almost every case the services that will supposedly make these coins valuable have not yet been finished.", "These coins are generally inspired by older virtual currency systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, with a cap on the number of coins that will exist \u2014 to provide a sense of goldlike scarcity \u2014 and a structure that allows them to operate entirely outside the existing financial and regulatory ecosystem.", "Investors generally buy the new coins by sending the programmers Bitcoin or Ether (the virtual currency inside the Ethereum network). What\u2019s more, many of the coins are stored, moved around and enabled by other Ethereum technology.", "But the coins sold in coin offerings are meant to exist independent of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with their own free-floating value.", "(For a more complete explanation of Bitcoin, click here, and for an Ethereum explainer, click here.)", "The name for coin offerings was clearly inspired by the initial public offerings that companies do to sell stock to investors. But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don\u2019t get an ownership stake in the start-ups. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.", "Investors can contribute as much or as little money as they want in these offerings, which are generally more like crowdfunding campaigns that new projects do on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.", "In principle, people buy these coins because they want to use the services on which the coin will be used. So far, though, almost none of the services have been completed.", "In the meantime, people are buying coins because they are hoping the value will go up. When the Stratis token was released in July 2016, it was worth seven-tenths of a penny. In the fall of 2017, each of those tokens was trading for around $2.95, a 42,000 percent increase.", "After the initial coin offering, when the programmers sell their tokens for a set price, coins are traded on third-party exchanges through open-market bidding \u2014 similar to the way stocks are traded and priced after an I.P.O. The programmers who created the coins generally keep a large stash of coins so that they also benefit if the price goes up.", "The people betting on the price of these tokens are generally betting that the services promised by the programmers will be completed, creating demand for the coins in the future.", "The most obvious reason to do a coin offering is that you can raise more money than you ever could from venture capitalists. The most valuable virtual-currency company that was funded with venture capital, Coinbase, raised $100 million this year, five years after it was founded. The same day that was announced, Filecoin, which doesn\u2019t even have a working product, announced that it had raised over $200 million.", "Another plus: Start-ups that raise money through coin offerings don\u2019t have to give away ownership of their technology to outside investors.", "Some programmers look to coin offerings because they can raise money for projects that venture capital won\u2019t fund. Specifically, coin offerings can provide funding to build open-source projects that in the end no one will own, the way that no one owns Bitcoin or Ethereum. Filecoin\u2019s cloud storage network, for instance, would be operated by its users rather than any central company.", "It is easier than it seems. The software behind Bitcoin and Ethereum is open source, which means that anyone can take the computer code and tweak it to create a virtual currency with slightly different characteristics. There are companies that will do this for you if you are not technologically adept. Convincing people that your new coin will have value is the harder part, and many coins that are released never grow to be worth anything.", "Some companies have gone the more complicated route of creating their own new software for their coins, with qualities that are very different from Bitcoin and Ethereum.", "Anyone who has Bitcoin or Ether and is willing to send their money to the creators of a coin offering.", "China and South Korea have said it is illegal.", "In the United States and many other countries, regulators have said some coins should be categorized as securities, like stocks and bonds.

Suffice to say, essentially no coin offerings have followed these rules.", "Many people are waiting for regulators to crack down.

And because it is private property, the company does not have to share ride information with regulators and it can try new ideas without as much red tape.", "Cars that can drive themselves could be a great benefit to older people. Residents at the Villages say that once people stop driving, they often pull back from activities and interacting with friends.", "Ms. Jackson, who has lived here for three decades, was one of Voyage\u2019s first test passengers. For now, the company is limiting rides in two driverless cars (with a third arriving in two weeks) to a busy, two-mile loop. A person stays in the driver\u2019s seat in case something goes awry. And the plan is for any Village resident to be able to summon one of Voyage\u2019s cars through a smartphone app for free door-to-door service.", "Voyage\u2019s introduction to the Villages comes as self-driving vehicles interact more and more with regular cars. Waymo, the driverless car unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, started a trial ride-hailing program in Phoenix this year with several hundred cars. The ride-hailing service Uber is also testing the technology in more than 200 cars with real passengers in Arizona and Pittsburgh.", "Voyage was formed this year after spinning out of the online education start-up Udacity. How an online education start-up ended up operating an autonomous taxi service in a retirement community is an \u201conly in Silicon Valley\u201d story.", "It started with a drive from nearby Mountain View to San Francisco. When Udacity started to offer a self-driving car curriculum, a team of employees created a challenge for themselves: Make a 32-mile drive on busy El Camino Real during rush hour and without human intervention.", "After five months of failure, the team finally completed the route. Sensing an opportunity, Udacity executives spun out the self-driving car project into a new company. Voyage raised $5.6 million from investors.", "The company had a major selling point: Udacity\u2019s chairman, Sebastian Thrun, the founder of Google\u2019s driverless car project and a pioneer in autonomous vehicle research, was joining Voyage as chairman. He pushed the idea of starting in a retirement community.", "It was a good match. Last year, the Villages had conducted a survey about what amenities residents wanted to see over the next 15 years. Among the top answers: autonomous cars and a shuttle service.", "Four years ago, the Villages considered a shuttle, but decided it was too costly to have a full-time driver. There is a service called the Villages Medical Auxiliary to take people to the doctor\u2019s office or the supermarket, but there is a shortage of volunteer drivers and people need to make appointments two days in advance. It pushes residents to keep driving when they shouldn\u2019t.", "Ask almost anyone at the Villages and he or she can tell you about an accident: the driver who drove into a pond or the person who hit the accelerator instead of the brake and took out the tennis court fence.", "\u201cThe driverless car would be far less risky than the drivers that we currently have,\u201d said Bill Devincenzi, a former board president of the Villages whose term expired in June.", "Another issue that could be solved by driverless cars is a shortage of parking spots. Like many of the Villages\u2019 residents, Nancy Green, 88, is active. She swims three times a week, regularly attends wine-tasting dinners and participates in a weekly bridge game. But after three back operations, she struggles to walk long distances.", "For popular events, she sometimes arrives an hour early to secure one of the few handicap spots.

She said she did not like eating dinner at the clubhouse at 5:30 p.m., but the chances of finding a parking spot at her preferred time of 7 p.m. were \u201cslim and none.\u201d", "\u201cFrom that perspective, I think the self-driving car would be great,\u201d she said.", "But what seemed like a done deal hit a roadblock this year. The agreement to offer self-driving car rides in the retirement community almost fell apart when negotiations hit an impasse over insurance. California requires autonomous vehicles to have $5 million of coverage, but the Villages insisted on 50 percent more coverage because it is a private community with more liability risk.", "\u201cWe\u2019d call the Geicos and Progressives of the world and asked them, \u2018Do you do self-driving car insurance?\u2019\u201d said Oliver Cameron, Voyage\u2019s 29-year-old chief executive. \u201cThe answer was no.\u201d", "Working with an insurance broker, Voyage delved into \u201cexotic insurance\u201d policies and had to pay twice as much per car for its insurance policy versus the standard $5 million coverage.", "The insurer, Munich Re, also had an unusual request. It wanted data \u2014 any data \u2014 produced by the cars. Because this is a new field, even insurers wanted to understand the potential risks of self-driving cars. Voyage agreed to hand over nonidentifiable, sensor data.", "Another issue arose when Mr. Thrun had to leave the company because of a conflict of interest. He was also the chief executive of Kitty Hawk, a flying car start-up backed by Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, which owns Waymo.", "Coupled with the fact that Voyage and not Udacity would be operating in the Villages, some in the community were concerned that they had fallen for a bait and switch.", "To sweeten the deal for the Villages, Voyage offered them an equity stake \u2014 the equivalent of what it would grant a new hire.", "For the last few months, Voyage has been testing at the Villages.

Trump, that\u2019s the defining story of 2017, the meta-narrative lurking beneath every other headline.", "The companies I call the Frightful Five \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company \u2014 have experienced astounding growth over the last few years, making them the world\u2019s five most valuable public companies. Because they own the technology that will dominate much of life for the foreseeable future, they are also gaining vast social and political power over much of the world beyond tech.", "Now that world is scrambling to figure out what to do about them. And it is discovering that the changes they are unleashing \u2014 in the economy, in civic and political life, in arts and entertainment, and in our tech-addled psyches \u2014 are not simple to comprehend, let alone to limit.", "I\u2019ve spent the last few years studying the rise of these giants. As tensions over their power reached a high boil this summer \u2014 Facebook and Russia, Google and sexism, Amazon and Whole Foods \u2014 I began thinking more about the nature and consequence of their power, and talking to everyone I could find about these companies. Among them were people in the tech industry, as well as many in other power centers: Washington, Hollywood, the media, the health care and automotive businesses, and other corners of society that may soon be ensnared by one or more of the Five.", "This is the first of several columns in which I\u2019ll take measure of the Five. Here, I assess their efforts to infiltrate entertainment \u2014 their plans to push deeper into the business of movies, TV and music, and the fears of cultural domination those moves have provoked.", "Why start with the culture industries? The Five elicit worries of total social control. Many people fear the companies will be able to translate their hold on key digital platforms into wholesale ownership of adjacent industries that depend on those platforms, giving them wider economic and social power.", "The entertainment industry is a good place to assess those claims because in different ways, the Five have spent years building platforms for the distribution of art, culture and media. Facebook runs the news; Google\u2019s YouTube has videos and music; Microsoft\u2019s Xbox has games; Amazon runs books, movies and TV (and, through its web-hosting service, AWS, hosts much else, including Netflix); and Apple has pretty much of the same, plus all those apps.", "Yet in entertainment, we also see the limits of their efforts to push into new territory. Though their technologies have altered nearly everything about how we buy and experience popular culture, the Five themselves have not been the greatest beneficiaries of the changes.", "They are pouring money into entertainment, but they have been cornered by nimbler start-ups like Netflix and Spotify. Amazon has struggled to make a hit show, while Apple\u2019s plans for original TV are perpetually around the corner. (It has now struck a deal to revive \u201cAmazing Stories,\u201d the 1980s Steven Spielberg series; there\u2019s no word on when it will air.) All of the Five have labored to create some killer position in the tumultuous new marketplaces their platforms have enabled.", "Several times in conversations with people in Hollywood, I heard the tech people referred to as \u201cdumb money\u201d \u2014 the sort of outsiders (in the past, they came from oil, then from finance) who parade through town looking to call the shots. One Hollywood executive who has worked often with tech companies told me: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve looked at them with fear, no.\u201d", "The Five\u2019s struggles in entertainment, if they persist, suggest that they can be as clueless about the changes wrought by technology as the rest of us \u2014 that they do not quite understand, and haven\u2019t yet begun to master, how to translate their technological power into wider cultural power.", "Not long ago, this story looked a lot more open-and-shut. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple acquired dominance over a music industry that was struggling to respond to the digital age. Amazon eclipsed Barnes & Noble as the biggest boogeyman of the indie bookstore; for years, it fought bruising battles with the publishing industry over sales contracts that publishers said were too onerous. Through YouTube, Google gained control over not just funny cat videos, but also the modern replacement for radio. (People watch a lot of music videos on YouTube.) And Facebook has become the world\u2019s most popular source of news, a position that has consumed its leaders over much of the last year.", "There\u2019s no doubt that technology has upended the economics of modern cultural businesses. In a recent polemic, \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d Jonathan Taplin, the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California (and a former rock band manager and movie producer), points out that musicians could once make a decent living off their royalty checks.", "Digital technology has now completely undercut that business. YouTube has made every song available online, and even though many artists are paid a cut of the ads placed on YouTube (the company said it paid out $1 billion last year), the money is nothing close to what artists got from selling records.", "Mr. Taplin sees what has happened in music as a harbinger for much of the rest of culture. \u201cThe rise of the digital giants is directly connected to the fall of the creative industries in our country,\u201d he wrote.", "But there is another side to the story. As I\u2019ve argued before, while musicians have had to find new sources of revenue, the rise of online subscriptions and a new consumer willingness to pay have led to an explosion of new cultural voices.", "Meanwhile, some earlier doomsaying has not come true: Indie bookstores and print books are making a comeback, while publishers are enjoying record profits. And the tech giants\u2019 eagerness to create entertainment marketplaces has led to a bonanza for some artists. To compete for new members, Apple, Tidal and other streaming services are paying out lavish bonuses; Apple paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for two weeks of exclusive access to his latest album.", "The tech-industry money train is making its biggest hauls in Hollywood. \u201cThere are so many new markets for talent and writers to go to, and the creators here love that,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the U.S.C. Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cInstead of having seven buyers for your idea, there are now more like 20 \u2014 and that makes everybody happy.\u201d", "This story may sound puzzling. The tech giants are the most sophisticated media companies in the world, so why, after prying open their wallets, have they struggled to capture Hollywood?", "It\u2019s because technology is not all that matters. The Five acquired their power by mastering the tech industry. They achieved dominance in a field that\u2019s won with information, data and precision.", "But even though they now control valuable platforms, as they move to areas that require them to stretch their skills they are finding that they won\u2019t be able to roll in and take over. Several people in Hollywood told me that many of the Five just didn\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d the movie and TV business. They had brought Northern California\u2019s tech ideas to Southern California\u2019s entertainment party, and did not understand the value of imagination, talent and subjective inspiration.", "This myopia is part of a pattern that will repeat itself often in this series. You see it in how Facebook got caught off guard by how it was used during the election, or in YouTube\u2019s surprise that some of its biggest stars were pushing hateful ideas on its platform.", "The tech giants have upended much of society, but even they have difficulty understanding and navigating the chaos of the new platforms they have built.

And from the elected officials\u2019 perspective, the appeal is obvious. They can sidestep media gatekeepers and beam their personalities and priorities straight to their constituents\u2019 ears, all while heightening their national brands, perhaps in anticipation of seeking higher office. It\u2019s less clear what the constituents get out of the deal.", "On their podcasts, our representatives are doing something almost journalistic: They\u2019re moderating discussions with other political figures, interviewing experts on North Korea or monopoly power and staging interactions with the public. Except there are no actual journalists around to ask any pesky questions. At least on TV interview shows or at news conferences, reporters challenge the politician\u2019s narrative. Even on Twitter, we can tweet back.", "But the podcast offers a hermetically sealed branding platform. Mr. Brown\u2019s new show, \u201cCanarycast,\u201d seeks to reinforce his image as a blue-collar champion: It\u2019s named for the canary in the coal mine, and it finds Mr. Brown \u201cmoderating\u201d discussions on how to \u201crestore the value of work in America.\u201d Mr. Duffy\u2019s show, \u201cPlaidcast,\u201d references his rugged status as a lumberjack games champion and sets out to \u201chumanize\u201d his colleagues by interviewing \u201cneat, cool members of Congress.\u201d", "There is plenty of like-minded confabbing \u2014 Mr. Sanders interviewing Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Duffy interviewing fellow Republican members of Congress \u2014 that makes everybody look right and good.

And conservative figures like Sean Hannity, Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro all run successful podcasts with sizable audiences.", "But as President Trump (and before that Candidate Trump) has conquered the media landscape, commanding the agenda on issues big and very, very small, it makes sense that Democratic lawmakers would be most eager to seize alternate outlets to promote their political priorities.

Now, you don\u2019t have to stop at supporting Mr. Sanders as a political candidate; you can get your news filtered through \u201cThe Bernie Sanders Show,\u201d in your podcast feed or on Facebook Live.", "The lawmaker podcast boom is just another way that our political news is becoming less accountable to the public and more personality driven. But that\u2019s not the only thing wrong with it. The podcasts are also boring.", "Efforts to showcase the lighter side of politicians rarely reveal the most interesting things about them. Mr. Emanuel\u2019s podcast would probably be more captivating if he weren\u2019t so focused on seeming supremely relatable and chill. And I\u2019m sure Mr. Duffy has some interesting stories about what it\u2019s like to be in Congress right now, under this president, but he\u2019s instead ceding his time to interviews with other lawmakers about their educational and work backgrounds and what kinds of cheese they like best.", "None of these shows are the optimal conduit for understanding the political issues of the day, unless you\u2019re a big nerd for Congress or really hate conflict.

In the first episode of \u201cCanarycast,\u201d Mr. Brown tells his guests \u2014 a trio of Whirlpool workers \u2014 that he has to end the interview to cast a vote. Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s podcast unexpectedly went silent in January after only six episodes. I guess she\u2019s been busy.", "The political figures with podcasts actually worth listening to are the ones who have left office. These are people who have relevant inside information about how our government works but who are now in a position to pull back the curtain. They also have more incentive to produce something truly interesting, as opposed to simply politically advantageous.", "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign podcast, \u201cWith Her,\u201d became instantly more compelling after her loss; the two episodes she recorded in September reflecting on the election are riveting, even for those with Election 2016 fatigue.

A graduate student in history at the University of Michigan, he was searching online for forgotten alphabets of South Asia when an image of a mysterious writing system popped up. In eight years of digging through British colonial archives both real and digital, he has found almost 200 alphabets across Asia that were previously undescribed in the West, but this one, which he came across in early 2011, stumped him. Its sinuous letters, connected to one another in cursive fashion and sometimes bearing dots and slashes above or below, resembled those of Arabic.", "Pandey eventually identified the script as an alphabet for Rohingya, the language spoken by the stateless and persecuted Muslim people whose greatest numbers live in western Myanmar, where they\u2019ve been the victims of brutal ethnic cleansing. Pandey wasn\u2019t sure if the alphabet itself was in use anymore, until he lucked upon contemporary pictures of printed textbooks for children. That meant it wasn\u2019t a historical footnote; it was alive.", "An email query from Pandey bounced from expert to expert until it landed with Muhammad Noor, a Rohingya activist and television host who was living in Malaysia. He told Pandey the short history of this alphabet, which was developed in the 1980s by a group of scholars that included a man named Mohammed Hanif. It spread slowly through the 1990s in handwritten, photocopied books. After 2001, thanks to two computer fonts designed by Noor, it became possible to type the script in word-processing programs. But no email, text messages or (later) tweets could be sent or received in it, no Google searches conducted in it. The Rohingya had no digital alphabet of their own through which they could connect with one another.", "Billions of people around the world no longer face this plight. Whether on computers or smartphones, they can write as they write, expressing themselves in their own linguistic culture. What makes this possible is a 26-year-old international industrial standard for text data called the Unicode standard, which prescribes the digital letters, numbers and punctuation marks of more than 100 different writing systems: Greek, Cherokee, Arabic, Latin, Devanagari \u2014 a world-spanning storehouse of languages. But the alphabet that Noor described wasn\u2019t among them, and neither are more than 100 other scripts, just over half of them historical and the rest alphabets that could still be used by as many as 400 million people today.", "Now a computational linguist and motivated by a desire to put his historical knowledge to use, Pandey knows how to get obscure alphabets into the Unicode standard. Since 2005, he has done so for 19 writing systems (and he\u2019s currently working to add another eight). With Noor\u2019s help, and some financial support from a research center at the University of California, Berkeley, he drew up the basic set of letters and defined how they combine, what rules govern punctuation and whether spaces exist between words, then submitted a proposal to the Unicode Consortium, the organization that maintains the standards for digital scripts. In 2018, seven years after Pandey\u2019s discovery, what came to be called Hanifi Rohingya will be rolled out in Unicode\u2019s 11th version. The Rohingya will be able to communicate online with one another, using their own alphabet.", "As a practical matter, this will not have much impact for the Rohingya who are suffering in Myanmar, many of whom are illiterate and shut off from educational and technological opportunity. \u201cThe spread of this new digital system is unlikely to go to scale,\u201d Maung Zarni, a human rights activist who works on Rohingya issues, and Natalie Brinham, a Ph.D. fellow at Queen Mary University of London, told me in an email. They emphasized that the Rohingya do not have the autonomy to organize their own schools. But given the group\u2019s history of oppression, the encoding of their language carries considerable symbolic weight because it legitimizes an oppressed minority and their language. \u201cIt becomes a tool of unity to help people come together,\u201d Noor says.", "Creating such interconnectedness and expanding the linguistic powers of technology users around the world is the whole point of Unicode. If the work is slow, that\u2019s because standardizing a writing system for computers is a delicate art that relies on both engineering and diplomacy. And the time and attention of the volunteers who maintain the standard are finite. So what happens when a new system of visual communication like emoji emerges and comes under their purview? Things get even slower and the mission more complicated.", "Shortly after finishing a linguistics Ph.D. at Berkeley in 1980, Ken Whistler was frustrated by the inability of mainframe computers to print the specialized phonetic symbols that linguists use. I can fix that, he thought, and he then hacked an early personal computer to do so. In 1989, on one of his first days on the job at a software start-up, his boss told him to meet with a Xerox computer scientist, Joe Becker, who had just published a manifesto on multilingual computing. \u201cThe people of the world need to be able to communicate and compute in their own native languages,\u201d Becker wrote, \u201cnot just in English.\u201d", "At the time, computing in the United States relied on encodings like those from the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (usually known as ASCII), which assigned numerical identifiers to letters, numbers, punctuation and behaviors (like \u201cindent\u201d). The capital letter \u201cA,\u201d for instance, had an ASCII code of 065, or 01000001 in the 0s and 1s in the binary code of computers. Each textual character used by a computer needs its own unique sequence, a numerical identifier or \u201ccharacter encoding.\u201d The problem with ASCII was that it had only 256 codes to distribute and far more than 256 characters in the world needing identifiers.", "In order to work with more writing systems than ASCII was able to handle, technology companies like Apple, Xerox, IBM, DEC, Hewlett-Packard and even Kodak created their proprietary encodings. None of them worked with the others. To complicate things further, some nations insisted as a matter of national pride on their own standards for text data. \u201cThe proliferation of character encodings was chaos,\u201d Whistler says.", "Joe Becker gathered like-minded computer scientists to bring order to the chaos, arguing that cooperation was needed among companies. The result was the Unicode Consortium, which was incorporated in 1991. He also maintained that the solution had to be international and helped broker an alliance with the International Organization for Standardization, which maintains more than 20,000 standards related to products and services, from the tensile strength of yarn to the chemical composition of toys. Such standards are meant to ensure, among other things, that things from one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. Standardized shipping containers, for instance, have made international commerce far more efficient. Standards don\u2019t become regulations; they\u2019re conventions, \u201crecipes for reality\u201d in the words of Lawrence Busch, a sociologist emeritus at Michigan State University who studies how standards arise. Unicode unified all the numerical identifiers and made sure they were reliable and up-to-date.", "As is the case in other standards organizations, full membership in the nonprofit Unicode Consortium comes with the right to vote on changes to the standard. Membership dues are $18,000 annually; current full members include global tech giants (like Apple, Facebook and Google) and the Sultanate of Oman (which wants to see digital Arabic improved). A second membership tier includes a university, government bodies in Bangladesh and India, a typeface company and an emoji search engine. Over the years, members came and went, depending on their immediate interest in issues of standardization.", "Unicode\u2019s idealistic founders intended to bring the personal-computing revolution to everyone on the planet, regardless of language. \u201cThe people who really got the bug,\u201d Whistler says, \u201csaw themselves at an inflection point in history and their chance to make a difference.\u201d No fortunes have been made through Unicode, unless you count the platforms (like Twitter) and products (like the iPhone) that adopted the standard.", "Unicode\u2019s history is full of attacks by governments, activists and eccentrics. In the early 1990s, the Chinese government objected to the encoding of Tibetan. About five years ago, Hungarian nationalists tried to sabotage the encoding for Old Hungarian because they wanted it to be called \u201cSzekley-Hungarian Rovas\u201d instead. An encoding for an alphabet used to write Nepal Bhasa and Sanskrit was delayed a few years ago by ethnonationalists who mistrusted the proposal because they objected to the author\u2019s surname. Over and over, the Unicode Consortium has protected its standard from such political attacks.", "The standard\u2019s effectiveness helped. \u201cIf standards work, they\u2019re invisible and can be ignored by the public,\u201d Busch says. Twenty years after its first version, Unicode had become the default text-data standard, adopted by device manufacturers and software companies all over the world. Each version of the standard ushered more users into a seamless digital world of text. \u201cWe used to ask ourselves, \u2018How many years do you think the consortium will need to be in place before we can publish the last version?\u2019\u2009\u201d Whistler recalls. The end was finally in sight \u2014 at one point the consortium had barely more than 50 writing systems to add.", "All that changed in October 2010, when that year\u2019s version of the Unicode standard included its first set of emojis.", "On a downtown San Francisco street last November, partygoers were lined up at a Taco Bell truck to get tacos. Inside the nearby co-working space, Covo, was the opening night party of Emojicon, a weekend-long celebration of all things emoji, held just days before the presidential election. Only foods that could be depicted with emojis were being served, while a balloon artist twisted approximations of various emojis.", "In the late 1990s, when Japanese phone manufacturers first put emojis on their devices as marketing gimmicks, messaging standards required that emojis be sent as text data \u2014 as characters matched to strings of numbers, not as images. But emojis were unreadable on devices that couldn\u2019t translate their numerical identifiers.", "When a software engineer named Graham Asher suggested in 2000 that Unicode take responsibility for emojis, the consortium demurred on the grounds that pictures were subjectively interpreted. A few years later, companies like Apple and Microsoft realized that the increasingly popular Japanese emojis would appear as gibberish on their products and pushed the consortium to encode them. By 2009, 974 emojis had been assigned numerical identifiers, which were released the following year.", "As the demand for new emojis surged, so, too, did the criticisms. White human figures didn\u2019t reflect the diversity of real skin colors. Many emojis for specific professions (like police officer and construction worker) had only male figures, while icons for foods didn\u2019t represent what people around the world actually ate. Millions of users wanted to communicate using the language of emoji, and as consumers, they expected change to be swift. One thing appeared to be slowing things down: the Unicode Consortium.", "At Emojicon, resentment toward Unicode was simmering amid the emoji karaoke, emoji improv and talks on emoji linguistics. \u201cSuch a 1980s sci-fi villain name,\u201d one participant grumbled. \u201cWho put them in charge?\u201d A student from Rice University, Mark Bramhill, complained that the requirements for the yoga-pose emoji he had proposed were off-puttingly specific, almost as if they were meant to deter him. A general antiestablishment frustration seemed to be directed at the ruling organization. One speaker, Latoya Peterson, the deputy editor of digital innovation for ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Undefeated,\u201d urged people to submit proposals to Unicode for more diverse emojis. \u201cWe are the internet!\u201d she said. \u201cIt is us!\u201d", "On the first morning of Emojicon, Mark Davis, president of Unicode, explained in a talk that the consortium also maintains the repository for time and date formats, currency and language names and other information that adapts computer functions to where a user is. Even more demanding technically is making sure that characters behave as users want them to. One major achievement has been ironing out how right-to-left alphabets like Arabic are used in the same line of text as left-to-right ones like Latin, which affects billions of users and can take years to adjust. Dealing with emojis, in short, is a small, though increasing, part of the consortium\u2019s responsibilities.", "Davis mentioned that once characters become part of the Unicode standard, they\u2019re never removed. This inspired one young designer in the audience to announce that he\u2019d ensure his legacy by proposing emojis until one was accepted. The crowd laughed; Davis smiled coolly, perhaps because Unicode committees have been overwhelmed with some 500 submissions in the last three years.", "Not everyone thinks that Unicode should be in the emoji business at all. I met several people at Emojicon promoting apps that treat emojis like pictures, not text, and I heard an idea floated for a separate standards body for emojis run by people with nontechnical backgrounds. \u201cNormal people can have an opinion about why there isn\u2019t a cupcake emoji,\u201d said Jennifer 8. Lee, an entrepreneur and a film producer whose advocacy on behalf of a dumpling emoji inspired her to organize Emojicon. The issue isn\u2019t space \u2014 Unicode has about 800,000 unused numerical identifiers \u2014 but about whose expertise and worldview shapes the standard and prioritizes its projects.", "\u201cEmoji has had a tendency to subtract attention from the other important things the consortium needs to be working on,\u201d Ken Whistler says. He believes that Unicode was right to take responsibility for emoji, because it has the technical expertise to deal with character chaos (and has dealt with it before). But emoji is an unwanted distraction. \u201cWe can spend hours arguing for an emoji for chopsticks, and then have nobody in the room pay any attention to details for what\u2019s required for Nepal, which the people in Nepal use to write their language. That\u2019s my main concern: emoji eats the attention span both in the committee and for key people with other responsibilities.\u201d", "Emoji has nonetheless provided a boost to Unicode. Companies frequently used to implement partial versions of the standard, but the spread of emoji now forces them to adopt more complete versions of it. As a result, smartphones that can manage emoji will be more likely to have Hanifi Rohingya on them too. The stream of proposals also makes the standard seem alive, attracting new volunteers to Unicode\u2019s mission. It\u2019s not unusual for people who come to the organization through an interest in emoji to end up embracing its priorities. \u201cWorking on characters used in a small province of China, even if it\u2019s 20,000 people who are going to use it, that\u2019s a more important use of their time than deliberating over whether the hand of my yoga emoji is in the right position,\u201d Mark Bramhill told me.", "Since its creation was announced in 2015, the \u201cAdopt a Character\u201d program, through which individuals and organizations can sponsor any characters, including emojis, has raised more than $200,000. A percentage of the proceeds goes to support the Script Encoding Initiative, a research project based at Berkeley, which is headed by the linguistics researcher Deborah Anderson, who is devoted to making Unicode truly universal. One the consortium recently accepted is called Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong, devised for the Hmong language by a minister in California whose parishioners have been using it for more than 25 years. Still in the proposal stage is Tigalari, once used to write Sanskrit and other Indian languages.", "One way to read the story of Unicode in the time of emoji is to see a privileged generation of tech consumers confronting the fact that they can\u2019t communicate in ways they want to on their devices: through emoji. They get involved in standards-making, which yields them some satisfaction but slows down the speed with which millions of others around the world get access to the most basic of online linguistic powers. \u201cThere are always winners and losers in standards,\u201d Lawrence Busch says. \u201cYou might want to say, ultimately we\u2019d like everyone to win and nobody to lose too much, but we\u2019re stuck with the fact that we have to make decisions, and when we make them, those decisions are going to be less acceptable to some than to others.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/business/week-ahead-supreme-court-jobs-report.html": ["Here\u2019s what to expect in the week ahead:", "LABOR", "On Monday, the first day of its new term, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about one of the central questions in today\u2019s workplace: whether companies can require workers to forfeit their rights to join together in lawsuits or arbitration proceedings against their employers. The court accepted three cases that produced conflicting rulings in federal appeals courts. In two of those cases, the appeals courts ruled that employers violate federal labor law when they require employees to forfeit these rights. In a third case, the appeals court ruled these kinds of employment contracts can be legal. Because of the cost of legal representation, experts say, workers are far less likely to sue their employers over issues like safety violations or wage theft if they cannot band together to do so.

I think early on, in the pilot, when we see that Donna is an engineer, we wanted to see some sort of rise to power for her. I guess we always knew at some level that Joe would become something very different than what he thought he wanted to be. When you pitch a show, the network asks, \u201cHow many seasons do you see here?\u201d and you go, \u201cOh, at least five!\u201d And you really have to say that with a lot of confidence and bluster. You pitch what it could be, which is really just proof of concept, to show the network you can think long term.

I think the \u201crise of Mutiny\u201d story line was us finding our voice. There was something about the neon, snarky, punky type thing that came up between Cameron and Donna that when we saw it, we knew.

That was a storytelling structure that was worthy of being investigated. I think the best shows crack that wide open and mine them for all they\u2019re worth.

We would always have the audience assuming he was up to something. I think when you have that established, you can play against it. What would it take to make people want to get back into rooms, let alone business with Joe? So while I think at first that was kind of a liability, it felt like the show could be about a man who will do anything to do a deal. You really get a story about a man becoming human.

Why unravel them?", "CANTWELL Cameron and Joe have always been a challenge for us. When they met, they were both wearing masks that covered up a lot of baggage. Cameron is someone who appreciates and enjoys being a lightning rod or a divining rod for brilliance, and Joe is someone who is always looking for that kind of inspiration in himself. He\u2019s good at finding it. She\u2019s good at producing it. But as people, they were just so damaged.

But also, what we\u2019ve been trying to say in this series, and exemplify with the characters\u2019 lives, is that nothing lasts forever.

He was 66.", "The company, in Santa Clara, Calif., said he died in his sleep, but it did not specify a cause.", "Mr. Otellini led Intel from 2005 to 2013 and was the first leader of that Silicon Valley giant who was not trained as an engineer. He rose mainly through Intel\u2019s sales and marketing ranks after joining the company in 1974, but he held other positions as well, including chief of staff for Andrew S. Grove, the longtime chairman and chief executive who was credited with turning Intel into the dominant supplier of microprocessor chips for personal computers. Mr. Grove died in 2016.", "Where Mr. Grove and his immediate predecessor, Craig R. Barrett, were tough taskmasters, Mr. Otellini was known for a softer, more personable touch. \u201cHe solved problems without yelling like some of his predecessors,\u201d Mr. Barrett wrote in an email. \u201cProbably the best decision I made as C.E.O. was to recommend him as my replacement.\u201d", "Through the 1980s and \u201990s, Intel solidified its position in personal computers as advances in manufacturing produced chips that ran software faster. But Mr. Otellini faced a series of challenges when he became chief executive in May 2005.", "At the time, Intel\u2019s chips consumed too much power and generated too much heat. The company\u2019s rival Advanced Micro Devices had introduced attractive processors that grabbed a sizable chunk of the market. AMD followed up with an antitrust lawsuit against Intel that prompted government investigations by the authorities in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe.", "Mr. Otellini battled back by listening to customers, former colleagues said. That approach was recognized when he got an onstage hug in June 2005 from Steve Jobs, then Apple\u2019s chief executive, who had agreed to switch to Intel technology for the company\u2019s popular Macintosh computer line.", "Mr. Otellini pushed Intel to develop more energy-efficient chips, fueling a trend in which laptop computers were beginning to supplant desktop models. In the case of winning Apple\u2019s Mac business, Mr. Otellini also agreed to offer very low prices.", "\u201cHe was willing to take an upfront hit to forge a partnership,\u201d Andy Bryant, Intel\u2019s chairman, said.", "But Mr. Otellini later admitted to making a major miscue in the mobile market. Those devices were mainly built using chip technology developed by ARM Holdings, which drew much less power than PC chips and was licensed to multiple manufacturers that competed on price and features.", "Intel for a time built ARM chips, too, but that business was unprofitable. Mr. Otellini dropped it, opting to court phone makers with Intel\u2019s mainstay x86 chip design.", "Intel was still in the running as a supplier when Apple was developing the first iPhone, which was introduced in 2007, ushering in what would become a giant market for smartphones. Mr. Otellini underestimated the iPhone\u2019s sales potential and viewed Apple\u2019s price demands as onerous.", "\u201cWe ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you want to view it,\u201d Mr. Otellini said in a 2013 interview with The Atlantic magazine. \u201cThe world would have been a lot different if we\u2019d done it.\u201d", "Though Intel missed the smartphone boom, it won over internet companies like Google and Facebook on the way to grabbing nearly all of the market for chips used in data centers. In all, Intel estimated, the company\u2019s annual revenue rose to $53 billion from $34 billion under Mr. Otellini.", "He also left a legacy as a peacemaker when Intel settled its court battles with regulators and A.M.D. \u201cThat was driven by Otellini more than anyone else,\u201d said Hector Ruiz, a former A.M.D. chief who launched the litigation.", "Paul Stevens Otellini, the son of Dave Otellini, a butcher, and his wife, Evelyn, was born in San Francisco on Oct. 12, 1950.

Smaller markets experience the company as a powerful invading force \u2014 often a welcome one. The company\u2019s model easily outclasses and undercuts provincial competitors, conscripting local cabbies and enlisting new drivers. Flimsy taxi regulations backed by weak municipal governments are quickly overwhelmed by the multibillion-dollar company and its armies of lawyers and lobbyists and their briefcases full of case studies and legislative suggestions.", "But in larger markets with bigger taxi companies, municipal governments bristle at the company\u2019s deep, evident disdain for their authority \u2014 and they\u2019re capable of striking back. Last month, in a sudden show of force, London told Uber that its license to operate in the city wouldn\u2019t be renewed. The city\u2019s transit authority cited a number of reasons for its actions: Uber\u2019s approach to reporting crimes; its background-check policies; its aggressive attempts to thwart regulators; general appeals to \u201cpublic safety\u201d and \u201ccorporate responsibility.\u201d", "\u201cWhile Uber has revolutionized the way people move in cities around the world, it\u2019s equally true that we\u2019ve got things wrong along the way,\u201d Uber\u2019s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, wrote in a public letter. But this performance of contrition came on the heels of the company\u2019s first effort at retaliation. It had already mobilized its drivers and users, starting a petition accusing the city of having \u201cgiven in to a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice,\u201d of threatening the livelihoods of tens of thousands of its workers and of depriving millions of customers. The effort quickly garnered more than 800,000 signatures.", "London\u2019s threat to Uber is clearly existential: Being shut out of one of its largest markets is terrible for business and sets a dangerous precedent for the company as it tries to expand around the globe. But governments similarly perceive, in Uber, a broader challenge to their legitimacy. Uber doesn\u2019t so much do business in cities as unilaterally install itself as infrastructure. Its incompatibilities with local regulations or national employment law are presented as neither features nor bugs but as evidence of evolution and progress. It identifies, vets and credentials drivers. It fields complaints and arbitrates disputes, exercising authority over those it deems bad actors. It lets riders rate drivers and vice versa, creating a sort of customer-service-centric accountability. Because Uber purports to be self-regulating, its users and drivers share in the company\u2019s feeling that outside interference is unwelcome and even unnatural. It now has a constituency, hundreds of thousands strong, angry with their government on behalf of a corporation.", "The same week Uber was given notice in London, Mark Zuckerberg sat down in front of a camera in Menlo Park, Calif. His desaturated earth-tone palette was matched color for color by his office in the background, as if to provide camouflage. Indeed, it was easy to miss the sheer range and strangeness of what he was there to say. \u201cI care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world.\u201d", "Facebook had recently disclosed that it believed Russian state actors purchased political ads during the 2016 election; more broadly, it had been accused of allowing disinformation and misinformation to thrive on its platform. Among the measures that Zuckerberg said his company would take included expanding \u201cpartnerships\u201d with election commissions around the world and \u201cworking proactively to strengthen the democratic process.\u201d Most striking, coming from the C.E.O. of a publicly traded American social-media company, was this line: \u201cWe have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend.\u201d", "Social-media companies aren\u2019t new to defending themselves in ideological terms \u2014 they\u2019re just not used to doing it on their home turf. While to authoritarian regimes, the threat of social media is obvious, in the United States, Facebook, Twitter and Google have for years talked about themselves freely in the language of democracy, participation and connectivity. The emerging tension between internet platforms and democratic governments, however, seems to stem less from their obvious rhetorical differences than from their similarities.", "Facebook\u2019s transition from a confident stride to a guarded crouch was conspicuous and sudden, arriving roughly at the same time as President Trump. Shortly after the 2016 election, Zuckerberg dismissed heated claims that misinformation on his platform had gotten Trump elected as a \u201cpretty crazy idea.\u201d In September, he admitted that his comment was dismissive, but did so after months of near-constant scrutiny, including, according to The Washington Post, a postelection lecture from President Obama. In an interview with Bloomberg published in September, he sounded more wistful than irritated: \u201cFor most of the existence of the company, this idea of connecting the world has not been a controversial thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething changed.\u201d It certainly had: Facebook was being implicated as potentially harmful to the systems within which it had thrived, and with which it had sought to identify itself.", "The problem was that Facebook had outgrown every context except its own. Though it neither thinks like nor resembles a government, it has effectively sewn itself into the fabric of users\u2019 public and personal lives. Facebook accounts have now become something like IDs, enabling an ever-growing range of activities: commerce, job-seeking, leisure. Networks stand in for community; encryption, in owned and operated services like WhatsApp, stands in for guarantees of liberty; newsfeeds become sources of diverse information, including ads, yes, but also calls to register to vote \u2014 to apply elsewhere what you\u2019ve increasingly experienced online.", "All this is to say that a sufficiently successful social platform is experienced, much like Uber, as a piece of infrastructure. Except, instead of wrapping its marketplace around a city\u2019s roads, Facebook makes a new market around communication, media and civil society. This, from a founder\u2019s perspective, is an electrifying outcome. But this cultural metastasis has led to a swift and less-than-discriminate backlash. Already, calls for regulating the largest internet platforms are growing louder while remaining tellingly vague. After all, what can a government realistically do about a problem like Facebook?", "It\u2019s very likely that any approach to regulating Facebook will look more like diplomacy than anything else \u2014 a cautious search for d\u00e9tente with an institution that ultimately gets to set its own laws, whether a government likes it or not. Indeed, the company has been presenting itself as a willing, generous participant in American investigations, but more generally as a supranational, self-regulating force for good, and, boldly, as indispensable for the continuation of democracy around the world. \u201cWe will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world,\u201d Zuckerberg said, \u201cbut also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.\u201d For citizen users, it\u2019s a gesture of good faith. To skeptical countries, it\u2019s a gentle declaration of independence, or maybe a dare.

In his proudest moments, he resembles something like a theorist of transformation, decline and creation. In his lowest, he is more like a speaking canary, prone to prophecy, a game with losing odds. His attempts at optimism are framed as counterintuitive, faring little better, in predictive terms, than his lapses into pessimism. He teeters hazardously between implicating his audience and merely giving their anxieties a name. He \u2014 and it is almost always a he \u2014 is the critical equivalent of an unreliable narrator, unable to write about technology without also writing about himself. Occasionally, he is right: about what is happening, about what should happen, and about what it means. And so he carries on, and his audience with him.", "Franklin Foer, thankfully, recognizes these pitfalls even if he can\u2019t always avoid them. Who can? The melodramatically titled \u201cWorld Without Mind,\u201d Foer\u2019s compact attempt at a broad technological polemic \u2014 which identifies the stupendous successes of Amazon, Google and Facebook, among others, as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the individual and to society \u2014 begins with a disclaimer. Foer\u2019s tumultuous stint editing The New Republic under the ownership of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes ended with mass resignations and public acrimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this experience informs the argument of this book,\u201d he writes. He is likewise entangled through his proximity to publishing: The author\u2019s friends, colleagues and immediate family members \u2014 including his brother, the novelist Jonathan Safran Foer \u2014 depend to different degrees on the industry Amazon consumed first. The book is dedicated to his father, Bert, a crusading antitrust lawyer.", "In this slightly crouched posture, and with a hint of healthy self-doubt, Foer proceeds quickly. We, the consuming public, have failed to properly understand the new tech superpowers, he suggests, leaving little hope for stodgy and reluctant American regulators. The scope of their influence is obscured by the sheer number of things they do and sell, or problems they purport to be solving, and by our outdated sense of what constitutes a monopoly. To that end, Foer promotes the concept of the \u201cknowledge monopoly,\u201d which he qualifies with a mischievous grin. \u201cMy hope is that we revive \u2018monopoly\u2019 as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers,\u201d he says, rather than as a \u201ctechnical\u201d term referring to one company cornerning a market. (His new monopolists, after all, aren\u2019t raising prices. They\u2019re giving things away free).", "For much of the book, readers are parachuted into various moments in the history of computing, the internet, media and philosophy. Character introductions arrive rapidly, with a casualness that can slip into absurdity: Descartes \u201cenjoyed his sleep\u201d; Mark Zuckerberg \u201cis a good boy, but he wanted to be bad, or maybe just a little bit naughty\u201d; Alan Turing was an \u201catheist and a loner,\u201d while Ray Kurzweil, the prophet of an artificial-intelligence-driven singularity, is driven by his inability to escape \u201cthe biggest fear of them all.\u201d (Death.) The effect is slightly delirious but genuinely enjoyable. Readers are flung through a highly selective history of the philosophy of mind, landing squarely on their feet in Google\u2019s A.I. laboratories. The 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\u2019s stubborn and total belief that knowledge could be reduced to mathematical computation leads surprisingly seamlessly into a perceptive assessment of Zuckerberg\u2019s fraught and inconsistent public relationship with the concept of the algorithm, his mission to connect the world and the billions of meaningful decisions made by Facebook\u2019s software every day.", "As Foer\u2019s book veers into advocacy, readers are treated to a similarly energetic and cleareyed view of the modern \u201cknowledge monopoly\u201d giants. Jeff Bezos\u2019 techno-populist suggestion that he can \u201csee the elimination of gatekeepers everywhere\u201d is contrasted with his personal purchase of The Washington Post and his stewardship over Amazon, which is a massive, diverse and participatory marketplace, but one under the control of a single private company with a reputation for ruthlessness and strong-arm negotiation tactics. \u201cOld gatekeepers might not always have been worthy of praise,\u201d Foer writes, \u201cbut at least there were a lot of them.\u201d", "His best assessment of what has happened to media in general in the last decade is tucked in an aside about what Facebook, Google and Amazon all offer, or threaten: They are the \u201cprimary bundlers\u201d of commercial media, whether it\u2019s books, articles or video. \u201cThey are the ones that create a usable, coherent product from its disparate parts. Their business model is infinitely better than the one it displaced.\u201d More broadly, truly ambitious tech companies are in the business of creating markets, not competing in them; of wrapping themselves around industries, not merely disrupting them.", "The New Republic, of which Foer was editor twice \u2014 Hughes invited him back in 2012 partly as a demonstration of good faith for a skeptical staff \u2014 appears intermittently in \u201cWorld Without Mind.\u201d Foer doesn\u2019t share gossip or indulge much in the way of bitterness. He is generous in his only slightly condescending description of the magazine\u2019s young tech-rich owner and in his minimally insulting account of working with the company\u2019s data-obsessed C.E.O., whose arrival plainly portended Foer\u2019s departure and the subsequent resignation of a majority of its masthead. What happened at The New Republic is more useful to Foer as an entry point for describing the news media\u2019s state of utter upheaval at the time. Here, again, he becomes the knowingly unreliable narrator: His obvious loathing of the social-media-driven news coverage pursued in recent years by most media organizations does capture the fatalistic mood of the industry, but betrays a sense of nostalgia for a better era that can be hard to locate anywhere outside of Foer\u2019s own memory. He also reveals a lack of interest in new modes of media production that were rising as his magazine fell.", "Foer\u2019s other concession to nostalgia, in the form of an inoffensive command to return to the \u201csustaining nourishment of the contemplative life and the deep commitment to text,\u201d is overshadowed by a vigorous and novel call for regulatory intervention. He reminds us that the issue of monopoly dominated our politics for generations, even as the companies in the crosshairs changed in form and ambition. Though he makes no radical or provocative case to, say, nationalize Facebook, or to break up Google, he does suggest creating a Data Protection Authority, in the mold of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s post-financial-crisis Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and calling for government to protect privacy as it (in theory) protects the environment.", "Is this idealistic, plain crazy, or just impotent?

But beyond that academic analysis, in political debate in a polarized country, the word \u201cterrorism\u201d is also a verbal weapon, freely wielded \u2014 especially when the accused is Muslim.", "\u201cThe label is so powerfully pejorative and carries so much weight,\u201d said Martha Crenshaw, a terrorism expert at Stanford\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation.", "The first reports of any mass attack summon not only a general sense of grief, but anxieties and wishes in specific American subgroups: Muslim Americans pray that the attacker does not share their faith, for instance; conservatives and liberals alike want the assailant to turn out to be a member of their political opposition.", "\u201cIn today\u2019s political climate, it\u2019s so polarized that people are hoping it\u2019s not pinned on their side,\u201d Ms. Crenshaw said. As a political progressive, she admitted to a passing feeling of dread on Monday that the gunman might come from the left.", "More cynical observers of American politics may feel that Mr. Paddock\u2019s advanced age, white race and non-Muslim religious background make it less likely that he will be tagged a terrorist, whatever may emerge about his politics.", "And this gruesome tragedy, perhaps the deadliest single shooting episode in American history, quickly and predictably reopened a debate on gun control. If Mr. Paddock\u2019s purpose was uncertain, his choice of weapons was unmistakable.", "The tussle over what terrorism is dates back to the beginning of its modern history, said David C. Rapoport, the dean of American historians of terror.

He said each of the earlier waves lasted about 40 years, and that he expected the period of religious terrorism to fade by 2025.", "But in every case, the perpetrators had a clear ideological agenda. They were also overwhelmingly young, Mr. Rapoport said. Mr. Paddock so far seems to fit none of the patterns. His age, a year short of qualifying for Medicare, is especially perplexing.", "Still, the phenomenon of mass shooting, whether or not it properly carries the terrorist label in a particular case, is a recognizable American phenomenon. And from the point of view of potential victims, the crucial factor may not be a specific ideological motivation but the decision to target random, innocent people.", "Homicides in the United States rose more than 8 percent in 2016, to 17,250, the F.B.I. reported last month.

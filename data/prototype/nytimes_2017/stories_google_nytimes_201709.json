Such an analysis is a matter of art as much as science, however. Getting it right is crucial in the United States right now, because stock market valuations are already high enough to be worrisome.", "But are investors primed psychologically for a major decline in the stock market, or are they likely to keep bidding up stocks for some time to come? Those are critical questions.", "We can\u2019t peer into investors\u2019 minds, of course. But we can examine news articles for data on what they are reading. In a column in March, I noted that surveys indicate that people in the United States think the stock market is expensive. That would be dangerous if it meant that many investors were thinking of getting out of the market. But while I analyzed stock valuations, I didn\u2019t look at current stock market news coverage and compare it with the evidence from previous periods in which prices were also elevated. I\u2019ll remedy that now.", "First, consider stock prices. They are very high, particularly when using the Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings ratio, or C.A.P.E., which I defined almost thirty years ago with Prof. John Y. Campbell, who is now at Harvard University. The C.A.P.E. ratio is essentially the price earnings ratio, with annual fluctuations smoothed by averaging. (More precisely, it is the inflation-corrected stock price divided by the lagging ten-year average of real earnings.)", "The C.A.P.E. ratio is above 30 today, compared with an average of 16.8 since 1881. It has been above 30 in only two other periods: in 1929, when it reached 33, and between 1997 and 2002, when it soared as high as 44.", "The current number is troubling. After the ratio\u2019s peak in 1929, real inflation-corrected stock prices in the United States lost four-fifths of their value by 1932, the biggest crash in the market\u2019s history. And from 2000 to 2003, they lost half of their real value.", "So current valuations make the market vulnerable. But it took more than high valuation numbers to precipitate those ugly declines in the past. The other ingredient was mass psychology. For information about what investors thought other investors were thinking, we can go to the newspaper archives.", "First, in 1929, before the great October stock market crash, newspapers said prominently and repeatedly that traders were engaging in widespread speculative gambling. In an annual outlook piece on January 1, for example, The New York Times described \u201cfantastic illusions\u201d that were spurring \u201cthe most reckless stock market speculation.\u201d The article said it was possible that, before long, \u201cthe bubble bursts.\u201d", "The notion that investors were laboring under \u201cfantastic illusions\u201d and had bid up prices to unsupportable levels appeared in many places. On the same day, The Atlanta Constitution ran a all-caps banner headline in its financial pages: \u201cSTOCK MARKET ACTIVITY AND PRICE FLUCTUATIONS SMASHED ALL RECORDS DURING YEAR JUST CLOSED.\u201d", "The Proquest newspaper database shows an increasing concern that excessive lending to support share purchases was fueling stock speculation, starting in 1927, and peaking in 1929. The database also shows a sudden increase in 1928, and again in 1929, of references to \u201ctulipomania\u201d \u2014 the bubble in tulip prices in Amsterdam that crashed in the 1630s. In 1928, the database shows, there was also a sudden burst in the use of the term \u201cspeculative orgy\u201d in stock market articles.", "Decades later, in the period leading to the dot-com crash that started in March 2000, we saw eerily similar themes in news articles. The term \u201ctulipomania\u201d began to spike again in the newspaper database, for example. And in a 1996 speech, Alan Greenspan raised the specter of \u201cirrational exuberance,\u201d, a term that went viral by 2000 (I made it the title of a book on the markets that I published that year). When dot-com stock prices started to decline in 2000, people were already primed to rethink their assumptions about the wisdom of holding shares in internet companies.", "In early 2000, for example, there was a surge in stories of foolish investors buying anything with \u201c.com\u201d in the company name. Dot-com investments morphed into embarrassing \u201cdot-bombs,\u201d articles said, affecting the self-confidence of stock market investors and plausibly bleeding over to the whole market.", "So where are we today?", "Mass psychology appears to be in a different, calmer place. Investors do not seem to have the concern they had in 1929 or 2000 that other investors might suddenly sell their holdings and get out of the stock market.", "That said, speculation based on excessive lending is a worry, the newspaper database indicates, but less so than in the previous periods. References to tulipomania have been appearing from time to time, but widespread fear that we might already be immersed in a speculative orgy is simply not evident. And while there have been articles this year about the boom in so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), the database indicates that this issue is minimal compared with the attention given in the late 1990s to the dangers of dot.com stocks.", "In the financial sphere, discussions of bitcoin, the leading so-called cryptocurrency, have gone viral twice, in 2013 and again this year. There may well be a bitcoin bubble, but with a total market value for bitcoin that is still less than $100 billion dollars, potential problems within that world don\u2019t seem to provide investors with sufficient reason to consider bailing out of the vastly larger stock market. And articles about the outlook for the stock market on New Year\u2019s Day in 2017 contained barely a hint of the concerns about speculative mania that were so evident in 1929.", "Why people are so calm about the high-priced market is a bit of a mystery. On this, I can only speculate. Perhaps investors have been distracted by the endless flow of news about Donald J. Trump, North Korea, the back-to-back hurricanes and so much else. I don\u2019t really know.", "But the result is that while valuations remain very high there just doesn\u2019t seem to be much evidence that many investors in the United States stock market are actively worrying today that other investors are on the verge of selling. Mass opinions may well change, but for now, in the critical psychological dimension, the stock market does not closely resemble the market in the dangerous years of 1929 or 2000.", "That doesn\u2019t mean that there is no danger of a crash.

Brown, 32, started his career at a paper in upstate New York, where he grew up, and looks the part of a local reporter, clad in a fresh oxford and khakis that tend to become disheveled over the course of his long days. His first order of business was an article about a City Council meeting from the night before, which he hadn\u2019t attended. Brown pulled up a recording of the proceedings and began punching out notes for his weekly article. Because most governing in Twin Falls is done by a city manager, these meetings tend to deal with trivial subjects like lawn-watering and potholes, but Brown could tell immediately that this one was different.", "\u201cWe have been made aware of a situation,\u201d said the first speaker, an older man with a scraggly white beard who had hobbled up to the lectern. \u201cAn alleged assault of a minor child and we can\u2019t get any information on it. Apparently, it\u2019s been indicated that the perpetrators were foreign Muslim youth that conducted this \u2014 I guess it was a rape.\u201d Brown recognized the man as Terry Edwards. About a year earlier, after The Times-News reported that Syrian refugees would very likely be resettled in Twin Falls, Edwards joined a movement to shut the resettlement program down. The group circulated a petition to put the proposal before voters. They failed to get enough signatures to force a referendum, but Brown was struck by how much support around town the movement attracted. In bars after work, he began to overhear conversations about the dangers of Islam. One night, he heard a man joke about dousing the entrance to the local mosque with pig\u2019s blood.", "After he finished watching the video, Brown called the police chief, Craig Kingsbury, to get more information about the case. Kingsbury said that he couldn\u2019t discuss it and that the police reports were sealed because minors were involved. Brown made a couple phone calls: to the mayor and to his colleague at the paper who covers crime. He pieced together that 12 days earlier, three children had been discovered partly clothed inside a shared laundry room at the apartment complex where they lived. There were two boys, a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old, and a 5-year-old girl. The 7-year-old boy was accused of attempting some kind of sex act with the 5-year-old, and the 10-year-old had used a cellphone borrowed from his older brother to record it. The girl was American and, like most people in Twin Falls, white. The boys were refugees; Brown wasn\u2019t sure from where. In his article about the meeting, Brown seems to anticipate that the police chief\u2019s inability to elaborate was not going to sit well with the people whose testimony he had just watched.", "That weekend, Brown was on his way to see a movie when he received a Facebook message from Jim Dalos Jr., a 52-year-old known to Twin Falls journalists and police as Scanner Man. Dalos is disabled; he works six hours a week as a dishwasher at a pizzeria but spends most of his time in his apartment, sitting in a reclining chair and drinking Diet Pepsi out of a 52-ounce plastic mug, voraciously consuming news. He reads the local paper, old issues of which litter his living-room floor, and keeps the television blaring \u2014 usually Fox News. He got his nickname because he constantly monitors an old police scanner, a gift he received as a teenager from his father, and often calls in tips to the media based on what he hears. He also happens to live at the apartment complex, Fawnbrook, where the laundry-room incident occurred.", "Dalos told Brown that he had seen the police around Fawnbrook and that the victim\u2019s mother told him that the boys had been arrested. He also pointed Brown to a couple of Facebook groups that were created in response to the crime. Brown scrolled through them on his cellphone and saw links flying back and forth with articles that said that the little girl had been gang raped at knife point, that the perpetrators were Syrian refugees and that their fathers had celebrated with them afterward by giving them high fives. The stories also claimed that the City Council and the police department were conspiring to bury the crime.", "Over the weekend, Brown plowed through his daily packs of cigarettes as he watched hundreds, then thousands, of people joining the groups. Their panic appeared to be piqued by a mass shooting, the deadliest in American history, that had just occurred at Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The perpetrator had declared allegiance to ISIS. The commenters also posted stories that claimed refugees were responsible for a rash of rapes in Europe and that a similar phenomenon in the United States was imminent. \u201cMy girl is blond and blue-eyed,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cI am extremely worried about her safety.\u201d", "The details of the Fawnbrook case, as it became known, were still unclear to Brown, but he was skeptical of what he was reading. For one thing, he knew from his own previous reporting that no Syrians had been resettled in Twin Falls after all. He woke up early on Monday to get a head start on clarifying things as much as possible in order to write a follow-up article. Before he got into the office, a friend texted him, telling him to check the Drudge Report. At the top, a headline screamed: \u201cREPORT: Syrian \u2018Refugees\u2019 Rape Little Girl at Knifepoint in Idaho.\u201d", "As the only city of any size for 100 miles in any direction, Twin Falls serves as a modest hub within southern Idaho\u2019s vast agricultural sprawl. Its population of about 45,000 nearly doubles each day as people travel there to work, primarily in the thriving agribusinesses. But its bucolic rhythms still allow for children to play outside unattended and make driving a meditative experience. Surrounding the city and sprinkled among its tidy tract neighborhoods, potatoes, alfalfa, sugar beets and corn grow in fields. Half a million dairy cows in the area produce three-quarters of the state\u2019s milk supply. Because of its location, Twin Falls is home to major food processors like Chobani Yogurt, Clif Bar and Glanbia Nutritionals, a dairy company. All have large facilities in town and have helped to push down the unemployment rate to just under 3 percent, below the national average. The wealth of easy-to-find low-skilled jobs made Twin Falls attractive as a place for resettling refugees, and they began arriving in the 1980s, at that time mostly from Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia. Nearly 2,500 refugees have moved to the town over the years.", "Most Twin Falls residents are churchgoing, and about half of those are Mormons. Locally owned stores and restaurants are generally closed on Sundays, and the city has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936. Liberals often register as Republicans just to have an opportunity to participate in the electoral process, by voting in the primaries. If a Republican is going to win regardless, the thinking goes, they would at least like to play a role in deciding which one prevails.", "The same qualities that bind the townspeople together can, in turn, be alienating to newcomers. The refugee community has begun to experience this effect as its demographic makeup has changed. Over the past decade and a half, as conflict spread across North Africa and the Middle East, Twin Falls started to resettle larger numbers of refugees with darker skin who follow an unfamiliar religion \u2014 two things that make it difficult to blend into a town that is 80 percent white.", "On a national scale, an ascendant network of anti-Muslim activists and provocateurs has exploited the fears brought on by these changes, finding a platform and a receptive audience online. The narrative they espouse \u2014 on blogs with names like Jihad Watch \u2014 is that America, currently 1 percent Muslim, is in the midst of an Islamic invasion. Central to the worldview of these bloggers, some of whom have celebrity-size social-media followings, is that Muslims have a propensity toward sexual violence. They seize on any news item that bolsters this notion. Perhaps their biggest touchstone is an incident that took place in Cologne, Germany, on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2015. Mobs of men, many of them asylum seekers from the Middle East, pick-pocketed and groped more than a thousand women in and around a train station. The German police acknowledged the incident had taken place only under pressure, as the women\u2019s stories began to leak out through the media. This established, for these activists, the contours of a narrative that they believe has been repeating itself. The Fawnbrook incident quickly drew their interest.", "What happened in Twin Falls was sadly somewhat commonplace but not in the way the activists believed. The local Police Department investigates sex crimes on a weekly basis, and in about half a dozen of those that proceed to court each year, the victims and the accused are both minors. \u201cIf it\u2019s younger kids, it\u2019s them being curious,\u201d J.R. Paredez, the lead investigator on the case, explained to me. Some children who act out sexually have been victimized themselves, he said, while others have been exposed to explicit material at home or at school or, as is more common recently, on their cellphones. \u201cAs they start to get older, there\u2019s more of the actual sexual component to it.\u201d", "Two weeks after the incident, the boys were charged with lewd and lascivious behavior against a minor. (The 14-year-old who lent his cellphone to the boys was initially charged with the same crime. He was not present in the laundry room, and his charge was eventually reduced to make him an accessory.) In Idaho, this statute applies to physical contact \u201cdone with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person, such minor child, or third party.\u201d Paredez said that the cellphone video made clear what specifically had happened between the children, but that he couldn\u2019t show it to the reporters who asked him about it, because doing so would have constituted criminal distribution of child pornography. He called most of the details that he read about the case on the internet \u201c100 percent false, like not even close to being accurate.\u201d (The family of the accused declined to comment.)", "As more time passed without a solid account of what happened inside the laundry room, lurid rumors continued to surface online and came to dominate conversations in grocery stores and at school events. And while the City Council members did not have control over the case, the bloggers who wrote about it placed much of the blame on them.", "On the Monday when Twin Falls was the top story on Drudge, the City Council held another weekly meeting. Normally only a handful of people attend, and Brown is one of the few reporters among them. But that night, the auditorium filled until there was standing room only, and television news crews appeared from Boise and other nearby cities. When it came time for public comments, one man got up and praised the city\u2019s handling of the case, followed by more than a dozen others who laid into the council members. Terry Edwards handed each of them a small copy of the Constitution and told them to do their jobs. A woman named Vicky Davis, her hair in a satiny white bob, stood up and proclaimed that Islam had declared jihad on America.", "\u201cThey are not compatible with our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cThey hate us. They don\u2019t want to be Americans. They don\u2019t want to assimilate. What do you need to see? What more proof do you need?\u201d", "This was a highly unusual meeting, but Brown wasn\u2019t exactly surprised. Several months earlier, when the anti-refugee activists began to organize, he started reading up to try to better understand their views. He picked up a book by Ann Coulter and began to follow the anti-refugee blogs. At the meeting, he felt as if he were hearing all that he had read being repeated aloud by his neighbors.", "Kingsbury, the police chief, read from a statement while fumbling with a thicket of microphones piled onto the lectern by visiting reporters. In between exasperated breaths, he explained why he could not disclose the details of the incident but said that he could address some of the misinformation that was spreading online. There was no evidence of a knife, he said, or of any celebration afterward or of a cover-up, and no Syrians were involved: The boys were from Sudan and Iraq. \u201cI\u2019m a kid who grew up in Idaho,\u201d he said. \u201cLaw enforcement takes these types of allegations very seriously. However, we can\u2019t act on them within an hour. It\u2019s not like a crime show.\u201d He told the audience that the boys had been arrested, to applause.", "But online, Kingsbury\u2019s words only inflamed the activists more. Just after midnight, someone posted his work email address on Jihad Watch, along with those of the council members and the mayor. A commenter on another website called The Muslim Issue posted the phone numbers and email addresses for the town\u2019s government officials, the head of the refugee-resettlement center and some administrators at the college, which runs the refugee resettlement program. From there, the information spread to more blogs and to the comments sections of far-right news outlets with massive audiences.", "By 9 the next morning, messages were pouring into the inbox of the mayor of Twin Falls, Shawn Barigar, nearly every minute. Barigar grew up in a neighboring town and went to work in Boise as a television news anchor before moving back to start a family. His even keel and the air of sophistication he picked up while living in a comparatively big city have made him popular politically. He is left of the town on many social issues, which has made some of his constituents suspicious of him. But most of the people who contacted him that summer were from other states and even other countries. Some people demanded that the city pay for a new car and apartment for the victim and her family. Others said that local officials\u2019 attempts to correct inaccurate details about the incident were veiled efforts to suggest that no crime had occurred at all, in order to protect the refugees. Others accused him of being a \u201cglobalist,\u201d a word that has taken on many definitions but in this case meant he was part of a vast, arcane conspiracy. They believed that establishment politicians wanted to turn red states like Idaho blue by starting wars and then importing refugees from those war zones as cheap labor who would not only displace American workers but also reliably vote Democratic.", "Many of the people who wrote to the mayor had a much simpler goal: to unleash their hatred of Islam. One message, with the subject line \u201cMuslims,\u201d said that refugees were committing rapes and hit-and-runs and urinating on women and that the mayor was guilty of treason. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the bag, [expletive],\u201d it read. \u201cWe will and are holding you responsible for any and all crimes committed by these quote refugees. No courts. No police. Just us. You will answer to us in the darkness of night.\u201d", "The next day, Camille Barigar, the mayor\u2019s wife, arrived in her office at the college, where she ran the performing-arts center, and started listening to her voice mail. In a calm, measured voice, a man who sounded as if he was reading from a script went on for nearly four minutes. \u201cI wonder, Miss Barigar, if your residence was posted online and your whereabouts identified, how you would feel if half a dozen Muslim men raped and sodomized you, Miss Barigar, and when you tried to scream, broke every tooth in your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I wonder how you\u2019d feel if, when you went to the Twin Falls Police Department, they told you to run along, that this is simply cultural diversity.\u201d", "The caller said that life was \u201cbecoming difficult\u201d in the United States, just as it had in England. He referenced Jo Cox, a British member of Parliament who spoke out in support of refugees and later \u201cmet with opposition in the form of a bullet to the head.\u201d", "\u201cShe\u2019s dead now,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve buried her.\u201d", "The Twin Falls story aligned perfectly with the ideology that Stephen Bannon, then the head of Breitbart News, had been developing for years, about the havoc brought on by unchecked immigration and Islamism, all of it backed by big-business interests and establishment politicians. Bannon latched onto the Fawnbrook case and used his influence to expand its reach. During the weeks leading up to his appointment in August 2016 to lead Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign for president, Twin Falls was a daily topic of discussion on Bannon\u2019s national radio show, where he called it \u201cthe beating heart\u201d of all that the coming presidential election was about. He sent his lead investigative reporter, Lee Stranahan, to the town to investigate the case, boasting to his audience that Stranahan was a \u201cpit bull\u201d of a reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let him off the chain,\u201d he said.", "Then 50, Stranahan was relatively new to journalism. He had spent a few decades as a television producer and a graphic illustrator in Los Angeles, and on the side he shot erotic photography, which is how he met his wife. Stranahan\u2019s transition into journalism began during the television writers\u2019 strike of 2007 and 2008. To keep himself entertained, he created parody political advertisements and posted them on YouTube. One of the first was a satirical Rudy Giuliani ad, asking Republican primary voters to support him because he had taken good care of his mistress, offering her private security courtesy of the N.Y.P.D., whereas Mitt Romney \u201cdidn\u2019t even bother\u201d to take on a paramour. Stranahan says that within weeks, the videos led to invitations to appear on CNN and to meet with a vice president at NBC and to a job offer, which he accepted, writing political comedy for The Huffington Post.", "In college, Stranahan was a libertarian and even attended Ayn Rand\u2019s funeral. But when he moved to California, he became a liberal, vehemently opposing the Iraq war and the presidency of George W. Bush. He voted for Barack Obama in 2008. Two years later, Stranahan interviewed Andrew Breitbart, a fellow Huffington Post alumnus, for an article he was writing about Jon Stewart\u2019s Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. They spoke for more than three hours, bonding over their shared love of Depeche Mode. Eventually, Breitbart became Stranahan\u2019s mentor, converted him to conservatism and offered him a job. In 2011, Breitbart took Stranahan to the Conservative Political Action Conference and introduced him to Michele Bachmann, who, in Stranahan\u2019s recollection, convinced him that she had uncovered disturbing details about Islam that no one in the establishment was willing to talk about. Stranahan says this conversation was the genesis of his concerns about the religion.", "Stranahan arrived in Idaho in August, after covering the national party conventions. The sealed nature of the case prevented any journalist from an exhaustive examination, and the accused and the victim\u2019s families refused to speak to the mainstream media. But Stranahan thrived in the void of facts. He was granted one of the few interviews with the victim\u2019s family, but his account of the crime offered little more information than others\u2019 had \u2014 and far more inaccuracies, according to the police and the county prosecutor. He described what took place as a \u201chorrific gang rape\u201d and wrote graphic details about the incident, which the Twin Falls Police say are untrue. On Breitbart radio, Stranahan openly wondered whether Barigar, the mayor, was \u201ca big, you know, Shariah supporter.\u201d And he suggested repeatedly that mass rapes by refugees had occurred in Europe and were inevitably coming to the United States. \u201cIf you want to wait until your country turns into France or Cologne, Germany. If you want to wait, you can wait,\u201d he warned the audience. \u201cBut if you want to watch it and stop it now, you\u2019ve got a chance to do it in November.\u201d", "Stranahan says his Breitbart editors sent him to Twin Falls to report on the \u201cMuslim takeover\u201d of the town. (Breitbart denies this and says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd.\u201d) But he soon became enamored of a grander theory about what was happening in southern Idaho: globalism. He wrote that local businesses received government kickbacks for employing foreigners instead of Americans. (Stranahan did not cite any evidence of this, and it is untrue, according to the state Department of Labor.) And he often referred to a Syrian refugee crisis, though no Syrians were ever resettled there. Then, to bring the story full circle, he claimed these Muslim refugees were being used to replace American workers and that the government, big business and law enforcement were either conspiring to conceal the sexual-assault case or intentionally looking the other way, in order to keep the machine turning.", "\u201cBottom line, this is bad for business,\u201d he told me in an interview last winter, explaining his interpretation of the city officials\u2019 rationale: \u201c\u2009\u2018I\u2019m not really going to look into this too deeply because if I find out the truth, if I discover what actually happened, if I figure out the truth, it\u2019s not really good for business.\u2019\u2009\u201d Stranahan believed that Chobani, a Greek-yogurt company, was at the center of the scheme. Breitbart had been covering the company for months, ever since the owner, Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish-born businessman, made a speech at the World Economic Forum at Davos encouraging other chief executives to pledge financial and political support to refugees.", "While he was in town, Stranahan embedded with critics of the refugee program. They drove him to some of his interviews and to the yogurt factory to shoot drone footage. Stranahan doesn\u2019t get around well on his own in part because he has been mostly blind in one eye since grade school, when a neighborhood kid threw a rock at him, shattering his right optic nerve. Rather than a round pupil, his is jagged-edged, and so large that it nearly covers his iris. He shuffles when he walks because of neuropathic foot pain from diabetes, which he regulates by eating a ketogenic diet, usually one meal a day, consisting entirely of protein and fat. In Twin Falls, he subsisted most days on blackened chicken from Popeyes.", "During the three months he was in Twin Falls, City Council members refused his interview requests, leaving him stuck inside an echo chamber with the activists, which he amplified online. When I was in Twin Falls, I found myself empathizing: These same activists refused to speak with me. One of the most outspoken among them is a woman named Julie DeWolfe, who lives atop a grassy hill 20 minutes outside town and who spent significant time with Stranahan. When I went there to ask for an interview, she came outside with several barking dogs and told me to leave. \u201cThe company you work for is not trustworthy,\u201d she said.", "As the summer came to a close, The Times-News was bombarded with threatening phone calls and email from all over. After it received a threat that was deemed credible enough to engage the F.B.I., the editor of the paper told Brown and the other reporters to conduct their interviews outside the office and ordered the entire staff to walk in pairs when going out to their cars. For months, the reporters covered protests around town, which were widely hyped on social media but, for the most part, sparsely attended. At least once the Police Department deployed plainclothes officers into the crowds, with instructions to look after the journalists. Later, it turned out that fake Facebook accounts linked to the Russian government helped to spread stories about Twin Falls and even organized one of the rallies there. The event was also poorly attended but is the first known Russian attempt to spark a demonstration on American soil.", "The phone and email attacks continued through the fall and spiked each time a new conspiracy theory was posted online. One council member told me that she gained 15 pounds from the stress. At night, Shawn Barigar would lie down with his iPad and spend hours reading stories that called him a crook, a liar or an ISIS sympathizer. He had to shut down his Twitter account after someone accused him of having been convicted of sexual assault. Before he could debunk the myth, the post had spread, leaving untold numbers of constituents under the impression that he was a rapist. He stopped sleeping and struggled to focus at work or to be present with his family. He and his wife say they bickered all summer.", "\u201cIt was like being in a hole,\u201d he told me, his eyes welling up with tears. \u201cIt was all-consuming.\u201d", "Stranahan now works out of a trendy shared workspace in Washington, across the street from the White House. He quit his job at Breitbart, which he said was being mismanaged in Bannon\u2019s absence, to host a drive-time FM radio show with Sputnik, a state-run Russian news outlet. He told me that he jumped at the chance to transition to a Kremlin-funded outfit and, knowing that it would be controversial, spoke to every media outlet that inquired about it, in order to draw even more people to his work.", "He expressed no contrition about the reporting he did in Twin Falls, though many of the conclusions that he drew on the radio and online have been debunked. Still, many of the outlets that covered Twin Falls made only minor tweaks to their stories or did nothing at all. Many of the falsehoods that were written about the Fawnbrook case still appear at the top of a Google search of the city.", "The most transparent course-correction resulted from a lawsuit against Alex Jones, the publisher of InfoWars, for its misleading stories about Chobani. After initially vowing to fight the yogurt company in court, Jones retracted several stories and issued an apology in order to make a lawsuit go away. Stranahan said that his editors forced him off the Twin Falls story during the fall and suggested that they had done so under threat from Chobani. (Breitbart denies this.)", "Stranahan and I spoke a handful of times over the course of the last year, each time for several hours. Talking with him feels like being inside one of his conspiracy theories. When you ask him a question, he begins to answer and then immediately swerves in a different direction, bouncing like a pinball between topics that barely connect to one another \u2014 from the Fawnbrook case to clitorectomies and stoning, then Syrian refugees, then a prominent Wahhabi cleric \u2014 and seems to increase in velocity as he ricochets off them. It\u2019s an exhausting exercise, but also a fascinating one. He seems perpetually on the precipice of pulling the argument together, sparking just enough curiosity that you let him keep going. Stranahan uses this talent most effectively in his work, painting himself as a champion of people who are understandably uninformed about other cultures and religions based on their own experiences. \u201cIt\u2019s just easy to brand these people as a bunch of Islamophobic, racist yokels,\u201d he told me, with a hint of disgust in his voice. \u201cI just don\u2019t like it.\u201d", "Stranahan struck me as passionate about his stories; not about their veracity but about the freedom he and the critics of refugee resettlement should have to speculate as they wanted without being belittled by the fact-mongering mainstream. When I reached him by phone this June, he told me he was planning to travel back to Idaho for more reporting on Fawnbrook, now that he was no longer constrained by his editors at Breitbart. He told me that he believed that he had uncovered another dimension of his globalist theory related to Chobani\u2019s participation in the federal school-lunch program. He felt compelled to follow up on the earlier coverage, because he was frustrated that Alex Jones and others were forced to retract their stories and apologize under pressure. \u201cI don\u2019t like people getting shut up like that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if their stories have problems, I don\u2019t like journalists getting shut down.\u201d", "I started to ask why anyone should be allowed to publish false information for the express purpose of angering their audience and pushing them further away from those with whom they disagree, but Stranahan cut me off. \u201cHey, I\u2019m walking into the White House right now,\u201d he said. He had just arrived for a press briefing with the president\u2019s spokesman. \u201cLet me call you back.\u201d", "This April, the boys accused in the Fawnbrook case admitted guilt \u2014 the juvenile court equivalent to pleading guilty \u2014 and were sentenced in June. The judge prohibited city officials from commenting on the outcome of the trial, but juvenile-justice experts told me that the boys would most likely be placed on probation and required to attend mandatory therapy to correct their behavior. Even in Idaho, a state with tough sentencing requirements, the law bars anyone under 10 from being jailed and only allows it in extreme cases for anyone under 12.", "Late one Monday night in June I received a phone call from Dalos, the Scanner Man. He asked if I had heard about the \u201cfireworks flying around Twin Falls.\u201d The news of the boys\u2019 fate had somehow reached the public. \u201cThe suspects didn\u2019t go to jail or nothing,\u201d he said, adding that people in town were \u201cirate.\u201d Facebook posts about the story were again flooding his feed. \u201cThey\u2019re blaming it on Muslim law,\u201d he said. One of the articles circulating, from a site called Bare Naked Islam, included a photograph of the judge in the case with a large red arrow pointing toward his head, next to the caption \u201cCorrupt Judge.\u201d Another article published the judge\u2019s home address and phone number, inciting another flood of harassment, a year after the initial onslaught.", "Shawn and Camille Barigar\u2019s bickering has subsided, but they have discovered that they disagree over whether Islamic teachings conflict with American social norms. \u201cI can\u2019t take the leap,\u201d Shawn told me, \u201cthat because you are Muslim therefore you are reading the Quran verbatim, and you\u2019re going to go out and do genital mutilation.\u201d Camille said she supported the local resettlement program but thought that her husband\u2019s unwillingness to even consider cultural differences or acknowledge any nuance was na\u00efve. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to be afraid to talk about it entirely or, like, sound racist.\u201d It is precisely this discomfort that provides an opening for people like Stranahan to dominate the conversation.", "Part of the reason a fear of Islam has persisted in Twin Falls is because the local leadership refused to defuse it, according to Matt Christensen, 36, the editor of The Times-News. While Brown wrote articles that sorted out the truth about the Fawnbrook case, Christensen was publishing commentary that castigated the people who were spreading falsehoods. He told me that he had closed-door meetings with city officials, in which he asked them to write guest editorials doing the same, but none of them did. Christensen suspected that they were afraid of one of the most reliable political dangers in the region, the same force that leads would-be Democrats there to register as Republicans: being outflanked on the right is the quickest way to lose your job.", "\u201cBehind closed doors, they would all tell you they were pro-refugee, and we wanted them to step forward and make that declaration in a public arena, and it just never really happened,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was frustrating to us especially at the beginning because it really felt like the newspaper was out there all alone.\u201d He continued: \u201cThere were days where we felt like, Godammit, what are we doing here? We write a story and it\u2019s going to reach 50,000 people. Breitbart writes a story and it\u2019s going to reach 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 million people. What kind of a voice do we have in this debate?\u201d", "The refugee resettlement center received a dramatic increase in donations from local residents during the last year. But those in the town who support the program have often been drowned out by the relatively smaller, but louder, group of activists who oppose it. Brown said he expected to see an anti-Shariah bill introduced in the State Legislature when the next session starts in 2018. Bills like this, which try to bar Islamic law from being used in American courts, have been introduced in the past two years in Boise but never passed. He speculated that the momentum of the past year could force a different outcome. \u201cThere are a lot of people who feel like society is changing too quickly, like the community is changing too quickly,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd who view other people not like them or who don\u2019t speak their language as a threat or a sign that their culture is going to be weakened. And they want to do what they can to stop that.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/technology/personaltech/deleted-tweets.html": ["Q.

In exchange, Seesaw offers teachers a subscription to its $120 premium service, product previews and a company badge to post on their profiles.", "Joel R.

He described the company-teacher relationships as mutually beneficial for schools and industry. After Ms. Delzer developed a relationship with Seesaw, he noted, the company gave every Mapleton teacher a premium subscription and training sessions.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a real advantage when she comes back and she shares with us what she sees happening at the forefront of education,\u201d Mr. Jacobson said. \u201cPlus, it is good recognition for Mapleton Elementary School. We do a lot of things you wouldn\u2019t expect in a school of our size.\u201d", "Mr. Sjogreen, the Seesaw co-founder, said that his company\u2019s ambassador program did not pay teachers and that its premium software was not valuable enough to be a draw for them.", "\u201cThere is nothing that we are doing really to incentivize teachers to become ambassadors,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that they give us great feedback and help us spread the word, we are happy to support them to become more knowledgeable.\u201d", "Ms. Delzer has also served as an Amazon Education \u201cTeacher Innovator\u201d; a \u201cDigital Image Champion\u201d for GoEnnounce, the student portfolio platform; a brand ambassador for GoNoodle, a classroom activity app; and a \u201cLead Digital Innovator\u201d for PBS LearningMedia, the education arm of the nonprofit broadcasting company.", "One evening last spring, Mr. Provenzano, the English teacher and tech company ambassador, came home from school and went downstairs to his basement.", "He had just finished teaching \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d in his English classes at Grosse Pointe South, a public high school in a Detroit suburb. And he had given his students an unusual choice of assignments: They could make traditional class presentations, or use computer-assisted design software to draft objects illustrating themes from the novel.", "At a time when many teachers feel constrained by curriculum requirements, Mr. Provenzano said digital tools provided a creative outlet. The design software assignment also took advantage of his side business, called The Nerdy Teacher. Mr. Provenzano consults for education technology companies, and his basement is chock-full of the electronics they send him to try.", "Now, he used a $1,299 3-D printer sent to him by Dremel, a tool brand for which he is an ambassador, to turn his students\u2019 designs into three-dimensional objects. He printed one student\u2019s design, a gavel, representing the struggle for justice in the novel.", "Later he posted a photo of the gavel on Twitter, mentioning the brand: \u201cStudent designed and @DremelEdu 3D40 printed gavel for a To Kill a Mockingbird presentation.\u201d", "Mr. Provenzano also blogs and gives conference presentations to teachers, sharing interesting ways that he uses the 3-D printers. \u201cI feel comfortable saying teachers have bought Dremel because of me,\u201d he said.", "This teacher-influencer soft sell may be new in schools. But researchers who study medical marketing recognize it from techniques used for years by the pharmaceutical industry.", "Drug makers have long cultivated doctors to promote brand-name medicines to their peers. Insiders have a nickname for these doctors: \u201cKey Opinion Leaders.\u201d Among other things, drug makers have paid physician influencers to give talks about company drugs, sent them on junkets and lavished them with fancy dinners.", "If the ed-tech industry is now replicating these strategies, it is because, at least in medicine, they work.", "\u201cThese techniques encourage the use of the product being promoted rather than evidence-based practices,\u201d said Dr. Aaron S. Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who has studied how drug company payments influence doctors. \u201cThere is evidence that even a small amount of money, like a meal, can influence prescribing.\u201d", "Some academic medical centers now prohibit their doctors from giving industry-sponsored speeches. And some drug companies have stopped giving doctors swag.", "But there has been little public discussion about the ramifications of similar tech industry cultivation of teachers.", "Mr. Provenzano said he did not see a conflict of interest between his teaching and industry affiliations, noting that his blog prominently listed his company affiliations. He added that school districts often hired him to train their teachers precisely because his industry relationships had helped him become an expert.", "He left his public-school teaching job over the summer and started a position as director of maker spaces at a nearby private school. \u201cThese ambassadorships helped me get this job,\u201d Mr. Provenzano said.", "Some ambassador programs involve formal contracts that may take advantage of well-meaning teachers, legal experts said. For instance, a document online reviewed by The New York Times titled \u201cDremel Idea Builder Ambassador Agreement\u201d contains a number of stipulations for teachers.", "Among other things, the document said the company would provide a 3-D printer in exchange for a teacher\u2019s developing at least one four-minute video tutorial every other month featuring a classroom project using the device. It required the teacher to give Dremel-related presentations at two or more conferences. The document, as written, also included a noncompete clause prohibiting teachers from working with other 3-D printing companies.", "And Professor Reidenberg of Fordham Law pointed out that the document reviewed by The Times would give Dremel the right to settle any legal claims arising from the teacher\u2019s work, while making the teacher liable for legal costs. \u201cThis clause could bankrupt the teacher,\u201d Professor Reidenberg said.", "Linda Beckmeyer, a spokeswoman for Bosch, the maker of Dremel, said its contract with teachers was confidential and declined to discuss its terms.", "\u201cThe purpose of the ambassador program is to advance the maker movement in education by giving teachers and students access to 3-D printing,\u201d she said.", "Earlier this year, after school, Ms. Delzer drove to Kittsona, a trendy midpriced clothing boutique in Fargo. She already had a host of speaking engagements on her calendar, and she wanted new outfits to wear to them.", "The Kittsona staff greeted her like a V.I.P.", "Last year, the store\u2019s owners agreed to outfit Ms. Delzer free of charge after she asked them to sponsor her in exchange for her tagging Kittsona on social media. Now, a stylist rushed about, picking out cute sleeveless dresses, embroidered tunics, layered necklaces and suede bootees for the teacher to try on.", "Kittsona ran several promotions this year in which Ms. Delzer offered her Instagram followers a store discount. Each one directly resulted in 50 to 100 sales, said Nicole Johnson, Kittsona\u2019s co-owner.", "It was an indication, she said, that young working women were responding to Ms. Delzer\u2019s ambitious-but-approachable schoolteacher brand. \u201cWe are not all Kim Kardashians,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.", "An hour or so later, Ms. Delzer left the boutique laden with shopping bags. But her working day was hardly done.", "After dinner, Ms. Delzer installed herself at her kitchen counter. Dozens of emails from companies, conferences, publishers and teacher fans on social media needed responses.", "Ms. Delzer recalled how, when she was starting out a few years ago, some veteran teacher influencers snubbed her. Tonight, she would try to respond to as many requests as possible. \u201cI just drink a lot of coffee,\u201d she said.", "If her Top Dog Teaching fans nationwide love her, so do her third graders. One reason is that she often treats them like budding adults.", "Every fall, for instance, Ms. Delzer holds a social media boot camp to teach her students how to run the class Instagram and Twitter accounts. She teaches them rules like \u201cnever share your password\u201d and helps them understand how to maintain an upbeat online image.", "After all, the class accounts, called TopDogKids, are essentially an offshoot of her own.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to post something bad,\u201d McCoy, the third grader, said, \u201cbecause if you want a job, those people are probably going to look at your social media page and they are going to decide if they\u2019ll let you have the job.\u201d", "Lest they forget, a sign on the classroom wall reminded students and teacher alike: \u201cI am building my digital footprint every day.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/22/smarter-living/any-questions-career.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/briefing/north-korea-puerto-rico-nfl.html": ["Here are the week\u2019s top stories, and a look ahead.", "1.

They also provided Google and other companies with a way of mapping urban roadways in three dimensions, so that cars will know exactly where they are at any given moment \u2014 something GPS cannot always provide.", "But these lidar sensors have additional shortcomings. They can gather information only about objects that are relatively close to them, which limits how fast the cars can travel. Their measurements aren\u2019t always detailed enough to distinguish one object from another. And when multiple driverless cars are close together, their signals can become garbled.", "Other devices can pick up some of slack. Cameras are a better way of identifying pedestrians and street signs, for example, and radar works over longer distances. That\u2019s why today\u2019s self-driving cars track their surroundings through so many different sensors. But despite this wide array of hardware \u2014 which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle \u2014 even the best autonomous vehicles still have trouble in so many situations that humans can navigate with ease.", "With their new sensor, Messrs. Salehian and Rezk are working to change that.

They left Apple late last year.", "Where current lidar sensors send out individual pulses, Aeva\u2019s device sends out a continuous wave of light. By reading the way this far more complex signal bounces off surrounding objects, Mr. Rezk said, the device can capture a far more detailed image while also tracking velocity. You can think of it as a cross between lidar, which is so good at measuring depth, and radar, which is so good at measuring speed.", "Mr. Rezk also said the device\u2019s continuous wave would provide greater range and resolution than existing lidar devices, deal better with weather and highly reflective objects like bridge railings, and avoid interference with other optical sensors.", "Cars will continue to use multiple kinds of sensors, in part because redundancy helps ensure that these cars are safe. But Aeva aims to give these cars a better view of the world from a smaller and less expensive set of sensors.", "Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have built similar hardware, and companies like Velodyne and the start-ups Oryx Vision and Quanergy say they are exploring similar ideas. Like these efforts, the Aeva prototype is still under development, and the company plans to sell devices next year. But it shows how autonomous car sensors need to evolve \u2014 and that they are indeed evolving.", "Ultimately, new sensors will allow cars to make better decisions. \u201cWith autonomous cars, 90 percent of the time, you are trying to infer what is happening,\u201d Mr. Ziyaee said. \u201cBut what if you can just measure it?\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/arts/television/fall-television-calendar.html": ["More listings for the new season: Art | Classical | Dance | Film | Pop | Theater", "Two words you\u2019ll see a lot of in this fall\u2019s television season, sometimes in tandem: Marvel and Netflix.", "Four new series based on Marvel Comics franchises are scheduled to appear before the end of the year (including \u201cThe Punisher\u201d on Netflix, not listed here because it doesn\u2019t have a premiere date yet).

How? With \u201cflow.\u201d", "But what is flow?", "First popularized decades ago by the Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow is an elusive state cultivated by artists, athletes and others, that of being so absorbed in what they\u2019re doing that they lose track of time and thought, finding themselves guided rather by instinct and intuition. It has also been referred to as the Zone \u2014 not to be confused with the diet of the same name \u2014 or just \u201cbeing in the moment.\u201d And for those who have experienced it, there is no denying its magic.", "Dr. Csikszentmihalyi, who turns 83 this month, is a deeply philosophical academic formerly of the University of Chicago (now at Claremont Graduate University) and still publishing. In 2004 he gave a Ted Talk that has been viewed over four million times.", "Mr. Wheal has taken a somewhat brisker, more commercial approach. He has advised members of the United States Navy Special Operations, top-ranked athletes and executives of technology companies on \u201coptimizing performance\u201d through flow, receiving six-figure fees for some of his consultations.", "His five-day retreat, at a sprawling, privately held property known as Summit and convened the day before the solar eclipse, cost almost $5,000 and was a sort of beta test for spreading his gospel to a larger public audience. (He also offers free assessments and videos on his website.)", "Attendees were housed in white tepee-like tents, with portable toilets set up down a dirt path. The camp had been erected quickly by the \u201cglamping\u201d company Aether Camp, to Mr. Wheal\u2019s specifications.", "Mr. Wheal, who said his father was a test pilot for the British royal navy, came to the United States from England at age 8 and speaks rapidly in a mash-up accent, dropping idiosyncratic phrases and erudite references to the Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky, to Cincinnatus and Aldous Huxley. At moments he is given to phrases that are not immediately comprehensible, like \u201cWe are broaching the possibility of midwifing humanity into the infinite game.\u201d", "But his larger message came through clearly. In our digital age, loud with bottom-feeder commentary, the ping of incoming emails and bleating social media, the pursuit of flow is all the more urgent.", "\u201cHonestly, have we abdicated our purpose just because of these insistent micro asks?\u201d Mr. Wheal said. \u201cHave we just completely ceded our center, completely ceded clarity, and it was all just based on 20-something bro-grammers trying to crack our attention spans?\u201d", "To fulfill his flow-finding mission, Mr. Wheal wants to bring what he calls his Dojo Domes to locations around the world. Next year, he and his partners hope to build a one-million-square-foot complex in Vancouver, British Columbia, with a medical emphasis, combining brain-imaging technology with simpler equipment.", "Mr. Wheal began to envision gatherings of this sort in 2007, while he was teaching at Esalen, the spiritual retreat in California. With Steven Kotler, a journalist, he founded the Flow Genome Project, based in Austin, Tex., and dedicated to gathering the latest science behind flow states. Its board of advisers includes neuroscientists, filmmakers and a kiteboarder.", "It was his book, \u201cStealing Fire,\u201d written with Mr. Kotler and published earlier this year, that attracted many of the flow campers to Utah. In it, Mr. Wheal and Mr. Kotler consider the question of peak human performance, describing how so many powerful companies and individuals are now trying to optimize their own brains, in ways both legal and illegal.", "They offer case studies from the Navy SEALs and Google, arguing that what the world today faces \u201cwicked problems,\u201d unprecedented and complex, that require creative solutions, the kinds that are most likely to come not from staid meetings in conference rooms but rather from \u201cnon-ordinary states.\u201d", "\u201cFlow,\u201d they write, is associated with six neurotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, norepinephrine, anandamide and endorphins. Knowing the neurochemical profile of flow means, in theory, people can devise ways of achieving it more often, more reliably and more quickly.", "The new generation of flowsters are excited, perhaps, that using the advances of neuroscience, they might not have to meditate every day for 10 years to gain access to these layers of their brains.", "\u201cThis was a significant investment of time and money for me \u2014 this tells you how compelled I was to come here,\u201d said Alexandre Lang-Willar. At 28, Mr. Lang-Willar is in some ways the embodiment of Mr. Wheal\u2019s target demographic: the high achiever who grasps the brass ring, only to discover he craves something more. Mr. Lang-Willar quit his job as a Goldman Sachs analyst and has created a dating app with his father called \u201cInvite and Meet,\u201d centered on live activities, that will be introduced later this year.", "Reading \u201cStealing Fire,\u201d Mr. Lang-Willar said, he became convinced that nothing less than a \u201ccultural awakening\u201d was underway.", "By 8 a.m. each morning, the flow campers lay prone and shoeless in the Dojo Dome, moving back and forth on brightly colored foam rollers. Other daily activities included balancing and bouncing on big yellow balls; acro-yoga, in which partners learn to lift each other in the air; and strapping into special contraptions, like Mr. Wheal\u2019s 360 Swing, which allows those courageous enough to propel themselves, standing up, all the way around the swing\u2019s axle in a complete loop.", "All of these undertakings were in the service of honing a crucial element in flow, what Mr. Wheal refers to as \u201cembodied cognition\u201d: integrating our whole minds and bodies through specific exercise, based on the science showing that physical movement directly affects how we think and feel.", "\u201cThey are tapping into spiritual intelligence that before now was only really talked about in a religious context,\u201d Kristen Ulmer said, sitting outside the Dojo Dome one morning. Ms. Ulmer, formerly the top ranked extreme skier in the world, has also written a book, \u201cThe Art of Fear.\u201d", "She went on: \u201cA lot more people are saying they\u2019re spiritual but not religious \u2014 but what does that really mean? I would say sports and movement are the most oft way we access a spiritual experience and transcend our ego, but they\u2019re the least discussed and least understood.\u201d", "On the third night of camp, attendees gathered in the Dojo Dome for a night of heavy breathing. On their backs, as the lights changed colors and music pulsed from the speakers, they practiced a technique developed by the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, involving intense hyperventilation for 15 minutes. People were transported into altered states, gyrating their pelvises, bursting into peals of unrestrained, almost feral laughter, even leaping to their feet to dance.", "The group had succeeded, Mr. Wheal announced afterward, in \u201cdefragging our nervous systems.\u201d", "In addition to exercise, lectures and breathing, there were some fairly X-rated activities on the program. One evening after dinner, Mr. Wheal spoke about a set of sexual practices that he has found particularly effective for transporting oneself well outside of humdrum daily rhythms. (They are further detailed in a chapter of \u201cStealing Fire\u201d called \u201cTaking the Kink out of Kinky.\u201d)", "All of these are what Mr. Wheal calls, apologetically, \u201chacks\u201d: techniques for busting out of the overwhelmed modern condition into a place of creativity, passion, focus, tranquillity, vitality and self-refinement.", "\u201cThe genius of what we\u2019re doing here is we\u2019re combining ideas about how to get into flow with actually doing physical things to experience it,\u201d said Kora Kinard, 29, an orgasmic meditation practitioner from San Francisco who attended. \u201cThe flow state and the orgasm state are very connected.\u201d", "Indeed, Mr. Wheal, having wearied somewhat of the term \u201cflow,\u201d prefers \u201cecstasis,\u201d an ancient Greek term for \u201cstepping beyond oneself.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s a giant irony of my life that everyone wants to come and talk to me about flow and I have no interest in having that conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be hemmed in.\u201d", "The neuro-chemicals that define flow or ecstasis are powerfully alluring, and Mr. Wheal warned they are not always used for good. He argues, for instance, that Donald J. Trump instinctively knew how to manipulate them in gathering support for his presidency.", "\u201cTrump hacked ecstasis,\u201d Mr. Wheal said. \u201cLight, sound, movement, repetition, scapegoating the other. People said if you haven\u2019t been to his rallies, you\u2019re missing what\u2019s actually happening in this movement. And what does Hillary say? \u2018I\u2019ve got a policy binder.\u2019 While Trump pulled all the strings.\u201d", "Politics aside, Mr. Wheal suggests that we seek daily not a fleeting non-ordinary hour or two, but rather, a permanently altered mind-set. A trait, not a state, a means of incorporating these methods into our lives so that flow, or ecstasis, is threaded through all our months and years.", "Flow camp ended with a shoeless closing ceremony, with participants sitting cross-legged in a circle passing a tiny sculpture of Tara, the female Bodhisattva, from person to person and sharing memories of their experiences that week. The room was thick with emotion and warmth.", "But the last thing Mr. Wheal wants to produce, he said, are more \u201cbliss junkies and epiphany whores,\u201d for whom he reserves a particular antipathy. It\u2019s not enough, in other words, to eat magic mushrooms, experience oneness with nature and humanity, cuddle a Buddha statue and then go right back to how things were.", "Or, for that matter, to parachute into Burning Man \u2014 where many of the flow campers were heading next \u2014 melt down your ego on the playa, and then fail to integrate the experience into the rest of your life.", "\u201cEveryone lines up for the peak experience,\u201d Mr. Wheal said. \u201cBut no one does their push-ups on Monday morning.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/podcasts/the-daily/listen-to-the-daily-the-sheriff-bind.html": ["Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher", "If they hold an undocumented criminal too long, they\u2019re violating the constitution.

My wife, Paola, laughed at me, knowing all too well that rolling towels against windows as the water breached our refuge was like grabbing Band-Aids to care for a gushing bullet wound. Within an hour, there was a foot of contaminated water across the first floor of our house, making it smell like a swamp.", "Now, two weeks later, we are safe, eating well and enjoying the company of close friends who have taken us in. The two of us and our 12-year-old daughter, Emilie, are among the lucky ones, as many continue searching for a decent meal and a place to sleep in peace. Our house is drying, the walls peeled back to their wooden skeleton and the hardwood floors ripped up and strewed across our dying lawn. We are about to move into a short-term apartment. Recovery is in sight, even if I need a pair of binoculars to see it.", "The damage to our home is considerable, and will be expensive to fix. New windows, appliances, curtains \u2014 it will all add up. Multiply our losses thousands of times, and you can begin to understand the blow to the Houston area, the country\u2019s fourth-largest metropolis. Lost home values, lost tax receipts, damaged schools, countless stores shut for repairs, half-empty restaurants, looting. And now Floridians have taken flight in the face of another monster storm, wondering if a similar fate awaits them.", "Houston has declared that it is open for business, but road travel can last hours longer than usual, complicated by closed roads and displaced commuters. Some refineries remain shut or are running at reduced capacity, and gasoline prices have soared. On the other side of the ledger, the money I am going to spend, multiplied by thousands, will be a stimulus package for the regional and national economy.", "Of course, my story is a grain of sand compared with the constellation of wrecked neighborhoods, broken hearts and even deaths. But perhaps my family\u2019s relative comfort has given me time to think about what this all means, beyond the economics. I hope that I come out of this experience stronger as an individual, and that together we come out stronger as a family. I am fairly confident that will happen, although I could be na\u00efve.", "Apart from financial losses, the storm has brought something else: It has exposed the skeletons of our lives, just as surely as the wooden bones of our stripped walls. It has exposed us to the limitations of our patience, not to mention our insurance, along with our dependency on a contractor and his workers, and the challenging task of juggling our jobs and family needs.", "It is probably hardest on Emilie, who awaits the opening of school on Monday after a two-week delay. With no room of her own, and mostly separated from her friends, she is bored and moody. Paola, ordinarily sociable, is turning down dinner invitations. The two of them share a bed with our cockapoo, Sweetie, while I sleep on the living-room couch, waking up frantic each day about the tasks that await.", "Decisions come fast and furiously; they have since the first days. As the waters devoured our house\u2019s first floor, Paola and I had to choose what to save and what to discard. We rolled up our Persian rug and took it upstairs, along with books, CDs and two light tables. Our couches were too heavy to save, but I managed to haul a leather chair onto a couch and saved it from the waters. Paola insisted we should pull up the curtains or take them down. I said let them go. That was a mistake.", "Once the floodwaters receded, which happened with amazing speed, we went into action to find someone to rip out the walls and floors. It was almost like a race among our neighbors to get the stuff out, to avoid mold, even while we all commiserated, compared notes, shared stories and drinks. I asked a trusted local real estate agent to recommend a contractor, whom we hired on the spot, since there seemed no time to lose. Was he the best? Maybe. I had to go with my gut.", "Then came calls to the insurance companies. The auto insurer provided a quick, fair payment for my wife\u2019s car (mine was a company car), but our homeowner\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t take care of flood damage to the house. Fortunately we have flood insurance, but it doesn\u2019t cover lodging while the house is repaired, however long that might be. One neighbor said he expected to be out eight months.", "That leaves FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I registered for assistance, and was quickly offered several weeks in a hotel room \u2014 but told that the room would probably be on the outskirts of Houston or beyond, so my daughter and my wife would probably have to spend hours getting to school and work. We decided to seek temporary housing on our own and see if FEMA would defray some of the costs.", "I spend part of each day at our waterlogged house, where I have been able to resume working from an upstairs office as well as organize the rebuilding effort. I worried about the adjusters\u2019 visit, having heard that adjusters can be stingy. Scavengers are picking through everything, with trucks to haul it away.", "But when the adjusters \u2014 a married couple from Mobile, Ala. \u2014 arrived to inspect our house and belongings, they could not help being impressed by the piles of debris on nearly every lawn on our block. They seemed sympathetic, but we will need to see their paperwork before we know what we can spend on repairs.", "The bad news was what they said would not be covered \u2014 our garage, for instance, because, the adjusters said, it includes a home office above. (They later changed their minds.) The gate to our driveway may or may not be covered because it is only partly attached to the house.", "I am not particularly religious, but on the first Friday night after the flooding I went to my synagogue to find some solace. Congregants embraced, and I went over to hug a woman I know casually because she was crying. I asked if she had lost her house; no, her mother had just died days before. It dawned on me that hers was a real loss, compared with the material things.", "Rabbi David Lyon, in his own eloquent way, beseeched those in need to reach out for help and for everyone to assist one another. \u201cHate is not the opposite of love,\u201d he said, citing the Holocaust survivor and writer Elie Wiesel. \u201cIndifference is the opposite of love.\u201d", "I also went to church, two days later. I was not hedging my bets with God; I was covering the fire at the Arkema chemical plant in Crosby, Tex., and I have found that a church is a good place to meet local residents and get information. The music was uplifting, and I could see people\u2019s anxieties melt with prayer. I smiled when the wife of a firefighter pleaded with the congregation, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the media; listen to Jesus.\u201d I couldn\u2019t understand why people couldn\u2019t do both.", "The pastor, Keenan Smith, like my rabbi, appealed for mutual aid. \u201cIt\u2019s times like this, God, that people really see you,\u201d he said. Being an essentially secular person, I probably took that slightly differently from the way he intended. In all the turmoil, what is really important comes into sharp relief: True feelings are shown; the agonies and the brightness of life are displayed.", "Perhaps my neighbor Todd Lewis put it best. \u201cThere is a realignment of priorities,\u201d he said.", "Todd and his wife, Amanda, suffered little damage aside from the foot of water that flooded their garage. With a little time on his hands, Todd went door to door in our town and an adjoining neighborhood offering to rip out people\u2019s drywall, while Amanda did people\u2019s laundry and served neighbors dinner. When I told her that I was moved by their generosity, she responded, \u201cWe did nothing.\u201d", "I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of emails, phone calls and Twitter messages from relatives and friends asking how we are doing. It is almost embarrassing, but it sure feels good. I even heard from our house\u2019s former owner, who wrote an emotional note to say he was sorry that the home he once loved had been damaged.", "Neighbors have invited me into their homes, and shared details of their childhoods and other things I would never have known if not for the flood, conversations that have drawn us closer. Strangers have knocked on our door to ask if we need help, or food, or even an embrace. An elderly woman came by to hand me an envelope from our synagogue. There was an assistance check inside, and gift cards to replace towels and other household goods. \u201cI may be back,\u201d she said, smiling.", "The search for housing, meanwhile, became a priority. I stopped at various buildings to see if anything was available. Most places wanted me to sign leases for six or seven months. Paola scanned Google for apartments near Texas Medical Center, realizing that doctors and patients regularly come and go. Smart move. We found a furnished two-bedroom apartment, and the management agreed to find a desk for Emilie to do her homework.", "I know that a company-leased car is on the way for me. But we still needed to find a new one for Paola. We decided to lease, and keep more of the insurance money from her destroyed car. Right now I am still on a list to rent a car even temporarily, and dependent on a rickety old Volvo station wagon with a less-than-perfect muffler lent by a good friend. If it breaks down, we are in trouble.", "I need cataract surgery, since the cataract in my right eye is worsening after my retina detachment surgery a few months ago. (Yes, it\u2019s been a bad year!) Do I go with the expensive surgery that is not completely covered by insurance, or do I do it on the cheap? Time to plan for Emilie\u2019s bat mitzvah. Move ahead, or do something modest? Our finances are up in the air.", "And beyond those decisions is the uncertainty about how long it will take to get our house together, and replace things it took years to collect.", "As a reporter who has worked in Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa and made four trips above the Arctic Circle, I have had ample opportunities to meet people from all walks of life. The storm has given me another chance, perhaps the most intimate.", "The other day we got a call that a tow company was coming for one of our cars. We assumed it was the Subaru parked in the driveway, which was blocking my company Malibu in the garage. But when Jon of Jon\u2019s Wrecker Service came by, he had been contracted to pick up the wrong car. He thought he might be able to move the Subaru and get the Malibu out, and managed to start both cars. When the Malibu started, water began to gush out of the exhaust pipe. He couldn\u2019t move the Subaru because of the electronic parking brake, which was immobilized by the flood damage.", "Not only was his trip a waste of time, but now I also had a spill of water in the garage, with furniture in renewed danger of damage. Even though Jon had many more cars to pick up, he stayed to help me clean up, and he tried to work with me to get the damaged garage door working again. We began talking about our families, and how we had been affected by the storm. He is of Mexican descent, and his wife is from El Salvador. One of his children goes to a local school, and is missing classes. He told me about his career, beginning as an aviation mechanic, how his family loved to go to El Salvador every summer to swim at the beach.", "\u201cI\u2019m getting a lot of work,\u201d he said, but without a glimmer of glee. He was clearly tired. He said he wanted his children to go to college, something he now wishes he had done. When we parted, we said we hoped to see each other again.", "One neighbor asked me if becoming a victim had made me a more empathetic interviewer. I have to think about that. But I do know that many people are in far more dire need than I am, and I feel for them.", "While reporting in Crosby, I went to the high school, where employees from the Arkema plant were passing out checks from the company to needy families. I met two Mexican women who spoke broken English at best, so we spoke in Spanish. They had been forced to evacuate their homes because they were so close to the plant.", "Both had families of five and had to wait in line for $100 checks, which weren\u2019t going to take them very far. Araceli Reynosa, who works with her husband in a Mexican restaurant in Houston over 30 miles away, found the check insultingly inadequate considering her car was flooded and inoperable. \u201cWe have no car to go to work,\u201d she said with a sigh.", "The other woman, Leticia Sanchez, was no happier. \u201cMy house was totally flooded, and my animals \u2014 my dogs, my chickens, my goats \u2014 are all lost,\u201d she said. With a sad but steady voice, she added, \u201cThey must be dead.\u201d", "All I could say was that my house was flooded, too.", "\u201cSorry to hear that,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said.

How was your week? I\u2019ve been busy trying to get my digital life in order. For instance, I\u2019ve decided to check my email just twice a day, and I\u2019m carrying around my Kindle so that when I get the urge to check Twitter on my phone, I read a book instead. I have high hopes that it will make me fitter, happier and more productive. What do you think?", "Mike: Um, no wonder it\u2019s taking so long for you to respond to my emails. I\u2019m going to start texting you my email threads instead. Prepare for a lot of chain letters.", "Farhad: Great. Well, let\u2019s talk tech. First, quickly: Google is spending $1.1 billion to hire about 2,000 employees from HTC, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that has run into financial problems. Google and HTC have long been partners \u2014 HTC made Google\u2019s Pixel smartphone \u2014 so this deal effectively creates a more tightly integrated team for building Google\u2019s hardware. And Google has bet big on hardware lately. On that note: Nest, one of Google\u2019s sister companies, unveiled a set of home security gadgets this week.", "I wish I had some sparkling insight to offer here to make sense of all this. Why is Google, which has repeatedly failed to make it big in hardware, spending so much to become a big player? But the answer is really straightforward: because it has the money, so why not? We\u2019re at that stage in the tech industry where every one of the five tech giants is doing everything, because their money is endless and their appetites are ferocious. There is not much more to it than that.", "Mike: I honestly am a bit confused here. Remember the Motorola debacle from a few years back? Google paid more than $12 billion to buy Motorola Mobility, another struggling handset maker, in an attempt to take on Apple more directly and own the hardware stack from top to bottom.", "That didn\u2019t work out so well. Google ended up selling Motorola for parts after it realized that, uh, no one wanted to buy Motorola phones.", "Some people are saying this is about gaining more expertise inside Google for building hardware. O.K., I guess. But let\u2019s hope it works out better than last time.", "Farhad: Let\u2019s turn to Apple, Facebook and Amazon, since they all had a rough week. For Apple, it was about a buggy smartwatch. The new Apple Watch is supposed to work on cellular networks, meaning it can reach the internet even if you\u2019re away from your phone. Our own reviewer, Brian X. Chen, found that it worked quite well, but reviewers at The Wall Street Journal and The Verge discovered a flaw in the devices that prevented them from reaching cellular networks in some instances. Apple said it would fix the bug in a software update, but it\u2019s still an embarrassing slip from a company that prides itself on getting things perfect.", "Mike: Do we have to call this one \u201cWatchgate?\u201d I swear, every few iPhone launches we see some damning flaw in the hardware, and it takes a little shine off their huge annual product introductions.", "However, people will still buy their new iPhones in droves, as they always do. Probably the new watch, too. And to be fair to Apple, at least they aren\u2019t shipping phones that explode in your pants pocket.", "Farhad: Facebook, meanwhile, had to scramble to fix its ad targeting engine after ProPublica found that advertisers could use the system to target ads using racial slurs\u2014for instance, people could show ads to \u201cJew haters.\u201d Other reporters soon found that Google\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s ad systems could also be used to target heinous categories. Coming on top of reports that Russia used Facebook\u2019s ad system to manipulate the American election, the stories fed the perception that these companies just don\u2019t know how their systems are being used.", "Mike: And don\u2019t forget that Facebook finally came out with a nine-point list on how the company plans to comply with continuing investigations into Russian-linked ads and even begin some forms of self-regulation for political ads on Facebook. It\u2019s a huge story.", "Farhad: Oh, for further evidence of the cluelessness of tech companies over their platforms, Amazon\u2019s website has been recommending bomb-making materials to people, a British report found. Boy oh boy. Remember when tech was fun and zany, when it was all about getting cool gadgets? We\u2019re long past that.", "Mike: I started playing a video game the other day that\u2019s basically Grand Theft Auto meets San Francisco hackers. Part of the game includes making guns from a 3-D printer. The future is terrifying.", "Farhad: The rapidly deteriorating image of tech companies is having real-world consequences. Our colleague Cecilia Kang reported that Facebook and Google have lost so much clout in Washington that they\u2019ve all but given up trying to stop a sex-trafficking bill that they think could have negative consequences for their businesses. The bill would allow people to sue some websites for the content they host \u2014 a huge change to existing law, which doesn\u2019t hold companies responsible for stuff their users post on their sites, as long as they work to take down illegal material.", "Internet giants were gearing up to fight the law, but they\u2019ve determined that the growing anti-tech sentiment makes it too difficult. It\u2019s hard out there for a tech giant \u2014 other than all those billions of dollars they keep raking in.", "Mike: Right, and I think tech companies have grown wise to where the tide is turning. Right now, we\u2019re seeing Facebook try to get ahead of Congress by announcing that it wants to essentially regulate its own political ads, largely because it doesn\u2019t want Congress to intervene. Also, I can only imagine that Google, Twitter and Amazon are bracing for the possibility of this story picking apart their businesses, too.", "In any case, the future is scary!

This summer, as the city celebrated its 375th anniversary, Montreal had the most visitors it has ever had since it began keeping count.", "Visitors flock to Montreal for business, bachelor and bachelorette parties, as well as music festivals and sports events such as the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix car race. With four major universities, Montreal also attracts many students and educators.", "The Golden Square Mile, where the new Four Seasons will sit, is at the foot of the hilly Mont Royal park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted about 16 years after he helped create Central Park in New York. Between 1850 and 1930, some of North America\u2019s wealthiest families built mansions, as well as churches and universities in the Golden Square Mile. Now boutiques, restaurants, theaters, cinemas, art galleries and book stores populate the area.", "The developers of the new Four Seasons in Montreal, which is set to open next year, expect the shopping to be a big draw. While many high-end hotels feature luxury boutiques on their street level, the Four Seasons will be connected directly to the 250,000 square foot-luxury Ogilvy/Holt Renfrew department store.", "The Four Seasons will be a monochromatic 18-story building with tinted windows creating a reflective charcoal facade broken up by \u201ca golden thread that emphasizes the shift between volumes and outlines its main entrances,\u201d said Eric Pelletier, an architect and design principal at the firm designing the project. The gold inlay also highlights the 6,000-square-foot ballroom that will seat 500 guests.", "Four Seasons brought in Parisian-based architects Gilles and Boissier to design the hotel rooms, which are \u201ca balance of New World and Old World,\u201d said Dana Kalczak, vice president of interior design for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.", "In contemporary shades of white, cream, rose and gold, the rooms maximize natural light, including bathrooms with windows that allow light to pass in from the room outside. Old world touches include a built-in cocktail cabinet featuring all the equipment for \u201cshaking up a great cocktail or pouring a super scotch,\u201d said Ms. Kalczak.", "The building will include condos, which went on sale this June and range from 2,886 to 6,910 square feet. The largest penthouse includes a home gym and 2,060-square foot terrace with a fire pit and the option of a pool.", "It remains to be seen whether the timing is good. This year the overall condo market is \u201ca lot healthier than it was,\u201d says H\u00e9l\u00e8ne B\u00e9gin, a senior economist at Desjardins Economics.

That\u2019s a good start, but more is required \u2014 of Facebook, of social media giants generally and of Congress.", "Mark Zuckerberg, a co-founder and the chief executive of Facebook, said on Thursday that the company would give congressional investigators more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads and would begin disclosing the names of Facebook business accounts that place political ads on the site. He also said the company would hire more people to improve security, work more closely with election regulators and crack down on political harassment.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we stand for.\u201d A day earlier his top lieutenant, Sheryl Sandberg, pledged to change the company\u2019s systems so ad buyers couldn\u2019t target their missives to racists and anti-Semites. These statements came two weeks after Facebook said that a business linked to the Russian government had placed $100,000 worth of divisive ads on the site between 2015 and May of this year.", "Companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have become a huge force in the political system and in society broadly. While their executives have eagerly embraced their status as disrupters and innovators, they have been reluctant to acknowledge that their creations have been used to do harm. Technology executives have been loath to accept much or any responsibility for the power they and their businesses wield. In fact, many of them have gone out of their way to avoid or evade rules that apply to the traditional businesses that they are trying to displace. For example, Facebook argued in a 2011 letter to the Federal Election Commission that it and other internet companies should not be subject to regulations on political ads that radio and TV stations have to abide by.", "Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s concern about democracy is commendable, and some of the changes he announced could have a positive impact. But they apply only to his company and can be easily evaded. Disclosing the name of Facebook business accounts placing political ads, for instance, will be of little value if purchasers can disguise their real identity \u2014 calling themselves, say, Americans for Motherhood and Apple Pie. Further, even if Facebook succeeds in driving away foreign propaganda, the same material could pop up on Twitter or other social media sites.", "More comprehensive safeguards will need intervention from Congress, which could begin by passing a law requiring online political ads \u2014 those that mention candidates seeking office or that advocate for certain political outcomes \u2014 to disclose who paid for them. Congress should also require internet companies to preserve the ads, and data about the groups the ads were targeted against, to help investigators looking into illicit activities. Two Democratic senators \u2014 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia \u2014 are planning to introduce a bill with some of these ideas.", "Of course, legislation cannot completely protect American elections from outside interference. It was already illegal for foreigners to purchase political ads when Russian agents started their Facebook campaign. Stronger enforcement of those rules would help, but that would require broader reforms, like replacing the Federal Election Commission, a toothless watchdog often paralyzed by partisan gridlock, with a new agency that has an odd number of members, including a nonpartisan election law expert.", "An educational effort by government, schools, civil society groups and the media to help people distinguish facts from fakery might help. Regrettably, President Trump has elevated \u201calternative facts\u201d to a high political art, and many members of his party and its talking-head cheerleaders seem perfectly happy to follow his lead.

With honesty much in the news lately \u2014 you might even say honesty is having a cultural moment \u2014 I wanted to reflect on my own. My 6-year-old daughter once told me that telling the truth made her feel \u201cgold in her brain.\u201d Could upping my personal honesty light up a pleasure center in my own brain?", "My plan was to jot down different instances throughout the day where I had to make a choice about honesty and notice how it felt.", "The day I started the journal, the same 6-year-old daughter asked me during her bath if the cat really went to sleep last year, and if that actually meant that I had killed him. I rinsed her hair and sighed, wondering if I should wait to start this honesty project until my children were grown. But I braved it and told her that yes, I had made the choice for him to die, because he was suffering and I wanted him to be at peace. She lost interest about halfway through my explanation, which was O.K. with me.", "It struck me that the choice to lie or be honest was often a choice between two equally undesirable things. Telling my daughter the truth did not make me happier, but lying wouldn\u2019t have either.", "A bigger opportunity arose with my 8-year-old son. Though he didn\u2019t know anything about the journal, after a few weeks, he seemed to open up in a new way, asking me things he was too embarrassed or scared to ask before, like what the word \u201cpimp\u201d meant and why people kill themselves. In fact, one of my biggest takeaways was that we shouldn\u2019t lie to children when they are asking us about grown-up words or ideas \u2014 otherwise, they will just ask Siri. If it\u2019s between YouTube and me to explain prostitution, I pick me.", "Still, I wondered about those little lies we tell to avoid hurting people\u2019s feelings. Researchers at the University of California San Diego Emotion Lab are looking at \u201cprosocial\u201d lies \u2014 the white lies we tell to benefit others, like telling an aspiring writer a story is great because you want to be nice and encouraging, when in reality you know it needs work and will meet rejection. A recent study at the lab suggests that we are more likely to tell a prosocial lie when we feel compassion toward someone, because if you feel bad for someone, the last thing you want to do is hurt him or her with the truth. These lies feel better in the short term, but they often do more harm than good in the long term. After all, the brutal truth can be painful, but people need to know it if they are to improve their performance, especially in a work or school situation.", "But was brutal truth what I really wanted when it came to my marriage?", "My focus on honesty at times did lead to better interactions with my husband. When the New York Times Magazine article about open marriage came out, for example, it sparked my curiosity. Since I was keeping an honesty journal, rather than keeping it to myself, as I would have done in the past, my husband and I had an honest discussion about it. Other times, the compulsion to be honest strained things between us. That I disagree with some of his parenting techniques doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be pointed out every single time. I came to realize that, within relationships, there is a third category between dishonesty and telling white lies, called not sharing everything.", "Over all, I found that I struggled more with the small instances of honesty, rather than the big. So, when a client accidentally paid me twice for a project \u2014 sending a duplicate $1,000 check a week after they\u2019d already paid me \u2014 there was no internal debate. It was $1,000, so obviously, I notified the client. But when the McDonald\u2019s drive-through cashier gave me an extra dollar in change and the line had been SO long and all I wanted was a Diet Coke and my kids were acting crazy in the back seat and why was this stupid McDonald\u2019s always so slow anyway?!\u2026 it was a different story. Even though I gave the dollar back, I almost didn\u2019t, because an extra dollar was such a small thing and seemed somehow justified. Had I not been focused on honesty, I\u2019m not sure I would have given it back.", "My experience was consistent with what the behavioral economist Dan Ariely wrote about in his 2012 book, \u201cThe (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty.\u201d His research showed that we fudge the truth by about 10 percent or so. We cheat when we are fairly certain we can get away with it, but just by a little, and about things we can justify. We do it more if we see other people doing it. We do it less if we are reminded to be honest. My journal pointed these instances out to me rather starkly.", "I also quickly came to realize that the Facebook version of Judi Ketteler, whose life was so together and children so well behaved, was a very particular version of me, a notion explored by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz in his book \u201cEverybody Lies.\u201d Dr. Davidowitz, a data scientist, tackles the discrepancy between the ideal version of ourselves we present to the world via social media and the often-miserable confessions we make to Google as we search for the things we would never post in a status update. My social media self wasn\u2019t a lie, but if I was going to focus on truly honest behavior, it seemed better not to indulge too much \u2014 hence, I pulled way back from posting on Facebook.", "Even though honesty felt like a struggle, I started to like how it felt. Research from the University of Notre Dame has shown that when people consciously stopped telling lies, including white lies, for 10 weeks, they had fewer physical ailments (like headaches) and fewer mental health complaints (like symptoms of depression) than a control group that did not focus on honesty.", "When people were more honest, they also tended to feel better about their relationships and social interactions, the researchers found. This rang true for me, mostly because I felt better about myself. I like the saying, \u201cEverybody wants the truth, but nobody wants to be honest.\u201d I didn\u2019t always want to be honest. But I wanted the truth, and this focus on honesty helped me feel that I was doing my part.", "The bottom line is that focusing on honesty is a way to actively engage with the world, versus passively complaining about it.

As performance improved, chips consumed about the same amount of power, according to another, lesser-known law of chip design called Dennard scaling, named for the longtime IBM researcher Robert Dennard.", "By 2010, however, doubling the number of transistors was taking much longer than Moore\u2019s Law predicted. Dennard\u2019s scaling maxim had also been upended as chip designers ran into the limits of the physical materials they used to build processors. The result: If a company wanted more computing power, it could not just upgrade its processors. It needed more computers, more space and more electricity.", "Researchers in industry and academia were working to extend Moore\u2019s Law, exploring entirely new chip materials and design techniques. But Doug Burger, a researcher at Microsoft, had another idea: Rather than rely on the steady evolution of the central processor, as the industry had been doing since the 1960s, why not move some of the load onto specialized chips?", "During his Christmas vacation in 2010, Mr. Burger, working with a few other chip researchers inside Microsoft, began exploring new hardware that could accelerate the performance of Bing, the company\u2019s internet search engine.", "At the time, Microsoft was just beginning to improve Bing using machine-learning algorithms (neural networks are a type of machine learning) that could improve search results by analyzing the way people used the service. Though these algorithms were less demanding than the neural networks that would later remake the internet, existing chips had trouble keeping up.", "Mr. Burger and his team explored several options but eventually settled on something called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or F.P.G.A.s.: chips that could be reprogrammed for new jobs on the fly. Microsoft builds software, like Windows, that runs on an Intel C.P.U. But such software cannot reprogram the chip, since it is hard-wired to perform only certain tasks.", "With an F.P.G.A., Microsoft could change the way the chip works. It could program the chip to be really good at executing particular machine learning algorithms. Then, it could reprogram the chip to be really good at running logic that sends the millions and millions of data packets across its computer network. It was the same chip but it behaved in a different way.", "Microsoft started to install the chips en masse in 2015. Now, just about every new server loaded into a Microsoft data center includes one of these programmable chips. They help choose the results when you search Bing, and they help Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing service, shuttle information across its network of underlying machines.", "In fall 2016, another team of Microsoft researchers \u2014 mirroring the work done by Jeff Dean at Google \u2014 built a neural network that could, by one measure at least, recognize spoken words more accurately than the average human could.", "Xuedong Huang, a speech-recognition specialist who was born in China, led the effort, and shortly after the team published a paper describing its work, he had dinner in the hills above Palo Alto, Calif., with his old friend Jen-Hsun Huang, (no relation), the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia. The men had reason to celebrate, and they toasted with a bottle of champagne.", "Xuedong Huang and his fellow Microsoft researchers had trained their speech-recognition service using large numbers of specialty chips supplied by Nvidia, rather than relying heavily on ordinary Intel chips. Their breakthrough would not have been possible had they not made that change.", "\u201cWe closed the gap with humans in about a year,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Mr. Huang said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the weapon \u2014 the infrastructure \u2014 it would have taken at least five years.\u201d", "Because systems that rely on neural networks can learn largely on their own, they can evolve more quickly than traditional services. They are not as reliant on engineers writing endless lines of code that explain how they should behave.", "But there is a wrinkle: Training neural networks this way requires extensive trial and error. To create one that is able to recognize words as well as a human can, researchers must train it repeatedly, tweaking the algorithms and improving the training data over and over. At any given time, this process unfolds over hundreds of algorithms. That requires enormous computing power, and if companies like Microsoft use standard-issue chips to do it, the process takes far too long because the chips cannot handle the load and too much electrical power is consumed.", "So, the leading internet companies are now training their neural networks with help from another type of chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. These low-power chips \u2014 usually made by Nvidia \u2014 were originally designed to render images for games and other software, and they worked hand-in-hand with the chip \u2014 usually made by Intel \u2014 at the center of a computer. G.P.U.s can process the math required by neural networks far more efficiently than C.P.U.s.", "Nvidia is thriving as a result, and it is now selling large numbers of G.P.U.s to the internet giants of the United States and the biggest online companies around the world, in China most notably. The company\u2019s quarterly revenue from data center sales tripled to $409 million over the past year.", "\u201cThis is a little like being right there at the beginning of the internet,\u201d Jen-Hsun Huang said in a recent interview. In other words, the tech landscape is changing rapidly, and Nvidia is at the heart of that change.", "G.P.U.s are the primary vehicles that companies use to teach their neural networks a particular task, but that is only part of the process. Once a neural network is trained for a task, it must perform it, and that requires a different kind of computing power.", "After training a speech-recognition algorithm, for example, Microsoft offers it up as an online service, and it actually starts identifying commands that people speak into their smartphones. G.P.U.s are not quite as efficient during this stage of the process. So, many companies are now building chips specifically to do what the other chips have learned.", "Google built its own specialty chip, a Tensor Processing Unit, or T.P.U. Nvidia is building a similar chip. And Microsoft has reprogrammed specialized chips from Altera, which was acquired by Intel, so that it too can run neural networks more easily.", "Other companies are following suit. Qualcomm, which specializes in chips for smartphones, and a number of start-ups are also working on A.I. chips, hoping to grab their piece of the rapidly expanding market. The tech research firm IDC predicts that revenue from servers equipped with alternative chips will reach $6.8 billion by 2021, about 10 percent of the overall server market.", "Across Microsoft\u2019s global network of machines, Mr. Burger pointed out, alternative chips are still a relatively modest part of the operation. And Bart Sano, the vice president of engineering who leads hardware and software development for Google\u2019s network, said much the same about the chips deployed at its data centers.", "Mike Mayberry, who leads Intel Labs, played down the shift toward alternative processors, perhaps because Intel controls more than 90 percent of the data-center market, making it by far the largest seller of traditional chips. He said that if central processors were modified the right way, they could handle new tasks without added help.", "But this new breed of silicon is spreading rapidly, and Intel is increasingly a company in conflict with itself. It is in some ways denying that the market is changing, but nonetheless shifting its business to keep up with the change.", "Two years ago, Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, which builds the programmable chips that Microsoft uses. It was Intel\u2019s largest acquisition ever. Last year, the company paid a reported $408 million buying Nervana, a company that was exploring a chip just for executing neural networks. Now, led by the Nervana team, Intel is developing a dedicated chip for training and executing neural networks.", "\u201cThey have the traditional big-company problem,\u201d said Bill Coughran, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital who spent nearly a decade helping to oversee Google\u2019s online infrastructure, referring to Intel. \u201cThey need to figure out how to move into the new and growing areas without damaging their traditional business.\u201d", "Intel\u2019s internal conflict is most apparent when company officials discuss the decline of Moore\u2019s Law. During a recent interview with The New York Times, Naveen Rao, the Nervana founder and now an Intel executive, said Intel could squeeze \u201ca few more years\u201d out of Moore\u2019s Law. Officially, the company\u2019s position is that improvements in traditional chips will continue well into the next decade.", "Mr. Mayberry of Intel also argued that the use of additional chips was not new. In the past, he said, computer makers used separate chips for tasks like processing audio.", "But now the scope of the trend is significantly larger. And it is changing the market in new ways. Intel is competing not only with chipmakers like Nvidia and Qualcomm, but also with companies like Google and Microsoft.", "Google is designing the second generation of its T.P.U. chips. Later this year, the company said, any business or developer that is a customer of its cloud-computing service will be able to use the new chips to run its software.", "While this shift is happening mostly inside the massive data centers that underpin the internet, it is probably a matter of time before it permeates the broader industry.", "The hope is that this new breed of mobile chip can help devices handle more, and more complex, tasks on their own, without calling back to distant data centers: phones recognizing spoken commands without accessing the internet; driverless cars recognizing the world around them with a speed and accuracy that is not possible now.", "In other words, a driverless car needs cameras and radar and lasers.

So why would you even use it?", "As a result, you will probably continue to use the phone\u2019s fingerprint scanner, a feature that has been available on many smartphones for several years. Unfortunately, the fingerprint scanner is located on the back of the phone, adjacent to the camera flash, which is next to the lenses.

So why should anyone use it? Nobody wants their time wasted by an assistant who is insecure and incompetent.", "In my tests, Bixby failed to dictate my latest email, provide traffic data for a commute, bring up a map to the gym and order delivery food, among many other tasks. The upshot: Bixby is an unfinished product and it should not be a reason to consider buying the Note 8.", "Shopping for a smartphone is becoming a lot like buying a TV.

Now, having grown more confident that it understands the fickle market for consumer products, Amazon is making it clear that the Echo and other hardware powered by Alexa, the intelligent assistant behind the devices, present the company with one of its brightest opportunities.", "On Wednesday, Amazon introduced an array of new Alexa devices that are smaller, less expensive and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home, including an alarm clock, Echo Spot, that is designed to sit on night stands and desks.", "Amazon prides itself on its almost pathological focus on what its customers want, rather than what its competitors are doing. But its new Alexa products are clearly a response, at least in part, to new smart speaker offerings from Google and Apple. Amazon is betting that it can defend its franchise by using an old trick \u2014 aggressive pricing \u2014 and by finding ways to embed Alexa\u2019s hooks more deeply into customers\u2019 lives.", "If the strategy works, Amazon could gain an edge in a new wave of computing. Most big technology companies are convinced that voice commands and intelligent assistants will be primary ways that people interact with technology, perhaps more vital than touch screens and keyboards.", "David Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, said Wednesday that the company had about 5,000 employees working on Alexa projects. The company held its event on the 30th floor of one of its high-rise buildings in Seattle, where it had created a living room and kitchen to test how the Alexa devices worked in a homelike setting.", "The company has identified music, communications and controlling smart home appliances as the most popular uses of Alexa. Although Amazon has not released specific sales figures for Alexa devices, Mr. Limp said tens of millions had been sold.", "\u201cThey\u2019re literally scattering them around the house, putting them in hallways, workshops and garages,\u201d he said.", "Echo Spot, a $129.99 spherical device with a 2.5-inch touch screen, is Amazon\u2019s version of an alarm clock. In addition to displaying the time and weather, its microphones will allow people to make phone calls, turn lights on and off and ask how long a morning commute will take. A tiny camera makes videoconferencing possible.", "The device, and its camera, could also provide a test for Amazon. Whether customers feel comfortable having a camera aimed at their beds will depend partially on whether they trust Amazon to protect their privacy.", "Also introduced Wednesday was an updated version of the original, cylinder-shaped Echo. The new iteration is shorter, with sleeves made of fabric, wood veneer and other materials that allow it to blend in better with the rest of a home\u2019s d\u00e9cor. The company said it had improved the device\u2019s speakers as well. The biggest change is the price: $99.99 instead of the original Echo\u2019s $179.99.", "Another new device, Echo Plus, resembles the original Echo, but comes with technology that helps control certain household devices like light bulbs that are automated. Echo Plus, priced at $149.99, is designed to find many of those automated devices with little configuration required.", "A new version of Fire TV, the company\u2019s device for streaming internet video to televisions, is small enough to dangle from the back of a television\u2019s video port. Amazon said that media companies including Bravo, Netflix and Showtime planned to use a new Alexa capability that lets people use voice commands to control Fire TV video apps.", "Amazon also said that BMW Group had agreed to embed Alexa in its BMW and Mini Cooper vehicles starting next year, the latest in a series of relationships that Amazon has entered with carmakers to spread the use of Alexa outside the home.", "Jan Dawson, an analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research said he believed Amazon\u2019s goal was to strengthen the loyalty of its customers, especially those enrolled in its Prime membership program.", "\u201cOverall, today\u2019s announcements felt like Amazon doubling down on its Echo and Alexa strategy,\u201d he said, adding that the company was \u201creminding all of us that it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to make money on Echo hardware for the strategy to be successful.\u201d", "Mr. Dawson said the strategy created \u201cinteresting competitive challenges for others like Google and Apple who don\u2019t have such obvious non-hardware revenue streams associated with their smart voice speakers.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/business/media/facebook-ads.html": ["Facebook\u2019s enormous audience has long been catnip to advertisers. But the company\u2019s vast ecosystem has come under scrutiny this year from major brands, which are increasingly sensitive to the possibility of inadvertently showing up next to objectionable content.", "In response to those concerns, Facebook released a new set of rules on Wednesday that outline the types of videos and articles that it will bar from running ads. It also said it would begin disclosing new information to advertisers about where their messages appear on the platform and on external apps and sites it is partners with.", "The rules, which will be enforced by a mix of automation and human review, restrict ads from content that depicts, among other topics, real-world tragedies, \u201cdebatable social issues,\u201d misappropriation of children\u2019s show characters, violence, nudity, gore, drug use and derogatory language. Facebook is extending the guidelines immediately to videos \u2014 which the company hopes will become an increasingly lucrative part of its business \u2014 and, in the coming months, to articles.", "Facebook said users who repeatedly violate its content guidelines, share sensational clickbait or post fake news may lose the ability to run ads.", "\u201cThere have been concerns that marketers have had that are wide-ranging around digital, and we want to do everything we can to ensure that we are providing the safest environment for publishers, advertisers and for people that utilize the platform,\u201d said Carolyn Everson, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global marketing solutions.", "The new policies, which closely mimic guidelines established by Google\u2019s YouTube, come as advertisers demand more accountability from the internet giants related to where and how their messages are delivered.", "Facebook and Google were criticized during and after the presidential election for allowing misinformation to spread on their platforms. This year, YouTube had to address advertisers\u2019 concerns after messages from major brands like AT&T were discovered on videos that promoted terrorism and hate speech. The Wall Street Journal found at least 50 acts of violence on Facebook Live broadcasts.", "(On the other side of the advertising equation, Facebook disclosed last week that it had identified more than $100,000 worth of ads on divisive issues that ran from June 2015 to May 2017 and had been bought by fake accounts based in Russia.)", "The companies are moving quickly to address such issues, particularly as they seek to attract a greater portion of the money earmarked for television advertising to the video content on their sites.", "Facebook has enabled hundreds of publishers and individuals to run ads during live video broadcasts in the past year, and the company recently introduced a slate of new shows on a part of its site called \u201cWatch.\u201d If the new guidelines encourage people to post more G-rated video content, they are likely to bolster Facebook\u2019s pitch to advertisers.", "\u201cFacebook is this huge, huge, huge platform, and they haven\u2019t really been monetizing original content in the same way as YouTube has,\u201d said John Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at GroupM, a media investment group for the advertising giant WPP. \u201cWhat I think is different for Facebook is that this is a much earlier stage for them that they\u2019re going into this, and the scale is different in that there will be much, much less content uploaded than those stupefying numbers you hear about on YouTube.\u201d (YouTube has said 400 hours of video are added to the site every minute.)", "That should be an advantage in policing content, Mr. Montgomery said, especially with the limits that Facebook is placing on who can make money from certain features. For example, the company required pages and profiles that wanted to run ads on live videos this year to have more than 2,000 followers. They could only show ads if they had at least 300 concurrent viewers after four minutes.", "Facebook also said it would begin showing advertisers a preview of where their messages may appear before campaigns start, giving advertisers a chance to block undesirable destinations. The company will also report on where the ads actually run.", "When brands use Facebook to target specific people with ads, they are able to select from a cornucopia of traits, including age, gender and how many lines of credit a person has. Many ads then show up in the main Facebook and Instagram feeds that people flick through, but they can also appear in articles and videos within Facebook and on outside apps and mobile websites that are part of Facebook\u2019s \u201caudience network.\u201d", "Brands have not been able to see beforehand what kind of content that might include, and some have had to contend with objections from consumers after being placed on sites like Breitbart News. Facebook said there were tens of thousands of apps and sites in its audience network and that more than 10,000 publishers displayed articles within its platform through a tool called Instant Articles.", "As YouTube has moved to limit ads from running alongside unsavory content, many creators on the platform have complained that their videos have been unfairly penalized by automated systems. Facebook will probably have to grapple with similar complaints as it expands the number of people who can make money from video ads on the site.", "\u201cWe are not censoring their content; as long as it abides by our community standards, the content can run on the platform,\u201d Ms. Everson said. \u201cIf a publisher wants to monetize that content, they have to adhere to the monetization eligibility standards.\u201d", "Facebook previously let advertisers opt out of a more limited list of topics, including sites and apps related to dating, gambling and \u201cdebated social issues\u201d like religion and politics, Ms. Everson said. She added that the new rules would allow publishers to \u201cunderstand where we\u2019re placing ads\u201d and make it easier for advertisers to avoid offensive content.", "The company, which will also have an appeals process for content deemed ineligible for ads, reiterated its commitment to hiring 3,000 more people to a team of 4,500 to review and remove content that violates its community guidelines, which were announced in May. (It did not provide an update on how many people it has hired.)", "In its announcement on Wednesday, Facebook also addressed industry concerns about how it measures ads, an issue that attracted attention again last week after an analyst noted that Facebook\u2019s online ad tools claimed the ads could reach 25 million more young Americans than the Census Bureau says actually exist. Facebook, which said this year that it would seek accreditation from the nonprofit Media Ratings Council to validate how it measured ads, said it hoped to achieve that in the next 18 months for key metrics for its display and video ads."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/briefing/japan-north-korea-kuala-lumpur-your-friday-briefing.html": ["Good morning.", "Here\u2019s what you need to know:", "\u2022 North Korea fired a ballistic missile toward the east, its 15th launch this year, in defiance of new U.N. sanctions prompted by the country\u2019s most powerful nuclear test to date.", "In Japan, alerts were issued on television and via cellphones, warning people to take shelter indoors or underground.", "Check back for updates on this developing story.

They don\u2019t even beat the paltry returns of one-month Treasury bills, he has found.", "But a relative handful of stocks are extraordinary performers. Only 4 percent of all publicly traded stocks account for all of the net wealth earned by investors in the stock market since 1926, he has found.

In his 2016 rankings, Exxon Mobil, not Apple, appears at the top, with net wealth creation of more than $1 trillion. Apple lags at about $745 billion.", "But it has been a wild year. Exxon Mobil shares have declined more than 11 percent at a time of weak energy prices, while Apple, which just introduced a raft of new iPhones, is on a spectacular stock surge, gaining more than 37 percent.", "Run the numbers as I did, and it\u2019s clear that at this moment, Apple has pulled ahead of Exxon Mobil, with total net wealth creation of somewhere in the vicinity of $1 trillion. Counting dividends, Exxon Mobil\u2019s losses in the stock market have reduced its total to a bit over $910 billion. (Note that, as a technical matter, Professor Bessembinder defines net wealth creation as total stock returns in excess of one-month Treasury bill returns, which averaged an annualized 3.38 percent, so the actual stock returns for Apple, Exxon, and the others are even higher than indicated.)", "\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that Apple has generated so much wealth in such a short period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cExxon has had decades to pile up those returns.\u201d", "Exxon is among the top wealth-creating companies that have been publicly trading \u2014 under the name of a predecessor, Standard Oil of New Jersey \u2014 since the inception of Professor Bessembinder\u2019s tally in July 1926. Others include General Electric, IBM, Altria, Coca-Cola, DuPont, PepsiCo and Schlumberger.", "He relied on a database developed at the University of Chicago, known as CRSP, for the Center for Research in Security Prices, that contains virtually all publicly traded stocks in the United States. The Center for Research uses rigorous and logical criteria to determine when stocks enter and depart its listings, with some results that may seem surprising at first glance.", "General Motors, for example, ranks eighth. It was publicly traded in 1926, but the list says it ceased to exist in June 2009. A company called General Motors exists today, of course, but as Chloe Fu, senior support and relationship manager at the Center for Research in Security Prices, explained it, G.M.\u2019s bailout and bankruptcy led the center to declare the old company terminated, with a new G.M. coming to life in June 2009. Consequently, the new G.M. returns aren\u2019t included in the total for G.M. on the list.", "The list is a fascinating ranking of big winners in the stock market. But for a variety of technical reasons, it isn\u2019t a straightforward table of the greatest wealth generators in market history. For example, the long-term gains generated by Exxon Mobil and its predecessors are understated because of the database\u2019s limited duration and strict criteria.", "Exxon Mobil\u2019s wealth in the list doesn\u2019t include Mobil\u2019s, which Professor Bessembinder\u2019s listing says, ceased to exist in November 1999, when it merged with Exxon. And going back further, both Exxon and Mobil were among the descendants of the Standard Oil trust, established by John D. Rockefeller and his partners in the 19th century. The total wealth generated by the cluster of companies derived at least partially from the trust \u2014 which also include Amoco and Chevron \u2014 doesn\u2019t appear in a single notation, because of the list\u2019s logic.", "Other apparent oddities are explained by Professor Bessembinder\u2019s application of the center\u2019s criteria. There are two companies on the list called AT&T, for example, neither capturing the total net wealth generated by an investment in the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company at its 19th century inception.", "To start with, the \u201cold\u201d AT&T, a.k.a. \u201cMa Bell,\u201d is ranked 17th. It is said to have gone out of existence in November 2005. Another AT&T appears in the 33rd spot. That company came to life in March 1984 as Southwestern Bell, spun off from the old AT&T as a result of an antitrust suit. A descendant of Southwestern Bell bought the AT&T name in 2005 and operates under it today.", "Other AT&T cousins are on the list: Verizon, as well as Comcast, which resulted from a merger between AT&T Broadband and an older company also known as Comcast.", "The listings for most of the recently created companies are less tangled.", "As I wrote in July, Amazon, which started trading in 1997, has soared to the 14th spot. Although it hasn\u2019t been in existence long compared with Exxon Mobil, its annualized return is the highest in the list, 37.4 percent through December. A group of young companies have also had remarkable results.", "Facebook, which started trading in June 2012, is the youngest on the list, with an annualized return of 34.5 percent. Visa, which had its initial public offering of stock in 2008, is the second-newest company, with a 21 percent annualized return, followed by Alphabet (Google), ranked 11th with a 24.9 percent annualized return.", "And then there is that great wealth machine, Microsoft, ranked as the third-greatest wealth creator. Since 1986, it has had an annualized return of 25 percent, making its founder, Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $87 billion, according to Bloomberg.", "No list of wealth-generating companies is complete without Berkshire Hathaway. It ranks 12th, just behind Alphabet, with an annualized return of 22.6 percent. By comparison, Exxon Mobil\u2019s annualized return was only 11.94 percent.", "Why is Berkshire\u2019s annualized return so much higher?", "It is because the return doesn\u2019t include decades of mediocre performance for the old textile company Berkshire Hathaway, which started in 1929. The Center for Research says the Berkshire on this list started in November 1976. It was a holding company for Warren E. Buffett, who guided it to fabulous gains. Thanks to Berkshire, Mr. Buffett is a rich man, with a net worth estimated by Bloomberg at $79 billion.", "Anyone who invested in Apple or Microsoft or, really, in any of these companies at their inception and just held on did extraordinarily well. You might look at that record and conclude that you should just buy the best companies as a foolproof way to get rich.", "If only it were that easy.", "How do you find those companies? Not here.", "\u201cThe problem is, I have no idea which companies will generate the best returns over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years, \u201c Professor Bessembinder said. \u201cProbably it will be some companies we\u2019ve never heard of. Maybe it will be companies that don\u2019t even exist now.\u201d", "This list is worth studying for understanding the past.

Rising energy prices allow politicians to take their hands off the legislative wheel. Less attention to smart, controlled growth at the state and local level allowed unchecked sprawl along the coast. And now declining revenues will make it harder for the state to address its very real needs, assuming the Legislature can get its act together. The silver lining to this tale? It finally seems to be dawning on people that low taxes, less regulation and more oil are no substitute for actually governing.", "If this doesn\u2019t sound like the Tall Tale of the Texas Miracle of just a few years ago, that\u2019s because it\u2019s not. Way, way back \u2014 in early 2015 \u2014 Gov. Rick Perry rode out of office with his head held high: The boom years had created over 1.4 million jobs since the end of 2007. We had escaped the housing bust, oil and gas prices were rising and the state\u2019s economy had diversified and profited mightily from free trade. Texas was the promised land, reminiscent of Davy Crockett\u2019s observation that our state \u201cis the garden spot of the world.\u201d At the height of this latest Texas miracle, the cost of living was so low and there were so many jobs that 1,000 people flocked here every single day.", "Times, however, have changed. Two years ago Texas had one of the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rates; today it is in 28th place. Though it is now at 4.4 percent, it was as high as 5 percent a few months ago, and there\u2019s a good bet it will bounce back up, and likely higher, soon.", "The reason: the oil patch. When oil fetched $100 per barrel, we fracked away, even in our own suburbs. Roughnecks rented trailer spots in front yards and showered towns from Odessa to Victoria with money. A drive across West Texas\u2019s vast, oil-rich Permian Basin in late 2015 revealed equipment crowding roads. Now much of that equipment is idle, and energy companies are planning on $40 a barrel as far as they can forecast.", "The Lone Star State also slipped in the business rankings. For the first time in years, Texas tumbled out of the top two most desirable states for business in CNBC\u2019s annual survey of executives. No. 1? Washington State.

In addition to the immense human suffering, applications for unemployment benefits have spiked to Great Recession levels. If the federal government comes through with all the money, then those costs would eventually be zeroed out as money pours into rebuilding.

Of that, only $1 billion has been disbursed; almost a third of that will be needed just to clean up trash.", "The tale of the Texas Miracle was a big fat lie: Plentiful oil, low regulation and even lower taxes are not a panacea. Sure, they don\u2019t hurt. But they don\u2019t help, not without consistent, well-considered state policy to attract and build businesses.", "Still, there is hope. Harvey is forcing Texans to rethink our political dogma of small government at any cost. Harris County, which surrounds Democratic Houston and includes bedrock Republican suburbs, has placed everything on the table to prevent disasters in the future: from radical rezoning to land conservation and a giant Dutch-style engineering project to protect the region from another direct hit. That will take at least tens of billions of taxpayer dollars.", "Even the state\u2019s right-wing lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has found religion, singing the praises of expensive engineering. Mr. Abbott is being too clever by half so far, refusing to tap the state\u2019s $10 billion rainy day fund while asking for the federal government to pick up the entire tab for the hurricane. Though as a politician he has done nothing but oppose the federal government, his re-election may end up hinging on how effective he is at bringing home the federal bacon.

He was 96.", "His son, Norman, confirmed the death.", "Emerging from an academic paper Mr. Zadeh published in 1965 as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, \u201cfuzzy logic,\u201d as he called it, was an ambitious effort to close the gap between mathematics and the intuitive way that humans talk, think and interact with the world.", "If someone asks you to identify \u201ca very tall man,\u201d for instance, you can easily do so \u2014 even if you are not given a specific height. Similarly, you can balance a broom handle on your finger without calculating how far it can lean in one direction without toppling over.", "Mr. Zadeh envisioned a mathematical framework that could mimic these human talents \u2014 that could deal with ambiguity and uncertainty in similar ways. Rather than creating strict boundaries for real world concepts, he made the boundaries \u201cfuzzy.\u201d Something was not in or out, for example. It sat somewhere on the continuum between in and out, and at any given moment a set of more complex rules defined inclusion.", "\u201cIt was a bridge between theory and reality,\u201d said Rudolf Seising, a professor at the University of Jena in Germany who specializes in fuzzy logic and worked alongside Professor Zadeh in his later years.", "In academic circles, Professor Zadeh\u2019s work was controversial and sometimes ridiculed, in part because it challenged other forms of mathematics and in part because of his terminology. \u201cFuzzy logic\u201d seemed to make fun of itself.", "But the logic itself was not fuzzy, said Professor Timothy Ross of the University of New Mexico. It was a way of dealing with \u201cfuzzy sets,\u201d collections of information whose boundaries were vague or imprecise. Over the years it proved to be an enormously influential idea.", "According to the website Google Scholar, Mr. Zadeh\u2019s 1965 paper, titled \u201cFuzzy Sets,\u201d has been cited by more than 90,000 scholarly works, and his mathematical concepts have provided practical new ways to build consumer electronics, trade stocks, forecast weather and more.", "Lotfi Asker Zadeh was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Baku, Azerbaijan, which was then a Soviet Socialist republic.

He moved to Berkeley in 1959.", "Elijah Polak, a professor emeritus at Berkeley, recalled in an interview that Professor Zadeh\u2019s theory of fuzzy sets emerged during their walks across the campus.

But the idea expanded into other areas. It could provide a way for insurance companies to assess damage after an earthquake, for instance. Is the damage serious, moderate or minimal under company rules? Fuzzy sets could help.", "\u201cThey opened up a whole new way of addressing problems where you don\u2019t have precise data,\u201d said Professor Ross, the author of a textbook on the practical uses of fuzzy logic.", "The method could also help build machinery and electronics that gradually move from one state to another, like an automobile transmission, which shifts smoothly from first gear to second, or a thermostat, which flows just as smoothly from hot to cold. Hot and cold need not be precisely defined. They could exist on a continuum.", "In the 1980s, Professor Zadeh\u2019s ideas became popular among Japanese manufacturers, thanks to heavy investment from the government. Today the hype has faded, but fuzzy logic remains an active part of the mathematics that underpin the modern world.", "In recognition of his work, Professor Zadeh received more than 50 engineering and academic awards. From 1963 to 1968 he was chairman of Berkeley\u2019s electrical engineering department, helping to shift its focus toward computer science, a move that gave rise to one of the world\u2019s top university computer science programs.", "Professor Zadeh\u2019s son is his only immediate survivor.

He did so, he told his company\u2019s board, because he believed that no executive should make more than $225,000 a year (which translates into almost $2 million today).", "He worried that \u201cthe temptations of success\u201d could distract people from more important matters, as he said to a biographer, T. George Harris. This belief seems to have stemmed from both Romney\u2019s Mormon faith and a culture of financial restraint that was once commonplace in this country.", "Romney didn\u2019t try to make every dollar he could, or anywhere close to it. The same was true among many of his corporate peers. In the early 1960s, the typical chief executive at a large American company made only 20 times as much as the average worker, rather than the current 271-to-1 ratio. Today, some C.E.O.s make $2 million in a single month.", "The old culture of restraint had multiple causes, but one of them was the tax code. When Romney was saying no to bonuses, the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent. Even if he had accepted the bonuses, he would have kept only a sliver of them.", "The high tax rates, in other words, didn\u2019t affect only the post-tax incomes of the wealthy. The tax code also affected pretax incomes.

Many of the world\u2019s most successful companies are American \u2014 not only Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but also Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson and JPMorgan Chase.

But I am convinced that the current top tax rate, 39.6 percent, is too low.", "It has contributed to soaring inequality, with the affluent having received both the biggest pretax raises and the biggest tax cuts. Plus, there is no evidence that a modestly higher rate would hurt the economy. The recent president with the strongest economic record, Bill Clinton, increased the rate, while the one with the weakest economic record, George W. Bush, cut it.", "This week, President Trump and Congress will turn their attention to tax policy. After the failure of their health care bill, they are desperate for a legislative win and hope to pass a bill by year\u2019s end.

What we did was read books that raised serious questions about the human condition, and which invited us to attempt to ask serious questions of our own. Education, in this sense, wasn\u2019t a \u201cteaching\u201d with any fixed lesson. It was an exercise in interrogation.", "To listen and understand; to question and disagree; to treat no proposition as sacred and no objection as impious; to be willing to entertain unpopular ideas and cultivate the habits of an open mind \u2014 this is what I was encouraged to do by my teachers at the University of Chicago.", "It\u2019s what used to be called a liberal education.", "The University of Chicago showed us something else: that every great idea is really just a spectacular disagreement with some other great idea.", "Socrates quarrels with Homer.

On the contrary, the disagreements arise from perfect comprehension; from having chewed over the ideas of your intellectual opponent so thoroughly that you can properly spit them out.", "In other words, to disagree well you must first understand well. You have to read deeply, listen carefully, watch closely. You need to grant your adversary moral respect; give him the intellectual benefit of doubt; have sympathy for his motives and participate empathically with his line of reasoning. And you need to allow for the possibility that you might yet be persuaded of what he has to say.", "\u201cThe Closing of the American Mind\u201d took its place in the tradition of these quarrels.

What\u2019s clear is that the mis-education begins early. I was raised on the old-fashioned view that sticks and stones could break my bones but words would never hurt me.

This is the age of protected feelings purchased at the cost of permanent infantilization.", "The mis-education continues in grade school. As the Brookings findings indicate, younger Americans seem to have no grasp of what our First Amendment says, much less of the kind of speech it protects. This is a testimony to the collapse of civics education in the United States, creating the conditions that make young people uniquely susceptible to demagogy of the left- or right-wing varieties.", "Then we get to college, where the dominant mode of politics is identity politics, and in which the primary test of an argument isn\u2019t the quality of the thinking but the cultural, racial, or sexual standing of the person making it. As a woman of color I think X. As a gay man I think Y. As a person of privilege I apologize for Z. This is the baroque way Americans often speak these days. It is a way of replacing individual thought \u2014 with all the effort that actual thinking requires \u2014 with social identification \u2014 with all the attitude that attitudinizing requires.", "In recent years, identity politics have become the moated castles from which we safeguard our feelings from hurt and our opinions from challenge. It is our \u201csafe space.\u201d But it is a safe space of a uniquely pernicious kind \u2014 a safe space from thought, rather than a safe space for thought, to borrow a line I recently heard from Salman Rushdie.", "Another consequence of identity politics is that it has made the distance between making an argument and causing offense terrifyingly short. Any argument that can be cast as insensitive or offensive to a given group of people isn\u2019t treated as being merely wrong. Instead it is seen as immoral, and therefore unworthy of discussion or rebuttal.", "The result is that the disagreements we need to have \u2014 and to have vigorously \u2014 are banished from the public square before they\u2019re settled. People who might otherwise join a conversation to see where it might lead them choose instead to shrink from it, lest they say the \u201cwrong\u201d thing and be accused of some kind of political -ism or -phobia. For fear of causing offense, they forego the opportunity to be persuaded.", "Take the arguments over same-sex marriage, which you are now debating in Australia. My own views in favor of same-sex marriage are well known, and I hope the Yes\u2019s wins by a convincing margin.", "But if I had to guess, I suspect the No\u2019s will exceed whatever they are currently polling. That\u2019s because the case for same-sex marriage is too often advanced not by reason, but merely by branding every opponent of it as a \u201cbigot\u201d \u2014 just because they are sticking to an opinion that was shared across the entire political spectrum only a few years ago. Few people like outing themselves as someone\u2019s idea of a bigot, so they keep their opinions to themselves even when speaking to pollsters. That\u2019s just what happened last year in the Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential election, and look where we are now.", "If you want to make a winning argument for same-sex marriage, particularly against conservative opponents, make it on a conservative foundation: As a matter of individual freedom, and as an avenue toward moral responsibility and social respectability. The No\u2019s will have a hard time arguing with that. But if you call them morons and Neanderthals, all you\u2019ll get in return is their middle finger or their clenched fist.", "One final point about identity politics: It\u2019s a game at which two can play.

On second thought, this isn\u2019t the whole truth.", "Yes, we disagree constantly. But what makes our disagreements so toxic is that we refuse to make eye contact with our opponents, or try to see things as they might, or find some middle ground.", "Instead, we fight each other from the safe distance of our separate islands of ideology and identity and listen intently to echoes of ourselves.

They can also have great food and lousy government, as France has always demonstrated.", "But no country can have good government, or a healthy public square, without high-quality journalism \u2014 journalism that can distinguish a fact from a belief and again from an opinion; that understands that the purpose of opinion isn\u2019t to depart from facts but to use them as a bridge to a larger idea called \u201ctruth\u201d; and that appreciates that truth is a large enough destination that, like Manhattan, it can be reached by many bridges of radically different designs. In other words, journalism that is grounded in facts while abounding in disagreements.", "I believe it is still possible \u2014 and all the more necessary \u2014 for journalism to perform these functions, especially as the other institutions that were meant to do so have fallen short.

Though it was equipped with a suction cup or a parallel gripper \u2014 a kind of two-fingered hand \u2014 it could reliably handle only so many items. And it could not switch between the cup and the gripper on the fly. But the techniques used to train it represented a fundamental shift in robotics research, a shift that could overhaul not just Amazon\u2019s warehouses but entire industries.", "Rather than trying to program behavior into their robot \u2014 a painstaking task \u2014 Mr. Mahler and his team gave it a way of learning tasks on its own. Researchers at places like Northeastern University, Carnegie Mellon University, Google and OpenAI \u2014 the artificial intelligence lab founded by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk \u2014 are developing similar techniques, and many believe that such machine learning will ultimately allow robots to master a much wider array of tasks, including manufacturing.", "\u201cThis can extend to tasks of assembly and more complex operations,\u201d said Juan Aparicio, head of advanced manufacturing automation at the German industrial giant Siemens, which is helping to fund the research at Berkeley. \u201cThat is the road map.\u201d", "Physically, the Berkeley robot was nothing new. Mr. Mahler and his team were using existing hardware, including two robotic arms from the Swiss multinational ABB and a camera that captured depth.", "What was different was the software. It demonstrated a new use for what are called neural networks. Loosely based on the network of neurons in the human brain, a neural network is a complex algorithm that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By looking for patterns in thousands of dog photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog.", "Over the past five years, these algorithms have radically changed the way the internet\u2019s largest companies build their online services, accelerating the development of everything from image and speech recognition to internet search. But they can also accelerate the development of robotics.", "The Berkeley team began by scouring the internet for CAD models, short for computer-aided design. These are digital representations of physical objects. Engineers, physicists and designers build them when running experiments or creating new products. Using these models, Mr. Mahler and his team generated many more digital objects, eventually building a database of more than seven million items. Then they simulated the physics of each item, showing the precise point where a robotic arm should pick it up.", "That was a large task, but the process was mostly automated. When the team fed these models into a neural network, it learned to identify a similar point on potentially any digital object with any shape. And when the team plugged this neural network into the two-armed robot, it could do the same with physical objects.", "When facing a single everyday object with cylindrical or at least partly planar surfaces \u2014 like a spatula, a stapler, a cylindrical container of Froot Loops or even a tube of toothpaste \u2014 it could typically pick it up, with success rates often above 90 percent. But percentages dropped with more complex shapes, like the toy shark.", "What\u2019s more, when the team built simulated piles of random objects and fed those into the neural network, it could learn to lift items from physical piles, too. Researchers at Brown University and Northeastern are exploring similar research, and the hope is that this kind of work can be combined with other methods.", "Like Siemens and the Toyota Research Institute, Amazon is helping to fund the work at Berkeley, and it has an acute need for this kind of robot. For the past three years, the company has run a contest in which researchers seek to solve the \u201cpick and place\u201d problem. But the promise of machine-learning methods like the one used at Berkeley is that they can eventually extend to so many other areas, including manufacturing and home robotics.", "\u201cPicking an object up is the first thing you want a manipulator robot to do,\u201d said Stefanie Tellex, a professor at Brown. \u201cA lot of more sophisticated behavior begins with that. If you can\u2019t pick it up, game over.\u201d", "The research demonstrated how a task learned in the digital world can be transferred to the physical. Since the camera on Berkeley\u2019s robot could see depth, it captured three-dimensional images that were not unlike the CAD models the team uses to train its neural network.", "Other researchers are developing ways for robots to learn directly from physical experience. For example, at Google, using an algorithmic technique called reinforcement learning, robots are training themselves to open doors through extreme trial and error. But this kind of physical training is both time consuming and expensive. Digital training is more efficient.", "For this reason, some organizations are hoping to train robots using complex virtual worlds \u2014 digital recreations of our physical environment. If a system can train itself to navigate a car racing game like Grand Theft Auto, the thinking goes, it can navigate real roads.", "This is still largely theory.

Facebook gives rich and instant feedback to advertisers, allowing them to quickly tailor ads to improve outcomes or customize messages even more. There is nothing mysterious or untoward about the system itself, as long as it\u2019s being used for commerce instead of politics. What\u2019s alarming is that Facebook executives don\u2019t seem to grasp, or appreciate, the difference.", "A core principle in political advertising is transparency \u2014 political ads are supposed to be easily visible to everyone, and everyone is supposed to understand that they are political ads, and where they come from.

Moreover, in the case of federal campaigns in the United States, the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act requires candidates to state they approve of an ad and thus take responsibility for its content.", "None of that transparency matters to Facebook. Ads on the site meant for, say, 20- to 30-year-old home-owning Latino men in Northern Virginia would not be viewed by anyone else, and would run only briefly before vanishing. The potential for abuse is vast. An ad could falsely accuse a candidate of the worst malfeasance a day before Election Day, and the victim would have no way of even knowing it happened. Ads could stoke ethnic hatred and no one could prepare or respond before serious harm occurs.", "Unfortunately, the range of potential responses to this problem is limited. The First Amendment grants broad protections to publishers like Facebook. Diplomacy, even the harsh kind, has failed to dissuade Russia from meddling.

Photography is now the main way we communicate about restaurant cooking. As a word guy I hate to say this, but it\u2019s true.", "I wrote an essay about this a few years ago, when the outlines of the new world were just coming into view, and it\u2019s much more clear now. At the time, restaurant designers were just starting to think about lighting the dining room so people could take better pictures for Instagram. Now they talk openly about it, and you see it everywhere. It\u2019s the thing that killed off the last trend in lighting, those amber-colored dangling Edison bulbs.", "Now everybody is installing pin spots in the ceiling pointing straight down at the table, which is why you see all these very sharp and high-contrast pictures of plates on Instagram. The restaurants are doing this because it\u2019s largely free marketing. (Some Instagrammers are so popular that restaurants will invite them in for a comped meal, so it\u2019s not entirely free.) I was told that one major restaurant publicity firm in New York has a full-time employee who does nothing but help restaurants with Instagram.", "This solves one of the main problems that restaurants used to have in the days when \u201cold\u201d media was the only game in town: How do you keep people talking about your place after the initial buzz dies down?", "Besides the marketing, there are creative implications. For one thing, chefs are much more focused now on sending out food that photographs well. So I end up eating a lot of flowers and leaves that don\u2019t really taste like much but make the plate more colorful, because most cooked food is brown. Ditto all the boards and slates and rocks that are being asked to stand in for plates.", "It has also sped up the rate at which ideas about food travel from one place to another.

I used to be really self-conscious when I took out my phone; I\u2019d run to the restroom and take surreptitious notes in the stall. Now I just snap away all night long, and I look like everybody else. And photography is the first stage of my note-taking now.

The hard part is extracting it from all the useless stuff, which is what most people in food media see when they look at Yelp.", "The basic problem is that Yelp was built to reward frequent posting rather than knowledge or insight or expertise. And yet there are people on Yelp who know a lot about food and eat around and have a pretty solid basis for comparison. I find that Yelp is most useful with Korean, Chinese and Japanese food, because, for a number of reasons, there tend to be a lot of Yelpers who know those cuisines pretty well.", "How do you feel about delivery apps like Instacart, Caviar or UberEats? Do you use them much?", "I don\u2019t. I almost never eat at home, and when I do, I want to cook. I did use Caviar in the context of a restaurant review a few weeks ago and was pretty happy with how well it worked.", "Sites like Yelp give people plenty of information about restaurants. Yet many restaurants still have their own websites. Is this necessary?", "The most valuable thing a restaurant can do on its website is post the current menu and drinks lists, with prices. All the other data you might want, and there\u2019s not really very much, can be served up much more efficiently by Google, although I still think website designers who don\u2019t put the restaurant\u2019s address and phone number and hours right on the home page should be sued for malpractice.", "As our food critic, you have to stay unrecognized when you try new restaurants. How do you do that in an era that demands us to sacrifice privacy on the internet?", "This isn\u2019t a major issue. People are always surprised when I say that, but it\u2019s one of the things that has been least affected by technology.", "Before we had digital photographs, restaurants would get their hands on some old head shot of the critic from a book jacket or something \u2014 Ruth Reichl, William Grimes and Frank Bruni had all written books before they were restaurant critics \u2014 and then photocopy it and share it with all their friends in the business.

Whatever this might tell us, it did not signal to the mayor that there was any need to feel embarrassed or inadequately fussed over.

So why has the economic expansion since the recession been so tame, with sluggish productivity and, at least until recently, anemic wage growth?", "Economists say the answer, to some degree, can be found in a start-up slump \u2014 a decline in the creation of new businesses \u2014 and a growing understanding of what\u2019s behind it.", "A total of 414,000 businesses were formed in 2015, the latest year surveyed, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. It was a slight increase from the previous year, but well below the 558,000 companies given birth in 2006, the year before the recession set in.", "\u201cWe\u2019re still in a start-up funk,\u201d said Robert Litan, an economist and antitrust lawyer who has studied the issue. \u201cObviously the recession had a lot to do with it, but then you\u2019re left with the conundrum: Why hasn\u2019t there been any recovery?\u201d", "Many economists say the answer could lie in the rising power of the biggest corporations, which they argue is stifling entrepreneurship by making it easier for incumbent businesses to swat away challengers \u2014 or else to swallow them before they become a serious threat.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve got rising market power,\u201d said Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cIn general, that makes it hard for new businesses to compete with incumbents. Market power is the story that explains everything.\u201d", "That argument comes at a potent political moment. Populists on both the left and right have responded to growing public unease about the corporate giants that increasingly dominate their online and offline lives. Polling data from Gallup and other organizations shows a long-running decline in confidence in banks and other big businesses \u2014 a concern not likely to abate after high-profile data breaches at Equifax and other companies.", "The start-up slump has far-reaching implications. Small businesses in general are often cited as an exemplar of economic dynamism. But it is start-ups \u2014 and particularly the small subset of companies that grow quickly \u2014 that are key drivers of job creation and innovation, and have historically been a ladder into the middle class for less-educated workers and immigrants.", "Perhaps most significant, start-ups play a critical role in making the economy as a whole more productive, as they invent new products and approaches, forcing existing businesses to compete or fall by the wayside.", "\u201cAcross the decades, young companies are really the heavy hitters and the consistent hitters in terms of job creation,\u201d said Arnobio Morelix, an economist at the Kauffman Foundation, a nonprofit in Kansas City, Mo., that studies and promotes entrepreneurship.", "The start-up decline might defy expectations in the age of Uber and \u201cShark Tank.\u201d But however counterintuitive, the trend is backed by multiple data sources and numerous economic studies.", "In 1980, according to the Census Bureau data, roughly one in eight companies had been founded in the past year; by 2015, that ratio had fallen to fewer than one in 12. The downward trend cuts across regions and industries and, at least since 2000, includes even the beating heart of American entrepreneurship, high tech.", "Although the overall slump dates back more than 30 years, economists are most concerned about a more recent trend. In the 1980s and 1990s, the entrepreneurial slowdown was concentrated in sectors such as retail, where corner stores and regional brands were being subsumed by national chains. That trend, though often painful for local communities, wasn\u2019t necessarily a drag on productivity more generally.", "Since about 2000, however, the slowdown has spread to parts of the economy more often associated with high-growth entrepreneurship, including the technology sector. That decline has coincided with a period of weak productivity growth in the United States as a whole, a trend that has in turn been implicated in the patterns of fitful wage gains and sluggish economic growth since the recession. Recent research has suggested that the decline in entrepreneurship, and in other measures of business dynamism, is one cause of the prolonged stagnation in productivity.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of pieces now that say dynamism has gone down a lot since 2000,\u201d said John Haltiwanger, a University of Maryland economist who has done much of the pioneering work in the field. \u201cStart-ups have gone down a lot since 2000, especially in the high-tech sectors, and there are increasingly strong links to productivity.\u201d", "What is behind the decline in entrepreneurship is less clear. Economists and other experts have pointed to a range of possible explanations: The aging of the baby-boom generation has left fewer Americans in their prime business-starting years. The decline of community banks and the collapse of the market for home-equity loans may have made it harder for would-be entrepreneurs to get access to capital. Increased regulation, at both the state and federal levels, may be particularly burdensome for new businesses that lack well-staffed compliance departments. Those and other factors could well play a role, but none can fully explain the decline.", "More recently, economists \u2014 especially but not exclusively on the left \u2014 have begun pointing the finger at big business, and in particular at the handful of companies that increasingly dominate many industries.", "The evidence is largely circumstantial: The slump in entrepreneurship has coincided with a period of increasing concentration in nearly every major industry. Research from Mr. Haltiwanger and several co-authors has found that the most productive companies are growing more slowly than in the past, a hint that competitive pressures aren\u2019t forcing companies to react as quickly to new innovations.", "A recent working paper from economists at Princeton and University College London found that American companies are increasingly able to demand prices well above their costs \u2014 which according to standard economic theory would lead new companies to enter the market. Yet that isn\u2019t happening.", "\u201cIf we\u2019re in an era of excessive profits, in competitive markets we would see record firm entry, but we see the opposite,\u201d said Ian Hathaway, an economist who has studied the issue. That, Mr. Hathaway said, suggests that the market is not truly competitive \u2014 that existing companies have found ways to block competitors.", "Experts also point to anecdotal examples that suggest that the rise of big businesses could be squelching competition. YouTube, Instagram and hundreds of lower-profile start-ups chose to sell out to industry heavyweights like Google and Facebook rather than try to take them on directly. The tech giants have likewise been accused of using the power of their platforms to favor their own offerings over those of competitors.", "Most recently, Amazon openly called for a bidding war among cities for its second headquarters \u2014 hardly the kind of demand a new start-up could make. Mr. Morelix said the Amazon example was particularly striking.", "\u201cWe\u2019re saying that it\u2019s O.K. that they shape how a city charges taxes?\u201d Mr. Morelix said. \u201cAnd what kind of regulations they have?

Please listen to the corresponding audio before quoting from it.", "JW: I\u2019m Jenna Wortham.", "WM: I\u2019m Wesley Morris. We\u2019re two culture writers at The New York Times.", "JW: I mostly write about how humans relate to technology.", "WM: And I mostly write about how popular culture relates to humans.", "JW: This is Still Processing. Welcome back to our show, our pop-culture confession booth.", "WM: Hi.", "JW: So, Mr. Morris, what is on your mind this week?", "WM: Walter Becker died about two weeks ago. He was half of Steely Dan, a group that I thought was two old black dudes my whole life \u2014 or not my whole life, sorry, my entire adolescence. My father had to have a very comical but what for him was an annoyingly, unnecessarily difficult conversation with me.", "JW: This was pre-Google.", "WM: They weren\u2019t an MTV act either, but my dad had Steely Dan records. So, I\u2019m still listening to women and the albums they\u2019ve made, and so I was sort of torn about whether to interrupt what I was pleasurably doing to listen to some Steely Dan, and I did that. I listened to \u201cAja,\u201d which was one of their bigger albums. And one of the most famous songs from that record and one of their most famous songs if you\u2019re a hip-hop fan is, of course, \u201cPeg,\u201d which we should play a little bit of right now. We\u2019ll just play, we\u2019ll just go right into the chorus.PEG, STEELY DAN", "WM: I didn\u2019t understand race as a kid. Nobody, no kid understands race. I just thought all the keyboards on this record sounded black. They kind of sang pretty well. Anyway, Walter Becker, you were a music genius. Rest in peace, my friend.", "JW: Okay, and ... what else you got?", "WM: I\u2019m really proud of our co-worker and pal, Nikole Hannah-Jones. I wish that somebody would find a way to put her out of business and give her something else to write about, but racism and education seems to persist, nonetheless. So, she had this story about the resegregation of this county in Alabama. It\u2019s really just devastating, mostly because just reading it, you understand just how much states can have been trying through racism to not integrate the schools, and to keep black people and Latinos from having an equal and fair education.", "JW: Right. It\u2019s exposing something that most people probably thought fundamentally we moved away from, just equal access to education. It\u2019s tragic.", "WM: More bad news is on my brain, because how can it not be? The weather ... the hurricane.", "JW: It\u2019s so distressing.", "WM: Destroying islands in the Caribbean, wrecking havoc on the South. ...", "JW: I know. I was like, name a city in the South. Name a coastal state.", "WM: It\u2019s just really terrible, and I feel \u2014 my heart goes out to everyone who has known someone who has lost a life, who has lost a home, who can\u2019t find people. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s really sad. We\u2019re thinking about you, everybody. Like we said last week, it\u2019s still true this week. Anyway. What\u2019s going on with you? You have any happy news?", "JW: Oh, yeah. I have a really good piece of news. Want to hear it?", "WM: Yes, please.", "JW: So, I finally got prescription sunglasses. I don\u2019t know why it took me so long. I have been waiting my whole life for this miracle. You know I love the sun.", "WM: I know.", "JW: You know I love the beach. And normally, what happens is I don\u2019t have my proper eyes on, I just have like a pair of Forever 21 glasses on. And, you know, people get miffed because they\u2019re waving at me, I can\u2019t even see the motion of their hands. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. There have been so many times I\u2019ve been out in the park and I don\u2019t realize someone\u2019s trying to talk to me until they\u2019re right up on top of me, and then I\u2019m like, Oh, I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s really a problem. It\u2019s a problem. So, I finally invested. I got a cool pair of shades. I wore them all weekend. I was so happy to not bump into things. I could recognize people on the street when I saw them. Quality of life is now at 100, so. You\u2019ve been telling me to watch this television show called \u201cClaws\u201d for many moons now. I finally binge-watched all of it the last couple of days and ... I loved it. It\u2019s like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d meets \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d meets \u201cSteel Magnolias.\u201d It\u2019s about a bunch of women \u2014 I mean, they make that joke themselves about something else on the show \u2014 but it\u2019s about a bunch of women who work in a nail salon in South Florida, and they get caught up in some petty crime. Niecy Nash is in it, she\u2019s incredible. Dee Norris, who was actually on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d is like a bisexual crime lord. The only thing that\u2019s weird about the show is that there\u2019s a character on the show named Virginia, who is Vietnamese, and her ethnicity is a running punch line. She\u2019s played by Karrueche Tran, who is a makeup artist and kind of became an insta-celebrity after that for different reasons. I don\u2019t like those jokes, and I don\u2019t know. ... We need to talk about it at some point.", "WM: This is like, what? Our fourth week of talking about Asian racism, or racism against Asians. There\u2019s always a fight over what the last acceptable form of racism is, and in this race to the bottom \u2014 I mean \u201cacceptable\u201d meaning what shows can get away with without huge protests. For whatever reason, there\u2019s a lot of racism against Asian people that is just in our culture that we don\u2019t really examine. Often because, I think, it comes from nonwhite people and is therefore less \u2014 what? Contested?", "JW: Right. But the show, overall, if you can get past that, is excellent. Maybe they\u2019ll do better for Season 2, because it was renewed. O.K. A little birdie told me about Rihanna\u2019s beauty launch last week.", "WM: Tweet, tweet, tweet, right here!", "JW: I\u2019m not too proud to admit that the invitation didn\u2019t come directly to me, but it came through one Mr. Wesley Robert Morris. Thank you very much for making my birthday dreams true early. We saw, we experienced, we smelled even Rihanna, because she was that close to me that I could tell you precisely from head to toe what she smells like. Cotton candy and hormones. She was everything. Everything. Capital E, capital T. So, I\u2019m not someone who gets very starstruck. I mean, partially because I\u2019m a journalist, but also, I\u2019m just not a hype beast. Like, I don\u2019t like to be the one who can\u2019t keep their [expletive] together when, you know what I mean? Like, some celebrity swans through the room. I don\u2019t like that anyway, and I did keep my composure at this event, but I was shocked to learn that even I was not immune to the privilege and the access and the exclusivity of being at that event. I tweeted it, I Instagrammed it, I storied it, I told everybody in my life about it. And watching myself transform into that monster instantaneously was a little distressing.", "WM: You weren\u2019t quite monstrous.", "JW: Um ... but I did transform into a gremlin, and I, you know, I\u2019m still thinking about that. Still thinking about that, what happened. How the water got on my fur.", "WM: Fenty Beauty is not the only thing we did last week.", "JW: Very true. Very, very true.", "WM: We didn\u2019t go to the U.S. Open together, but we were there the same night, and we watched some tennis not together. But together, because you kept texting me about how stressed out you were. Venus Williams played that night, she beat Petra Kvitov\u00e1, and we were talking about how much this woman means to both of us, and to many, many other people, and she just had the best year of her professional tennis life in almost a decade. It\u2019d be great to talk about what you learned and what you have learned watching her play \u2014 and lose. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about today.", "JW: Yes.", "WM: These two women.", "JW: Venus and Rihanna.", "WM: Rihanna\u2019s win, her Fenty Beauty win. Her win over like, a whole aspect of consumer culture. And Venus\u2019s many, many wins, and her ultimate loss and what we take away from that, what the experience of watching her win and lose is like, especially at this point in her career.", "JW: Alright, stay tuned. Last week, we arrived \u2014 I arrived by car, you arrived by foot. I had to go in separate from you, because I was like, I cannot be late to this event. Anyway, so we arrive at a warehouse \u2014\u2014", "WM: You were so steamed.", "JW: Honey. I was like, if you make me miss Robin Fenty because you decide to walk from your house to Brooklyn Navy Yard, uh-uh. I knew, I was just like, We will not be friends anymore, so let me just go ahead. But basically, we arrive at this warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it\u2019s the middle of Fashion Week, which means empty lots, empty warehouses, random parks or whatever get transformed into runway shows of different kinds. And it\u2019s all very exciting, it\u2019s all very fun. You never know who is going to show up. People come dressed up. It\u2019s very fun. We arrive, Rihanna\u2019s launching her new beauty line called Fenty Beauty. Everybody\u2019s excited because it\u2019s supposed to have like, the most number of complexion, like, different foundations and products for the largest number of complexions on the market. Whatever. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. But people were very excited for this event. People get excited for anything Rihanna does in general, so.", "WM: Well, she\u2019s one of the few people, one of the few pop stars to manage to somewhat instantly have a successful fashion imprint.", "JW: Well, she feels like she has a vision.", "WM: Right.", "JW: What\u2019s remarkable about the space is not how it has been transformed, which is, like, into a spaceship, more or less, for this product launch, but it\u2019s that everyone in the room is done up head to toe, but they\u2019re also starring in their own \u201cLive From Fenty Beauty\u201d show that\u2019s ongoing. So, you have all these people with selfie sticks, they\u2019re doing a long-armed selfie hold. People are shooting each other, they\u2019re shooting the napkins that say Fenty Beauty \u2014 which I took a stack of, which I\u2019m not embarrassed to admit, because I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know what came over me! I couldn\u2019t help myself.", "WM: You were ... you had no shame.", "JW: Listen.", "WM: It was so adorable.", "JW: I was freaking out. But anyway, the point is, I have not seen ... I know how the beauty world works. I know that there are beauty bloggers. I know that people cover beauty events. I know that people write up product launches. They review them, and I get it. Makeup Instagram is like a whole world unto itself. But I did not realize the degree to which the launch of a makeup line by someone like Rihanna really also rests on the amplification of \u2014 dozens, hundreds? How many people were there? Of those people, you know, Snapchatting and Instragramming and uploading to Facebook and tweeting about this event, also. But it makes total sense. I mean, everything that I buy pretty much is couched within the context of social media. If I see a cute pair of pants on Instagram, I\u2019m probably going to ask that person where they got them. I don\u2019t go to stores to shop. I don\u2019t like stores.", "WM: This is why brick-and-mortar retail is in the toilet, by the way.", "JW: It is, though. But it is. But I mean, pretty much all the things I\u2019m interested in buying or wearing or doing \u2014 and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m copycatting looks, but it\u2019ll be like, a particular shade of a blue. And I\u2019m like, Oh, I like that color blue on that skin tone. I should maybe think about wearing baby blue, too. I get all my fashion pretty much through social media, on people that I know of or trust.", "WM: So, you now have these video mannequins basically who you can also kind of call your friend.", "JW: I mean, at the thing itself, so we\u2019re looking at all these video screens, a woman comes out, makes a speech, then Rihanna comes out, makes a speech, and then Rihanna proceeds to swan around the whole event.", "WM: The minute she was done speaking and the screens had gone up, everybody flipped their phone around and began to say, you know, things like, \u201cI\u2019m going to go try on this base.\u201d", "JW: Highlighter, I\u2019ve got to try the primer. I\u2019ve got to try the gloss. And at the stations themselves where you could go try on these products and they had the vanity setups, but they actually had cell phone stands in them. So you could put your phone in the stand \u2014", "WM: Shut up.", "JW: Did you not see this?", "WM: I did not notice that.", "JW: Oh, yeah. They had directly next to the vanity \u2014 I was turning into a Tasmanian devil \u2014 but they had the little stands so you could put your phone in the thing, press with one finger to record and do your makeup, and talk into the camera. It was unbelievable. But I was doing some research last night, and there was a business and fashion article that said according to a recent report from Google, 64 percent of women shop this way today. Via influencers! Like, people who talk about the clothing, accessories that they want and wear them online in their social media. So, you have this entire climate. It\u2019s Fashion Week. You have this entire climate where people who are popular online, who have built these kinds of followings online all the sudden are getting priority seating at fashion shows. All of the sudden, they\u2019re getting priority access to new items of clothing or makeup products, like Fenty Beauty. And I have to say too, you know, I did watch all the outtakes and footage from Rihanna\u2019s Puma fashion show via social media. I wasn\u2019t interested in what Vogue thought of her show. No, I wanted to see what my friends, who were sitting front row at the show, had to say. What looks they zoomed in on. I\u2019m way more interested in what they think versus what an anonymous person at Vogue thinks.", "WM: I wonder if this is partially a technological-innovation milestone, right? Where you have the ability now to whip out your phone, create content that is qualitative, evaluative of a particular product. Or whether it\u2019s the result \u2014 whether the development is the result of the way fashion media and the fashion industry has tended to fetishize and dollarize and romanticize and favor particular looks, to exclude lots and lots of body types and people from its pages, from its worldview.", "JW: And this is the upside of social media, right, like it allows anyone to become an entrepreneur, in theory. It allows anyone to build a following. And this is something I spend a ton of time writing about and a ton of time thinking about, because I love new economies that aren\u2019t beholden to the old gatekeepers. I love new types of jobs that exist. I think it\u2019s ... phenomenal that if you are a young person \u2014 or not even that young, but you\u2019re just someone who has an aesthetic for how you want to present yourself online, and you can get thousands, millions of people to follow you, and then in turn, you get paid just because you\u2019re such a dynamic presence, people want to follow you and they want to find out what you\u2019re into ... that\u2019s amazing. I mean, it sounds exhausting, but it\u2019s also amazing, because it\u2019s the same \u2014 it\u2019s a way around these same barriers of access and barriers of entry that you\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s why there hasn\u2019t been beauty products that complement my skin tone, or shaving products that work with your skin type.", "WM: But what do the Anna Wintours take from this disruption? Do they see Rihanna and roll their eyes, or do they see Rihanna and try to get on board? Not just with her celebrity but now, her power as a businesswoman.", "JW: Yeah, well, I think the Vogues of the world still love the Rihannas of the world, but I think the Vogues of the world\u2014\u2014", "WM: But do they love the women Rihanna love?", "JW: I mean, if you\u2019re talking about in terms of coverage, I think we have started to see mainstream fashion sites and beauty sites start to be more inclusive to women of color, because they have to. They know they have to, if not only because of maybe the advertising dollars or digital traffic or ad revenue, IDK, because it\u2019s not a good look to be like, We only speak to white women. You\u2019re just going to get called out on social media. So, I think that\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s been a shift towards more inclusiveness. But I also think the traditional sites across the board are feeling frustrated by the lack of exclusivity that they have. I mean, Rihanna\u2019s always going to do a Vogue cover. But you know, if you\u2019re some really hot collection designer, you might give your pieces to a really young, hot Instagrammer instead, and not an editor at a fashion site. You might bring that person, because you\u2019re like, Well, they\u2019re actually reaching more of the people that I want to reach, and people that are going to be more inclined to buy my products, the people that are directly tapped into them.", "WM: But I have to ask this, this all sounds great in some ways, but what\u2019s the human downside to this?", "JW: Yo, like everything else about the internet, human cost can be real expensive. I mean, I think anecdotally speaking, some of the influencers I\u2019ve talked to, this rules their entire lives, and I think also, they ... they work all the time, because they always have to make content. And if you think about how quickly we scroll through our social media feeds, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not a commercial that takes weeks to produce and then you watch it for 30 seconds. This is something that takes hours to produce and then you look at it and digest it and move on in a second. I mean, the beast is always hungry, and it\u2019s always asking for more. And you know, there was a woman at the Rihanna show we spoke with who was like, It\u2019s really difficult, especially during Fashion Week because, I\u2019ve got two children, and they\u2019re part of this, too. But also, I never get to spend time with them, and I don\u2019t want them to remember that Mommy always had her phone in front of her face, because you\u2019re always checking to see what\u2019s going on or what are the new offers.", "WM: But at the same time, the same person, like her child was part of her thing.", "JW: She made her child part of thing too, which is, I mean, I don\u2019t know. I follow her now, and I\u2019m kind of into it. But I think the cost is high, and I think when you yourself become the thing that people are consuming, I think it\u2019s hard to anticipate how draining that is. And also what it does to your sense of self and your sense of privacy. I mean, people do make money, though. You can get paid like \u2014 I\u2019ve heard numbers as high as tens of thousands of dollars for a single post depending on who you are.", "WM: It\u2019s like a Gary Shteyngart novel. It is. It\u2019s \u201cSuper Sad True Love Story.\u201d", "JW: But here\u2019s my question for you. Like, I feel my brain being rewired.", "WM: It\u2019s a world in which everything is quantified by your interaction with it and people\u2019s approval of X, Y, or Z interaction.", "JW: Right. You\u2019re only as valuable as the content you create.", "WM: So all your behavior is motivated by technology.", "JW: The feedback loop.", "WM: He is a visionary, Gary Shteyngart. And it\u2019s funny, because that book, you just sort of felt like that\u2019s the future. And it was so strange to be at \u2014\u2014", "JW: Literally that narration of it.", "WM: Yeah, yeah.", "JW: But the difference between that book and reality, I would say, is that in the book, the protagonist has the wherewithal to be like, This is not normal. And no one else \u2014\u2014", "WM: But he\u2019s the only person who knows.", "JW: He\u2019s the only person in that world who knows. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true of this age that we\u2019re in. I think there\u2019s very much a tacit awareness and understanding of the economy that you\u2019re participating in. And what you\u2019re getting out of it, what you\u2019re extracting out of it. And this is the thing that I think people like about Rihanna a lot is that she\u2019s also very aware of her role in all of this too. Like she\u2019s not going to be Justin Bieber who is like, Please, please don\u2019t. Rihanna just won\u2019t show up. She won\u2019t show up in public if she doesn\u2019t want you to take her picture. but I think when she\u2019s there in that role, she really understands like, I\u2019m not a person. I\u2019m an avatar. I don\u2019t know. We could be more skeptical. I should be more skeptical about it. For me, it\u2019s mostly exciting until proven otherwise.", "WM: I think we have been plenty skeptical. I mean, my other question is like, what happens if all this stuff falls apart, you know? Like, you know about me and my great internet apocalypse. And I don\u2019t even know what that looks like, but I\u2019m always thinking about what happens when the equivalent of a Hurricane Irma or a Hurricane Harvey comes to the internet. And like who survives, who lives, who dies, and what models are viable enough to survive that? I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s a fair analogy, but I do wonder \u2014 I don\u2019t quite get the built on a house of cards feeling about quite this, but there\u2019s a lot that goes on in the way that we consume and create culture now that does feel to me, from a business model standpoint, to have a house of cards dimension to it.", "JW: Yeah. There\u2019s a degree of ephemerality and frailty that we\u2019re not looking at because we\u2019re too busy utilizing it. We\u2019re too busy maximizing it right now. I think that\u2019s real.", "WM: And the difference between now and before is there\u2019s so much more money to be made from that ephemeral relationship between a consumer or an allegedly critical consumer or a reviewer consumer and the corporate making the products themselves too. There\u2019s just, everything is bigger now.", "JW: Big social! One of our favorite phrases.", "WM: Big social!", "JW: Coming for ya.", "WM: It\u2019s back.", "JW: Well, we\u2019ll keep thinking about this, because it\u2019s clearly not going away, and I found it all to be tremendously exciting. I was mostly curious to observe myself get caught up in it, and what that said about me, and also what that says about how social media is ... you know those ants that get infected by spores in the rainforest and then climb up the trees? They go as far as they can and while they\u2019re climbing, the fungus is like, eating their brain, it\u2019s like telling them to go higher and higher, and they get to top, and they explode full of the spores that drift down to the bottom of the rainforest and infect everything else? And then those ants climb back up? You\u2019ve never heard about this?", "WM: No!", "JW: Oh, it\u2019s like a cool thing. You should google it. Like zombie ants and mushrooms should bring it up. But I was literally like that ant.", "WM: You were a zombie ant.", "JW: I got infected. The virus, you know, I touched infected blood supply, I guess.", "WM: Well, I guess we should talk about my zombie ant experience now. I have one, and her name is Venus Williams.", "JW: It sounds so grim. This is so exciting.", "WM: Well, it is until you think about what you\u2019re really doing. I\u2019m really climbing up a tree waiting to explode.", "JW: Well, on that cheerful note ... we\u2019ll take a break. We\u2019ll be right back.", "WM: We\u2019ll be right back.", "JW: I want to talk to you about the U.S. Open because I like tennis, but you love tennis. You told me that you think Venus Williams is your Billie Jean King. Yeah. The most important \u2014\u2014", "WM: Yeah. She\u2019s very important, and she\u2019s just about as important as Billie Jean King.", "JW: And I just want to talk to you about watching her at this point in her career, and you know, she lost the Open, eventually, ultimately, to Sloane. And in the press conference after, I was really moved by what she said when they were like, What\u2019s going to happen next with your career?", "VW: What do you mean?", "Reporter: What do you see in your near future?", "VW: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll continue to play tennis. It\u2019s nothing complicated.", "JW: She\u2019s amazing.", "WM: You know, the thing that has been very stressful \u2014 I should say first of all, that in addition to Venus Williams\u2019s being an incredibly important tennis player socially and politically, she fought to get equal prize money for the women at these major tournaments \u2014\u2014", "JW: Snaps to her.", "WM: And has been very quietly \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even, outspoken? To know Venus Williams is to know that a word like \u201coutspoken\u201d is not the right word. She has been judicious in her attempt to keep equality between the genders at these tournaments and to make sure that as much attention is paid to the women as to the men. We should say the crucial thing about why we\u2019re talking about her additionally is she\u2019s 37 years old.", "JW: Which was explained to me is ancient for tennis years. I don\u2019t know how this sport works.", "WM: She\u2019s the Mummy in tennis. I mean, there\u2019s only been one woman who has played, I mean, I mean, her sister now is close behind her. Serena is almost, I think she\u2019s 35 still. And she\u2019s going to come back to tennis next year after having had this baby a couple weeks ago.", "JW: And dominate. Completely dominate post \u2014", "WM: We\u2019ll see. But the exciting thing about Venus Williams now is she has this disease called Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome, which seemed like it was going to derail her career. She might never play again. And she decided to keep playing, and it\u2019s an autoimmune disease that has the power to sap your energy. And so it seemed very much like she would never play again, and if she was going to play, she would just be playing because that\u2019s what she\u2019s always done. And she wouldn\u2019t amount to much in these tournaments, and she would be there just rolling the dice. And for several years, that seemed to be the case. She was losing in the first round, in the second round, in the third round. Wasn\u2019t going very far. And this went on for a long time, and at some point, I think these sports writers were just like, Venus, girl, when are you going to give it up? You\u2019re not winning anything. And then about three years ago, something started to change, and she stopped expiring halfway through a match. You know, the disease, I think she just got control over it. She changed her diet, and she\u2019s figured out how to play great tennis with this disease. And then all of the sudden, she has, she had a really good 2016. She doesn\u2019t play enough tournaments to be at the top of the game just because of the way they factor the points. But basically, she plays enough tennis and if she wins a lot, she\u2019ll be well inside the Top 10. And 2017, she gets to the final of the Australian Open and loses to her sister. Loses somewhat inexplicably in the fourth round of the French Open. She gets to the final of Wimbledon, loses to, to ... Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza. And she almost gets to the final of the U.S. Open. For any other player, this an amazing year. For Venus Williams, who is 37 years old and battling this autoimmune disease, it\u2019s extraordinary. And so, you said to me the words that I never want to hear when talking about Venus Williams, which is, I want to talk about the things I\u2019ve learned in watching her lose. And like, I don\u2019t want to talk about her losing at all because it just depresses me. My mood just went south. Yours is up, mine is down. What do you got? What have you learned?", "JW: The night I saw Venus play at the Open against \u2014\u2014", "WM: Ugh, the Czech Republic\u2019s Petra Kvitov\u00e1, who \u2014 she and Venus have played some great matches together.", "JW: I\u2019m going to gesture to you a lot because I don\u2019t know any of the tennis terminology. But you know, she played the first set and she did very well. The second set comes around, Venus is clearly fatigued. You\u2019ve mentioned she has this autoimmune disease, I looked up some of the symptoms. Causes joint pain, it goes extreme feelings of being tired. Um, she was lagging. She was run down. I got so stressed out. She was the lead server or whatever and wasn\u2019t able to get the points?", "WM: They traded breaks a couple times in that third set.", "JW: The point was, she wasn\u2019t making contact with the ball as much as she should have been considering her advantage on the court. So, I took the opportunity to relieve myself of that encounter, and I just went out to get my commemorative cup because I was like, I cannot take this tension. I was extraordinarily stressed out. But you know, I was watching from the TVs while I was getting my commemorative cup and then I came back, and you know, she seemed so deliberate. And I watched Kvitov\u00e1 work really hard to beat Venus Williams, and Venus looked unbothered. She looked unflapped, you know.", "WM: But she always, and she always looks that way. You have no idea whether she\u2019s up or down in a match based on her body language and facial expression.", "JW: But there was something about the way she came back on the third set. She had a lot more confidence. She had a lot more ... pep in her step, and she just looked like she knew she was going to win. So just, so basically like, as a black woman in America, I am very attuned to how other black women in America move in spaces where they are and have been the only one for the majority of their lives and their careers. I love watching how Venus chooses to operate. I love watching how she tries to be in press conferences, which she doesn\u2019t really take the bait. She answers what she wants to say. You know, she says what she wants to say, she doesn\u2019t respond to the things they try to get out of her about other people. I love watching how Serena moves \u2014 she has so little cares. You know, the cares, I would use another word, but it\u2019ll get bleeped, so I won\u2019t, but she has so few cares about what other people think about her. They\u2019re on back order. We don\u2019t know when the store is going to be back in supply. Serena just lives for herself, and they both take two very different approaches to being these public figures, and I take notes from both of them. And I think what I learned from Venus was that, you know, she was very willing to bide her time. She was very willing to make concessions so that she could ultimately come to victory. I mean, she couldn\u2019t get there in the end, but conservation of energy, conservation of resources. Strategic losing is never, it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ve ever thought about doing in my life, but watching her do it, I was like, yo, she really knows some things.", "WM: So you think that \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re not saying she tanked that second set, but \u2014", "JW: No, I think she was making a decision about what her body could do and what it would mean for the third portion of that.", "WM: This is fascinating. I never considered this.", "JW: I mean, I\u2019m speculating. I\u2019m not a mind reader. I don\u2019t have any insight into Venus Williams\u2019s game plan.", "WM: She has lost a lot of second sets, and I\u2019m not saying \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re not arguing that she\u2019s throwing the second set, because ultimately, she wins a lot of those three set matches. But there is something interesting about like, when she \u2014 we used to call it, like a lot of tennis people call it when a player does this going on a walk. You just go on a walk for part of the match, and the match takes a little longer than you need it to. All great players do it, lesser players do it and lose and never become great because they\u2019re always on a walk. But you know, she is a walker. She can just disappear for a little while during a match. But since she got diagnosed with this disease, I have found that it\u2019s really crucial, and I think she knows it\u2019s crucial, but what was exciting to me is she played a lot of three set matches in this tournament, and \u2014", "JW: Are they always three sets? I\u2019m sorry, go on.", "WM: Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s the best of three. So, you know, obviously you want to get two sets so you can get off the court. But she played a lot of three sets. It didn\u2019t seem like what happened against Sloane Stephens in that semifinal was the result of being tired. It was the result of Sloane Stephens playing the four best games of tennis she\u2019s ever played in her life.", "JW: Yeah. She came with a mission.", "WM: With anybody else, Venus Williams would have won that match. When it was five all, she would have broken, served for the match, she\u2019d be in the final against Madison Keys. I have never seen a player do that to Venus Williams \u2014 get every ball Venus hit, no matter where Venus hit it, in like the most remote back of the court, in the corners, Sloane was there with an amazing shot. It wasn\u2019t just getting a racket on the ball. She was making shots on the dead run, and I\u2019ve never seen anybody play, maybe Serena\u2019s the only other person I\u2019ve seen play Venus quite that way. What happened to Venus in that match was, it wasn\u2019t physical fatigue, it was mental. Like, where on this court can I put this ball so this woman can\u2019t get it? And there was no place she could put it. And I think her will just...Sloane broke her will, like as much as she broke her serve.", "JW: Fascinating.", "WM: It was a fascinating match. But I\u2019m curious for you what the difference is between a Venus and a Serena and \u2014 I mean, obviously they\u2019re very different people, but there\u2019s something about the way Venus chooses to kind of be introverted versus Serena\u2019s...obvious extroversion. I mean, Venus isn\u2019t a hermit or anything. She\u2019s more mysterious to me than a lot of other women tennis players, a lot of tennis players in general. It\u2019s like she\u2019s holding onto something and she\u2019s not going to give it to us because it\u2019s hers. And I really respect that.", "JW: I respect that too. I learn a lot by watching how she moves. I mean, I think I\u2019m more aligned with Serena\u2019s style of approach in terms of how she wants to be in the world, which is you know, she doesn\u2019t want to have to adhere to someone else\u2019s ideas of how she should behave. And I mean, I\u2019ve seen Serena play a few times live, and when people boo her, oh my gosh. Like, I cry. It feels so personal. It feels so personal, because it feels like what they don\u2019t like about her is her unwillingness to be small. And Serena is never going to be small, and Venus isn\u2019t either, I should say \u2014", "WM: But it\u2019s just a different thing. It\u2019s a different energy.", "JW: Yeah, she\u2019s just a lot more inward. But at the same time, this is a woman who played, I think, in an outfit that she designed that looked fabulous. She was wearing enormous gold hoops that didn\u2019t slow her down. She did a little twirl at the end when she won. I mean, the look on her face when she won, oh my God. I mean, it\u2019s hard not to feel uplifted by that. It\u2019s hard not to watch her, the extreme physicality of the struggle to win and the struggle of Venus to just be on that court, and you know it means so much to her to arrive on that court every time they do it. I\u2019m not trying to say that I can relate to what they do in life, but on a much different scale, I can. I know what it feels like to arrive in a room where people aren\u2019t really rooting for you or you aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re rooting for you, and there\u2019s no one else that looks like you at that table. And if you are arrogant or cocky or you know, you\u2019re not in your place the way people think you should be in your place, you get down voted. I mean, I am intimate with those feelings. So, I love them and I adore them and I love watching them because of what they represent to me. And I think, it was just really um, I just feel like I got a free business seminar from Venus. Like I want to Venmo her five bucks \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she needs it, but you know what I mean. I feel like I just got a free course, like a free business lesson.", "WM: What I learned watching her play in this tournament was that there\u2019s no limit to how long she can do it. As long as she\u2019s getting to finals and losing only to like her sister and to players who are inspired in a slightly different way than she is, I think the thing, the amazing thing about her is she is redefining what \u201cold\u201d is.", "JW: Yes!", "WM: She\u2019s old, she\u2019s not old in real life. She\u2019s trying to prove that she\u2019s not even old in her sport. Like, there are so many players in tennis right now who are doing well over the age of 30, including Roger Federer. So, I think that she sits down and spends the next couple of months thinking about how she can have an even better 2018 than she had in 2017.", "JW: I love it. Me too.", "WM: I mean, I think she thinks she...she was crushed by losing to Sloane Stephens because she could have won the whole tournament. And she was two points away from getting to the final.", "JW: She\u2019s not done.", "WM: I feel bad for Serena, because I think when Serena comes back...", "JW: 2018! It\u2019s going to be a good year.", "WM: Venus is going to want to beat everybody.", "JW: Oh my God. Well, we need these lighthouses. These are dark times, so you know, if these are the things, these are the ports that get me through the storm, like I\u2019m here for it, so.", "WM: Well, what was interesting to me about this particular U.S. Open is that the four semifinalists were American, and three of those four women were black.", "JW: I didn\u2019t realize that.", "WM: Yeah. Madison Keys, Sloane Stephens, and Venus Williams, all black women. And I think that Venus and Serena faced a lot of skepticism when they started playing because nobody...I mean, Althea Gibson is pretty much, Althea Gibson, Gloria McNeil, Zina Garrison. There weren\u2019t a lot of black women playing this sport, and nobody had ever played it the way these two would. And Venus and Serena...they changed the sport, and a lot of people wanted to hold onto the old ways of thinking about how tennis was played.", "JW: And the types of people that played tennis.", "WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was one of those people. I mean, she was their chief rival for a long time, and she played a tactical game. And what Venus and Serena did was put an emphasis on power before tactics. And it sort of got into this, what for me was a really racist mentality in terms of how they talk about Venus and Serena. They were physical. They were tough. They were...they were dominating.", "JW: They talked a lot about their body shape and their body size.", "WM: Yeah. And Martina Hingis was always smart.", "JW: These very coded words that signify threatening.", "WM: She knows how to construct a point and Venus just hits the ball like a crazy person. That\u2019s how people used to talk about them, anyway.", "JW: Well, they still do though, because Maria Sharapova put out a new memoir called Unstoppable \u2014", "WM: Wait. Excuse me. First of all, Unstoppable, Maria Sharapova?", "JW: She\u2019s been stopped.", "WM: Uh, what\u2019s your, what\u2019s your win/loss record with Serena Williams? Can I find that for you? Because uh, Unstoppable? You have been stopped.", "JW: She writes in the book, you know, Serena\u2019s physical presence is much stronger and bigger than you realize watching on TV. She has thick arms and thick legs and is so intimidating and strong. This is via a Buzzfeed article. But yeah. So she\u2019s still talking about her like she\u2019s a...you know, not human, like a super human human. It\u2019s creepy. It\u2019s crazy.", "WM: Come on. Really? I mean, it\u2019s bad enough being a woman athlete who doesn\u2019t look like what you think an athlete should look like, or looking too much like \u2014", "JW: Just a woman in the spotlight, people feel like they can...", "WM: But to have a Maria Sharapova say this about...I mean, look. She and Serena have their issues with each other, but that\u2019s disappointing. And unsurprising at the same time. That\u2019s why she beat you 16 times in a row. Anyway, go on.", "JW: From your perspective, looking at where both the Williams sisters are at in their careers, I am really curious to hear what you think tennis would look like without either of the Williams sisters and if they\u2019ve dominated it for so long...as long as I can remember being conscious and aware and thinking about tennis as a sport, it\u2019s only been since they\u2019ve been involved.WM: Well, somebody would have figured a way to play this way, maybe. Somebody would have figured out that serving hard and fast and unreturnably is really important. I mean, it wasn\u2019t like Martina Navratilova had a weak serve. She had the hardest \u2014 Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati had like enormous serves. But there was something about, for instance, Serena\u2019s ability to disguise her toss. You never know where she\u2019s going to hit it. I mean, they just changed a lot of the way tennis should be played by women, and now there\u2019s another conversation happening in their wake about how bad serving is in the women\u2019s game and how it could just be better than it is. And it should be a priority. But sexism \u2014 once again, women get taught how to return, not how to serve. Whereas men get taught to serve and not return. Men, I mean, historically have been pretty great returners, but women are, the reason so many serves get broken in women\u2019s tennis is not just because the serve is weak, but they\u2019re really great returners by and large, statistically. I definitely know that if the Williams sisters don\u2019t show up, you know, your Martina Hingises and Lindsay Davenports are going to a lot more finals and winning more than three and five majors, five and three majors a piece.", "JW: See you at the Open next year, Wes. I\u2019ll see you. Maybe we can actually go together.", "WM: Maybe.

We\u2019re two culture writers at The New York Times.", "JW: I mostly write about how humans relate to technology.", "WM: And I mostly write about how popular culture relates to humans.", "JW: This is...Still Processing. And we\u2019re back.", "WM: Hi.", "JW: Hi.", "WM: What\u2019s going on?", "JW: Nothing.", "WM: You\u2019re rocking whatever\u2019s going on over here.", "JW: Sports bra?", "WM: Ivy Park sports bra!", "JW: Look, it only took until September for summer to finally get here, so I\u2019m working with it.", "WM: I got told today \u2014 by you! \u2014 that I look like a substitute teacher who is trying to be cool at a different school.", "JW: You\u2019re literally Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed. Good job. So...what\u2019s topping your personal pop chart this week?", "WM: So, the Emmys happened on Sunday. There was a lot of good news. One extremely infuriating thing that had nothing to do with anybody winning or losing, except America. But there were two good speeches! The first was Ann Dowd\u2019s speech, your favorite, Ann Dowd from The Leftovers and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. She won supporting actress in a drama for Handmaid\u2019s Tale. And she just gave this really strange, peculiar speech. I just want to play a little bit from it.", "AD: Well, I think this is a dream, you know. Um...I know it\u2019s an actor\u2019s dream, and I\u2019m deeply grateful to you. I\u2019ve been acting for um, a long time, and that this should happen now, I don\u2019t have the words, so I thank you.", "WM: And then...the other great speech from that night was Lena Waithe winning for writing the best episode of Master of None, with Aziz Ansari. The Thanksgiving episode.", "LW: And last, but certainly not least, my LGBTQIA family. I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers. Every day, when you walk out the door, put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world, because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it. And for everybody out there that showed us so much love for this episode, thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer black girl from the South Side of Chicago. We appreciate it more than you could ever know.", "WM: I like how she said it. She \u2014", "JW: L-G-B-T-Q-I-A.", "WM: At some point, Trump was trying to do it that way during the campaign. He was trying to like...to all my LGBTQIA brothers and sisters \u2014 I see you. I see you. Anyway, listen. I saw It over the weekend. It\u2019s really not, I mean, it\u2019s not ugh.", "JW: It looks scary!", "WM: For me, I mean, it takes a lot for me at this point because my tolerance is so high. There\u2019s one thing in this movie that really freaked me out. There\u2019s a really great surprise playing around with dimensionality, you know, big and small, and it\u2019s so effective and so unexpected and so scary. I actually don\u2019t think the reason that move is popular is because it\u2019s a horror movie. Or even because of Stephen King necessarily. I think the movie is popular because we\u2019re going through some weird nostalgia thing right now where it\u2019s so much more fun to be in 1988 than it is to be in 2017.", "JW: That\u2019s super real.", "WM: I have a real world problem that we have to talk about. Last week, it was announced that Nestle is buying Blue Bottle Coffee.", "JW: I can\u2019t believe I missed that. It\u2019s gross. I mean, good for them, but also, that\u2019s gross.", "WM: I didn\u2019t know anything about how bad Nestle was, and I open up our newspaper on Sunday and there\u2019s a story about how Nestle is one of these companies that is responsible for the obesity epidemic in countries that aren\u2019t ours! In Brazil, for instance, the obesity rates have gone up because of the influx of processed food from places like Nestle. The reason I\u2019m upset about this is because I\u2019ve been drinking Blue Bottle Coffee since Blue Bottle Coffee started. It was just a cute little thing that I did in California, and it was one of many coffee purveyors, but I preferred this one. It\u2019s like one of the only products that I feel a very personal affinity for and connection to. You know what I mean? It\u2019s one of those things where like, I\u2019ve been there from the beginning, and then you know, I have no say in what their business thinking is. If they want to, you know, I\u2019m not a shareholder. If they want to let Nestle buy them, what should I do?", "JW: Find another coffee place to support, or just keeping Blue Bottle. What are you going to do?", "WM: I don\u2019t know. I feel like this is probably what we\u2019re going to wind up talking about today, which is like, wherever you look...", "JW: The milk is never clean.", "WM: I know. I know, we talk about this so much. Such a quandary. What\u2019s going on with you?", "JW: I\u2019ll start with a little spot of good news. Ever since I witnessed Rihanna/Robin Fenty at the launch of Fenty beauty, resplendent in yellow top to bottom, head to toe, looking like the reboot of Beauty from Beauty and the Beast that I would watch, that I would pay $10 to watch \u2014", "WM: Oh, yeah. It was very Beauty and the Beast. I didn\u2019t even appreciate that.", "JW: Our Belle of the ball. I just have had a renewed appreciation for yellow, the color yellow, which I never wear because I have a yellow undertone and I just feel like it will make me look ill or not be flattering, so I\u2019ve been conditioned out of wearing yellow. But I started wearing yellow, and I get so many compliments.", "WM: It\u2019s a good color for you.", "JW: Everyone on the street knows it\u2019s in reference to Rihanna, which makes it even more delightful. A guy in a bodega was like, Fenty, head to toe. And I was like, yes, boo! And then that was it, and I got my sandwich and left. So, as usual, I like to know more about why colors resonate and what is speaking to what universe, and so, I did a little research on Google and I found that the color yellow correlates to the third chakra in the body, which is the solar plexis. It refers to something known as the lustrous gem of the body. So, your solar plexis is a source of personal power. It governs the self esteem, warrior energy, and the power of transformation, so thank you, Rihanna, for yet another gift into my life.", "WM: Oh my God. She just keeps giving.", "JW: She never stops giving.", "WM: What else?", "JW: Last week, I had the privilege of being taken on a date to see Ms. Erykah Badu in New Jersey.", "WM: Stop it. You need to stop right now!", "JW: Me or my date?", "WM: Uh, the whole thing. I didn\u2019t get an invitation. I didn\u2019t even know she was in the vicinity.", "JW: You didn\u2019t feel the earth shake? You didn\u2019t feel the universal ripple? You didn\u2019t feel your energy shift? You know, we talk a lot on the show about how musicians age, how celebrities age, how art ages and what holds up, and I\u2019m happy to report that from Mama\u2019s Gun to Baduizm to her new EP to Amerykah One and Two, it all still holds up. Her voice is transcendent. She also performed the majority of the show in a giant oversized cowboy hat in like a laser pyramid. Let\u2019s play Hello off her 2015 mixtape, but you can\u2019t use my phone, because she opened with that and it just sounds so good live.", "HELLO, ERYKAH BADU", "JW: Well, Internet got her panties in a twist last week over a new little startup called Bodega. You probably heard about it.", "WM: Oh, I heard about it.", "JW: You heard all about it. A new startup out of California that\u2019s basically like, a DYI, buy what you want little pantry box that\u2019s...I mean, the name alone is insulting, but the founders took it a step further and acknowledged, like, yeah, we\u2019re trying to put bodegas out of business. We want this to replace the mom and pop corner store bodega. Of course, Twitter goes HAM, rightfully so to some degrees. But I can\u2019t help but think that that outrage is a little misplaced. It\u2019s extraordinarily valid. I mean, this is a pretty abhorrent principle and it\u2019s embarrassing that these guys are so blatantly and flagrantly like, yes, we want to put a ton of immigrants out of business. We don\u2019t care about them! Just to make our lives easier, so we can have the fancy sparkling water and whatever, whenever we want. But I also want to challenge the way we responded to that, because I think that\u2019s a very easy, that\u2019s a very easy company to take aim at, and they do deserve it, but I think it also allows us to ignore all the other things we\u2019re very complicit in about new technology and startups and the actual, real ways the companies we actually use every day are terror forming planet Earth. Not some little hypothetical thing that\u2019s going to end up in startups up and down the west coast and not actually be, you know, at the corner of Fulton and Flatbush any time soon.", "WM: Alright. I\u2019d like to talk about that with you. You\u2019re like the only person I want to talk about that with.", "JW: Well, I want to talk to you about It and horror movies in general and I know we both also saw Mother!, which I definitely want to talk about.", "WM: Yeah. I would pay more money to hear you talk about Mother! than I would to see Mother!, and I actually had a really good time at that movie, so I would love to talk about horror movies. I also want to talk about how horror is right now, for reasons that are really fascinating to me, a vehicle for several other ideas, and how you can be scared but you can also be thinking about what you\u2019re actually scared of. So, let\u2019s start with talking about Bodega, and the pros and cons of being mad at Bodega, and then the pros and cons of...", "JW: Indulging in all this existential horror.", "WM: Right. Well, we\u2019ll be right back.", "JW: Wesley. We need to talk about this new startup called Bodega.", "WM: Do we?", "JW: We do. We absolutely do, because there is the actual implementation of a startup that is meant to disrupt, meant to gentrify, meant to cater to a one percent, a growing one percent class that is not the Wall Street billionaires that we associate with the one percent but a newly minted class of wealthy developers and Silicon Valley, you know, acolytes who don\u2019t want to deal with the nitty gritty and the dirty and the reality of just living in a city. That\u2019s part of it.", "WM: Brown people.", "JW: Brown people. Well, some of them are brown.", "WM: Like, messy bodegas. It\u2019s a snobbery.", "JW: Sure. It\u2019s a snobbery. It\u2019s a snobbery and an interest in luxury above all else, right? But what we also really have to talk about, and actually what this entire episode is about is reality versus the perception of reality.", "WM: Yes, ma\u2019am.", "JW: So, the reality is that these two ex-Googlers launched a company called Bodega, very well funded by some well known VCs. The idea is that you get these little vending machines that are self sufficient, they can go in offices, they can go in Air BnBs, they can go wherever you might need a snack. So, this thing launches, there\u2019s a big splashy article in Fast Company that really does them no favors. And the logo of this company is a bodega cat. They really give them no cushion to make this sound acceptable whatsoever. They present it for what it appears to be: two gratuitous interlopers who are more than happy to put out a ton of immigrants and completely change a culture of cities like New York and San Francisco for the sake of improving and sanitizing and Wall-E-izing, really, American culture.", "WM: Wall-E. It saw the future, back in 2008.", "JW: It really did. So basically, Twitter goes HAM. And everyone is like, how dare you. You can\u2019t get a chopped cheese out of a vending machine, really just going in on this company. Which, to be fair, they deserved. Because they were incredibly ungenerous and incredibly callous about the impact on local communities that this startup might have. They didn\u2019t have the decency to lie. And actually, in a way, all they did was tell the truth, which is hilarious unto itself.", "WM: Well, and I think you know, I\u2019m a big fan of transparency. They were very honest about it. They were very clear about their goals. Business plan was right up front coming right out of this guy\u2019s mouth.", "JW: And yet, let\u2019s take a closer look at what they outlined their business imperative and rollout to be. They said, essentially they were B to B, so business to business, so, you know, not really going to be on street corners because people would probably smash them. But they were going to be in other businesses \u2014 yeah, you\u2019d smash them. I mean, the kiosks that people charge their phones in get knocked over, so a bodega vending machine is definitely going to get smashed as well. Realistically, though, it was a pretty modest roll out. It was pretty much business to business. They said 50 locations up and down the west coast, which to me just screams, startups. It says, this is not going to be on a boardwalk. This is not going to be at the corner of, you know, Hayes and Goff in San Francisco. Not 6th and Market in San Francisco. It\u2019s going to be in the new Twitter offices, if anything else, you know what I mean? So, basically not that big of a deal. But what I\u2019m interested in is why people got so upset, and why the pile on was so loud and so fun. Do you have any ideas?", "WM: Because it\u2019s easy.", "JW: You get a Snickers bar. Because that is the correct answer.", "WM: Can I get it out of a vending machine? I\u2019m going to pick up my bodega cat and walk to the register and get my Snickers with my own two feet, thank you very much.", "JW: But you know, I mean, I think it\u2019s worth looking at why mostly Twitter and new, newly entitled media gets extremely upset about something like this and yet has nothing to say about Nestle buying Blue Bottle. About Amazon working its way into Whole Foods. About Fresh Direct. About Instacart. About the proliferation of Uber and all the million Uber clones. All the things that we actually use on a day to day basis that are actually completely reshaping who is moving where and how things are being gentrified. Like, no one\u2019s going to use this Bodega. But people will actually start using Prime to get Whole Foods. And that is a bigger deal. And in some ways, I\u2019m excited \u2014 that is a much bigger threat to bodegas. But we don\u2019t want to talk about it because you know what? How many people in this room have Amazon Prime? I wanted to let my subscription lapse. It didn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to be real about it. I forgot to turn it off, and I still use it. And I like it! Okay? Because if I need a new iPhone case, guess what? It comes in one day. So, I\u2019m just like, look. You don\u2019t get points just because you\u2019re willing to call evil evil. You actually have to do something about it. What happened in New York a week ago? We had, what, primary elections? Did you vote?", "WM: Oh, I did.", "JW: Because you\u2019re good like that.", "WM: I had to turn around and vote, but yes.", "JW: How many people voted in New York, though?", "WM: Like 13 percent?", "JW: And what percent of New York Twitter do you think was complaining about Bodega?", "WM: 100?", "JW: Probably. I don\u2019t have the math. I don\u2019t have the stats. I\u2019m not Nate Silver. But I\u2019m saying, it probably was closer to 100 percent. So, listen up, guys. You want to be mad about some hypothetical startup coming into your hood?", "WM: You\u2019ve got a right to be mad.", "JW: And you\u2019ve got a right to be mad, but I\u2019ve got a right to be mad too that y\u2019all didn\u2019t vote for the people who are actually making these decisions.", "WM: No, it\u2019s true. Well, I actually think that the real problem with Bodega isn\u2019t the business. It\u2019s the name Bodega. That\u2019s the thing that we\u2019ve also seized upon with this, which is sort of another thing about this moment, right? It\u2019s that we are now in this identity politics phase of being upset about things and it\u2019s not what the business is actually going to do to bodegas. It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s two guys from Silicon Valley yet again with no idea how the real world works, and they are doing something that is an actual affront to brown people. There is an identity politics issue with this name that you can easily seize upon because it\u2019s not the class problem, really. Everybody claims to love their bodega. Let me just say...", "JW: Nobody loves the $12 olive oil at your bodega that you have to buy because the next bodega is too far and you don\u2019t know if they have it and it\u2019s cold outside, and you gotta make dinner, so you\u2019re just going to fork over the $12. No one loves their bodega. We like the idea that we like our bodegas.", "WM: Right. The idea \u2014", "JW: I mean, I do kinda love \u2014 my bodega guy meows at me and I kinda love it. But I also, you know.", "WM: He also tells you you look fly, apparently.", "JW: And he zips up my dresses and he helps me out. But the idea that a bodega is necessarily going to be put out of business. I mean, the real issues facing bodegas are things like rent control, changing neighborhood demographics, issues with leases, issues with lots of different things. And I would be really sad if that went away. I would be really sad if I couldn\u2019t buy beer from a 12 year old anymore, and you know, there\u2019s always someone\u2019s child manning the register when they shouldn\u2019t be, and it\u2019s just like part of the fabric of New York and I love it. But the idea that screaming on Twitter about the name of a company \u2014 of a hypothetical company that\u2019s not coming to your city anytime soon, damn it \u2014 and not voting is somehow more effective...yelling on Twitter is more effective than not voting...blows the mind. And it is as indulgent and as privileged and as gentrified as the thing itself. Bodega is part of a larger trend of exorbitantly imagined and priced ideas that are being rolled out and people are adopting, so the idea that this is going to cause \u2014 it caused a backlash, but the idea that this is going to somehow put this company out of business I think is really farfetched because let us not forget, we just had the announcement of a $1,000 iPhone. There is a company called Peloton that\u2019s basically an individual SoulCycle and the bikes are thousands of dollars, and they\u2019re in every startup office, where you just bike \u2014 you don\u2019t have to go to SoulCycle, you can just hop on the bike and it\u2019s WiFi connected and you can like, pedal along like you\u2019re in a class. I mean, Uber valet \u2014 like we have all of these things already that are catering to those growing upper class of young people who basically are infantilized and just still want to feel like they\u2019re in college. It\u2019s already happening. But it\u2019s not the worst of our problems.", "WM: It gets worse. I was telling you about this company that wants to be a home mortgage company. And the deal with that is, you don\u2019t have enough money for a down payment? By all means, let us give you $50,000. Here\u2019s the catch. You have to pay us the money back, and one of the ways you\u2019re going to pay that money back is by making sure that for one to three years, one of the rooms in your house is going to be an Air BnB available room.", "JW: It\u2019s the new digital sharecropping. It\u2019s indentured servitude to some degree. That\u2019s crazy!", "WM: It\u2019s never going to work.", "JW: Honey, look. It might work. People might do it. These are the times we\u2019re living in. This is what I\u2019m saying about reality versus our perception of reality. Let\u2019s check back in six months and see.", "WM: Once again, I have been taken to school by Jenna Wortham. We\u2019re going to take a break, we\u2019ll be back to talk about some other happy news in the world of what\u2019s real and not real and depressing and not depressing. Horror movies!", "JW: We\u2019re going to shove more clowns in the clown car.", "WM: Yes. We are back.", "JW: We really have to talk about Mother!", "WM: We\u2019re going to talk about what happens in this movie. There will be some things that might spoil this experience for you.", "JW: We\u2019re going to do our best not to completely spoil it, but it\u2019s impossible to talk about this movie in totality without talking about a little bit about how it ends and sort of what some of the theories are behind it.", "WM: Right. Also, after you see it \u2014 and we both think you should see it \u2014 you can come back and listen to what you skipped.", "JW: So, you told me to go see Mother! and okay, alright. Wesley, I love you and I hate you, because I go to this movie, I don\u2019t know anything about it. You know I don\u2019t like suspense, number one. You know, you\u2019ve been to the movies with me. You know I don\u2019t like suspense. This is the most suspenseful thing. I\u2019m climbing out of the seat. I went with my friend Dodai, and she made me go to AMC 7 because they have the recliner seats. I\u2019m like, lying back, I\u2019m freaking out. There are no spoilers online. I tried to look on my phone, because it\u2019s so new...", "WM: I also think people don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.", "JW: People don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. I tried to read summaries of it.", "WM: It\u2019s unspoilerable.", "JW: You know, I just was extraordinarily stressed out. And then at some point, I was like, oh, you\u2019re brilliant, and this is why you wanted me to see this, and now I hate you even more because I loved it and I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I never knew what was going to happen. It got crazier and crazier and crazier. It stars Jennifer Lawrence. Love to look at her face. Javier Bardem. Love to look at his face. Michelle Pfeiffer. What a queen. I mean, what a gift unto itself, and she looked amazing and she was so sexy and just, that was the role she was born to play/my future.", "WM: Drunk suburban mom who drops in?", "JW: Who refuses to do any housework and just rolls around and wears neon green underwear.", "WM: And loves Ed Harris.", "JW: Except for that part. Except for that part. But the neon green undies, boozy drinks during the day, makes fun of Jennifer Lawrence? Sign me up.", "WM: She was great. This movie, Mother!, is basically the story of a woman in a house, married to a poet, who has got something like writer\u2019s block. He\u2019s having some sort of trouble getting his next project going.", "JW: And she appears to be some sort of mystic. Like, it\u2019s unclear if she\u2019s communicating with this house that they\u2019re living in, she\u2019s like, every now and again making a little yellow tincture drink and knocking it back. I was just like, sign me up. I love everything about this.", "WM: Darren Aronofsky, of course, is the director of Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, and The Fountain and Noah, and his interest in freaking an audience out has everything to do with point of view. Like, he\u2019s a subjective filmmaker. He\u2019s very much more interested in the life of movies than he is in the life of actual human beings and the ways in which he can mine preexisting texts \u2014 in this case, the films of Stanley Kubrick or Luis Bu\u00f1uel or Gaspar Noe or Roman Polanski...it\u2019s really a Rosemary\u2019s Baby, what it turns into is a Rosemary\u2019s Baby-like movie. That\u2019s kind of the vibe of the movie is other people\u2019s movies, and the Bible. The Old Testament Bible. Anyway. Ed Harris shows up. He\u2019s the first guest. He thinks he is, he\u2019s been sent to the wrong house. He\u2019s looking for a bed and breakfast, he shows up at Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s giant Victorian home, the groaning Victorian home, and rather than send him to the place where he was supposed to be going, Javier Bardem\u2019s character is a narcissist of infinite proportions and says, please, by all means, come in. Do stay with us. Jennifer Lawrence is like, excuse me? What? And then there\u2019s a knock on the door the next day. Then, there\u2019s another, there\u2019s a woman at the door. Oh, that\u2019s my wife, says Ed Harris. And in comes Michelle Pfeiffer.", "JW: The luminous Michelle...my God.", "WM: The everything...we should maybe do a whole Michelle Pfeiffer episode.", "JW: We should. No, I love her to death, my God.", "WM: So, the two of them come with their \u2014", "JW: Like, hypersexualized libido and like invasiveness and they\u2019ve disrupted this idyllic environment that JLaw has like tried to create for them.", "WM: But there\u2019s some tension. There\u2019s tension between Javier Bardem and the Jennifer Lawrence character. And the tension has, in Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s character\u2019s eyes, to do with the fact that they don\u2019t seem to be, what\u2019s the love situation like between the two of you? We\u2019re so in love. We\u2019ve got these wonderful kids, and we have a lot of sex, which you can see, because you just walked in on us doing it. Then, there\u2019s another knock on the door. And basically, there\u2019s one knock after another, and what you begin to see once Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris\u2019 kids show up is that this is clearly an allegory for something. You probably knew that two shots into the movie, but this is clearly an allegory for something, and it\u2019s clearly based on a very specific \u2014 it\u2019s based on the Bible, okay. It starts with Genesis.", "JW: What I will say though is that I spent a lot of time on, you know, our/fan theories \u2014 Reddit is still good for something. I spent a lot of time reading about all the various theories, and it is probably Biblical knowing Darren\u2019s interests in that, but...we\u2019ll get into it in a second, but like, there are a lot of other theories too, we should say. It\u2019s not just based on Gensis.", "WM: No, no, no, there\u2019s a lot going on here, and I think once the rollercoaster of crazy really flies off the rails...it really does become more than a strictly Biblical allegory. And what winds up happening of course is Jennifer Lawrence...winds up pregnant, and the pregnancy becomes the focal point of the craziness in the movie. And where that goes...is...really entertaining and totally nuts.", "JW: Ridiculous to the point of absurdity. And that\u2019s when I started to have a really good time, because I was like, oh, we\u2019re like completely off the rails. But we should say that this movie has been very polarizing in terms of how people are reviewing it. Some people are like, zero out of four stars! Some people are like, this is a great comedy. Other people are like, WTF. Internet, basically, thinks that this is based on an allegory of the book of Genesis and that Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s characters are creating this Eden that gets ruined by man, and then all of mankind goes HAM. There was this great thread about how Jennifer Lawerence is actually Lucifer and competing with the poet, aka God, who keeps trying to create something and Lucifer just wants to tempt him away. Which I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. I don\u2019t know. There are other theories that it\u2019s an environmental film, like she\u2019s Mother Earth, and the house is being taken over by a greedy man, who just wants more and more and more, and keeps taking things from her. Like, physically taking things from her, ravaging things from her. I was really into those first two theories, and I was all on the Internet and talking about it with my friend Dodai, and then she was like, I think it\u2019s just about how men are really selfish and take from women, and I was like, is it just about like, the ego of an artist and maybe Darren is \u2014 because he and JLaw are dating, so maybe this is an allegory for their relationship? I mean, what the heck is going on in this movie?", "WM: First of all, apparently, I\u2019ve been living under a rock, and did not know that Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence were a couple.", "JW: They\u2019ve kept it hush hush, but I am up up on all the celeb goss, so I knew. But it\u2019s super, super, super on the DL.", "WM: Not anymore!", "JW: I mean, the cat\u2019s out of the bag.", "WM: Here\u2019s what I think. I think the movie is such a mess that it can be anything you want it to be. Because he\u2019s not strictly adhering to this Biblical allegory. And all of the sort of Christian and Old Testament thinking about creation, destruction, greed, sacrifice, all of those things are sort of messily dispersed throughout this movie. And his interest in freaking you out and in showing off what a strong visual director he is...keep upstaging the strength or the tightness of that story. I actually think the funniest metaphor in the movie is the kitchen sink that keeps almost falling off. People keep jumping on the sink and Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s character keeps saying...", "JW: It\u2019s not braced!", "WM: It\u2019s not braced!", "JW: Don\u2019t sit on it.", "WM: So, the kitchen sink, of course, being in critical complaint parlance, everything is in this movie, including the kitchen sink. This movie has everything in it, including a kitchen sink joke.", "JW: Yeah.", "WM: The real question is, is Darren Aronofsky funny? Is he a comedic director? And would it have been more fun if, I don\u2019t know, Luis Bu\u00f1uel or John Waters had directed it. I don\u2019t know. But I think what makes it extra funny is what is funny about it has gotten away from him. So, we are now laughing kind of with the movie, but mostly at it. And mostly at its like, high pitched, ultra keyed up insanity. And yet, I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy enough.", "JW: I think it could have been crazier.", "WM: I think it could have been so much crazier.", "JW: We also didn\u2019t say that like, one of the best cameos in the film is Kristen Wiig, which just comes at the height of the lunacy and like, it continues to evolve. It just...like, that\u2019s when you know that the joke\u2019s on us, the viewer. At least in my opinion. Because you don\u2019t cast Kristen Wiig in a movie that\u2019s supposed to be serious. Like, she is the epitome of just like, the inside joke.", "WM: Yes. And something happens to her in this movie that is, I mean, it\u2019s just funny. The effects team has a sense of humor too, because the thing that winds up happening to her is just funny. But anyway. One of the other things this movie is about is fame, and about stardom. And in the story about the making of this movie with Darren Aronofsky and Jennifer Lawerence, they talk about this Kardashian room that Jennifer Lawerence had for herself to stay sort of sane when the violence that her character undergoes as the movie goes on...becomes very intense for her as an actress to have to endure. I actually think that there is something about this movie in terms of where it winds up going that is very much about what we as the consumers of culture want from people like Jennifer Lawerence, and what people like Darren Aronofsky think about what we want from people like Beyonce. I mean, the baby aspect of this movie is actually fascinating, right. Because think about the ways in which we have become newly obsessed and creepily and dangerously and unhealthily obsessed with the babies of famous people.", "JW: Right, physically, like literally, and also metaphorically, like whether it\u2019s Lemonade or Blue Ivy or the twins, like, we are...", "WM: The Kardashian Wests.", "JW: We just want to consume it all.", "WM: This movie feels like it\u2019s also whether intentionally or not speaking directly to the machine that has to keep this fame going, and these babies are...who knows what\u2019s going to end up happening to any of these babies? But there is something, there is something longevity or \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the term is, but...", "JW: Well, there\u2019s something self perpetuating about it, though, and it becomes this feedback loop in the film, and it\u2019s very, you know, the movie ends sort of the way it starts, and you get the sense that they\u2019re caught in this hamster wheel of, even though they know how things might end, they keep trying to see if there might be a different outcome, which is actually the definition of insanity, but you get the sense that the movie in some ways is really about the cyclical nature of wants and desires and not being able to resist the things that you know will perhaps eventually destroy you. So, if we look at it from that perspective, so maybe this is a very entertaining slapstick horror movie about the horrors of celebrity. And the dangers inside of it, which actually relates back to the presidency, the current administration.", "WM: It is definitely meeting up with this moment we\u2019re in where we don\u2019t actually know what is actually going on outside the movie theater with what\u2019s real and not real. Sunday night, at the Emmys, not 20 minutes into the show, Stephen Colbert is doing \u2014 I think he\u2019s still in his monologue, actually, and at some point, he throws it to Sean Spicer!", "JW: Not even just live Sean Spicer, but Sean Spicer wheeling the podium that Melissa McCarthy uses to make fun of him on Saturday Night Live. And look, as someone who, I was en route to Charlottesville for a panel on some reporting on Sunday night, I only caught glimpses of it through Instagram, and let me tell you. It was gross. Like, it was not, I was like, I\u2019m not cool with this. The funhouse, I\u2019ve gotten too deep in the funhouse and I can\u2019t find the exit. Like, I don\u2019t know what mirror is me and what mirror is play Jenna. I just...it was deeply disturbing, the degree to which people were willing to embrace this person that they\u2019d been denouncing weeks, hours, how many minutes before?", "WM: And the thing that I always wondered when he was doing his job and lying on behalf of this administration...I actually thought, well, clearly, this guy has nowhere to go when this is over. Like, this guy has almost no viable culture position to maintain. And he will be shunned, he will be the first person to be stoned or something.", "JW: But will he? Will he?", "WM: Well, apparently not, because the very people who claimed to have contempt for him...I mean, I just feel like I don\u2019t even know how much control Stephen Colbert had in the production of that show...", "JW: A lot!", "WM: But it seems to me that it\u2019s a real moral abdication to allow Sean Spicer to get the last laugh not of the administration, but on Melissa McCarthy, who is sitting in the audience...her job with that role is done. He\u2019s out of a job. She can\u2019t play him anymore. He gets to have the last word on the woman who made him interesting in the first place, and who got the most scathing satire performed on him too.", "JW: And in addition to making him interesting also offered us the first avenue for comedic relief about something that has been an ongoing horror movie, more or less. Like, reality is shape shifting, reality is ephemeral, reality right now is a chameleon. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s up. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s down. Things are spiraling and continuing to spiral out of control. And the one thing that we had was grounding was the ability to take a step back and laugh at it a little bit, and that was lost when the Emmys allowed Sean Spicer to be in on the joke that he created the need for.", "WM: Here is Stephen Colbert throwing it to Sean Spicer at the Emmys.", "CLIP FROM THE EMMYS", "WM: Well, basically, what he\u2019s doing is playing Melissa McCarthy playing him, in a way, and Melissa McCarthy is sitting there kind of...like, the camera is on her face, and she does not know what to do.", "JW: I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t tell her.", "WM: I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t...I mean, I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t tell her. If they didn\u2019t tell her...oh, God. That\u2019s crazy. Can you imagine? She looked shocked.", "JW: This is how you know we\u2019re in the Truman Show. I need a scene to happen where someone is rowing to the edge of set and can\u2019t leave. You know what I mean?", "WM: But I actually think that\u2019s why Mother! is a movie for right now, because we\u2019ve been talking a lot about Jennifer Lawerence\u2019s role as sort of a passive victim and vehicle for the insanity that winds up swallowing her up, but really, it\u2019s about Javier Bardem\u2019s character, and it\u2019s about how nothing can stop what a narcissistic evil a-hole he is. And he\u2019s got the crystal. He can always just put the crystal back in the thing, the world resets, and another woman just wakes up in the bed every single time. He\u2019s got all the control.", "JW: All the power.", "WM: And I feel like this administration is so much like that. Nothing is stopping them from enacting their craziest most insane desires. People leave that administration, and they go on and do whatever they want. I went and say It, based on Stephen King\u2019s 1986 novel about a clown that haunts the daylight and nightlife of a group of children in a small town in Maine, and I thought, what a Trump metaphor! But I actually think it\u2019s so obvious and easy, and I think really that it is about how we don\u2019t want to live with what we\u2019re currently living with, and how there is a nostalgia for living in what we think is a simpler time, but I also think that the great thing about Stephen King and the reason we keep going back to him is that he\u2019s kind of uncompromising in his vision of what is horrific and what is scary.", "JW: And also, our inability to acknowledge that the seemingly impossible is possible, and our inability to comprehend that the most bizarre juxtaposition, we can\u2019t understand that things can have a duality and there can actually be a lot of evil embedded in something we\u2019re conditioned to believe is good. In fact, that\u2019s actually where the most evil thing might live, and I think for me, as a child, I read It, which was, I don\u2019t know what my parents were doing or thinking, they let me read all of Stephen King when I was like nine years old. It was in the house, like everything else \u2014 Danielle Steel, Stephen King, I read it all. Terry McMillan. But you know, aside from \u2014 and I have a high tolerance for horror, horror doesn\u2019t mess me up. Suspense does. I don\u2019t like suspense, I love horror. But the thing I always took away from It was just, you know, we are...we are fallible if we do not acknowledge the thing that is most present and most likely to be a threat. That\u2019s our Achilles heel as a society. It feels like the reboot is tapping into that too.", "WM: Yes. Both these movies to me are speaking to this moment in ways that are sort of maybe even beyond their makers\u2019 understanding.", "JW: Well, sir, that\u2019s an extremely generous read on your part to both of those directors who...I can\u2019t say for sure, because I\u2019m not living inside their heads like a little John Malkovich character, but look. There\u2019s a way in which it could just be a super fun early Halloween, campy, trashy film that you go see because you\u2019re bored and you need something to do on date night. There is, you know, a way in which Mother! is also causing a lot of outrage. People are very annoyed that this movie was funded, that this movie was made, that it\u2019s getting as much attention as it is. We\u2019re in a climate where people feel like there aren\u2019t enough stories that are relevant and interesting, especially movies that speak to queer POC perspectives, you know. This movie feels gratuitous in terms of scope and scale and budget and attention, so just to acknowledge that they might have some actual meaningful role to play in our general existential society consciousness is really nice of you.", "WM: But I think they\u2019re doing that anyway. I don\u2019t know. I just feel like...", "JW: Well, that\u2019s probably not what they intended.", "WM: Well...I think sometimes, the best and most lasting movies sort of live beyond what whoever made them intended to do. We should say that the director of It is Andy Muschietti. And I think that...there is a competency at work in both of these movies. I think one, it is too loud and a bunch of other things, but I think they wind up managing to speak to this moment better than you could have hoped. All our consciously trash movies...", "JW: And society right now is consciously kind of a trash society, so...like attracts like.", "WM: Right. And for anybody who is misunderstanding what I\u2019m saying, trash, I think, is my favorite type of movie.", "JW: Ditto. It took me a while to learn that about you, and I\u2019m here for it.

Those offices would house employees working on Facebook\u2019s effort to make hardware but could also help with its broader ambitions in China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans.", "Facebook\u2019s plans are tentative, the people said, and would depend on approval from the Chinese government. But if successful, it would be a symbolic victory for the social network, which has long worked to get into China despite being blocked there for nearly a decade.", "\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to questions about the office plans.", "Facebook has been looking for momentum in China, home of the world\u2019s largest population of online users. Earlier this year, it quietly authorized the release by a small local company of a Chinese version of its Moments photo-managing app.", "Despite being obstructed in China, Facebook has many reasons to continue pursuing business there. The social network sells advertising to Chinese companies hoping to reach the rest of the world. The Chinese ad sales, supported from its office in Hong Kong, are some of the largest in Asia. Even China\u2019s government propaganda organs use it.", "Facebook\u2019s new hardware ambitions would require a Chinese presence as well. The initiatives would require plugging into China\u2019s electronics supply chain, which helps build some of the world\u2019s most popular gadgets, like Apple\u2019s iPhone. The office would first be used by employees of Facebook\u2019s hardware effort, called Building 8, according to the people with knowledge of the plans. Anything from an internet-connected medical device to a drone requires coordination with dozens of Chinese producers and assemblers, mostly located in the southern part of the country.", "Facebook has for years entertained the idea of a Chinese office. In late 2015, it obtained a license to open an office in Beijing, but the permit lasted only three months and it could not establish a space in that time. Oculus, the virtual reality company Facebook bought three years ago, already has a Shanghai office.", "At the moment, Facebook uses third parties and its own employees to sell ads in China. Because of cybersecurity concerns, Facebook employees run special security software on devices when they travel in China and do not have access to secretive or critical business information.", "Opening an office in Shanghai allows more support for its employees when they are in China, but also raises security questions. The Building 8 teams, which focus on their own hardware projects, would have less need to access sensitive Facebook data when in China, one person said. The office could also help Facebook work more with local Chinese companies.", "If it opens a Shanghai office, Facebook would not be the only Western internet company banned in the country to have some space there. Google, which pulled its servers out of China in 2010 after it decided to stop censoring search results, retained offices in Beijing and Shanghai that support both advertising and research and development. Google still maintains extensive advertising sales and research facilities there.", "Facebook over the past three years has pulled out all the stops to court the Chinese government and gain approval for its network. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has showed off his Mandarin at one of the country\u2019s top universities and has directly courted Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president.", "The office search comes just months after Facebook released the Chinese-language version of Moments. That app, called Colorful Balloons, originally went largely unnoticed but briefly rose into the top 50 in the photo and video section of China\u2019s iPhone app store after The New York Times reported its release last month, according to app research company App Annie.", "Like other cities in China, Shanghai has been eager to attract technology start-ups and other internet-related investments.", "Earlier this year, a woman listed as the executive director of the company that released Colorful Balloons on Facebook\u2019s behalf was photographed at a meeting between Shanghai government officials and Facebook. In order to open an office in Shanghai, Facebook will likely have to register a branch company in Shanghai as well.", "That the Colorful Balloons app has not come down could be a sign that Facebook has done something right with the government, said Teng Bingsheng, a professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business.

The site says it works with some 3,000 critics worldwide, including bloggers and YouTube-based pundits. But should reviewers from Screen Junkies and Punch Drunk Critics really be treated as the equals of those from The Los Angeles Times and The New Yorker?", "Mr. Yanover rejected those complaints, pointing to the site\u2019s posted requirements. (\u201cOnline critics must have published no less than 100 reviews across two calendar years at a single, Tomatometer-approved publication,\u201d for instance.) He also noted that critics at traditional outlets tended to be white men and that Rotten Tomatoes wanted to include female and minority voices.", "For the studios, the question of how individual reviews get classified as fresh or rotten is also a point of contention. Only about half of critics self-submit reviews and classifications to the site. Rotten Tomatoes staffers comb the web and pull the other half themselves. They then assign positive or negative grades.", "\u201cWe have a well-defined process,\u201d said Mr. Voris, the vice president of Rotten Tomatoes. \u201cOur curators audit each other\u2019s work. If there is any question about how a review should be classified, we have three curators separate and do independent reads. If there still isn\u2019t agreement, we call the journalist.\u201d", "Staff members also fact-check what critics have self-submitted. In one recent instance, a review of \u201cAlien: Covenant\u201d that was submitted as fresh seemed rotten. The site reversed the categorization after contacting the critic for clarification.", "Mr. Voris brushed aside the studios\u2019 protests \u2014 shared by many critics \u2014 that the Tomatometer ratings damage films because they reduce nuanced reviews to blunt scores.", "\u201cI actually think it\u2019s the opposite of simplified,\u201d Mr. Voris said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly layered.\u201d Yes, the Tomatometer scores are the site\u2019s best-known feature, he said. But Rotten Tomatoes also carries snippets of dozens of individual reviews. Beyond that, there are also links to full reviews. The site also generates its own news articles and feature stories (\u201c75 Best Heist Movies of All Time\u201d) that try to put new films into context.", "Still, it is the Tomatometer scores that have become ubiquitous across the web. Rotten Tomatoes makes money through partnerships with companies like Apple, which lists the scores next to iTunes movie rentals and purchases. And to the dismay of movie marketers, Google has started to prominently display the scores even when users do not specifically search for them: Enter the name of a film into the search bar and the Tomatometer results pop up on the top right side of the results page, directly under the film\u2019s poster.", "\u201cRotten Tomatoes isn\u2019t new, but its omnipresence is,\u201d said Tim Palen, Lionsgate\u2019s president of theatrical marketing. \u201cThe scores are even part of the local TV news on Friday going into the weekend.\u201d", "The battle between movie companies and critics is a perennial one. There was an outcry when some publications started using a series of stars to summarize reviews. (By some accounts, that system started in 1928, when The Daily News gave one star to the silent film \u201cThe Port of Missing Girls.\u201d) Cries of harmful reductionism resurfaced in the 1980s, when the critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert brought their thumbs up or down edicts to syndicated television.", "Rotten Tomatoes was founded in 1998 by students at the University of California, Berkeley who wanted reviews for kung fu movies in one place. The name harkens back to medieval Europe, where people would lob spoiled food, often eggs, at petty criminals in the stocks. The practice spread to some theaters in the 19th century. In 1883, The New York Times reported that \u201ca large tomato thrown from the gallery\u201d hit a Long Island actor \u201csquare between the eyes.\u201d", "In past years, studio publicists would occasionally lobby Rotten Tomatoes to include positive reviews from far-flung publications as a way of improving scores, especially for films with a 59 \u2014 on the line between receiving a red, plump fruit label (fresh) or the dreaded splotch of green goo (rotten). But Hollywood more or less lived with it.", "Four things changed.", "There was Fandango\u2019s integration of Tomatometer scores with its ticketing platforms, which service about 28,000 movie screens in North America. Now, when Fandango customers buy tickets to a movie in the days leading up to its release, they are confronted by the film\u2019s Tomatometer score. After the movie is released, a different Rotten Tomatoes rating \u2014 one based on audience response, which is invariably positive \u2014 begins to pop up on Fandango next to the Tomatometer score.", "Then there is Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 growth into a very popular hub. In 2009, the site, which sells advertising, attracted about 1.8 million unique visitors per month. It now attracts as many as 14 million unique visitors a month. The broader Fandango portfolio of sites reaches 60 million unique visitors a month.", "Consumer behavior is also changing. People increasingly rely on review aggregation sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor to make all kinds of spending decisions. The trend is especially visible among young people, who make up Hollywood\u2019s most important audience. According to National Research Group, a movie industry consulting firm, 34 percent of American teenagers now check Rotten Tomatoes before buying a ticket, up from 23 percent in 2014.", "Most importantly, studios are panicking because moviegoing is no longer a habit for most Americans. Because of climbing prices and competition from other forms of entertainment, a trip to the multiplex has become a special event. In particular, more movie fans are ignoring low- and mid-budget films when they are in theaters: Ehh, let\u2019s wait until they show up on Netflix.", "Studios are trying to battle Rotten Tomatoes on multiple fronts.", "Marketers have discovered that early positive reviews can produce a bandwagon effect later, as some critics, especially those at less prestigious outlets, seek to go with the flow instead of against it. Studios have also started screening films early for pockets of critics. In some cases, studios create spreadsheets of which critics to invite to early screenings \u2014 often at festivals \u2014 based on questions such as who liked what in the past and who gives positive reviews more often than not.", "It is notable that \u201cLeatherface,\u201d a horror movie scheduled for release in late October, already has a very positive Tomatometer score of 86 based on seven reviews. (Rotten Tomatoes requires a minimum of five reviews before calculating a score.) The seven reviews came after an August screening at a London festival called FrightFest that was attended by reviewers from sites like Dread Central and HeyUGuys, which bills itself as an outlet for \u201clove letters to cinema.\u201d", "Another way to undercut Rotten Tomatoes involves restricting reviews until the last possible minute. Sony set a review embargo of opening day for \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which left the Tomatometer blank until after many advance tickets had been sold and families had made weekend plans. \u201cThe Emoji Movie,\u201d which ultimately received a Tomatometer score of 8, squeezed out decent opening-weekend ticket sales of $24.5 million.", "If Rotten Tomatoes is a monster, the studios helped create it. As much as they fear and loathe low scores, they love high ones. Sony recently ended its trailer for \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d a heist thriller, by flashing the Rotten Tomatoes logo and \u201c100 percent,\u201d the film\u2019s Tomatometer score at the time. (It later slipped to 94.) Annapurna did the same thing for \u201cDetroit\u201d in television ads. (Not that it helped; that drama flopped.)", "And Rotten Tomatoes is getting stronger. The site is working to build its Tomatometer scores for TV shows into a more formidable force. Also in development are a half-dozen video series, including one built around a cheeky event created by Ms. Drake, the senior movie editor, called Your Opinion Sucks.", "At that event, which started at the Comic-Con International fan convention in San Diego a few years ago, movie fans debate critics. The hourlong sessions can get heated.", "\u201cLet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s not an accident that I chose a costume that needs a whip,\u201d Ms. Drake said as she prepared to co-host one of three sessions at Comic-Con in July.

One member of the audience came to the microphone and offered an opinion: \u201cThe Fate of the Furious,\u201d which got a \u201cfresh\u201d Tomatometer score of 66 in April, deserved an even higher score.", "Snarky wisecracks from the critics and hosts started to fly.

Mike is out this week so Nick Wingfield, a Times technology reporter based in Seattle, filled in.", "Farhad: Hello, Nick! I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re joining me to chat about tech news in Mike\u2019s absence. He spent the weekend covering the many boardroom twists that led to Uber picking its new C.E.O. And now he\u2019s off recovering in a Twinkie-addled haze, I think. So, thanks for stepping in.", "Nick: You\u2019re welcome. Is there a rule that there has to be at least one bald guy in each week\u2019s newsletter?", "Farhad: Yes. I\u2019m glad you were up for it or I would have had to shave my head.", "Farhad: O.K., so this was a busy week in tech. First, there was Uber. As you know, the troubled ride-hailing company has been without a C.E.O. for two months, and its board of directors \u2014 which includes former C.E.O. and co-founder Travis Kalanick \u2014 has been consumed with tension over a new pick.", "As Mike explained in his in-depth account of a crazy weekend showdown, the board was picking between three people: Meg Whitman, the longtime eBay C.E.O. who now runs Hewlett Packard Enterprise; Jeff Immelt, the former C.E.O. of General Electric; and a third person whose identity no one on the outside could pin down. Kalanick and his faction backed Immelt, while Benchmark, the venture capital firm warring with Kalanick, backed Whitman.", "By Sunday morning it looked like Whitman had the whole thing locked up. Then the worm turned. According to Mike, Whitman kept pushing board members to make changes that would curb Kalanick\u2019s power \u2014 and it appears her tactics backfired.", "Nick: It\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. Whitman has a history of being in situations like this. In 2005, Walt Disney was looking for a successor for Michael Eisner, its chief executive at the time. The company seemed to be on the verge of naming Whitman to the job, but she decided to stay as the head of eBay, in part because Disney was taking too long to select a new leader, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time. It wasn\u2019t entirely surprising to see the Uber gig fall through.", "Farhad: Now she\u2019ll have more time to take another stab at political office.", "Anyway, with Immelt out of the way and Whitman overplaying her hand, the mystery third person got the nod. He is Dara Khosrowshahi, who has run the online travel company Expedia since 2005. And now, out of nowhere, he\u2019s Uber\u2019s new C.E.O. \u2014 and so far, he\u2019s been getting wide praise from many analysts. (Khosrowshahi is also on the board of The New York Times Company.)", "To me, Uber\u2019s board sounds as dysfunctional as a brunch between the Lannisters and the Starks on Game of Thrones, but isn\u2019t it kind of interesting that the process yielded a pick who seems pretty reasonable?", "Nick: I\u2019m going to be a contrarian. Aside from the leaks of candidate names, which are good for us storytellers, I don\u2019t think the hunt for a new C.E.O. was all that messy. You kind of hope there is vigorous debate on the board when they\u2019re picking a new leader. Of all the dysfunctional, wacky stuff that has gone on at Uber, I wouldn\u2019t even put the C.E.O. search in the Top 5. That\u2019s grading on a curve though.", "Farhad: One more thing on Uber. On Wednesday, a judge ruled that the lawsuit that Benchmark had filed against Kalanick should now be moved to arbitration. This makes it easier for Kalanick to shield any unsettling facts from public view. It might also allow both sides to back down more easily \u2014 and give Uber a chance to become something of a more normal, less-dramatic company soon. Or not.", "Nick: I wonder if Uber could become militantly boring now. The crazy at that company must be exhausting for everyone \u2014 board members, management, investors, employees. I listened to the leaked audio of Khosrowshahi\u2019s remarks to Uber employees this week when his appointment was official. The way he hat-tipped all the warring factions around the company made me think he would make a serious effort at peace. On the other hand, recorded audio leaked of the new C.E.O.\u2019s remarks. Maybe I won\u2019t put away the popcorn quite yet.", "Farhad O.K., let\u2019s move to your neck of the woods: Amazon. You had an interesting story about how Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s C.E.O., reached out to Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O., to push for the two companies to integrate their voice assistants, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.", "I was surprised by the move; it\u2019s a rare moment of cooperation among tech behemoths. One thing I wondered is if it presaged some larger cooperation between the two, on matters even beyond voice assistants. What do you think?", "Nick: I don\u2019t see major partnerships for the two companies down the line. They\u2019re serious, respectful rivals in cloud computing. I think part of what drove this relationship is that both are facing real roadblocks to getting people using their assistants outside homes and offices. Microsoft and Amazon are both weak in mobile devices. If they can somehow persuade Apple and Google to join their party, it might be easier to get people using Alexa and Cortana through smartphones", "Farhad: Then we have Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods, which just closed. To mark the kickoff, Amazon cut prices on a variety of Whole Foods staples. I went to my local Whole Foods around lunchtime yesterday and found it unusually packed. But have you been able to glean anything else about Amazon\u2019s long-term plans for Whole Foods, beyond this marketing push?", "Nick: The initial price cuts were a way to get curiosity seekers in the door on day one, which seems to have worked. Amazon has already talked about various plans to integrate Amazon services with Whole Foods, like making Amazon Prime the loyalty program for the stores.", "Checkout lines are the single most annoying experience everyone I know has at supermarkets. Amazon has insisted they won\u2019t use the cashier-free checkout technology they\u2019re testing at their Amazon Go convenience store in Seattle to put people out of work. But if they can get the system working smoothly, I could see Amazon sticking to their promise by giving cashiers new roles inside Whole Foods stores \u2014 for example, spending more time answering customer questions.", "And if they can prove this works through Whole Foods, what\u2019s to stop Amazon from selling the entire system to other retailers, the way they do with cloud computing services?", "Farhad: Oh wow, I hadn\u2019t thought about that.

The company responded by saying that it would restrict how advertisers targeted their audiences on the social network.", "On Friday, an article from BuzzFeed reported how Google allowed the sale of ads tied to racist and bigoted keywords, and automatically suggested more offensive terms as part of that process.

Officials of the park trust conceded that the demise of the 2.4-acre cultural island, which would have rested on piers nearly 200 feet from the shoreline, was a setback.", "\u201cWe had been working on this project nearly six years, and we are not in a position right now to speculate about what will take its place,\u201d said Madelyn Wils, president of the Trust.

George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, both Republicans, in what was hailed as an innovative city-state partnership. The idea was to transform the largely derelict Hudson River waterfront into a continuous strip of green, with a bicycle path and piers for recreation. The city and the state would finance its construction, but the park would be maintained with revenue from commercial development within its borders.", "Building a park largely atop piers has proved complex and costly, however, with maintenance of existing structures a constant battle.", "One of the commercial piers intended to generate revenue for the park is Pier 40, a popular athletic complex with commercial parking for 1,800 cars at the foot of Houston Street. But instead of creating revenue Pier 40 has turned into a drain on the park\u2019s finances, with its 3,500 corroded steel pilings in need of $100 million in repairs.", "After a long battle, the park won permission from the legislature to sell air rights to raise the needed money and last year, the City Council approved a plan for a five-tower residential complex across from Pier 40. The developer paid $100 million for the air rights to build a considerably larger project, and work on the pilings should begin next spring.", "After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, much of the park was flooded and electricity was cut off for months in some portions.", "Diller Island promised to bring a dose of celebrity and sex appeal to the park. The idea was to replace the decaying Pier 54, which was closed after it started to collapse, with a high-profile, high-design project. (The shuttered 875-foot pier was where survivors of the Titanic were brought in 1912.)", "But from the start, there were critics. In addition to the City Club of New York, a small civic group that sued to stop the project, Deborah J. Glick, the assemblywoman whose district includes part of the park, had raised concerns about the cultural island, citing both the environment and the slippery slope of privatization.", "\u201cI always thought that it was a very generous offer,\u201d she said Thursday, referring to Mr. Diller\u2019s gift. But, she said, \u201cI thought that a new pier in a sensitive part of the estuary in days of climate change was very wrong headed. I was also concerned that large private money resulting in the control of design and programming was not a particularly democratic notion.\u201d", "Elsewhere in the park, construction is scheduled to begin next year on Pier 26, between North Moore and Hubert Street in TriBeCa, with lawns, native plantings, a small soccer field and two-story walkway. The trust will also create a wetland tidal pool next to the pier in the river for educational purposes.", "And at Pier 57, at West 15th Street, Google has signed a lease for 250,000 square feet of space. The pier will also host a food marketplace and a rooftop park, with construction expected to begin next year.", "Adrian Benepe, the former commissioner of the city\u2019s parks department, said that the canceled gift by Mr. Diller and his wife, Diane von Furstenberg, was among the top three private gifts to parks in the United States.

Steltner, who has served for more than a dozen years as the spokesman for the Berlin state prosecutor, resembles a detective out of classic crime fiction: crisp suit, wavy gray hair and a gallows humor that comes with having seen it all. There was the 2009 case of the therapist who mistakenly killed two patients in an Ecstasy-infused session gone wrong. The Great Poker Heist of 2010, in which masked men stormed a celebrity-studded poker tournament with machetes and made off with a quarter-million dollars. The 2012 episode involving the Canadian porn star who killed and ate his boyfriend and then sent the leftovers home in the mail. Steltner embraced the oddball aspect of his job; he kept a picture of Elvis Presley on the wall of his office.", "But even Steltner found the phone calls he received that morning confounding. They came from police officers from towns far outside Berlin, who reported that protests were erupting, seemingly out of nowhere, on their streets. \u201cThey are demonstrating \u2014 \u2018Save our children,\u2019 \u2018No attacks from immigrants on our children\u2019 and some things like that,\u201d Steltner told me when I met him in Berlin recently.", "The police were calling Steltner because this was ostensibly his office\u2019s fault. The protesters were angry over the Berlin prosecutor\u2019s supposed refusal to indict three Arab migrants who, they said, raped a 13-year-old girl from Berlin\u2019s tight-knit Russian-German community.", "Steltner, who would certainly have been informed if such a case had come up for prosecution, had heard nothing of it. He called the Berlin Police Department, which informed him that a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had indeed gone missing a week before. When she resurfaced a day later, she told her parents that three \u201cSouthern-looking men\u201d \u2014 by which she meant Arab migrants \u2014 had yanked her off the street and taken her to a rundown apartment, where they beat and raped her.", "But when the police interviewed the girl, whose name was Lisa, she changed her story. She had left home, it turned out, because she had gotten in trouble at school. Afraid of how her parents would react, she went to stay with a 19-year-old male friend. The kidnapping and gang rape, she admitted, never happened.", "By then, however, the girl\u2019s initial story was taking on a life of its own within the Russian-German community through word of mouth and Facebook \u2014 enough so that the police felt compelled to put out a statement debunking it. Then, over the weekend, Channel One, a Russian state-controlled news station with a large following among Russian-Germans, who watch it on YouTube and its website, ran a report presenting Lisa\u2019s story as an example of the unchecked dangers Middle Eastern refugees posed to German citizens. Angela Merkel, it strongly implied, was refusing to address these threats, even as she opened German borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. \u201cAccording to Lisa\u2019s parents,\u201d the Channel One reporter said, \u201cthe police simply refuse to look for criminals.\u201d", "The following day in Berlin, Germany\u2019s far-right National Democratic Party held a protest at a plaza in Marzahn, a heavily Russian neighborhood. The featured speaker was an adult cousin of Lisa\u2019s, who repeated the original allegations while standing in front of signs reading \u201cStop Foreign Infiltration!\u201d and \u201cSecure Borders!\u201d The crowd was tiny, not much more than a dozen people. But it was big enough to attract the attention of RT, Russia\u2019s state-financed international cable network, which presents local-language newscasts in numerous countries, including Germany and the United States. A crew from the network\u2019s video service, Ruptly, arrived with a camera. The footage was on YouTube that afternoon.", "That same day, Sputnik, a brash Russian-government-run news and commentary site that models itself on BuzzFeed, ran a story raising allegations of a police cover-up. Lisa\u2019s case was not isolated, Sputnik argued; other refugee rapists, it warned, might be running free. By the start of the following week, protests were breaking out in neighborhoods with large Russian-German populations, which is why the local police were calling Steltner. In multiple interviews, including with RT and Sputnik, Steltner reiterated that the girl had recanted the original story about the kidnapping and the gang rape. In one interview with the German media, he said that in the course of the investigation, authorities had found evidence that the girl had sex with a 23-year-old man months earlier, which would later lead to a sexual-abuse conviction for the man, whose sentence was suspended. But the original, unrelated and debunked story continued circulating, drawing the interest of the German mainstream media, which pointed out inconsistencies in the Russian reports. None of that stopped the protests, which culminated in a demonstration the following Saturday, Jan. 23, by 700 people outside the Chancellery, Merkel\u2019s office. Ruptly covered that, too.", "An official in the Merkel government told me that the administration was completely perplexed, at first. Then, a few days later, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, held a news conference in Moscow. Bringing up Lisa\u2019s story, he cast doubt on the official version of events. There was no way, he argued, that Lisa left home voluntarily. Germany, he suggested, was \u201ccovering up reality in a politically correct manner for the sake of domestic politics.\u201d Two days later, RT ran a segment reporting that despite all the official denials, the case was \u201cnot so simple.\u201d The Russian Embassy called Steltner and asked to meet, he told me. The German foreign ministry informed him that this was now a diplomatic issue.", "The whole affair suddenly appeared a lot less mystifying. A realization took hold in the foreign ministry, the intelligence services and the Chancellery: Germany had been hit.", "Officials in Germany and at NATO headquarters in Brussels view the Lisa case, as it is now known, as an early strike in a new information war Russia is waging against the West. In the months that followed, politicians perceived by the Russian government as hostile to its interests would find themselves caught up in media storms that, in their broad contours, resembled the one that gathered around Merkel. They often involved conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods \u2014 sometimes with a tenuous connection to fact, as in the Lisa case, sometimes with no connection at all \u2014 amplified until they broke through into domestic politics. In other cases, they simply helped promote nationalist, far-left or far-right views that put pressure on the political center. What the efforts had in common was their agents: a loose network of Russian-government-run or -financed media outlets and apparently coordinated social-media accounts.", "After RT and Sputnik gave platforms to politicians behind the British vote to leave the European Union, like Nigel Farage, a committee of the British Parliament released a report warning that foreign governments may have tried to interfere with the referendum. Russia and China, the report argued, had an \u201cunderstanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals\u201d and practiced a kind of cyberwarfare \u201creaching beyond the digital to influence public opinion.\u201d When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia visited the new French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the palace of Versailles in May, Macron spoke out about such influence campaigns at a news conference. Having prevailed weeks earlier in the election over Marine Le Pen \u2014 a far-right politician who had backed Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea and met with him in the Kremlin a month before the election \u2014 Macron complained that \u201cRussia Today and Sputnik were agents of influence which on several occasions spread fake news about me personally and my campaign.\u201d", "But all of this paled in comparison with the role that Russian information networks are suspected to have played in the American presidential election of 2016. In early January, two weeks before Donald J. Trump took office, American intelligence officials released a declassified version of a report \u2014 prepared jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and National Security Agency \u2014 titled \u201cAssessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections.\u201d It detailed what an Obama-era Pentagon intelligence official, Michael Vickers, described in an interview in June with NBC News as \u201cthe political equivalent of 9/11.\u201d \u201cRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cRussia\u2019s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency.\u201d According to the report, \u201cPutin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d", "The intelligence assessment detailed some cloak-and-dagger activities, like the murky web of Russian (if not directly government-affiliated or -financed) hackers who infiltrated voting systems and stole gigabytes\u2019 worth of email and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. But most of the assessment concerned machinations that were plainly visible to anyone with a cable subscription or an internet connection: the coordinated activities of the TV and online-media properties and social-media accounts that made up, in the report\u2019s words, \u201cRussia\u2019s state-run propaganda machine.\u201d", "The assessment devoted nearly half its pages to a single cable network: RT. The Kremlin started RT \u2014 shortened from the original Russia Today \u2014 a dozen years ago to improve Russia\u2019s image abroad. It operates in several world capitals and is carried on cable and satellite networks across the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. RT and the rest of the Russian information machine were working with \u201ccovert intelligence operations\u201d to do no less than \u201cundermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order,\u201d the assessment stated. And, it warned ominously, \u201cMoscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the U.S. presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies and their election processes.\u201d On Sept. 11, RT announced that the Justice Department had asked a company providing all production and operations services for RT America in the United States to register as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a World War II-era law that was originally devised for Nazi propaganda. Also on Sept. 11, Yahoo News reported that a former correspondent at Sputnik was speaking with the F.B.I. as part of an investigation into whether it was violating FARA.", "Russia has dismissed the intelligence-community claims as so much Cold War-era Yankee hysteria. Margarita Simonyan, RT\u2019s chief editor, told me the allegations against the network smacked of \u201cMcCarthyism.\u201d Still, Russian officials are remarkably open about the aims of RT and Sputnik: to \u201cbreak the monopoly of the Anglo-Saxon global information streams,\u201d as Putin himself put it during a visit to RT\u2019s Moscow headquarters in 2013. Russia\u2019s argument about RT\u2019s rightful place in the American media landscape is not all that different from the one Roger Ailes made when he started Fox News: If you thought Fox looked conservative, he would say, maybe it\u2019s because you were liberal. In Russia\u2019s case, it\u2019s: If RT looks biased, it\u2019s because you live in a bubble of Western arrogance and hypocrisy. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s biased.", "Plenty of RT\u2019s programming, to outward appearances, is not qualitatively different from conventional opinion-infused cable news. RT America\u2019s current roster of hosts includes the former New York Times correspondent Chris Hedges, Larry King and the former MSNBC star Ed Schultz, who told me that the network allows him to cover news that may not otherwise \u201cget the proper attention that we think it deserves.\u201d (And, he added, \u201cthe health care is outstanding.\u201d) Its fans point to its coverage of political perspectives that aren\u2019t prominent on mainstream networks \u2014 voices from the Occupy movement, the libertarian right and third parties like the Green Party. The network has been nominated for four International Emmy Awards and one Daytime Emmy.", "This makes RT and Sputnik harder for the West to combat than shadowy hackers. You can tighten your internet security protocols to protect against data breaches, run counterhacking operations to take out infiltrators, sanction countries with proven links to such activities. But RT and Sputnik operate on the stated terms of Western liberal democracy; they count themselves as news organizations, protected by the First Amendment and the libertarian ethos of the internet.", "So over the past decade, even as the Putin government clamped down on its own free press \u2014 and as Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, the U.S.-government-run broadcasting services, were largely squeezed off the Russian radio dial \u2014 RT easily acquired positions on the basic cable rosters of Comcast, Cox, Charter, DirecTV and Fios, among others. The network\u2019s offshoots \u2014 RT UK, RT Arabic, RT Deutsch, RT Espa\u00f1ol \u2014 operate just as freely in other countries (though British regulators have reprimanded RT UK for content \u201cmaterially misleading or not duly impartial\u201d). Macron might have grumbled about RT to Putin, but France is not standing in the way of RT\u2019s plans to start a new French channel.", "By standard media-industry metrics, RT is relatively small. Numbers that RT commissioned in 2015 from the polling firm Ipsos showed it was watched, weekly, by eight million people in the United States, placing it among the top five foreign networks here and in Europe. (Ipsos also found RT was watched by 70 million per week globally; the BBC, using a different polling firm, says its own audience is 372 million per week.) But American television measures itself by the Nielsen ratings, which RT doesn\u2019t pay to be measured by. Nielsen shows Fox News with an average audience of 2.3 million people nightly, MSNBC with 1.6 million nightly and CNN with more than one million nightly. It\u2019s a good bet that if RT thought it would rank anywhere near them, it would pay to be rated.", "But the ratings are almost beside the point. RT might not have amassed an audience that remotely rivals CNN\u2019s in conventional terms, but in the new, \u201cdemocratized\u201d media landscape, it doesn\u2019t need to. Over the past several years, the network has come to form the hub of a new kind of state media operation: one that travels through the same diffuse online channels, chasing the same viral hits and memes, as the rest of the Twitter-and-Facebook-age media. In the process, Russia has built the most effective propaganda operation of the 21st century so far, one that thrives in the feverish political climates that have descended on many Western publics.", "In April, I went to visit Dmitri Peskov, Putin\u2019s press secretary, at his Kremlin office. Peskov, who is 49, works in the presidential administrative headquarters, a prewar building with a grand facade but cramped hallways and offices inside. He has been a spokesman for Putin since Putin first took office in 2000 and is almost always hovering on the edge of the frame in Putin\u2019s photo ops, whether it\u2019s at a gathering of international heads of state or as the president is positioning his pads for a star turn in an exhibition hockey game. The whole presidential-press-attach\u00e9-as-celebrity thing is finally starting to hit Russia \u2014 Peskov\u2019s lavish wedding to a former Russian Olympic ice-dancing gold medalist in 2015 made the tabloids \u2014 but his work look is more Politburo than Paul Smith. He has bushy reddish-brown hair and a mustache, and always appears to be suppressing a sly smile, even when he is frowning.", "When I asked Peskov what Putin meant by RT\u2019s mission to \u201cbreak the monopoly of Anglo-Saxon global information streams,\u201d he went into something of a dissertation, speaking in English with obvious relish and little room for interjections. \u201cThe whole trend of global media was set by Anglo-Saxons,\u201d he began. \u201cIt\u2019s like the first conveyor belt. It was created by Mr. Ford in the United States.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t, but Ford was the first major manufacturer to use the technology on a grand scale.) But now, he went on, \u201cthe conveyor line is not only working in G.M., in Ford \u2014 it\u2019s also working in Citro\u00ebn, in Renault, in Mercedes-Benz, in Toyota, everywhere in the world.\u201d", "Something like the dissemination of Ford\u2019s conveyor belt, he said, was now happening in media; the sort of global news networks the West built were being replicated by Russia, to great effect. What was making \u201cthe whole story successful,\u201d he said, \u201cis a tectonic change of the global system that all of a sudden started to develop 10 years ago.\u201d", "The transformation and acceleration of information technology, Peskov said, had unmoored the global economy from real value. Perception alone could move markets or crash them. \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen bubbles like we\u2019ve seen in the greatest economy in the world, the United States,\u201d he said. The same free flow of information had produced \u201ca new clash of interests,\u201d and so began \u201can informational disaster \u2014 an informational war.\u201d", "Peskov argued that this was not an information war of Russia\u2019s choosing; it was a \u201ccounteraction.\u201d He brought up the \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which led to the ousters of Russian-friendly governments in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan in the mid-2000s. Russia blamed American nongovernmental organizations for fomenting the upheavals. But now, Peskov argued, all you might need to shake up the geopolitical order was a Twitter account. \u201cNow you can reach hundreds of millions in a minute,\u201d he said.", "By way of example, he pointed to \u201cthis girl, from show business, Kim Kardashian.\u201d Kardashian is among the most popular people in all of social media, with 55 million Twitter followers, nearly 18 million more than President Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine that one day she says, \u2018My supporters \u2014 do this,\u2019\u2009\u201d Peskov said. \u201cThis will be a signal that will be accepted by millions and millions of people. And she\u2019s got no intelligence, no interior ministry, no defense ministry, no K.G.B.\u201d This, he said, was the new reality: the global proliferation of the kinds of reach and influence that were once reserved for the great powers and, more recently, great media conglomerates. Even Peskov sounded slightly amazed considering the possibilities. \u201cThe new reality creates a perfect opportunity for mass disturbances,\u201d he said, \u201cor for initiating mass support or mass disapproval.\u201d", "One way of looking at the activities of Russia\u2019s information machine is as a resumption of the propaganda fight between the United States and the U.S.S.R. that began immediately following the Second World War. In the late 1940s, the Marshall Plan, the herculean development project helmed by Secretary of State George Marshall, flooded postwar Europe with money and advisers to help rebuild cities, advance democracy and form an integrated economic zone. Joseph Stalin immediately saw it as a threat \u2014 and saw propaganda as one of his best weapons to contain it.", "In 1947, Stalin formed the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform), a Belgrade-headquartered forum to coordinate messaging among European Communist parties. Cominform used Communist newspapers, pamphlets and posters to paint the Marshall Plan as an American plot to subjugate Europe. A representative Soviet poster distributed in Vienna showed an American \u2014 identified by American-flag shirt cuffs \u2014 offering aid packages with one hand while plundering Austria\u2019s gold with the other. Radio Moscow \u2014 the state-run international broadcaster \u2014 and Soviet-supported newspapers throughout Europe accused the \u201cimperialist\u201d United States of pursuing a plan of \u201cdollar domination\u201d to make the Continent dependent on American goods and services, and of conscripting local youth to fight American proxy wars elsewhere.", "Writing in The New York Times that year, the correspondent Anne O\u2019Hare McCormick recounted false reports in the Red Army newspaper in Vienna that the locals were afraid to walk the streets at night lest American soldiers rob and mug them \u2014 propaganda, she wrote, that \u201cmay not convince, but it adds to the confusion between truth and falsehood and fosters that darkness of the mind in which dictatorships operate.\u201d In a 1947 letter to George Marshall\u2019s undersecretary, Robert A. Lovett, William C. Chanler, a wartime Defense Department official, urged a response, warning that \u201cwe are making the same mistake that was made with Hitler.\u201d", "For the counterinformation campaign, the U.S. government enlisted journalists, including the Washington Post Pulitzer winner Alfred Friendly and the Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Roscoe Drummond; Hollywood filmmakers; and the top marketers of Madison Avenue, including McCann-Erickson and Young and Rubicam. The new effort \u2014 which eventually fell under a new United States Information Agency \u2014 produced upbeat posters with slogans like \u201cWhatever the weather, we only reach welfare together,\u201d which offered a bright contrast to the Communists\u2019 anti-Marshall Plan messaging. Operating on the theory that local voices would have more credibility than American ones, it fed news to foreign reporters about how well the Marshall Plan was progressing in their countries and recruited top European directors to produce hundreds of news features and documentaries that promoted \u201cWestern values\u201d like free trade and representative democracy.", "America went into the propaganda war with distinct advantages. At the time, the Marshall Plan was pumping $13 billion into Europe, while the Soviets were taking $14 billion out in the form of reparations and resource seizures; America\u2019s image abroad was as squeaky clean as it would ever be. \u201cThis was the time when finally the United States came of age as an international power \u2014 when it still had its virginity, as it were,\u201d David Reynolds, a Cambridge University history professor, told me.", "America\u2019s midcentury propaganda success set the tone for the decades to come. It was not entirely a matter of America\u2019s having a better story to tell, and savvier storytellers, than the Soviet Union did. Soviet propaganda did, in fact, work on the people it reached. A controlled study conducted by a professor at Florida State University in 1970 found that Americans who listened to Radio Moscow broadcasts developed more open attitudes toward the U.S.S.R. than those of average Americans. The problem was that very few Americans did hear Radio Moscow: It was available only on shortwave radio and on a handful of American stations \u2014 including WNYC in New York \u2014 reaching less than 2 percent of the adult population in the United States as of late 1966. Meanwhile, Voice of America, the United States\u2019 equivalent service offering a mix of news, music and entertainment, was reaching 23 percent of the Soviet adult population by the early 1970s. Later studies found that up to 40 percent of the Soviet Union\u2019s adult population listened to \u201cWestern broadcasting\u201d of one sort or another, in spite of aggressive Soviet signal-jamming efforts.", "And unlike the Soviets, the United States benefited from the existence of a vast ecosystem of nongovernment media that, even when it crossed swords with the American government, still reflected an American outlook and implicitly promoted American cultural values. The first international, 24-hour networks to come online in the 1980s, like CNN, were American, and they provided their audience \u2014 which eventually included many behind the Iron Curtain \u2014 an unsparing view of the last days of Communism: student protesters staring down tanks in Tiananmen Square, protests and strikes in Poland, East Germans exulting on the ruins of the Berlin Wall. When Mikhail Gorbachev signed his resignation, ceding power to the new presidency of Boris Yeltsin in the last official act of Soviet Communism, he invited CNN to capture the moment in his Kremlin office suite. Finding his own pen out of ink, Gorbachev turned to the CNN president at the time, Tom Johnson, who lent Gorbachev the Mont Blanc he had in his breast pocket. After making sure the pen wasn\u2019t American-made, the last Soviet leader used it to sign one of the most important documents in Russian history. \u201cYou have built your empire better than I built mine,\u201d he told Johnson.", "Mikhail Lesin, too, wanted to build an empire. Around the time of the Soviet Union\u2019s dissolution, he was in his mid-30s, running Video International, an early big Russian ad firm, of which he was a founder. Video International was credited with bringing modern, American-style techniques to Yeltsin\u2019s 1996 re-election campaign, and after Yeltsin\u2019s victory, the president rewarded Lesin by placing him in charge of his presidential communications operation.", "Lesin was a sharp-witted hard drinker who was concerned about Russia\u2019s image in the world. He had a vision for an international network that would familiarize Russia in the same way that CNN familiarized America. But the chaos of the later Yeltsin years, in which the ruble collapsed and Yeltsin\u2019s government foundered, made such a thing impossible.", "Lesin found a more receptive patron in Putin, who succeeded Yeltsin in 1999. Putin \u2014 who, as a deputy in the St. Petersburg mayor\u2019s office half a decade earlier, once chauffeured Ted Turner around the city \u2014 was an attentive student of the power of television. At times, he could not contain his frustration with the way the foreign media covered Russia. \u201cAll they can talk about is crisis and breakdown,\u201d he complained to a nationalist youth group in 2005.", "That year, with the Russian economy rebounding thanks to strong oil prices, Lesin and Alexei Gromov, Putin\u2019s press strategist, secured the approval and financing to start the network, which they called Russia Today. To run the new operation, they hired a 25-year-old TV reporter named Margarita Simonyan.", "When she heard she got the job, \u201cI almost fainted,\u201d Simonyan told me recently. We were sitting on plush couches on an exclusive, dimly lit floor of Voronezh, a fashionable restaurant in the Khamovniki district in central Moscow. \u201cDr. No,\u201d the James Bond film about a plan to disrupt the American space program, was on a TV screen opposite us. Before us was a spread of venison, oysters and shrimp, themselves an unsubtle statement: They were imported from Russia\u2019s far east, a menu adjustment in response to the sanctions and countersanctions that had cut off Western food imports.", "Simonyan, who is now 37, is petite with a wide face, dark hair and green eyes. Her name appears more times in the declassified U.S. intelligence assessment than anyone\u2019s besides Putin\u2019s, but she seems a somewhat unlikely candidate for an American national-security threat. When the report dropped, she wrote on Twitter: \u201cThey are kidding, right?\u201d At the restaurant, she told me: \u201cI never planned to be a part of a weapon. I have two children, and I\u2019m very, very peaceful. I don\u2019t like wars. Any wars.\u201d", "Simonyan grew up poor in Krasnodar, a southern Russia river town, and was 11 when the Soviet Union collapsed. \u201cWe adored the fact that we are now going to be like America and taught like America and to be even patronized by America and be America\u2019s little brother,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel in any way humiliating or contradictory to the Russian pride.\u201d Her infatuation with the United States led her to apply for a slot in a new State Department \u201cfuture leaders\u201d exchange program, which placed top students from the former Soviet Union in United States high schools to \u201censure long-lasting peace and understanding between the U.S. and the countries of Eurasia.\u201d", "For one academic year, she attended a public high school in Bristol, N.H. \u201cShe was fascinated with news,\u201d Patricia Albert, whose parents hosted Simonyan, and who remains close with her, told me. \u201cMaggie,\u201d as the family still calls her, would sit transfixed every night when she joined them on the couch to watch the local news, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cCBS Evening News With Dan Rather.\u201d But she also came to resent some of her American classmates for what she viewed as their sheltered na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201c\u2009\u2018Do you have dogs?\u2019 I remember that,\u201d she told me. \u201cI still have a letter I wrote to my parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they are seriously asking me whether we have dogs.\u2019 They were grown-ups \u2014 18-year-olds \u2014 in a normal high school in New Hampshire, which is supposed to be a sophisticated place.\u201d", "Back home in Krasnodar, her view of the United States, like many Russians\u2019, started to curdle after the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in the former Yugoslavia, with which Russian had strong ethnic, cultural and political ties: \u201cOur Slavic brothers and sisters,\u201d she told me, leaning forward for emphasis. \u201cYou bombed them with no permission, with no reason,\u201d she said, \u201cand in one day you lost Russia.\u201d", "As a journalism major at Kuban State University, Simonyan landed an internship and, quickly thereafter, a correspondent position at a local TV station. Her patriotism and feel for the American-style production techniques she had seen on TV in New Hampshire \u2014 which had not yet come to Russia \u2014 helped her rise quickly through the ranks of state journalism. She covered the brutal Chechen military campaign in 1999 and 2000 that helped solidify Putin\u2019s political standing as he ascended to the presidency, and the 2004 Beslan school siege, which earned her the government\u2019s \u201cStrengthening the Military Commonwealth\u201d medal.", "When she took the helm of Russia Today the following year, Simonyan modeled the new network on CNN and the BBC, and she hired TV consultants from Britain to help give Russia Today a modern cable-news look and feel. (The RT studios in Moscow, when I visited them this spring, were as state-of-the-art as any I\u2019d seen in the United States.) \u201cNobody in Russia had experience of that kind,\u201d Simonyan told me. \u201cTwenty-four-hour news had not been established yet.\u201d One of her employees, Andrey Kiyashko, who started at RT in his late teens, told me: \u201cCNN, BBC \u2014 we were watching it and taking notes on how to be broadcast journalists.\u201d", "At the beginning, the network\u2019s mission was to reverse the global view of Russians \u201cas bears that roam the streets and growl,\u201d as Lesin put it in an interview in 2001. (Lesin was found dead in a Washington hotel room in 2015. The city\u2019s medical examiner attributed his death to blunt trauma to the head. While the incident remains the subject of much speculation, federal investigators have said they believe Lesin\u2019s death followed a prolonged bout of heavy drinking.) An early BBC content analysis found nothing all that remarkable in the network\u2019s Russia-centric coverage and noted that it even included criticism of the Russian bureaucracy.", "Russia Today \u2014 incorporated as an independent company with state financing \u2014 was getting into hotels and even American cable systems. But three years into its existence, the network still had not gained much notice or had much discernible impact abroad. Simonyan says she concluded that the network\u2019s mission of solely focusing on Russia needed revising. \u201cWe had basically too much Russian news,\u201d she told me.", "So in 2008, Russia Today began to reposition itself. The network was reintroduced with a new name, RT, and hired McCann \u2014 the same American advertising firm that once helped the United States sell the Marshall Plan. It soon debuted a new satellite channel in the United States, RT America. Instead of celebrating Russia, Simonyan\u2019s network would turn a critical eye to the rest of the world, particularly the United States. As Peskov sees it, the idea was: \u201cWhy are you criticizing us in Chechnya and all this stuff? Look at what you are doing there in the United States with your relationship with white and black.\u201d He went on: \u201cRT said: \u2018Stop. Don\u2019t criticize us. We\u2019ll tell you about yourself.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "With that, he said, \u201call of the sudden, Anglo-Saxons saw that there is an army from the opposite side.\u201d RT\u2019s new slogan, dreamed up by McCann, was \u201cQuestion More.\u201d", "RT America set up shop in a glass-fronted office building in Washington a block and a half east of the White House. The new network promised to feature stories that \u201chave not been reported\u201d or were \u201chugely underreported\u201d in the mainstream media, Simonyan told The Times in 2010. In line with the Marshall Plan dictum that natives have more credibility than foreigners, it was staffed by American hosts: an incongruous mix of telegenic, ambitious but inexperienced broadcast journalists like Liz Wahl, whom RT recruited from the local television station in the Mariana Islands, and later-career itinerant expats like Peter Lavelle, a banker-turned-reporter who previously worked as a stringer for United Press International\u2019s Moscow bureau and contributed to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.", "From early on, the channel\u2019s interviews highlighted Sept. 11 \u201ctruthers,\u201d who believed the Sept. 11 attacks were an inside job, including Alex Jones, whose segments, ranging freely across the broader spectrum of conspiracy theories \u2014 from Osama bin Laden\u2019s staged death to the all-powerful machinations of the Bilderberg Group \u2014 became regular occurrences on the network. When I asked Simonyan about the Sept. 11 conspiracy theories, she replied: \u201cSome guy in the states who worked for us \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have that position anymore \u2014 was a bit into that. I didn\u2019t pay any attention to that. When I did, I almost killed everybody.\u201d But, she said, it went with the territory. \u201cWe do have our mistakes sometimes, like The New York Times does, like everything does,\u201d she said. \u201cWe correct them.\u201d", "To the extent that RT had any clear ideological bent, it was a sort of all-purpose anti-establishment stance that drew from both the anti-globalization left (the network hosted a Green Party debate) and the libertarian right (it lavished attention on the Rand Paul movement). Its news coverage emphasized poverty and racial injustice, and it found its breakthrough story in the Occupy Wall Street protests. As Wahl, who quit RT in 2014, wrote later in Politico Magazine, \u201cVideo of outraged protesters, heavy-handed police and tents pitched in parks portrayed America as a country in the midst of a popular uprising \u2014 it was the beginning of the inevitable decline of a capitalistic world power.\u201d The coverage, which earned RT one of its International Emmy nominations, brought the network into alignment with Julian Assange, whom Simonyan brought on to host an interview show that ran for a dozen episodes in 2012.", "At the time, state journalism back in Russia was enjoying a kind of renaissance under Dmitri Medvedev, who was elected president in 2008. (Russian presidents are limited to two consecutive terms; Putin endorsed Medvedev as his successor and served as his prime minister before returning to the presidency.) The main Russian international news service, RIA Novosti, hired journalists from The Moscow Times, Agence France-Presse and Reuters, following the philosophy that Russia served its interests best by providing traditional warts-and-all news, with a Russian voice and perspective. \u201cThere was no talk about censorship,\u201d Nabi Abdullaev, a former Moscow Times deputy chief editor who oversaw RIA Novosti\u2019s foreign-language news service, told me. \u201cAll they wanted from me was quality professional standards in reporting; that was it.\u201d", "But that all changed shortly after Putin\u2019s presidential re-election in 2012. The following year, with no warning, Putin signed a decree effectively bringing together RIA Novosti and Voice of Russia, the broadcast service previously called Radio Moscow, under the umbrella of a new organization called Rossiya Segodnya. The Kremlin appointed as its manager Dmitry Kiselyov, state television\u2019s most popular host, known for homophobic rants and his taste for conspiracy theories. Kiselyov went to greet the shocked staff a few days later, delivering a speech that one staff member surreptitiously recorded and posted to YouTube.", "\u201cObjectivity is a myth,\u201d Kiselyov said. \u201cJust imagine a young man who puts an arm around the shoulder of a girl,\u201d he went on, \u201cand tells the girl, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve wanted to tell you for a long time that I treat you objectively.\u2019 Is this what she\u2019s waiting for? Probably not. So in the same way, our country, Russia, needs our love. If we speak about the editorial policy, of course, I would certainly want it to be associated with love for Russia.\u201d Journalism, he said, was an instrument of the country.", "Three weeks later, Kiselyov announced that Margarita Simonyan would serve as the new organization\u2019s editor in chief. Simonyan renamed RIA Novosti\u2019s international branch Sputnik \u2014 \u201cbecause I thought that\u2019s the only Russian word that has a positive connotation, and the whole world knows it,\u201d she told me. Kiselyov presented it as a defensive weapon, saying it was for people \u201ctired of aggressive propaganda promoting a unipolar world\u201d from the West. Meanwhile, Simonyan made new plans for RT that included expansions in Britain and Germany. Together, RT and Sputnik would be the nucleus of an assertively pro-Russian, frequently anti-West information network, RT in the mold of a more traditional cable network and Sputnik as its more outspoken, flashy younger sibling.", "At the time, Putin was angry about pro-democracy protests that had attended his re-election, which RIA Novosti had covered. But the Russian leadership was also thinking about information strategy in new ways. In early 2013, Valery Gerasimov, a top Russian general, published an article in a Russian military journal called VPK. Gerasimov had observed Twitter and other social media helping spark the Arab Spring. \u201cIt would be easiest of all to say that the events of the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 are not war and so there are no lessons for us \u2014 military men \u2014 to learn,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut maybe the opposite is true.\u201d There were new means through which to wage war that were \u201cpolitical, economic, informational,\u201d and they could be applied \u201cwith the involvement of the protest potential of the population.\u201d Russia\u2019s military doctrine changed its definition of modern military conflict: \u201ca complex use of military force, political, economic, informational and other means of nonmilitary character, applied with a large use of the population\u2019s protest potential.\u201d", "Military officials in America and Europe have come to refer to this idea alternatively as the \u201cGerasimov doctrine\u201d and \u201chybrid war,\u201d which they accuse Russia of engaging in now. When I asked Peskov about those charges, he shrugged. Everyone was doing it, he said. \u201cIf you call what\u2019s going on now a hybrid war, let it be hybrid war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter: It\u2019s war.\u201d", "In the weeks after the 2016 election, the American political debate was overtaken by suspicions that Russia had played a role in the election in a significant way. There were the hacks of the D.N.C. servers, which intelligence agencies pinned on Russia well before Election Day. But there was also a sense that Russia\u2019s media and social-media machinery had contributed to the informational chaos \u2014 the fake news and conspiracy theories that coursed through social-media feeds \u2014 that characterized the final stretch of the election, to, it turned out, Trump\u2019s benefit.", "In a handful of cases, picking through the tangles of information, true and otherwise, that shaped the election, it was possible to isolate a single strand that could be traced to Russian news sources. One of the most striking cases came in late July 2016, when Sputnik and RT reported that thousands of police officers had surrounded a NATO air base in Turkey amid rumors of a coup attempt \u2014 a report that turned out to be exaggerated (there was a planned, peaceful demonstration, and the police were there to secure the area in preparation for a visit the next day by the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff). Three internet-security analysts, now working together at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund, followed the story\u2019s progress through the social-media landscape. Within the first 78 minutes, a large number of Twitter accounts \u2014 many of which they identified as pro-Russian bots \u2014 picked up the flawed story and blasted it out in some 4,000 tweets, one of the researchers, a former F.B.I. agent named Clinton Watts, testified before the Senate last spring.", "Some of the accounts added the hashtag \u201c#Benghazi\u201d and warned that thousands of Muslims were on the brink of acquiring the nuclear weapons held at the NATO base. Others included \u201c#TrumpPence16\u201d hashtags, along with words like \u201cAmerica,\u201d \u201cConstitution\u201d and \u201cconservative.\u201d Large numbers of the tweets included accusations that the \u201cMSM\u201d \u2014 mainstream media \u2014 wasn\u2019t covering the attack. The RT story racked up thousands of shares on Reddit and was picked up on David Duke\u2019s webpage. About two weeks later, in an interview with Jake Tapper of CNN, Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, said: \u201cYou had the NATO base in Turkey being under attack by terrorists.\u201d He claimed the media had ignored it. Watts told me: \u201cThat\u2019s when we were like, \u2018Whoa, this is a whole new level.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "But such clear-cut instances were rare. In other cases, the network simply nudged along existing or nascent conspiracy theories: about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health, about a Google plan to rig the election for her, about stock conspiracists\u2019 obsessions like the Rothschild family, the Bilderberg Group and the Illuminati. In general, the social-media matrix is so opaque, with anyone able to set up an account under any persona, that \u201cyou can only crack a piece of it,\u201d Watts\u2019s colleague J.M. Berger told me.", "After the D.N.C. staff member Seth Rich was, according to the police, murdered in a botched robbery attempt on July 10, one of the first inklings of the conspiracy theory that continues to swirl around his death \u2014 that he might have been behind the leaked D.N.C. emails that WikiLeaks distributed that summer \u2014 was a video posted to YouTube on July 29 of the American RT host Lori Harfenist wondering aloud: \u201cNo one in the media is reporting that one of the D.N.C.\u2019s employees who had ready access to the email servers was just mysteriously murdered in the middle of the night?\u201d But far-right media outlets, and the Republican presidential nominee, had spent the election trafficking in baseless conspiracy theories, too. As Simonyan pointed out to me, \u201cFox raised similar questions\u201d about Rich\u2019s death.", "And RT\u2019s coverage of Trump had not been wholly uncritical. Chris Hedges, the former Times correspondent, said Trump had \u201ca penchant for lying and deception and manipulation,\u201d and Ed Schultz pleaded with his guests: \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop Donald Trump?\u201d Even the declassified intelligence assessment seemed to struggle to describe what, exactly, made the Russian outlets\u2019 influence on the election so nefarious. It described RT and Sputnik as sitting at the center of a sprawling social-media network that included \u201cthird-party intermediaries and paid social-media users, or \u2018trolls.\u2019\u2009\u201d But it provided no detail about how that might have worked.", "The best illustration I was able to find came from John Kelly, the founder and chief executive of a social-media marketing and analytics firm called Graphika. Kelly has been studying the movement of information online since 2007, when, as a communications graduate student at Columbia University, he became interested in the social dynamics of political blogs: the ways in which different sites found and related to one another and amplified one another\u2019s work. He taught himself how to code and developed a program to quantify and map the flow of information within the blogosphere. That led to work on State Department-financed projects at the Berkman Klein Center of Harvard University, mapping the blog networks of Iran and, later, Russia. As the gravitational center of online conversation shifted from blogs to social-media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, he studied those too. Eventually he built a searchable database that captures millions of social-media interactions, stores them and analyzes them to determine social neighborhoods in which users share ideologies and interests, which he now mostly uses for private clients.", "Shortly after the election, academic and corporate clients hired him to track the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 that is, unequivocally false content. He confined his search to social accounts that shared fake news at least 10 times during the last month of the campaign. This September, in his airy, loft-style office suite on the West Side of Manhattan, he called up the results of the study on a laptop screen. They were visualized as a black sphere on which each of the 14,000 fake-news-spreading accounts appeared as a dot, grouped and color-coded according to ideological affiliation. The sphere was alive with bursts of purple (\u201cU.S. Conservative\u201d), green (\u201cU.S. Far Left\u201d), pink (\u201cPro-Russia/WikiLeaks\u201d), orange (\u201cInternational Right\u201d) and blue (\u201cTrump Core\u201d).", "Within the fake-news network, Kelly explained, RT was high on the list of most-followed accounts, but it was not the highest \u2014 it ranked No. 117 out of roughly 12,000 accounts he was tracking. Its website was the 12th-most-cited by the fake-news consumers and purveyors \u2014 ahead of The New York Times and The Washington Post but behind Breitbart and Infowars.", "What was more interesting was who followed RT. It drew substantially from all quadrants of Kelly\u2019s fake-news universe \u2014 Trump supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters, Occupy Wall Streeters and libertarians \u2014 which made it something of a rarity. \u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t just pumping up the right wing in America,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey\u2019re also pumping up left-wing stuff \u2014 they\u2019re basically trying to pump up the fringe at the expense of the middle.\u201d", "Nearly 20 percent of the fake-news-spreading accounts, Kelly\u2019s analysis determined, were automated bot accounts, of the sort the American intelligence assessment claimed were working in tandem with RT and Sputnik. But who was operating them was unclear \u2014 and regardless, they were far outnumbered by accounts that appeared to belong to real human beings, reading and circulating content that appealed to them. In this paranoid, polarized and ill-informed subset of American news consumers, RT\u2019s audience crossed all ideological boundaries.", "In January, just a few days after the release of the declassified intelligence report, RT hosted a party in New York. The occasion was the United Nations\u2019 decision to add RT to the internal television system in its Turtle Bay headquarters. For nearly any other broadcaster, this would have been a minor achievement, but in Moscow, it was considered a coup and a rebuke of U.S. intelligence. There were 20 channels in the U.N. system, and as the network saw it, counting RT among them was a new testament to its influence: It was sharing a small dial with BBC World and CNN International, at the heart of the diplomatic world.", "RT flew in several members of its leadership team from Moscow for a ceremony and held a cocktail party in the lobby of the General Assembly building, with hot plates and canap\u00e9s of shrimp dumplings and meatballs and ham. Giant banners proclaimed \u201cRT: Member Broadcaster of the United Nations In-House Network.\u201d", "After some mingling, the crowd moved into an auditorium with long pressboard tables and the standard-issue U.N. headsets and digital clocks. A number of officials gave speeches, including Vitaly Churkin, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., who would die suddenly in the Russian Mission in New York the following month. (The cause of death was withheld according to diplomatic protocol, though the New York police told The Times they did not suspect foul play.) Alexey Nikolov, RT\u2019s director general, also addressed the group. Nikolov is bald with a kindly face and a lilting voice. He began by explaining that he was reading from notes because he was emotional.", "His speech was about his mother, who grew up under Stalin. She was orphaned at 3, \u201cwhen she was thrown out of her apartment in the middle of Moscow winter together with her brother, when their parents were arrested by the N.K.V.D., the Stalin secret police,\u201d he said, speaking haltingly. \u201cMy grandfather, her father, as she only found out many years later, was tortured and executed. And my grandmother, her mother, died in a labor camp. And similar stories happened to millions of my compatriots back in the 1930s.\u201d", "He was building toward something. \u201cWhat I see today is more and more frequently people produce the highfalutin talk about using the word \u2018propaganda\u2019 that eerily echoes those dark days of the Soviet era, when even thinking their own thoughts, not to mention speaking or printing them, was a crime.\u201d People, he declared, \u201cmust have the right to know different news, coming from different sources, and then make their own judgment.\u201d", "It was an addendum to \u201cQuestion More.\u201d Yes, question more, but also consider more \u2014 more news sources, more versions of reality. It\u2019s a point that you really can\u2019t argue with: Of course everyone should be open to other perspectives and different takes on the news. In large part, this is why outlets like RT and Sputnik have proved so vexing to the West \u2014 and especially so in the United States. The far-right media, and even the president, have embraced what a couple of years earlier might have been the fringe of political discourse. Their financing aside, how exactly do you draw a line between RT and Sputnik and, say, Sean Hannity, the Fox News host and confidant of the president of the United States, who has also trafficked in conspiracy theories about Seth Rich and mysterious illnesses possibly afflicting Hillary Clinton? Or Infowars, Alex Jones\u2019s paranoid media empire, to which Trump gave an interview during the campaign?", "It\u2019s hard to imagine Russia\u2019s state-backed media getting any traction in the United States if there wasn\u2019t already an audience for it. For some subset of Americans, the intelligence report singling out RT and Sputnik was just another attack from the supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d that Breitbart, for instance, had been fuming about for months \u2014 and it was less than surprising when, this spring, Sputnik hired a former Breitbart reporter, Lee Stranahan, to start a radio show in Washington. As Stranahan told The Atlantic, though his paycheck might now come from the Russians, \u201cNothing about it really affects my position on stuff that I\u2019ve had for years now.\u201d", "When I asked Simonyan recently what she made of the proliferating attempts to map RT\u2019s influence in the Russian information network that United States intelligence agencies describe as a hybrid-war machine, she replied by email: \u201cThese projects simply blacklist all reporting, including by American media, as some pro-Russian campaign if any facts or views in them don\u2019t support the right kind of narrative.\u201d At the moment, she said, that narrative was: \u201cAll world problems are Putin\u2019s fault.\u201d In her view, \u201cit\u2019s the sad history of McCarthyism repeating itself.\u201d (These were arguments that echoed Trump\u2019s own.)", "It also reflected the genius of \u201cQuestion More\u201d: Every attempt to contain or counteract the Russian state-backed media\u2019s influence simply validated it. Churkin, the ambassador, acknowledged as much at RT\u2019s U.N. ceremony. As he stood to speak, he seemed to be almost bouncing on the soles of his feet, delighted at RT\u2019s newfound prominence. \u201cEverybody watches them,\u201d he said. \u201cDiplomats do it, ambassadors do it, foreign ministers do it, heads of state and government do it.\u201d In an oblique allusion to the recent American intelligence report, he noted that some people had been criticizing the network, but perhaps this was not such a bad thing.

Such search products, like restaurant and business reviews, are increasingly lucrative.", "Under the plan presented Wednesday, Google will create a stand-alone unit for its shopping service. That unit will remain part of its overall business, but will operate separately and will be subject to regular monitoring by the European Commission.

Fines for failing to meet the Thursday deadline could have been as high as 5 percent of the average daily global revenue of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. Google presented its plans to the commission at the end of August, but did not make them public until Wednesday.", "Google would like the measure it\u2019s implementing this week to apply narrowly to price comparison shopping services.

Because we\u2019re such social beings, our minds are exquisitely sensitive to the expressions, gestures and manners of others. Any whiff of artificiality triggers revulsion. Humanoid robots seem creepy to us, and the more closely they\u2019re designed to mimic us, the creepier they are. That puts roboticists in a bind: The more perfect their creations, the less likely we\u2019ll want them in our homes. Lacking human characteristics, smart speakers avoid the uncanny valley altogether.", "Although they may not look like the robots we envisioned, smart speakers do have antecedents in our cultural fantasy life.

Hooked up to cameras with facial-recognition software, the digitized Jeeves also acted as a sentry for the Zuckerberg compound, screening visitors and unlocking the gate.", "Whether real or fictional, robots hold a mirror up to society. If Rosie and her kin embodied a 20th-century yearning for domestic order and familial bliss, smart speakers symbolize our own, more self-absorbed time.", "It seems apt that as we come to live more of our lives virtually, through social networks and other simulations, our robots should take the form of disembodied avatars dedicated to keeping us comfortable in our media cocoons. Even as they spy on us, the devices offer sanctuary from the unruliness of reality, with all its frictions and strains. They place us in a virtual world meticulously arranged to suit our bents and biases, a world that understands us and shapes itself to our desires.

But if it turns out to be an unexpected hit, like the iPhone 6 Plus and 7 Plus, the company\u2019s sales \u2014 and stock price \u2014 could surge.", "Wall Street wasn\u2019t immediately dazzled by Apple\u2019s presentation, however, with the stock price down more than 1 percent by the end of the event.", "\u2014 Vindu Goel", "The iPhone X is the first redesigned iPhone in three years, and Apple says it is the blueprint for \u201cthe future of the smartphone.\u201d Many of the design details had leaked to the press before today\u2019s unveiling \u2014 we\u2019d heard that it would have a new display that stretched across much more of the phone\u2019s front, and that it would do away with the trademark home button.", "Much of that turned out to be true. The iPhone X is essentially the same size and overall shape as the iPhone 7, but because the screen occupies all of the front of the phone, it is far larger than that of older models. The screen uses a technology new for Apple (which many competitors already use), called OLED. It produces better image quality than Apple\u2019s older LCD screens.", "What we didn\u2019t quite know was how Apple would integrate the new button-free design with the operating system \u2014 how would you navigate the phone without a physical button?", "It\u2019s quite simple: You swipe. To go home, swipe up from the bottom of the screen. To see other apps, swipe up from the bottom and pause \u2014 now you see the multitasking pane. And to unlock your phone, you look at it. The iPhone X eliminates Apple\u2019s Touch ID, and replaces it with a facial-recognition system that Apple calls Face ID.", "Whether people will adjust to the button-free system remains to be seen. For better or worse, Apple has used essentially the same interface for the iPhone for the last decade. Swiping is easy, but it isn\u2019t as easy as hitting a button, and it may throw some people off at first. The learning curve will be interesting to watch.", "\u2014 Farhad Manjoo", "The brand-new feature in the iPhone X that has never existed on any other iPhone is infrared face scanning.", "The technology, called Face ID, uses an infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person\u2019s head to unlock the phone and authorize mobile payments. The technology works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.", "For Apple, Face ID has been years in the making. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a camera system that scanned people\u2019s bodies so people could play Xbox games using body movements.", "Face ID is a direct response to the face-recognition feature in smartphones offered by Samsung, Apple\u2019s fiercest rival.

The phones generally look the same as their predecessors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with the exception of glass bodies, as opposed to aluminum.", "Apple improved the phones\u2019 cameras with new sensors and added new motion sensors to better support applications made for augmented reality, which use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.", "In particular, the dual cameras in the iPhone 8 Plus take photos with sharp details in low light. Apple also added a new portrait mode to improve the lighting on faces regardless of the background.", "Another notable new feature is the introduction of magnetic induction to the iPhones. Similar to Apple Watch, the iPhones can now be charged by being placed on a charging pad as opposed to being plugged in with a cable.", "The new iPhone 8 line will be one of the most important for Apple. Wall Street analysts have estimated that more than half of iPhone buyers will buy the 8 and 8 Plus over the next year. The models have a slightly higher starting price than their predecessors: The iPhone 8 starts at $699, up from $650 for older iPhone models.", "\u2014 Brian X.

While Mr. Jobs referred to Apple TV as a \u201chobby\u201d because it was not a hot seller compared to the company\u2019s smartphones, computers and tablets, the product is becoming increasingly important to Apple as it, along with other tech giants like Facebook and Google, moves into creating original video content.", "The new Apple TV, called Apple TV 4K, it is an iteration of the last model, which introduced a touch pad remote control. The new box will now be able to stream so-called 4K resolution, which refers to screens with two times the vertical resolution and twice the horizontal resolution of older high-definition TVs. Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s head of internet software and services, added that 4K titles would cost the same to purchase as traditional high-definition titles, and those who previously bought high-definition titles would be upgraded to 4K at no additional cost.", "Apple said the new Apple TV 4K is also two times faster than the last one and includes support for a new color technology called H.D.R., or high dynamic range. This software feature enhances the contrast and color profile of a picture. In bright colors, you will see brighter highlights; in dark colors, you will see more details.", "\u2014 Brian X. Chen", "The Apple Watch has been a sleeper hit for the company. Though early reviews were mixed, Apple has steadily improved the device, and now the smartwatch is the best-selling watch in the world, according to Apple.", "Today, Apple unveiled the third version of the device. It looks identical to the old version, but the new one carries a much-requested feature for the first time: It will come with a cellular chip, meaning it can access the internet even if it isn\u2019t connected to your phone. Among other capabilities, the cellular version can make calls, send texts and stream music when you\u2019re on the go.", "\u201cNow you have the freedom to go anywhere with just the Apple Watch,\u201d said Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer.", "The cellular version completes a long-term vision for the Watch \u2014 to liberate you, in some small way, from Apple\u2019s best-selling phone. In a demo, a live call was made from the keynote address to an Apple employee on paddle board in the middle of a lake.", "This is a slightly risky strategy, of course; Apple doesn\u2019t want to kill its golden iPhone goose. But the new cellular watch is unlikely to be a replacement for the phone, just a high-priced complement.", "The new cellular version sells for $399; a WiFi-only version of the new version sells for $329, and you can still buy the older version for $249. The new watch will begin shipping on Sept. 22.", "\u2014 Farhad Manjoo", "Apple is set to unveil several new gadgets later this morning, but the highlight of today\u2019s event isn\u2019t something you can buy.

They said that while they worked hard to combat sex trafficking, changing the law \u201cjeopardizes bedrock principles of a free and open internet\u201d that have been crucial to innovation for decades.", "By this week, the two companies were hoping to reach a compromise with lawmakers, an acknowledgment that they could not stop the bill entirely because of strong political headwinds.", "The shifting position illustrates the changing political reality in Washington for some of the country\u2019s biggest technology companies. After years of largely avoiding regulation, businesses like Facebook, Google and Amazon are a focus of lawmakers, some of whom are criticizing the expanding power of big tech companies and their role in the 2016 election.", "The attacks cover a smattering of issues as diverse as antitrust, privacy and public disclosure. They also come from both sides, from people like Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.", "Many of the issues, like revising antitrust laws, have a slim chance of producing new laws soon. But they have become popular talking points nonetheless, amplified by a series of missteps and disclosures by the companies, including Facebook telling Congress this month that fake accounts linked to Russia had bought over $100,000 in political ads on the service.", "\u201cThere is much stronger agreement among me and my colleagues that there needs to be more aggressive enforcement action on tech companies like Google,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a sponsor of the sex trafficking bill.", "The companies, recognizing the new environment in Washington, have started to fortify their lobbying forces and recalibrate their positions. In the last year, Amazon has added antitrust to its roster of issues, hiring a former senior Senate staff member who helped shape antitrust policies. Google has paid several outside lobbying firms to argue against the sex trafficking bill, according to recent federal filings.", "\u201cWe are disruptive, and that creates a lot of tension, concern, worry and jealousy and sometimes rightfully identifies real problems that need solutions,\u201d said Ed Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Facebook, Google, Amazon and other tech companies.", "Tech companies have faced political pressure in Europe for years. That is expected to continue, with regulators prepared to push a new set of proposals to get the tech companies to pay more in taxes.", "The politics for the companies in the United States began to change after the 2016 presidential election, when attention turned to the role social media sites play in shaping public opinion. The scrutiny grew after companies struggled to eliminate fake content from their sites, raising fears that the platforms were too big to manage.", "After Facebook revealed to Congress that it had accepted money for political ads from fake accounts linked to Russia, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, started calling for new disclosure laws for the companies. He plans to begin writing a bill this week that requires Facebook and other social media companies to release funding sources for political ads, as is required for television broadcasters.", "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview. \u201cThe growth in political advertising is in the digital world, and if this is the most targeted and potentially most effective way into politics, the paid advertising rules that broadcasters rely upon should also apply in the social media world.\u201d", "Perhaps no issue in Washington has exposed the vulnerability of the tech companies as much as the sex trafficking bill. At the heart of the debate for the tech companies is a change to a 20-year-old law that prevents people from suing internet companies for things people post on websites. The companies, supported by some civil liberties groups, say the existing law has protected free speech and allowed internet companies to grow without fear of lawsuits.", "The bill being debated, written by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio, and Mr. Blumenthal, would allow state and local authorities to prosecute sites that host content related to sex trafficking. Their bill, which has bipartisan support from dozens of members in the Senate, would also enable people to sue websites.", "Companies like Google and Facebook vehemently opposed the law when it was introduced, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users are hard to police. The bill had provisions that would shield companies like Google and Facebook that have policies to combat sex trafficking, but the companies pushed back nonetheless.", "Starting about two weeks ago, as politicians stepped up their attacks against their businesses, Facebook and Google realized that the political landscape had changed, according to two people with knowledge of the decisions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the internal corporate decisions were private. So instead, the companies began trying to negotiate changes to the bill with Mr. Portman and other senators instead of trying to stop it entirely.", "As of Tuesday, Facebook and Google were still trying to negotiate changes with Senate staff members. One effort, by Google, would block state attorneys general from prosecuting web platforms for hosting any third-party sites that aided sex trafficking. Google said the Justice Department should be the sole agency in charge of enforcing sex trafficking laws.", "Mr. Portman has viewed enforcement by state attorneys general as the centerpiece of the legislation. He will not agree to weakening the enforcement role of local and state prosecutors, according to his spokesman, Kevin Smith.", "\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to engage members of Congress, anti-trafficking organizations and the industry to try and get to a resolution that addresses the problem without creating unintended side effects,\u201d Susan Molinari, Google\u2019s vice president of public policy, said in a statement.", "Facebook appeared more eager to reach a deal with lawmakers, according to two Senate staff members and a tech industry official, who all said the company had expressed a willingness to allow state law enforcement. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because Facebook\u2019s discussions with the lawmakers were private.", "\u201cWe strongly believe that there is a legislative solution that can address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens,\u201d Erin Egan, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said in a statement.", "Senators have not held back their continued frustration with the tech industry, even as the position of the companies has changed somewhat. On Tuesday, the Senate commerce committee held an emotional hearing on bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, that included the mother of a teenage victim of trafficking.", "The Senate invited Facebook and Google to testify but they declined, according to a member of the committee staff, instead sending their trade group, the Internet Association, to represent them.", "\u201cSilicon Valley holds itself out as being more than just an industry but a movement to make the world a better place,\u201d Mr. Portman said in the hearing. \u201cBut selling human beings online is the dark side of the internet.\u201d", "Other issues related to tech companies have gained less traction. The earliest criticism of big tech companies came from left-leaning politicians and economists, whose ideas were largely dismissed by Washington lawyers and regulators as fringe ideas. But there are signs that the companies are starting to take them more seriously now as well.", "The New America Foundation, a left-leaning research group in Washington that is financed by Google and Eric Schmidt, the chairman of its parent company, recently fired a division of antitrust scholars who had been critical of the company. Google has denied playing a role in the split. In California, big tech companies joined internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast \u2014 their adversaries on many policy issues \u2014 to fight a state broadband privacy law, fearing that it could embolden other states and federal regulators to write broader internet privacy rules.", "Even Amazon\u2019s recent move to buy Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion generated political attention. Amazon and Whole Foods have a small portion of the overall grocery market, an important measure in antitrust decisions, and the deal quickly passed an antitrust review by the Federal Trade Commission.", "But some lawmakers raised questions about Amazon\u2019s deep pockets and its ability to undercut the prices of smaller competitors.", "Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, pressed F.T.C. officials to justify their decision, arguing that the agency should have looked at longer-term competition factors. She has also introduced a bill that would force companies to prove that their deals would not be anticompetitive in the future.", "\u201cWe need to start adjusting to a world where we are right now,\u201d said Ms. Klobuchar. \u201cAntitrust laws haven\u2019t been updated since the 1950s.

For Ms. Ramos, that means cleaning at Apple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., in the present day.", "In the 35 years between their jobs as janitors, corporations across America have flocked to a new management theory: Focus on core competence and outsource the rest. The approach has made companies more nimble and more productive, and delivered huge profits for shareholders. It has also fueled inequality and helps explain why many working-class Americans are struggling even in an ostensibly healthy economy.", "The $16.60 per hour Ms. Ramos earns as a janitor at Apple works out to about the same in inflation-adjusted terms as what Ms. Evans earned 35 years ago. But that\u2019s where the similarities end.", "Ms. Evans was a full-time employee of Kodak. She received more than four weeks of paid vacation per year, reimbursement of some tuition costs to go to college part time, and a bonus payment every March. When the facility she cleaned was shut down, the company found another job for her: cutting film.", "Ms. Ramos is an employee of a contractor that Apple uses to keep its facilities clean. She hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in years, because she can\u2019t afford the lost wages. Going back to school is similarly out of reach. There are certainly no bonuses, nor even a remote possibility of being transferred to some other role at Apple.", "Yet the biggest difference between their two experiences is in the opportunities they created. A manager learned that Ms. Evans was taking computer classes while she was working as a janitor and asked her to teach some other employees how to use spreadsheet software to track inventory. When she eventually finished her college degree in 1987, she was promoted to a professional-track job in information technology.", "Less than a decade later, Ms. Evans was chief technology officer of the whole company, and she has had a long career since as a senior executive at other top companies. Ms. Ramos sees the only advancement possibility as becoming a team leader keeping tabs on a few other janitors, which pays an extra 50 cents an hour.", "They both spent a lot of time cleaning floors. The difference is, for Ms. Ramos, that work is also a ceiling.", "Eastman Kodak was one of the technological giants of the 20th century, a dominant seller of film, cameras and other products. It made its founders unfathomably wealthy and created thousands of high-income jobs for executives, engineers and other white-collar professionals. The same is true of Apple today.", "But Kodak also created enough working-class jobs to help create two generations of middle-class wealth in Rochester. The Harvard economist Larry Summers has often pointed at this difference, arguing that it helps explain rising inequality and declining social mobility.", "\u201cThink about the contrast between George Eastman, who pioneered fundamental innovations in photography, and Steve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote in 2014. \u201cWhile Eastman\u2019s innovations and their dissemination through the Eastman Kodak Co. provided a foundation for a prosperous middle class in Rochester for generations, no comparable impact has been created by Jobs\u2019s innovations\u201d at Apple.", "Ms. Evans\u2019s pathway was unusual: Few low-level workers, even in the heyday of postwar American industry, ever made it to the executive ranks of big companies. But when Kodak and similar companies were in their prime, tens of thousands of machine operators, warehouse workers, clerical assistants and the like could count on steady work and good benefits that are much rarer today.", "When Apple was seeking permission to build its new headquarters, its consultants projected the company would have 23,400 employees, with an average salary comfortably in the six figures. Thirty years ago, Kodak employed about 60,000 people in Rochester, with average pay and benefits companywide worth $79,000 in today\u2019s dollars.", "Part of the wild success of the Silicon Valley giants of today \u2014 and what makes their stocks so appealing to investors \u2014 has come from their ability to attain huge revenue and profits with relatively few workers.", "Apple, Alphabet (parent of Google) and Facebook generated $333 billion of revenue combined last year with 205,000 employees worldwide. In 1993, three of the most successful, technologically oriented companies based in the Northeast \u2014 Kodak, IBM and AT&T \u2014 needed more than three times as many employees, 675,000, to generate 27 percent less in inflation-adjusted revenue.", "The 10 most valuable tech companies have 1.5 million employees, according to calculations by Michael Mandel of the Progressive Policy Institute, compared with 2.2 million employed by the 10 biggest industrial companies in 1979. Mr. Mandel, however, notes that today\u2019s tech industry is adding jobs much faster than the industrial companies, which took many decades to reach that scale.", "Many of the professional jobs from those companies in the 1980s and \u201990s have close parallels today. The high-paying positions setting corporate strategy, developing experimental technologies and shaping marketing campaigns would look similar in either era.", "But a generation ago, big companies also more often directly employed people who installed products, moved goods around warehouses, worked as security guards and performed many of the other jobs needed to get products into the hands of consumers.", "In part, fewer of these kinds of workers are needed in an era when software plays such a big role. The lines of code that make an iPhone\u2019s camera work can be created once, then instantly transmitted across the globe, whereas each roll of film had to be manufactured and physically shipped. And companies face brutal global competition; if they don\u2019t keep their work force lean, they risk losing to a competitor that does.", "But major companies have also chosen to bifurcate their work force, contracting out much of the labor that goes into their products to other companies, which compete by lowering costs. It\u2019s not just janitors and security guards. In Silicon Valley, the people who test operating systems for bugs, review social media posts that may violate guidelines, and screen thousands of job applications are unlikely to receive a paycheck directly from the company they are ultimately working for.", "And the phenomenon stretches far beyond Silicon Valley, where companies like Apple are just a particularly extreme example of achieving huge business success with a relatively small employee count. The Federal Express delivery person who brings you a package may well be an independent contractor; many of the people who help banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan service mortgage loans and collect delinquent payments work for contractors; and if you call your employer\u2019s computer help desk, there\u2019s a good chance it will be picked up by someone in another state, or country.", "Apple emphasizes that its products generate many jobs beyond those who receive a paycheck from the company directly. The company estimates 1.5 million people work in the \u201capp economy,\u201d building and maintaining the mobile applications used on Apple products. Apple stores in 44 states tend to offer more generous pay and benefits than is standard in the retail industry. And it is growing quickly, including far from its California headquarters, such as with 6,000 jobs in Austin, Tex., at an average salary of $77,000 a year, and many more indirectly through what it says is $50 billion in annual spending to suppliers in the United States.", "\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for creating over two million jobs in the U.S., across all 50 states,\u201d said an Apple spokesman, \u201cranging from construction, customer care, retail and engineering to app development, manufacturing, operations and trucking. All Apple employees, whether full time or part time, are eligible for benefits and stock grants. We\u2019re also fortunate to have skilled contractors that contribute to our products and services daily, along with over 9,000 suppliers in every state.\u201d", "Perhaps the biggest indictment of the more paternalistic approach taken by an earlier generation of corporate behemoths is that, Kodak, despite having been an early innovator in digital photography, is a shell of its former self. After a bankruptcy and many years of layoffs, the company now has only 2,700 employees in the United States and 6,100 worldwide.", "But it is also clear that, across a range of job functions, industries and countries, the shift to a contracting economy has put downward pressure on compensation. Pay for janitors fell by 4 to 7 percent, and for security guards by 8 to 24 percent, in American companies that outsourced, Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Ethan Kaplan of Stockholm University found in a 2010 paper.", "These pay cuts appear to be fueling overall inequality. J. Adam Cobb of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Ken-Hou Lin at the University of Texas found that the drop in big companies\u2019 practice of paying relatively high wages to their low- and mid-level workers could have accounted for 20 percent of the wage inequality increase from 1989 to 2014.", "The same forces that explain the difference between 1980s Kodak and today\u2019s Apple have big implications not just for every blue-collar employee who punches a timecard, but also for white-collar professionals who swipe a badge.", "Phil Harnden was coming out of the Navy in 1970 when he applied for a job at Kodak, and soon was operating a forklift in a warehouse. He made $3 an hour, equivalent to $20 an hour today adjusted for inflation. That is roughly what an entry-level contracting job testing software pays.", "The difference between the two gigs, aside from the absence of heavy machinery in Apple\u2019s sleek offices, is the sense of permanence. Mr. Harnden put in 16 years operating forklifts before he left in 1986 to move to Florida. When he returned 10 years later, he was quickly rehired and even kept his seniority benefits.", "In interviews, tech industry contractors in Silicon Valley describe a culture of transience. They can end up commuting to a different office park that houses a new company every few months; in many cases 18 months is the maximum a contractor is allowed to spend at one company.", "\u201cI would rather have stability,\u201d said Christopher Kohl, 29, who has worked as a contractor at several Silicon Valley companies, including a stint doing quality assurance on Apple Maps. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful to find a new job every 12 to 18 months.\u201d", "For Silicon Valley\u2019s contracting class, there are reminders large and small of their second-class status. Contractors generally do not receive the stock options that have made some midlevel Silicon Valley workers wealthy over the years, nor the generous paid time off for vacation, illness or the birth of a child. The health insurance plans tend to be stingier than those that the tech giants they serve provide for their direct employees.", "The smaller reminders can be just as telling. One former Apple contractor recalled spending months testing a new version of Apple\u2019s operating system. To celebrate the release, the Apple employees they\u2019d worked closely with on the project were invited to a splashy party in San Francisco, while the contractors had beers among themselves in a neighborhood pub.", "The compensation these white-collar contractors receive puts them squarely in the middle rungs of workers in the United States, and the most skilled can make six figures (though that doesn\u2019t go far in the hyper-expensive Bay Area housing market). Apple, based on its consultants\u2019 report, expected to be indirectly responsible for nearly 18,000 jobs in Santa Clara County by now at an average pay of about $56,000 a year.", "There are some advantages. If they work for one of the companies like Apple or Google that feature a subsidized, high-quality cafeteria, contractors can enjoy the food. They can tell their friends that they work at one of the world\u2019s most admired companies, and enjoy predictable, regular hours. Once in a while, a contractor will be hired into a staff position.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not evil,\u201d said Pradeep Chauhan, managing partner of OnContracting, a site to help people find tech contracting positions. \u201cThey have a job and they\u2019re getting paid. But it\u2019s not ideal. The problem with contracting is, you could walk in one day and they could say, \u2018You don\u2019t need to come in tomorrow.\u2019 There is no obligation from the companies.\u201d", "And that is the ultimate contrast with the middle-skill, middle-wage jobs of earlier generations of titans \u2014 a sense of permanence, of sharing in the long-term success of the company.", "\u201cThere were times I wasn\u2019t happy with the place,\u201d Mr. Harnden said of his Kodak years. \u201cBut it was a great company to work for and gave me a good living for a long time.\u201d", "When an automaker needs a supplier of transmissions for its cars, it doesn\u2019t just hold an auction and buy from the lowest bidder. It enters a long-term relationship with the supplier it believes will provide the best quality and price over time. The company\u2019s very future is at stake \u2014 nobody wants to buy a car that can\u2019t reliably shift into first gear.", "But when that same automaker needs some staplers for the office supply cabinet, it is more likely to seek out the lowest price it can get, pretty much indifferent to the identity of the seller.", "Labor exists on a similar continuum.", "The right product engineer or marketing executive can mean the difference between success or failure, and companies tend to hire such people as full-time employees and as part of a long-term relationship \u2014 something like the transmission supplier. What has changed in the last generation is that companies today view more and more of the labor it takes to produce their goods and services as akin to staplers: something to be procured at the time and place needed for the lowest price possible.", "There is plenty of logic behind the idea that companies should focus on their core competence and outsource the rest. By this logic, Apple executives should focus on building great phones and computers, not hiring and overseeing janitors. And companies should outsource work when the need for staff is lumpy, such as for software companies that may need dozens of quality-assurance testers ahead of a major release but not once the product is out.", "There\u2019s no inherent reason that work done through a contractor should involve lower compensation than the same work done under direct employment.

We indulged ourselves with two nights each in New Orleans and Los Angeles. Yesterday, the Wheel of Excellence, high over Atlanta; tomorrow, a killer Bourbon Street brass band.", "There were two key differences between the South of \u201cPromised Land\u201d and the South we experienced. One was chronological \u2014 back then, in the cities we visited, civil rights activists fought school segregation in Charlotte; Freedom Riders rode Greyhounds to integrate lunch counters and bus stations; and Bull Connor, the infamous Birmingham public-safety commissioner, attacked peaceful protesters with dogs and fire hoses. Although we encountered references to today\u2019s racial struggles, such as a \u201cWhite Lies Matter\u201d sign in a French Quarter window, we largely experienced civil rights as a museum artifact.", "The other difference was the oversimplified nature of Mr. Berry\u2019s pop song versus our complicated route. Mr. Berry wrote \u201cPromised Land\u201d in prison, after police busted him for inviting a 14-year-old girl he had met on the road to work at his St. Louis nightclub. (He argued vehemently that the charges were racist.) He had trouble securing a road atlas to create his fictional journey \u2014 prison officials weren\u2019t thrilled about distributing maps. The \u201cstruggles\u201d he refers to \u201chalfway across Alabam\u2019\u201d are likely about Bull Connor; the poor boy \u201cbypassed Rock Hill,\u201d where a man in South Carolina beat the activist and future U.S. representative John Lewis for opening a \u201cwhites only\u201d door in 1961. \u201cIn that passing reference to Rock Hill \u2014 just three words \u2014 it opens up a whole other interpretation of the song,\u201d Mr. Burford said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sly.\u201d", "We snapped into our vagabond lifestyle with the first city mentioned in the song, Norfolk, taking a midnight Uber from the airport, blathering about \u201cPromised Land\u201d to the driver, an older man who used to spend time at rock concerts but recently shifted to jazz. \u201cWell, Chuck\u2019s gone,\u201d he lamented.", "After he dropped us off at our standard-issue Wyndham down the street from the Greyhound stop, we woke up the next morning to take in as much of Norfolk as we could in three hours. We achieved protein-rich superberry bowls at the hotel restaurant Fruitive; a long look at the World War II-era U.S.S. Wisconsin docked in the Elizabeth River harbor; and 15 minutes of a Sunday morning service by a group called The Rising at the Norva nightclub, where a young preacher in jeans and a T-shirt explained to a crowd the perils of \u201cfrogs,\u201d or small sins, such as viewing pornography or complaining about your job.", "In the song, it isn\u2019t until the second-to-last destination, Houston, that the poor boy meets \u201cthe people there who care a little about me\u201d and buy him luggage and a silk suit. Our comparable moment came on Day Two, in Raleigh, which Mr. Berry name-checks with no commentary. My old friend David Menconi, the veteran music writer for the News & Observer, and his wife, the paralegal Martha Burns, put us up for the night, accompanied us to Lilly\u2019s Pizza and gave us a tour of the city\u2019s downtown coffee shops and concert halls. Mr. Menconi introduced us to Dare Coulter, an artist in dreadlocks who was painting an ambitious, 20-by-30-foot wall mural commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union, focusing on images of rebellion and dissent, from the 1968 Olympians flashing the Black Power salute to the \u201cwoke baby\u201d who held up a sign at the Women\u2019s March on Washington and went viral on social media.", "Ms. Coulter had a looming deadline, and it was easy to discern why she was pushing it: In between grueling brush strokes she stopped to chat with (and hug) just about everyone who passed by downtown. Alnita Coulter, the artist\u2019s mother and helper, recalled seeing Mr. Berry perform at an outdoor festival in Raleigh in 2006. He was 80 then, but, she recalls, \u201cHe moved.\u201d", "The next morning, Mr. Menconi drove us to the bus station and we took off for Charlotte, the next destination on Mr. Berry\u2019s lyrical map. Although Charlotte still faces its past demons \u2014 a police officer here recently killed an African-American man, Keith Lamont Scott, setting off a wave of protests \u2014 it is also a fast-growing, new-South technology and banking hub that charmed us on a mild summer day. Our Airbnb was a modern, linear house, white with a cutout of weathered gray wood, on a not-quite-gentrified street lined with run-down Victorians. At one point, a police car showed up nearby, and our host explained that the two families across the street had been feuding for decades and occasionally yelled at each other from inside their houses until somebody called the authorities.", "We walked about a mile to NoDa, short for North Davidson Street, a sort of mini-6th-Street-in-Austin packed with clubs, restaurants (ours was Cabo Fish Taco, and we were glad to meet its tomato-and-corn house salsa) and, yes, murals, including one in progress of a giant mermaid.", "While we were \u201c90 miles out of Atlanta,\u201d as Mr. Berry sings, the hinky air-conditioning in the back of our crowded Greyhound was making everybody grumpy. A woman next to me in a tight baseball cap had sunk into a series of iPhone conversations before falling asleep with a blanket over her head, but by the end of the four-hour ride, when we could see Atlanta\u2019s jagged skyline, the bus came alive with camaraderie. My seatmate was Chrishelle Jackson, an R&B singer who goes by the stage name Je\u2019Elle. She had been riding buses since 10 o\u2019clock the previous night, from her family\u2019s home in Baltimore, back to where she lived outside Atlanta. She had been working with producers, record labels and video directors, some of whom were attempting to make her image too sexy when she considers herself a sophisticated \u201cKim Kardashian of music.\u201d I suggested she was more like the poor boy in \u201cPromised Land\u201d than anyone we\u2019d met on our trip so far.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a hard process,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to L. A. \u2014 I\u2019m going to the Promised Land. And it\u2019s not to live. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve made progress in my career.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a silk suit, but she had 8,700 Instagram followers.", "In Atlanta, we stayed at the Hyatt downtown, a high-rise with a tall lobby atrium and a 15th-floor room with a skyline view. On this trip, we avoided renting cars and over-Ubering, and economized by exploring on foot, which meant long, hot walks, but also colorful bursts of graffiti and rich shops like Criminal Records, a warehouse of CDs and comic books in Atlanta\u2019s bohemian Little Five Points. Outside the downtown Centennial Olympic Park, beyond the dancing fountains set to \u201cTwist & Shout,\u201d was the Center for Civil and Human Rights. Here, through Freedom Riders photos and interview snippets, we learned about what happened at Rock Hill. I sat at a lunch counter facsimile and put on headphones, listening to old Southern men shout racist threats and slurs while my chair vibrated violently.", "Our bus to Birmingham, Ala., the next stop in the song, rolled in late at night. Today\u2019s Birmingham of old, downtown, light tan buildings, preserves its ugly history in the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and a statue-filled park across the street, but it sets the old days against a colorful, tolerant present. A wall mural on the downtown police department depicts the Birmingham pledge (\u201cI will discourage racial prejudice...\u201d); viaducts light up in rainbows; and the downtown Birmingham Museum of Art contains a striking red-and-white birdhouse painted with the words \u201cBIRDS NEED CHURCH HOUSE.\u201d", "Like in \u201cPromised Land,\u201d something \u201cleft us all stranded in downtown Birmingham,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t our \u2018hound breaking down. Our first Amtrak was delayed four hours in a thunderstorm, so we took cover at El Barrio, whiling away the weather with chicken tacos and vegan tostadas.", "Filled with revelers preparing for the Essence Festival, starring Diana Ross, John Legend and others, our train, as in the song, finally went smoking into New Orleans at midnight after spanning the bottom of Mississippi in the pitch-black darkness. We stayed at the Maison Dupuy just inside the French Quarter, and woke up the next day for blueberry pancakes at the Meals of the Heart Caf\u00e9, a small counter in the covered French Market. We walked 10 humid miles in all, up and down the Riverwalk along the Mississippi River, giving a few bucks to a trumpeter playing \u201cNobody Knows the Trouble I\u2019ve Seen\u201d on a park bench. We circled around the Quarter and landed at quiet Louis Armstrong Park, where slaves were once given Sundays to dance and meet and, over time, created the foundation for jazz.", "Across North Rampart Street is the laundromat that once housed Cosimo Matassa\u2019s famous recording studio, where Fats Domino, Little Richard, Ray Charles and just about every talented musician in New Orleans recorded R&B hits from 1945 to 1956. We encountered a zillion local brass bands, including one of schoolkids going crazy on saxes and tubas at Peters Street and Ursulines Avenue.", "I\u2019d planned too late to get Essence tickets, so we went instead to the Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro, on Frenchmen Street, to see the pianist Ellis Marsalis lead his crack sax-and-trumpet quintet through his own compositions and songs by Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter. At the end, the wry Mr. Marsalis, 82, invited tourists to return to New Orleans and \u201cmake sure you bring your pocketbook because Louisiana is broke.\u201d I contributed to the cause, a little, falling for a beggar\u2019s old \u201cI can tell you where you got them shoes\u201d routine (\u201cYou got them on your feet!\u201d) on Frenchmen Street outside the club.", "By the time we left New Orleans the next day, Rose and I were afflicted with blisters and exhausted, but we were delighted to find the morning Amtrak to Houston to be our most luxurious transportation yet. This train had not just a snack counter but a bona fide, reservations-required dining car (O.K., we ate our own Subway sandwiches) and a viewing car to watch the scenery from overhead windows.", "For us, downtown Houston on a Saturday night in July was uneventful, and while we took a long walk past the Hobby Center for Performing Arts and watched kids play on the playground at Tranquility Park, we were exhausted and thankful for the Lancaster Hotel, which had a three-window view of the downtown skyline and perfect air-conditioning. Tragically, Hurricane Harvey ravaged the Lancaster along with the rest of the city in late August, flooding the basement and leaving the first floor with a foot of water; the hotel will not accept reservations until \u201cour situation gets better and the waters recede,\u201d according to its website. In Mr. Berry\u2019s song, Houston is where people \u201ccare a little \u2019bout me/and they won\u2019t let the poor boy down\u201d \u2014 in this case, I hope the world decides not to let a beleaguered city down, through donating to one of the many Harvey-related charities.", "Finally it was time for our jet to the Promised Land. Several who\u2019d followed our trip on social media were adamant that I eat \u201ca T-bone steak a la cartee\u201d on the flight, like the poor boy does, but I haven\u2019t had red meat since 1994 and the closest thing Spirit Airlines provided to a steak was a $4 snack box of popcorn and a cup of noodles. I asked a flight attendant if the pilot could announce when we were \u201chigh over Albuquerque,\u201d as Mr. Berry sings, but she said he was too busy. It didn\u2019t matter \u2014 soon we were on the ground, trying to figure out which part of Mr. Berry\u2019s \u201cheadin\u2019 to the terminal gate, swing low chariot, taxi to the terminal zone, cut your engines, cool your wings\u201d applied as we approached LAX. Whether Los Angeles was the Promised Land, it was certainly milder.", "We could walk a few blocks downtown without sweating, and the vegan restaurants were far easier to locate, particularly the Kaya Street Kitchen, in West Hollywood, near our centrally located Airbnb on 6th Street. We ate breakfast on the Sunset Strip and dinner at the Farmers Market. In between, we collapsed in a serene, 50-acre Hollywood Park with bright green lawns and tall trees called Wattles Garden.", "Unlike the smaller cities in the South, Los Angeles was impossible to fully explore in just a day and a half, so we followed the tourists to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I did a Google search the location of Chuck Berry\u2019s star and we dutifully took selfies. Few rockers have risen up as meteorically as Mr. Berry \u2014 his father worked in a Baden, Mo., flour mill with barely enough money to raise his family, and the singer painstakingly built his music career by crisscrossing the United States, overcoming prejudice and segregation.", "\u201cPromised Land\u201d may be loosely based on Mr. Berry\u2019s own history, although in 1987, when he received

ago, I was idly flitting a night away on the internet when it occurred to me that I should open up Twitter and tweet something that \u2014 in my heart, in that moment \u2014 was unassailably true:", "Bally >>> Gucci", "No good story begins with a tweet \u2014 or, good lord, an abandoned one \u2014 but bear with me. By that point, Gucci fetishism had become parodic and comical. Alessandro Michele\u2019s rebrand had infused the company with flamboyance, joie de vivre, whimsy and sass, but looking at some outfits suggested Ed Hardy\u2019s sophisticated older cousin, \u00c9douard.", "Bally, by contrast, is buttoned-up, quiet, peacockish only in its deep inner core. It has been that way for years. Thanks to hip-hop, Bally was one of the first brands I coveted in the 1980s. There\u2019s a guy I follow on Instagram who sells vintage sneakers and last year posted several gorgeous dead-stock pairs but, agonizingly, none in my size.", "The 2000s have not been kind to the company, but I\u2019ve sensed a quiet resuscitation in the last two years. Emphasis on quiet: I had to Google the name of its designer. (Beginning in 2014, it was Pablo Coppola, but he left in January; now there are three.) And it is still something of a global luxury footnote: Bally has 146,000 Instagram followers, less than 1 percent of Gucci\u2019s 17.4 million.", "Whether Bally is indeed >>> Gucci, of course, is up for debate. It\u2019s also the sort of proclamation that makes a certain stripe of the social media ecosystem furrow its brow. Twitter encourages petty rumbles and deadens genuine dissent. Principled disagreement is so easily mistaken for provocation that it becomes easier, if you\u2019re not inclined to howl, to not even bother whispering.", "A new Bally flagship store opened at the beginning of the summer, however, providing an opportunity to assess the company anew by applying the rigorous science of shopping.", "From the start, it should be acknowledged that the matchup is imprecise: Gucci is a full-service house, and Bally, which began life as a shoe manufacturer in the 1850s, still focuses on accessories. \u201cAt Bally it\u2019s like the clothes are the accessories to the accessories,\u201d Mr. Coppola said in an interview in 2014, the year he got the job.", "Indeed, at the store, approximately 30 items of men\u2019s clothing were on display \u2014 that\u2019s it. Some erotic outerwear, like the red velvet trucker jacket with a belt at the waist (a mere $2,795), or the black leather coach jacket with travel-theme green lining (*cough* $2,495).", "Both were lovely to the touch and on the body. Neither was practical. More reasonable was a purple polo shirt with black and white trim ($310), with the B logo slanted at an angle so that if you squinted, you might see the tilted P of Palace Skateboards. (It was regal. I bought it.)", "The women\u2019s side wasn\u2019t much different. The emphasis on scarves and purses and shoes was overwhelming, but also logical. I saw a sharp pair of soft-backed striped patent leather loafers ($675) that I recognized because Eva Chen had worn them on Instagram a few days earlier. (I\u2019m not ashamed.)", "It\u2019s important to remember that Bally is Swiss, not Italian, or French, or British: Restraint is its m\u00e9tier, and any place in the store where it veered from that is where it suffered. I\u2019ve long admired the company\u2019s sneakers. One of my rare shopping regrets is not buying a pair of 1980s too-snug-but-what-the-hell navy low-top sneakers from the old Flight Club on Greene Street \u2014 and its basic high-top, with a crimson and beige stripe pattern, was smartly elegant ($495).", "But when it strayed too far from purpose \u2014 I saw second- or thirdhand ideas from Valentino, Prada, Nike and, grotesquely, Giuseppe Zanotti \u2014 the charm faded.", "In general, less is more here. Even when embellishment is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of a certain piece, it\u2019s done minimally. A few wallets were printed with illustrations from old company posters of a dapper half-man, half-shoe hybrid ($395 to $725). A set of leather goods was embroidered with a low-key space desert theme. By the women\u2019s wallets were a set of luxe stickers ($50) designed to be applied to purses and wallets. I liked the pink heart shot through with a lightning bolt.", "Overall, though, the energy of the store was in its refusal. Unlike other Madison Avenue flagships, it is modest, quietly certain of itself. The nods to flash in the clothing are slight, like the perma-popped collar on the windbreakers ($750). In places, Bally is still determining how far to let the pendulum swing: The in-store journal had an article about the intersection of casinos and style (sure) and one on the Guardian Angels (ummmmm).", "Certainly, a tasteful and strategic alliance with a celebrity \u2014 say, ASAP Rocky, who would understand the brand\u2019s secret cool history \u2014 might amplify the work the brand is doing in what is, for the luxury world, relative anonymity. But I admire its stoic reserve, holding firm as the surrounding conversation escalates into a meaningless din."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/opinion/contradictions-hajj-through-smartphone.html": ["Is it permissible to take a selfie in front of the Kaaba during hajj? With spotty internet, I was unable to Google the answer. Forced to call an audible fatwa, I decided, \u201cYes, if indeed my intention is pure.\u201d", "Fourteen hundred years ago, the Prophet Muhammad and his companions definitely didn\u2019t have to decide between Clarendon and Gingham filters to document the hajj pilgrimage that is recreated by Muslims each year. But then again, they didn\u2019t have Instagram as I did when I went to Mecca to satisfy the pillar of my faith during the last days of August and the beginning of September. They didn\u2019t have access to the air-conditioned tents that I used for shelter. And when they gazed at the Kaaba \u2014 the austere black cube that represents God\u2019s house on earth \u2014 it certainly wasn\u2019t dwarfed, as it is now, by the enormous luxury hotel and bling-covered clock tower that the Saudi government added to the landscape in 2012.", "Awe-struck by the privilege of participating in this tradition while often agitated by the contradictions that surround it today, I made sense of the experience by sharing it \u2014 filtering the pilgrimage through the lens of my smartphone.", "The most painful aspect of hajj wasn\u2019t the physical toll that came with navigating cramped space with my two million diverse fellow pilgrims, or the intense spiritual concentration. It wasn\u2019t the hiking-induced blisters and chafing. It was witnessing the erasure and razing of my religion\u2019s culture, history and narrative by the House of Saud.", "The Saudi royal family follows the revisionist and extreme ideology of Wahhabism, which preaches an interpretation of strict monotheism that is often at odds with centuries of theological scholarship. They consider veneration and respect of most holy sites and visitations of graves as a form of idolatry.", "That explains why, in their country, while the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s mosque and courtyard in Medina are spacious, cooled and immaculate, Jannat al-Baqi \u2014 a graveyard directly across from the green dome housing the remains of thousands of Islam\u2019s luminaries \u2014 looks like a set from \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d There are no tombstones, just slabs of rock sticking out like middle fingers from the dirt. If you linger too long to pay respects or offer a prayer, the mutawwa \u2014 religious police \u2014 rush you along. When you ask them who\u2019s buried here, they answer, \u201cAllah knows best,\u201d although they know the truth: the daughter of the prophet, his family members and some of his most loyal companions.", "My friends and I spent hours at the prophet\u2019s tomb and the rawdah \u2014 a space between his original pulpit and grave considered by Muslims to be some of the hottest spiritual real estate on earth. The moving experience was tempered by the awareness that most Muslims long to offer their \u201csalaams\u201d (prayers of peace) to the prophet, but cannot afford to visit his mosque. Also, women are often unable to properly perform the \u201cziyarat\u201d (religious visitation) there because they\u2019re allowed only limited access.", "In Mecca, I hiked nearly an hour under the remorseless afternoon sun to visit the Cave of Hira, where the prophet is believed to have received his first revelation: \u201cRecite!\u201d There are no golden signs, air-conditioning, wheelchair ramps or video presentations here. The austere cave used to offer a clear line of sight to the Kaaba, but now the view is now obscured by that monstrous, $15 billion, Saudi-government-funded clock tower and the accompanying world\u2019s tallest hotel.", "That tableau is a perfect symbol of the strained marriage between the house of God \u2014 the Kaaba, in Mecca \u2014 and the House of Saud, which controls everything related to the sacred mosques. In adherence to the reactionary religious ideology it embraces, the government has allowed the prophet\u2019s house to fall into decrepitude. It has flattened the home of his first wife, Khadija, and installed public toilets where it used to stand. But it has no objection to the construction of extravagant hotels not far away.", "These government\u2019s conflicting values were on display wherever I looked: While non-Muslims are forbidden from even entering Mecca, everyone is free to eat American Hardee\u2019s hamburgers or KFC fried chicken, or buy a Rolex watch across from the Kaaba. It\u2019s forbidden to excessively venerate the prophet and his companions, but there\u2019s no problem with the giant posters of King Abdulaziz, King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, that are all around town.", "But whenever I found myself lamenting the ugliness and hypocrisy of these elements of my journey, the people I met reminded me why I was there, with displays of untarnished spirituality. In the prophet\u2019s mosque, local people brought bread, dates and milk to feed fasting pilgrims. Children begged me to eat from the plates they had prepared, hoping to gain some of the blessings. In the desert plain of Arafat, east of Mecca, I walked with nearly two million pilgrims to the Mount of Mercy. Men and women offered whatever they had: water, food, ice cream, a helping hand for a wheelchair-user. They shared the shade under their umbrellas, and sometimes even the clothes off their back with fellow pilgrims. We were united in a shared journey: seeking to find forgiveness, mercy and salvation.", "It made sense to invite fellow Muslims and friends along for a view of this often-schizophrenic experience, unfiltered through Wahhabi propaganda. While I initially worried it might distract me from my prayer, sharing the photos and Facebook Live videos made hajj a communal experience, in the most modern way possible.", "In Mecca and Medina, often through my camera\u2019s lens, I looked up at the heavens and at the shiny buildings, but I also looked around me and engaged with a community of believers \u2014 some of them with me on ground, and some of them looking at screens on the other side of the world.

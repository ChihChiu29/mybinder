But many others said the culture stoked their willingness to erode work-life boundaries, castigate themselves for shortcomings (being \u201cvocally self-critical\u201d is included in the description of the leadership principles) and try to impress a company that can often feel like an insatiable taskmaster. Even many Amazonians who have worked on Wall Street and at start-ups say the workloads at the new South Lake Union campus can be extreme: marathon conference calls on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving, criticism from bosses for spotty Internet access on vacation, and hours spent working at home most nights or weekends.", "\u201cOne time I didn\u2019t sleep for four days straight,\u201d said Dina Vaccari, who joined in 2008 to sell Amazon gift cards to other companies and once used her own money, without asking for approval, to pay a freelancer in India to enter data so she could get more done. \u201cThese businesses were my babies, and I did whatever I could to make them successful.\u201d", "She and other workers had no shortage of career options but said they had internalized Amazon\u2019s priorities.

It can also tell when engineers are not building pages that load quickly enough, or when a vendor manager does not have enough gardening gloves in stock.", "\u201cData creates a lot of clarity around decision-making,\u201d said Sean Boyle, who runs the finance division of Amazon Web Services and was permitted by the company to speak. \u201cData is incredibly liberating.\u201d", "Amazon employees are held accountable for a staggering array of metrics, a process that unfolds in what can be anxiety-provoking sessions called business reviews, held weekly or monthly among various teams. A day or two before the meetings, employees receive printouts, sometimes up to 50 or 60 pages long, several workers said. At the reviews, employees are cold-called and pop-quizzed on any one of those thousands of numbers.", "Explanations like \u201cwe\u2019re not totally sure\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you\u201d are not acceptable, many employees said.

After she had a child, she arranged with her boss to be in the office from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day, pick up her baby and often return to her laptop later. Her boss assured her things were going well, but her colleagues, who did not see how early she arrived, sent him negative feedback accusing her of leaving too soon.", "\u201cI can\u2019t stand here and defend you if your peers are saying you\u2019re not doing your work,\u201d she says he told her.

Because team members are ranked, and those at the bottom eliminated every year, it is in everyone\u2019s interest to outperform everyone else.", "Craig Berman, an Amazon spokesman, said the tool was just another way to provide feedback, like sending an email or walking into a manager\u2019s office. Most comments, he said, are positive.", "However, many workers called it a river of intrigue and scheming. They described making quiet pacts with colleagues to bury the same person at once, or to praise one another lavishly. Many others, along with Ms. Willet, described feeling sabotaged by negative comments from unidentified colleagues with whom they could not argue. In some cases, the criticism was copied directly into their performance reviews \u2014 a move that Amy Michaels, the former Kindle manager, said that colleagues called \u201cthe full paste.\u201d", "Soon the tool, or something close, may be found in many more offices. Workday, a human resources software company, makes a similar product called Collaborative Anytime Feedback that promises to turn the annual performance review into a daily event.

That includes promising job candidates, who are especially precious at a company with a high number of open positions.

He went on to become a director of engineering at Twitter.", "Each year, the internal competition culminates at an extended semi-open tournament called an Organization Level Review, where managers debate subordinates\u2019 rankings, assigning and reassigning names to boxes in a matrix projected on the wall. In recent years, other large companies, including Microsoft, General Electric and Accenture Consulting, have dropped the practice \u2014 often called stack ranking, or \u201crank and yank\u201d \u2014 in part because it can force managers to get rid of valuable talent just to meet quotas.", "The review meeting starts with a discussion of the lower-level employees, whose performance is debated in front of higher-level managers.

Netflix said it planned to offer unlimited leave in the first year after a child\u2019s arrival to many (though not all) of its employees, while Microsoft said it would substantially increase the paid leave that it will provide.", "Both companies are playing catch-up with the likes of Facebook, which offers four months of paid leave. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, had his own announcement to make in recent days: He and his wife are expecting their first child.", "For all the good that may come from the new policies at Netflix and Microsoft, Mr. Zuckerberg may have the biggest opportunity to help members of the paternity fraternity by using every last day of his leave. Without prominent men in high-performing organizations making parental leave the default choice, the mainstreaming of paid leave for fathers will take a lot longer.", "Paid paternity leave is an incredible privilege for employees in the small number of companies that offer it, and keeping the paychecks coming helps a lot. Cultural hurdles, however, are far harder to clear. Taking a lengthy paternity leave in a company where few, if any, senior men have ever done so requires a fair bit of courage. And while some employers believe that generous maternity leave more than pays for itself in retention, there is little proof that male employees won\u2019t experience a career stall immediately afterward if they dare to step out for a while.", "This evidence cannot emerge without employers offering paid paternity leave in the first place, and most of the people (generally older, often men) who sign off on these policy changes generally haven\u2019t seen fit to do so. Only 17 percent of the employers that the Society for Human Resource Management surveys provide fathers with the benefit.", "Employers that do so tend to be clustered in industries like technology, finance and professional services. Yes, the rich get richer, though it stands to reason that employers who already pay generously would lead the pack here. There are real productivity losses and recruiting costs they would otherwise bear in having bleary-eyed employees roaming the halls and others quitting altogether to stay home with new children. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island require some paid parental leave to all new parents; payroll taxes provide the funds.", "Netflix and Microsoft are on the outer edge of generosity, as you can see from the chart accompanying this column.

This equality stands in contrast with an odd requirement at other employers, where they ask you to declare yourself the \u201cprimary\u201d caregiver before you qualify for the most generous paid leave. The secondary parent gets less paid time off.", "No in-home audits are required, but every expert I spoke to disapproved of classifying commitment in this way. \u201cI find it to be a very weird rule,\u201d said Kenneth Matos, senior director of research for the Families and Work Institute. \u201cIt goes back to this concept where there is someone who is doing the work and someone else who is hanging out and on vacation.\u201d", "Whatever the label, there\u2019s no escaping the fact that the small number of men taking paternity leave at most employers so far means that many colleagues will remember their absence long after they return. So what\u2019s the upside to paternity leave, besides the bonding time (which is essential for single parents of either gender)?", "For men with spouses, it means that the couple is learning to raise their new child together, as opposed to there being one parent (usually the mother) figuring it out and then instructing the other. \u201cHaving men be more engaged means that they don\u2019t have to do it all themselves,\u201d said Mr. Matos, who added that taking equal leave is also an investment in your relationship with each other.", "Academic research, set mostly in Europe, provides additional evidence of how paternity leaves help mothers. In Norway, women are absent from work less because of sickness if their husbands take longer leaves. In France, mothers are less likely to experience depression. Among the Swedes, each month of parental leave appears to increase mothers\u2019 earnings by 6.7 percent, perhaps by helping her focus completely on work once she returns.", "Widespread, lengthy paternity leaves also have the potential to help female colleagues. Mr. Fuerstenberg of Mercer points out that some bosses may look at a woman and a man of childbearing age and favor the male for a promotion because of concern about the woman taking a six-month maternity leave. \u201cIf you provide the same benefit to both people and encourage both to take the leave, there is no opportunity for bias,\u201d he said. Yes, there are plenty of opportunities for gender bias elsewhere, but the expectation of equal length leaves could only help.", "Selflessness aside, however, what happens to a father\u2019s career after a lengthy paternity leave? In Europe, women who take long parental leaves may suffer career consequences, as my colleague Claire Cain Miller reported last year.", "In the United States, we don\u2019t know all that much yet about men specifically. Google has had generous parental leaves for several years and crunches plenty of its own human resources data. The company would not tell me whether it had specifically matched up men who took long parental leaves against otherwise similar men who did not, to see whether the leave-takers suffered financially in the years afterward.", "But Roya Soleimani, a Google spokeswoman, did offer some encouraging words. \u201cI can assure you that all levels of analysis are rigorously done by our team to ensure that there isn\u2019t bias,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see no sign of bias in our people processes, which includes compensation, promotion, performance.\u201d", "Your employer may be nothing like Google, so there\u2019s no denying that paternity leave requires bearing some risk. But it is also something that you can do for your fellow man, literally. If people don\u2019t use the leave, employers will take it away or cut it back or not extend it.", "Moreover, bias against leave-takers probably won\u2019t go away entirely until there are men in positions of authority who have taken it themselves. Right now, most new fathers are left to hope that their bosses won\u2019t grumble (rightfully) about the fact that they didn\u2019t get to go on a long, paid leave or (rightfully again) about the fact that they probably aren\u2019t getting 12 weeks of paid time off to take care of an aging parent.", "Employers can try to head off any such resentment by ordering managers to meet with fathers planning a leave the same way they do with pregnant women. \u201cWe encourage them to adjust their goals for that period of time,\u201d said Mary Tavarozzi, North America practice leader for absence and disability management at Towers Watson. \u201cThen, employees don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re going to get dinged on performance reviews because they had the same goals as a guy who had been there all 12 months with no leave.\u201d Initiate that discussion yourself if no one at your employer does.", "Still, the normalization of paternity leave can only happen when larger numbers of men publicly declare their intention to take one and then shout from the rooftops about how spectacular it was.

The power wielded by the Anglo-American publishing industry over what gets translated produces uniformity; to encounter a true diversity of perspectives, Morgan demonstrates, may require some research and even some legwork.", "WHERE I\u2019M READING FROM\nThe Changing World of Books\nBy Tim Parks\n239 pp. New York Review, $19.95.", "Anyone annoyed by the platitudes about literature that tend to congregate anywhere books are sold will find a welcome respite in Parks\u2019s essays. His preferred b\u00eate noire is world literature. He reads it as a market based on American tastes, which encourages authors to write in a style easily translatable into English and to avoid contextually specific details that may not make sense to foreign readers. Shrugging off the fashionable view that literature ought to further cross-cultural understanding, Parks encourages novelists and readers to go local.", "While it\u2019s fun to contemplate these provocations, Parks is especially good when he zooms in on particular texts. He notes how \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u2019s\u201d neo\u00adlogism \u201cunrestfully\u201d captures, more precisely than \u201crestlessly,\u201d Daisy and Tom\u2019s \u201clack of benefit from their languor.\u201d This is brilliant, but it troubles Parks\u2019s larger claim that a text\u2019s nuances are best understood by a local readership.

What they get instead is a rambunctious personality wandering the aisles of rare-book stores; musing about language, aging and traffic; and catching up with fellow aficionados of the weird and the obscure. Whether readers like the book will largely depend on whether they end up liking Dirda, and for some it may be a close call. Coyly announcing that he once founded a club whose members had all won a \u201cprize that starts with P,\u201d Dirda may be the worst humblebragger in the English language. After wondering whether to describe his writing as \u201cmellifluous and pellucid\u201d or \u201cpellucid and mellifluous,\u201d he observes: \u201cI wrote that as a bit of self-\u00admockery \u2014 ironic deflation as a way of deflecting charges of vanity.\u201d The real issue, however, is that the only passages he takes the time to read closely are his own.

Yet even while it imposes a finished form onto experience, the novel also lends perpetual life to all the ungainly details, the stuff that doesn\u2019t make sense while it is happening. Offering characteristically sensitive readings of Penelope Fitzgerald, Chekhov, De Quincey and others, Wood\u2019s latest book also features grand pronouncements about literature of the kind that have provoked accusations that he is old-fashioned. In this case, however, he presents a more vulnerable, approachable version of himself by including details about his own life, as a boy in England and as a father living in Boston. Describing a memorial service for a friend\u2019s brother, he observes: \u201cIn some terrible way, his death was the notable, the heroic fact of his short life.\u201d That Wood is thinking about his own life, his own eventual death and his fears about both is evident; that he chooses to do so in such a dispassionate fashion, by writing about a deceased stranger, yields a clue as to why he needs literature and what kind of solace it offers him."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/us/politics/john-kasich-balances-his-blue-collar-roots-and-ties-to-wall-street.html": ["COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 As the people of Ohio already know \u2014 and Republican voters elsewhere are just beginning to find out \u2014 Gov. John R. Kasich grew up in working-class McKees Rocks, Pa., the son of a postal worker and the grandson of a coal miner. His grandfather was so poor, Mr. Kasich recently told voters in New Hampshire, that he would bring home scraps of his lunch to share with his children.", "\u201cThey would even be able to taste the coal mine in that lunch,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cSome of you can relate to that.\u201d", "As a congressman and as governor, Mr. Kasich has made hardscrabble stories of life in McKees Rocks a cornerstone of his political biography. And now the story of his blue-collar roots is an important part of how he is trying to distinguish himself in a crowded presidential primary field and draw a contrast with two of his leading competitors, Donald J. Trump and Jeb Bush, who grew up in wealthy families.", "But there is a chapter in Mr. Kasich\u2019s life story that conflicts with this narrative: the nearly eight years he spent as an investment banker with Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm. Mr. Kasich\u2019s career at Lehman, neatly tucked between his time as a congressman and his election as governor, coincided with the bank\u2019s messy collapse in September 2008, a downfall that helped throw the American economy into free fall.", "Matthew Dowd, the former chief strategist for President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign, who today considers himself an independent, says Mr. Kasich has the potential to emerge as a favorite of establishment Republicans \u2014 and a credible general election threat to Democrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2014 but only if he distances himself from Wall Street.", "\u201cThe base of the Republican Party right now is blue-collar, frustrated white males,\u201d Mr. Dowd said, \u201cand that group is angry at big government and angry at Wall Street.\u201d", "Far from treating his time at Lehman as a liability, however, Mr. Kasich has embraced it since announcing his candidacy last month, making it part of the image he seeks to project of a common-sense Midwesterner who can empathize with economic anxieties and has the business experience to allay them.", "\u201cI want to talk about it,\u201d he told voters recently. \u201cBecause I actually understand how job creators make decisions, and that\u2019s really, really critical if you want to be involved in economic growth.\u201d", "That explanation worked well for Mr. Kasich during his campaign for governor in 2010, when memories of the financial crisis in this recession-battered state were still painfully fresh.", "Democrats saw his Wall Street ties as a weakness, but Mr. Kasich managed to turn a potential vulnerability into a strength, beating the incumbent Democrat, Ted Strickland, by pledging to make Ohio\u2019s government \u201cmove at the speed of business.\u201d", "Mr. Kasich, who with his wife has assets worth between $9 million and $22 million, according to a recent financial disclosure, is hardly the only 2016 Republican hopeful with business ties. Mr. Trump has flaunted his success and wealth, and Mr. Bush advised Lehman, earning $1.3 million a year for two years from the firm. (Mr. Kasich, whose 2008 tax return showed roughly $600,000 in salary and bonus from Lehman, recalls that their paths crossed there once, during a meeting with an industrial client in Wisconsin.)", "But for Mr. Kasich, business was more a second career after a long string of successes in politics. He left Congress in January 2001 after an 18-year career that included a role as one of Newt Gingrich\u2019s lieutenants when he was House speaker, a stint as House Budget Committee chairman and a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.", "A friend helped him land an interview at Lehman Brothers.", "\u201cI came away thinking: interesting guy, not like a major door-opener,\u201d recalled Gary Weinstein, who interviewed him and became his boss. As to what the congressman knew about banking, Mr. Weinstein said, \u201cZero. It was shocking to me.\u201d", "Working in Columbus out of a two-man office, Mr. Kasich struggled at first to gain acceptance from New York bankers who seemed to have little use for him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t welcome him into the club,\u201d said Wilber James, the friend who helped arrange the interview.", "But Mr. Kasich could still open some doors. He took bankers to California to meet Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive and a former Treasury Department official, which led to a small role for Lehman in Google\u2019s 2004 public stock offering.", "Here in Ohio, Mr. Kasich got Lehman involved in the public offering for Designer Shoe Warehouse, or DSW, a Columbus-based shoe retailer founded by the Schottenstein family, which employed Mr. Kasich after Lehman\u2019s demise.", "Mr. Kasich also made introductions for Lehman to Ohio state pension funds, which drew the ire of Democrats after the funds lost hundreds of millions of dollars in ill-fated investments with the bank. Mr. Kasich has said his contacts did not result in any business for Lehman.", "But friends say Mr. Kasich was most captivated \u2014 and perhaps influenced \u2014 by his work in Silicon Valley, where he had grown close to Mark Kvamme, a venture capitalist. \u201cYou\u2019re from Silicon Valley. Are you rich?\u201d Mr. Kvamme recalls the blunt Mr. Kasich asking when they first met.", "Mr. Kvamme made introductions to other venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs, and over time, Mr. Kasich and his longtime aide, Jai Chabria, the other half of the two-man Lehman operation in Columbus, eventually managed relationships with 45 companies.", "Then, in 2008, Lehman collapsed, a victim of its own risky mortgage investments, which Mr. Kasich said did not involve him. \u201cI was a banker,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t offering home loans to anybody.\u201d", "Like other Lehman employees who held stock options, Mr. Kasich lost money when the firm collapsed.

What he gained, he said, was an understanding \u201cof the way C.E.O.s think.\u201d", "As governor, Mr. Kasich quickly put that understanding to use \u2014 and drew criticism from Democrats who said that he brought a Wall Street mentality to the job. With varying degrees of success, he pushed a series of economic initiatives, including a proposal to sell state prisons and use the Ohio Turnpike to issue bonds.", "But perhaps his most contentious decision was to dismantle the state\u2019s economic development agency and replace it with a private entity, JobsOhio, and put Mr. Kvamme in charge. Critics say the governor positioned his friend to benefit \u2014 an accusation Mr. Kvamme, who earned just $1 a year to run JobsOhio and now runs a venture capital firm, dismisses as \u201csilly.\u201d", "As JobsOhio offered tax incentives and other inducements to lure companies to relocate or expand in Ohio, Democrats and advocates for openness in government complained it was cutting deals in secret. David Yost, the state auditor and a Republican, called for greater transparency in the agency\u2019s activities, though Mr. Kasich insisted that JobsOhio was \u201cvery transparent.\u201d", "But, said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, \u201chis mind-set was, \u2018I\u2019m just going to do what a business does, and if that means not sharing information, that\u2019s fine \u2014 if that means hiring buddies, that\u2019s fine too.\u2019 \u201d", "Today, as Mr. Kasich\u2019s campaign seems to be gaining some traction in the early primary state of New Hampshire, Democrats \u2014 especially here in Ohio \u2014 are working hard to remind voters of his Lehman past. When Mr. Kasich vowed to reform Social Security by giving younger Americans \u201can opportunity to earn money through the strength of our American economy,\u201d the Ohio Democratic Party accused him of trying to hand \u201cSocial Security funds over to the same Wall Street banks that caused the Great Recession \u2014 and coincidentally turned Kasich into a millionaire.\u201d", "Mr. Kasich shrugs it off. His strategy is, as it has always been, to strike an aw-shucks tone, and invoke roots in McKees Rocks.", "\u201cI made more money than I ever thought I would make in something like that, and I\u2019m thankful for my experience,\u201d he said of his time at Lehman, expressing astonishment that \u201clittle Johnny Kasich\u201d had come so far. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve looked at McKees Rocks, but it\u2019s been an amazing journey.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/pageoneplus/corrections-august-6-2015.html": ["FRONT PAGE", "An article on Monday about a Chinese yarn manufacturer\u2019s opening of a cotton yarn mill in South Carolina misstated the month the mill opened.

It is an artifact of a border dispute of long standing, and neither Serbia nor Croatia expresses a desire to rule over this unprepossessing Gibraltar-size property. The land, marshy and prone to seasonal inundation, is choked with unregulated scrub, with here and there the lone tongue of a poplar or the gentle shag of a willow. The only road is a rutted single-lane dirt track, the only existing dwelling a flimsy hunting hovel, its provenance unknown.", "The absence of governmental authority on this land is due to the manipulated course of the Danube itself. By the late 19th century, the Danube was accepted as the natural border between the regions \u2014 at that point still under Austro-Hungarian control \u2014 that would become Croatia and Serbia. There, however, the river\u2019s path was tortuous and difficult for larger boats to navigate, so engineering work was undertaken to smooth the snaking flow. The straightened Danube was a vast improvement for international riverine transport, but in the process, four large uncontiguous bulges of Croatia became stranded alone on the Serbian side, and one small pocket of Serbia, on what was now the far bank, became attached to the Croatian mass.", "This latter pocket, which local residents call Gornja Siga, is the no man\u2019s land in question. When the two countries were neighboring republics of Yugoslavia, these orphaned riverbank plots were of little concern, but since the 1990s they have presented an intractable problem. The stranded pieces of Croatia now contiguous with Serbia are some 10 times larger, in aggregate, than the rather trifling portion of Serbia now joined to Croatia; Serbia has been all too glad to assume ownership of its expanded territory, but Croatia sees the situation as unacceptable. In light of this ongoing disagreement, for Croatia to accept Gornja Siga would constitute a de facto recognition of the Serbian view of the border and a relinquishing of Croatia\u2019s claim to the more considerable, though equally mosquito-infested and uninspiring, portions of Serbian bank.", "And yet Gornja Siga has come, over the last few months, to assume an outsize role in the imagination of many \u2014 not only in Europe, but also in the Middle East and in the United States. Its mere existence as a land unburdened by deed or ruler has become cause for great jubilation. There are few things more uplifting than the promise that we might start over, that we might live in the early days of a better nation. All the most recent states \u2014 South Sudan, East Timor, Eritrea \u2014 were carved from existing sovereignties in the wake of bitter civil wars. Here, by contrast, is a truly empty parcel. What novel society might be accomplished in a place like this, with no national claim or tenant? Such were the thoughts that had for some time inflamed the spirit of Vit Jedlicka, a 31-year-old Czech politician who traveled to the land earlier this year and, in broad daylight, planted a new flag in its unstable soil.", "It was not the first tract he had considered. Previously, Jedlicka had rejected as too small a plot on the Slovenian-Croatian border, and as too inconvenient, dangerous and arid a dominion between Sudan and Egypt, which was subsequently declared the Kingdom of North Sudan by an American named Jeremiah Heaton, who traveled there by caravan to declare his daughter a princess, though his nation remained unrecognized by any other world government. What instantly differentiated Jedlicka\u2019s aspirations from the minor follies of Heaton and other micronational leaders \u2014 of Flandrensis, the Dominion of Melchizedek, North Dumpling Island \u2014 is that he had stumbled upon acreage of what may genuinely be unclaimed land.", "And so, on April 13, 2015, he and his exploratory committee read, in English and Czech, the following proclamation:", "We, the members of the Preparatory Committee of the State of the Free Republic of Liberland, issue this proclamation:", "We, by virtue of the right to self-determination, right of discovery and the right of self-governance, proclaim the existence of the Free Republic of Liberland. The Free Republic is a free and independent country; and that as a free and independent state, the Free Republic of Liberland shall have the full power to defend itself, conclude peace, form alliances, establish commerce, and enjoy any other rights which sovereign states have. As a member of the family of nations, we pledge to abide by international laws that bind all states in existence.", "Jedlicka had long dreamed of such a proclamation. An avowed small-government libertarian and euroskeptic, he searched for two years for suitable territory on which to establish Liberland. The man he intermittently calls minister of information technology eventually discovered the plot via consultation of the \u2018\u2018terra nullius\u2019\u2019 entry on Wikipedia. According to the homestead principle, as well as the rules stipulated by the Montevideo Convention of 1933, Jedlicka felt the land was technically his after the flag-planting rite, carried out by Jedlicka, his girlfriend and a college friend. Though he claims he did not seek political office himself, and he in fact recused himself from the initial round of voting, Jedlicka was immediately elected the nation\u2019s first president by a vote of two to zero.", "In the days that followed his proclamation, President Jedlicka was unsurprised and unembarrassed by the dismissals of the international community; he knew recognition would come with time, once the land was properly settled and his intentions were made clear. The day after he declared independence, the Serbian government released a communiqu\u00e9 that declared the birth of the new nation to be a \u2018\u2018frivolous act\u2019\u2019 that it was prepared to ignore. Croatia\u2019s official position was that it considered Liberland to be \u2018\u2018a joke.\u2019\u2019 When Jedlicka, soon after his election, tried to approach the Croatian foreign minister in Zagreb to talk over the matter, he says her bodyguards blocked his advances, and she fled on foot.", "The President is a sturdy man of thickening athletic build, with blond hair and a reddish blond goatee that diminishes up his high-colored cheeks into blond peach fuzz and then asserts itself anew as bright blond bushy eyebrows over long platinum lashes. He is a soft-spoken, gentle ruler, well mannered and with a schoolboyish eagerness to please. For the first three weeks after the flag-planting ceremony, he and his founding committee could come and go from Liberland as they liked. He spent most of his time at the first Liberlandian Embassy, in Prague, a terraced apartment in the sun atop a hillside not far from Wenceslas Square that is also his home. (Jedlicka enjoys the free and casual use of such terms as \u2018\u2018embassy,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018ambassador\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018minister,\u2019\u2019 though in his more legalistic moods, he is careful to qualify all of them with the adjective \u2018\u2018future.\u2019\u2019) Then, on weekends, he drove the eight hours to Liberland at his leisure.", "By May 8, though, which Jedlicka had planned as Liberation Day, his initial command of the situation had begun to erode. Domestically, the legitimacy of his administration was being challenged by a group that called itself the Liberland Settlement Association. The L.S.A., led by a Danish Bitcoin trader living in Switzerland, took at face value the President\u2019s initial declaration of Liberland as a radical libertarian experiment: They moved quickly to settle Liberland themselves, on the premise that it was as much theirs as anyone\u2019s. On the foreign-policy front, meanwhile, the Croatians lost their patience with the increasingly aggressive and populous homesteaders and were denying entry to Liberland. Croatian police apprehended all Liberlanders who attempted to enter. Jedlicka was arrested and thrown in jail twice.", "As a resilient type and an incurable optimist, the President was prepared to forget the various diplomatic affronts, and he quickly came to view the situation with Croatia in a positive light. He had learned from his extensive experience with social media that all attention is good attention and that even no attention could still be considered, at the very least, some attention.", "\u2018\u2018If they help us, they help us,\u2019\u2019 he calmly explained to his ambassadorial team in Paris, which, along with most of his international supporters, took a rather dimmer view of the Croatian question than he did. \u2018\u2018If they ignore us, they help us. If they harm us, they help us.\u2019\u2019", "What further ballooned the President\u2019s spirits amid the national conflict was the great pneuma of world solidarity. Within just a few weeks, he had received, via the Internet, more than 330,000 applications for citizenship. He had posted the citizenship application online in two parts, an initial registration and a subsequent questionnaire. The questionnaire asked if the applicant had a criminal history; if he or she was in debt; was respectful of the property of others; was interested in investing money in Liberland; was a member of an extremist group; if he or she wanted to reside in Liberland itself, and, if so, how. About 40,000 of the initial registrants filled out the entire questionnaire. Final citizenship, for the moment, remained in Jedlicka\u2019s hands, and by June he had awarded only about 130 of what he was referring to (pending constitutional confirmation) as honorary citizenships, mostly to those who showed the greatest commitment to the cause. Liberland was, after all, a tiny nation; he feared his experiment would implode under the weight of too many citizens right away.", "The President imagined that the majority of freedom-loving interest would come from those seeking greater freedom in general, as opposed to political freedoms in particular, so he had not necessarily expected that the overwhelming interest in his nation would come from North Africa and the Middle East. The greatest number of registrants \u2014 82,167 \u2014 came from Egypt. After the Egyptians, the most represented were the Turks, who almost certainly included Syrian refugees; after that came Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. The Czech Republic was seventh, followed by the United States. Then it was Iraq and Jordan. Jedlicka was both proud of this fact and slightly troubled by it. Still, his first principle was that Liberland should stand for the free movement of persons \u2014 with the exception of neo-Nazis, communists and convicted felons \u2014 as well as goods and capital; the question of political asylum, like many other small details of refined governance, could be safely worked out down the line, once the land was delivered from Croatian tyranny.", "Jedlicka proclaimed that in Liberland \u2018\u2018government will be banned except for three things: security, legal stuff and diplomacy.\u2019\u2019 His more specific platform was in constant flux, as he fielded suggestions and emendations from his supporters, but the pillars of his libertarianism were minimal government, complete privatization of schools and health care, voluntary taxation in the form of crowdfunded state expenditures and cryptocurrency. On some issues, he felt that more discussion was needed before he could divine the proper position. There was, for example, the matter of immigration. On the one hand, the President believed in the free movement of people; on the other, he understood that many fellow libertarians and euroskeptics believed that unrestricted immigration, particularly by economic migrants and refugees, placed too great a burden on a community created to beget wealth. On this and similar questions, he left the door open to spirited debate.", "Before any of these questions could be addressed, however, he had to advance Part 1 of his plan for establishing Liberland as a sovereign state: namely, to gain physical control over the territory. This had already proved more perplexing than anticipated. The Croatians regarded Liberland as Serbian territory; if you crossed overland, from the Croatian side, you were thus performing an illegal international crossing outside an official border checkpoint. If you crossed by water from the Serbian side, the Croatian police were technically arresting someone for crossing from Serbia to Serbia. The L.S.A. decided that mass arrests would inevitably bring international attention to the Croatian infringement on Liberlandian sovereignty, but the President knew firsthand the discomfort of the Croatian prison, and he did not want any more of his future citizens to suffer there. His tactic would be diplomatic, and he had to that end sought an alliance with a Czech member of the European Parliament. If the Croatian police arrested the holder of a diplomatic passport upon debarkation, they would provoke an incident with global repercussions; Liberland was a voluntary signatory to various international treaties and charters, and the Croatian provocation would not go unnoticed. The diplomat, Tomas Zdechovsky, a Czech member of the European Parliament, had agreed to the mission, which was to be held on a weekend in early June. The diplomat would attempt a landing at Liberland \u2014 which for a month no Liberlandian citizen or supporter had done without immediate arrest \u2014 and see if the Croatian police were willing to subject themselves to the scrutiny of the international community.", "The first diplomatic mission to Liberland convened at the Prague airport\u2019s old Terminal 1. The flight would be aboard AIR-Liberland, which was not a state asset but a private enterprise contracted to provide regular air service to the Croatian castle city of Osijek, about 20 miles overland from Liberland. Jedlicka had secured, by virtue of this arrangement, a lifetime of free personal transit on the airline. For him, the gesture comported with the dignity of his office, but to his detractors, it recalled the kind of crony capitalism that Liberland had been invented to circumvent.", "Though not vain, the President is a man of probity, always conscious of the freshness and propriety of his appearance, and he wore a pressed azure suit with a slight shine; the diplomat wore a blazer with a sewn-in pocket square in maroon and blue. Zdechovsky describes himself as a politician, crisis manager, media analyst, author and poet; he is an acquaintance of Jedlicka\u2019s from the bruising small-town politics of central Bohemia, where they campaigned against each other in the last European parliamentary elections.", "The aircraft was given an approach to Osijek over Liberland itself, and the President took a series of selfies with the sandy beach of Liberty Island, a soft crescent in the waters just off Liberland proper, in the background. It was his personal favorite geographical feature of his country. When he thinks of its sucrose shores, which had been host to his early presidential cavorting and now lay just beyond his reach, he is often moved to comment that \u2018\u2018Liberland is not just a tax paradise, it is also a paradise of a sort.\u2019\u2019", "On the drive from Osijek to the Croatian border checkpoint, Jedlicka fielded more than two dozen calls, answering each one with the phrase, \u2018\u2018Yes, this is the president.\u2019\u2019 Many of his contacts had never reached a head of state with so little intermediatory fuss. The President had more than a hundred messages via at least six apps to respond to and had to restart his phone more than once when its circuits needed cooling. He had left his own reserve battery on AIR-Liberland, so he borrowed a white power brick from a Canadian-Slovak named Vince Pillar, one of the President\u2019s growing cadre of assistants, who moved through life in a cloud of sweet banana-chocolate vape exhaust; the cable was too short, so Jedlicka had to hold both the brick and his phone to his ear to talk. We drove by the land entrance to Liberland, which for weeks was blocked by a compact white police car.", "After about an hour, Jedlicka\u2019s entourage arrived at the Liberlandian base camp, a sagging military tarpaulin stretched into a tent over a little field half-cleared of brambles on the Serbian side, about two miles upstream from Liberland itself. There were engine problems with Liberland\u2019s official boat, so the mission was delayed until another boat could be made available. On the far side of the river, 850 yards away, the peaks of squat orange-roofed Croatian houses crouched behind a large defensive embankment were visible. The thick berm had been built to protect against the river\u2019s flood season, as well as the mosquitoes that bred without regulation in the bogs. As we waited, someone shooed one of the wild boars, a prodigious sow running impressively free of governance, back into the thick brush.", "In the distance we could at last spy a small metal dinghy speeding north from Liberland toward the camp. The men and women from the boat hopped ashore, the tallest of the five waving a Liberland flag the size of a bedsheet. He was a tall man of considerable bulk, with long, thick hair swept back underneath a fraying straw cap and a Guy Fawkes beard. He wore a thin white short-sleeved dress shirt with an open collar and a Rolex tight around his wrist; at his collar\u2019s notch he wore a gunmetal medallion, with bas-relief imagery of a skull wearing a top hat alongside a gun. This was Niklas Nikolajsen, the director of the Liberland Settlement Association.", "A Danish software engineer who now describes himself as a Bitcoin broker, Nikolajsen founded the L.S.A. just days after Jedlicka declared the establishment of Liberland. He was suspicious of the President\u2019s self-declared presidency and decided to stake his own claim. The L.S.A. was incorporated in Switzerland as a limited-\u00adliability company, but it had quickly matured into an autonomous faction of political hooligans that now rivaled the President\u2019s authority.", "Nikolajsen lived in Zug, a small mountainous canton of Switzerland. He paid a tax rate of only about 4 percent, perhaps one of the lowest rates in all of Europe. But what if, Nikolajsen asked himself, \u2018\u2018you could even improve on that?\u2019\u2019 This wasn\u2019t just a selfish thought, though he wouldn\u2019t mind paying no taxes; it was also about all of those people who for some reason couldn\u2019t live in Switzerland. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re sitting somewhere nice, you think, Well, you could spread freedom,\u2019\u2019 he said. The idea had particular appeal in the context of the Balkans, where a byzantine regulatory apparatus allowed for a flourishing lawlessness. \u2018\u2018In many European languages, when things are really bad and bureaucratic, you call it \u2018Balkan conditions,\u2019 and there\u2019s a reason for it,\u2019\u2019 Nikolajsen said.", "Despite the fragile entente between the President and the L.S.A., there were undercurrents of soft-power maneuvering on both sides, and the threat of schism remained. Earlier that month, the L.S.A. posted an aggressive piece on its website titled \u2018\u2018Liberland\u2019s Constitution: Is It Libertarian Enough?\u2019\u2019 It subtly undermined Jedlicka at every turn, suggesting that he might not be as freethinking as advertised. Where the President had wanted a clause prohibiting public assembly that infringed upon the rights of others, the L.S.A. worried this would be used as a way of \u2018\u2018squashing protests.\u2019\u2019 More alarming, the President seemed to imply, in an article relating to the denial of gun permits to the mentally ill, that there might be any procedure at all to license firearms. The L.S.A. objected, along similar ideological lines, to Jedlicka\u2019s provision that the poor might have the right to gratis legal representation.", "Nikolajsen understood that the real promise and the real threat of Liberland was as a libertarian free-for-all: the Croatians feared an armed redoubt of brothels and meth labs, and they were right to worry. \u2018\u2018I created a hundred thousand shares of the company,\u2019\u2019 he bragged to me. \u2018\u2018I sold them all out to investors in the first 40 hours. Everybody wanted a piece. I never sold anything so fast. That\u2019s when I knew this was serious. You can always trust a market. You can\u2019t trust yourself, you can\u2019t trust your mother, but you can trust a market, because it shows you that what you have is something everybody wants.\u2019\u2019", "At last the first diplomatic mission was ready to begin. Nikolajsen turned to Zdechovsky, the diplomat, as the company prepared to walk down to the boat, and admitted something that must have lingered uncomfortably in the minds of many freedom-loving settlers: \u2018\u2018I have often been euroskeptic. But today I am totally for the European Union!\u2019\u2019", "With the official state vessel out of commission, the small metal dinghy had to fit eight people. It theoretically had a maximum capacity of six, but the President found he was unable to say no to the four teams of documentary filmmakers who didn\u2019t want to miss such crucial footage. The diplomat unwrapped four containers of kebab, chop and sausage, and laid them out attractively on very thin paper plates. The party picked at the food while waiting for a young Austrian in a blood-lettered shirt of a band called Ulcerate, a recent arrival Jedlicka hadn\u2019t yet met, to inflate a rubber raft for use in a landing.", "Nikolajsen stood on the shore, eyeing the raft grimly. He knew that the Croatian police would seize it as part of their ongoing campaign of punitive asset forfeiture. He and the President have profoundly varying notions about what might constitute a libertarian state, but they share an appreciation for national pageantry and its props. He called out, \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve been losing two flags and two rubber boats a day.\u2019\u2019", "The President looked to Nikolajsen. \u2018\u2018Can we have a flag?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018If you promise to give it back.\u2019\u2019 Nikolajsen fingered his gunmetal medallion and bit his lower lip. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s my last one.\u2019\u2019", "The President reassured him. \u2018\u2018I have more in my bag.\u2019\u2019", "The diplomat, an official of ambition delighted to be at the center of this special and unprecedented mission, swept his hand across the meat. Its grease had soaked through the paper plates and onto the weathered wooden bench. The aroma of the patties had the distinct ranginess of horse. \u2018\u2018Do you want something to eat?\u2019\u2019 he asked.", "The dinghy set off at speed downstream, with the President and the diplomat in the stern taking turns at the rudder. They could barely see anything in front of the boat for all of the filmmakers and photographers, and they had to swerve so as not to hit the concrete pylon that supported the border bridge. The boat quickly slowed, however, and Jedlicka looked back to find that the raft trailing behind on its leash was filling with loden green river water.", "The President sighed. He looked down at his textured brown oxfords, polished just this morning and now caked in gray mud. He and the Austrian hauled the raft up into the dinghy, where it rested between two filmmakers. He shrugged and regained his good cheer, throwing his arms up in anticipation of victory. \u2018\u2018These are the obstacles creating a new nation!\u2019\u2019", "The dinghy came around a bend in the river, the sun lower in the sky and the light a soft violet on the green width of the river, and the President stood up and laid his hand on the raft to take in the sight of his country. He had studied the poses of George Washington, whose likeness in oil graced the official Liberland Facebook page. Jedlicka beached the dinghy on a small sandbar just north of the Liberland-Croatia border. Black scathing cumuli of mosquitoes formed a needling vapor in the boat.", "Jedlicka took the pump and reinflated the raft, which had gone soft in the dinghy. \u2018\u2018This,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018is how presidential work is done in the field.\u2019\u2019 His azure suit was soiled with sludge, and when he wiped the sweat from his brow, his hand emerged striped with black arthropod entrails and jags of the blood of his face.", "There was a flurry of activity on the boat. With the raft back in the water and out of the way, all assembled could see before the dinghy, on its starboard side, a white boat with a blue tarp and antenna equipment. In clean blue lettering stenciled on the side, the boat identified itself as Policija. A man in a blue uniform and blue cap gazed at the dinghy through binoculars. A second policeman worked the radio on the bridge. The President stood up and waved. The boats drew up beside each other, and their bows plinked lightly.", "The President spoke amiably. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re sending a diplomat now to measure our borders.\u2019\u2019", "The diplomat said, \u2018\u2018I am from European Parliament.\u2019\u2019", "The policeman was impassive. \u2018\u2018What are your intentions please?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Now?\u2019\u2019 the President asked. The policeman nodded. \u2018\u2018We send diplomat to measure borders.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018I will warn you,\u2019\u2019 the policeman said, repeating some lines in English. \u2018\u2018Everyone who steps on the right side of the river will be arrested. This border is not defined. It is in dispute. Croatia defines one way, Serbia other way.\u2019\u2019", "The diplomat got involved. \u2018\u2018You must respect my mandate. There is European law here.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018We are not here to discuss with you,\u2019\u2019 the police official said. \u2018\u2018Everyone will be arrested.\u2019\u2019 He hesitated, then pointed at the diplomat. \u2018\u2018Except you. Your diplomatic passport protects you. We will inform our minister, and he will inform your home state.\u2019\u2019 The policeman seemed glad to be rid of these sentences.", "The two boats continued to slowly circle each other amid the squalls of mosquitoes. The diplomat boarded the raft, with one of the documentary filmmakers, and they set off toward the Liberlandian bank, a gently sloping mud beach under a low canopy of dense foliage. The President started the engine and swung the dinghy, now much lighter, toward the center of the river. The two policemen tied their boat to a tree and went ashore.", "The Austrian was encouraged. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re busy on the shore. We can go to Liberty Island and plant flag.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Yeah,\u2019\u2019 Jedlicka said, \u2018\u2018but you\u2019d get arrested.\u2019\u2019 Happy with the success of the mission thus far, he was in no mood to countenance more bodily sacrifice. The young filmmaker who went ashore did not look prepared to spend the night in a dank, windowless cell of the border garrison, where 28 L.S.A. affiliates had already spent at least one night. The President swooped the dinghy in doughnuts around the middle of the river, peering over to see what was happening beneath the forest canopy. He smiled broadly, and two mosquitoes landed as black marks on his white teeth. On the shore, the policemen were arresting the filmmaker and escorting the diplomat to their boat.", "As we set off upstream in the pinkening green, the President stood in the stern, sunburned, his face blotchy and cratered with scratched bites, his blond hair darkened by sweat and matted down. Roots extended from the eroded Serbian banks like long gnarled brooms, while the trees on the Croatian bank cast dark and extravagant emblems on the placid Danube.", "The Ryanair flight to London gave the President his first time to think in several days. He felt, it was clear, that what was required at this clotted, uncertain juncture was a sense of destiny. The only way he could retake full control from the L.S.A. and rally his own troops against the threat of Croatian incursion was to offer his followers a strong and coherent vision for how the nation would be established.", "What the President already knew was the following: The nation would be run by a legislative assembly of 20 individuals, but all laws could be vetoed by public referendum. He already had a designer\u2019s rendering of the future parliament building. It looked like a ranch house with an enormous porch, its roof arched in segments like a scaly fish in flight. \u2018\u2018The entire government,\u2019\u2019 Jedlicka insisted, \u2018\u2018will fit into this building, and will not ever grow larger.\u2019\u2019 As far as future construction went, there were varying points of view on how many people could fit on Liberland itself, but at least one artist on the Internet had imagined a hyperdense city of towering skyscrapers. Liberland was mostly marsh, however, and Jedlicka was not sure about the price of the necessary pylons. Beyond that issue, it was important to him that people not forget that his project was not solely about this small parcel of boar-crossed, mosquito-fogged swampland. This was a unique opportunity to create a worldwide movement for freedom \u2014 a way to distribute freedom instead of just concentrating it in this small state.", "Exactly how to further this objective was on the President\u2019s mind en route to London. With his mobile phone on airplane mode and his Bluetooth headset stowed, the future of Liberland came upon him as a revelation. The country\u2019s fate rested in his ability to construct a vast online work-flow app. Its integrated user interface would optimize the operations necessary to realize nationhood. It would render public the assigning and fulfillment of the remaining tasks; connect Liberlandians to one another, for cooperative purposes, via a messaging-and-commenting system; and streamline the gratification of logistical needs via a full-dress reservation portal for flights, buses, taxis and lodging.", "Though the whole thing sounded complicated, the site design itself would be simple and intuitive. It would resemble an organizational table. Each column would represent a country, and the rows would be labeled with necessary positions: ambassador, financial minister, photographer, videographer, publicity person. Each cell would then be color coded: green would indicate a task assigned and completed, yellow a task merely assigned and red a task in need of the application of industry. Carrying out tasks would earn points, which could then be put toward the purchase of citizenship. This plan, the President believed, would create a currency that, despite the absence of a central bank or a foundational debt, would have value from the beginning: It would be tied to the labor of nation-building and would unleash extraordinary energy toward that end. The name of the currency was also revealed to him on the meditative Ryanair journey: the Liberlandian merit. His would be the planet\u2019s first fully merit-based country.", "Despite an unusually hard landing, it was the President, in his crystalline, buzzing elation, who began to clap, with charisma; the rest of the cabin, dazed and a little rattled, soon fell in behind him with applause.", "Jedlicka was greeted by a future citizen holding a Liberland sign complete with national insignia. He was a handsome, tanned, bald man of about 40, and he wore a short purple tie, hung loosely about his collar, over an untucked pinstriped shirt. The aspiring citizen, Jay Picard, said he felt completely overdressed, and removed his tie by drawing the intact loop over his head. He was as eager and nervous to meet the President as the President was to meet him. Liberland already had an official embassy and ambassador in France and Slovenia, but the President had yet to find someone in Britain he could trust with local leadership.", "Picard showed Jedlicka to a racing-striped Mini Cooper, in which he had driven to the airport from his sometime home in Bath at, he claimed, more than 100 m.p.h. He turned toward the trunk, revealing a large tattoo of a bar code on the back of his head. \u2018\u2018The bar code,\u2019\u2019 he explained, \u2018\u2018is basically to say, \u2018I\u2019m not owned by the government.\u2019 I don\u2019t like to be a subject of the country.\u2019\u2019", "As he took Jedlicka\u2019s bag, he drew attention to the Liberland decal he had affixed to the rear bumper.", "\u2018\u2018Where did you buy that?\u2019\u2019 Jedlicka asked. Though the President claimed to have pledges from investors \u2014 sometimes he said $2 billion, other times $20 billion \u2014 the nation\u2019s primary revenue stream was through merchandising, and he might have preferred to retain an incidental state monopoly for the time being, or at the very least tributary payments.", "\u2018\u2018Oh, I just printed it right off the Internet!\u2019\u2019", "As the Mini exited the airport, the car filled with the banana-chocolate vape exhaust of Pillar, the Canadian-Slovak assistant. Pillar had almost been stranded in Osijek, because the President\u2019s assistant in Prague, Kristyna Nedvedova, forgot to check him in for the flight in advance. (Nedvedova disputes this, claiming that the President continually fails to pass along the necessary information.)", "The relationship among the President\u2019s many assistants resembled his broader problem in his attempt to consolidate his power base: He sought strength in numbers, told people what they wanted to hear and figured that envy and disagreement would resolve themselves down the line.", "Pillar puffed on his vape pen, and Picard took this as an opportunity to offer the passengers his own vape pen, which contained a solution of pure cannabis oil mixed with a lovely blueberry flavor. Picard told us that he used it to take the edge off a recent flight from Oslo; he had problems with the British government, in fact he owed them quite a bit of money, and he was nation-shopping. He liked Norway, but his ideal refuge would be a place like Liberland.", "Jedlicka was trying to change the shared Google Calendar time of the London meeting on his phone, but his roaming data service was unreliable. Picard took his hands off the steering wheel to pick up his own phone to broadcast as a local 3G hot spot. Jedlicka asked for the password.", "\u2018\u2018O.K., the key phrase is, first p, as in \u2018president,\u2019 then a zero, then, uh, r, n as in Nancy, s, and the ending is t, a, r. That\u2019s, uh, pornstar, but with a zero instead of the o.\u2019\u2019", "Jedlicka looked up from his phone and gazed at Picard. At times it seemed clear that the President felt minor but nagging doubts about the personnel decisions he had made. His tendency was to reward alacrity. When he advertised, on Facebook, for a Czech assistant who spoke English, the first person to reply was Nedvedova, a college student in Birmingham. Unfortunately, she still had two weeks of the semester left before she could return to Prague. The President said he needed someone immediately. She left school early, which made a vivid impression on the energetic young President. He had found, however, that it was not always easy to get in touch with her. And there were the frequent airport check-in problems.", "Still, the President needed a local vizier, and Picard had driven very far through a good deal of traffic. \u2018\u2018I will make you,\u2019\u2019 Jedlicka intoned, \u2018\u2018the leader of Liberland in Great Britain.\u2019\u2019", "The pub, along the high street in Hampstead, was upscale, the clientele smartly outfitted for a Friday evening. Picard dropped off Jedlicka and went to park the car. Pillar puffed on his banana-chocolate vape pen out front and began asking people if they had heard of Liberland. \u2018\u2018No? Well, do you like paying taxes?\u2019\u2019", "The President moved past him and into the pub, which he toured in a quick circle, his phone and battery brick held together to his ear. He took a seat at a table outside. His supporters were probably just late because of the traffic. After a time, the President was approached, with some trepidation, by two men in their mid-30s, with unlined faces, one of them with a conservative style of refined fauxhawk, the other bald. They were neatly kitted out for a night at a downtempo lounge. The one wearing the fauxhawk introduced himself as Martin. Martin asked the first question that the President is usually asked: How did he come to discover Liberland?", "Jedlicka, still dazzled by the radiant vision of an integrated user-login platform-portal, was eager to engage his subjects on the concrete matter of the future, not on the country\u2019s Wikipedia origin. \u2018\u2018Oh, yes, we did research, we somehow came over this piece of land, and we said, \u2018O.K., Let\u2019s take it,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018The next day, the Serbian government released a statement saying, \u2018We don\u2019t mind it, but it\u2019s a frivolous act.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Jedlicka laughed. \u2018\u2018What does that mean, \u2018frivolous\u2019 \u2014 like, of free will?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Not really,\u2019\u2019 Martin began, but the President had already leapt ahead.", "\u2018\u2018It will be like a large grid, with a row for each nation, and it will show the tasks and the titles,\u2019\u2019 he said, explaining the color-coding system for proper task management. \u2018\u2018It will be like a world collection of shadow governments, with a full Liberland cabinet in each place doing everything that needs to be done. Ambassador, photographer, videographer, P.R. guy.\u2019\u2019", "Martin pressed for details beyond the integrated Internet grid. \u2018\u2018But how,\u2019\u2019 he asked, \u2018\u2018are you going to do this? There\u2019s a claim from other governments \u2014 \u2019\u2019", "Jedlicka cut him off. \u2018\u2018No, there aren\u2019t.\u2019\u2019 He said that Croatia could not sensibly claim the land on behalf of Serbia. \u2018\u2018What Croatia did was recognize our borders by putting police there. That did more for us than the Serbians.\u2019\u2019 If everything went according to his plan, he added, \u2018\u2018We will inhabit the land by the sixth of September.\u2019\u2019 It would be the President\u2019s 32nd birthday.", "Jedlicka had to check Facebook in case he was missing some supporters who hadn\u2019t yet recognized him at the pub. This was supposed to be a meeting with his English patrons, but he had not seemed to register that Martin and his friend each had a slight Slavic accent.", "They were from Poland, though they\u2019d been in Britain for more than 10 years. They were software engineers with good jobs. They quite liked life in London but had been made anxious by the waxing anti-immigrant sentiment. They thought they had moved past the era, when Poland joined the European Union in 2004, of fears about the \u2018\u2018Polish plumber\u2019\u2019 come to take away middle-class jobs. But once again immigrants were being scapegoated, and their future in the country was uncertain. They were interested in Liberland in part for the technological aspect and in part because they wanted to make themselves aware of any possible haven, should such anti-immigrant parties as UKIP come into real power. Like the Egyptians and the Syrians, they might become exactly the sort of political refugees the hard-line libertarians preferred to keep out of their country. The L.S.A. had, for example, firm positions on the matter of immigration; on their website they ran an interview with one member who implicitly spoke for the whole movement when he said, \u2018\u2018I definitely wouldn\u2019t like it if people came to Liberland just because there isn\u2019t political freedom in their country.\u2019\u2019 But the President stood for a big-tent libertarianism and did not want to see the future of Liberland compromised by such small-stakes infighting.", "An hour passed before another ally arrived, an overweight, bespectacled man in his 50s wearing a large blue polo. He introduced himself as Martin. He, too, had a Slavic accent. He was interested in Liberlandian citizenship, because he thought it would be an excellent site for a protected data center.", "The first Slavic Martin asked where the second Slavic Martin was from. \u2018\u2018Are you English?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018British,\u2019\u2019 the second Martin said.", "\u2018\u2018Really?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018From Kazakhstan.\u2019\u2019", "Martin from Kazakhstan waited for Jedlicka to be finished on Facebook before he told him, with childlike delight, that he had been one of his earliest and most ardent supporters. \u2018\u2018Now you have 300,000 applications \u2014 \u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Three hundred thirty thousand,\u2019\u2019 the President corrected him.", "\u2018\u2018Now you have 330,000 applications, but when I registered on website it was only 200,000!\u2019\u2019", "The President was quick to capitalize on Martin from Kazakhstan\u2019s spirit. \u2018\u2018I know,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018When I sent out an email about this meeting, I sent it to only 100 people, and I put you on it.\u2019\u2019 The President looked around the pub. \u2018\u2018And here we are seven. Seven percent turnout for the last minute. Not bad.\u2019\u2019", "Liberland\u2019s ambassador to France, Pierre-Louis Boitel, lives in Charenton, a large suburb southeast of Paris, with which it shares a border. Some status anxiety attaches to a residence there, but the ambassador had translated Ayn Rand and appeared proud to resist the herdlike mentality. The only club the ambassador wanted to be a part of was Liberland, whose exclusivity was something he cherished; he worried that it would be diluted by impure libertarians. He spent the entire car ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport explaining to the President that the chief challenge facing Liberland was the question of citizenship and that they would have to run it on a subscription basis as a very exclusive club. The ambassador was friends with a retired police officer who was willing to run background checks. He seemed in part to want an exclusive club because of his anxiety about where he lived. For most people, he explained outside the Embassy, \u2018\u2018if you live in Charenton, you are nobody. You say you live in Paris, and someone says where, and you say, \u2018Charenton,\u2019 and they say, \u2018Oh, then you do not live in Paris!\u2019 But Paris is one hundred meters away, and we are on the Metro and here we pay 35 percent less than you pay to live in Paris.\u2019\u2019", "The President worried on occasion that he was too promiscuous with his titling, a common affliction among young micronational commanders in chief seeking to bolster the ranks of the political class, but he still referred casually to Boitel\u2019s apartment as the Embassy. The ambassador, a financial executive, was a lanky man of 39 in an oversize suit, with a long, pointy nose, a thick helmet of overbrushed brown hair and eyebrows whose animation seemed fitful and beyond his control. He showed Jedlicka into the Embassy, saying, \u2018\u2018This is your Embassy, President, you are at home here.\u2019\u2019", "The parlor room was done in a subdued baroque style. The walls were painted salmon pink and sea green; gilded Louis XV replica armchairs were reflected in gilded mirrors. Heavy teal curtains were pulled back to admit the hesitant afternoon light, which pooled on the pale herringbone wooden floors. The walls were hung with coarse pastoral and dock scenes in thickly knifed oils, and antique knickknacks were everywhere: daggers inlaid with mother-of-pearl, fragile ceramics, a music stand with the sheet music for \u2018\u2018La Vie Parisienne.\u2019\u2019", "Jedlicka had only a few minutes to update his presentation before the whole party had to leave for his keynote speech at the annual convention of the small French libertarian party, but first he needed time alone with the first lady, who had flown in from Prague for the event. The first lady, whom the President refers to exclusively as the first lady, has been the President\u2019s girlfriend for a year and a half, and now she resides with him at the embassy in Prague. She is tall and well scrubbed and very blond; she keeps up an active lifestyle and maintains perfect posture even while seated. Though she did not get involved in her current relationship with the expectation of a full roster of official duties, she has taken on her new role with felicity and elegance. In order to labor on behalf of Liberland full time, she has temporarily given up her work as a massage therapist. The President treats the first lady with extraordinary consideration and solicitousness.", "Once the President finished updating his presentation, the legation walked to the Metro. En route, he took out his phone. He would never be anything but unassuming about protocol, but he asked if there weren\u2019t a method of transport that might be more commensurate with his office. There was, after all, a French camera crew trailing him, and it was important that he make the proper impression on the television of a country where he had such a key embassy. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s just not too presidential to travel by subway,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going to call an Uber.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018No, no, you cannot,\u2019\u2019 the ambassador said. \u2018\u2018It is not safe, it is impossible to take Uber here, you will not be safe. There is no time, and we must take the Metro. It will be quick. We do not even have to change the train.\u2019\u2019", "The President relented. But he would draw the official line at being filmed carrying his own bag. Pillar, however, would not be arriving in Paris for another seven hours; the President\u2019s assistant had once again failed to check him in, and he had been left at Heathrow.", "The President turned to me with a look of anguish. He understood that this was a violation of propriety, but he also very strongly did not want to be filmed by French television carrying his own bag. I felt sorry for him and accepted a short tenure as his bag man.", "Jedlicka was briefly mollified, but he was still very embarrassed to be seen on camera taking the Metro at all. Perhaps to compensate for the indignity, Boitel proceeded to cut a very long line of people to buy tickets, claiming that he was traveling on urgent official business.", "The presentation, which began with a homage to the writings of the French proto-libertarian Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, was well attended, but the crowd was quick to disperse afterward. For the state dinner following the presentation, the ambassador had rented out an entire brasserie \u2014 all in crimson and gold \u2014 across from the Bourse, but more than 50 people who committed to coming weren\u2019t there. The President told him that in the future, it would be best to have people pay in advance. The ambassador was frustrated. I tried to make small talk.", "\u2018\u2018I can\u2019t tell you what I do or where I work, because my boss would immediately fire me,\u2019\u2019 the ambassador said. \u2018\u2018I have a total, clean separation between my work and Liberland.\u2019\u2019 He drew his hand down in a sharp chop. \u2018\u2018I work in financial services for a very important and well-known firm, and if it were discovered that I was serving as the French ambassador from Liberland, everyone would immediately think I was washing money.\u2019\u2019", "Across the table from the President was a middle-aged consultant with wire-rimmed glasses and a perpetual Gallic pout. He had been observing with some amusement the voltage across the gap between Boitel and Jedlicka, as they had sparred over the question of citizenship. The consultant said something sharp in French, and for the first time the ambassador lost his restrained bearing entirely. His pale face became hot with blood, and he sputtered rapid responses across the table. The consultant remained cool and sipped his Bordeaux, saying very little as the ambassador railed. The word that kept coming up in his ripostes was \u2018\u2018blanchiment\u2019\u2019 \u2014 \u2018\u2018whitening,\u2019\u2019 or money laundering.", "The ambassador decided to drop the matter and turned to his salmon, which required liberation from drowning in a pool of white butter.", "Later, the wife of the consultant, a petite Russian woman with red hair and tiny teeth, explained the dispute her husband had had with the ambassador. \u2018\u2018Oh, the ambassador works at this bank\u2019\u2019 \u2014 she said the name \u2014 \u2018\u2018and my husband told him that especially in the light of his job, everyone in France would view Liberland as a money-laundering scheme. That is how we view all of the other places the President likes to mention all the time: Liechtenstein, Monaco, Singapore. Those are all tax havens.\u2019\u2019", "On the one hand, the President took it as a matter of common sense that high tax rates had put innovation and growth in government shackles everywhere on earth; on the other, the President really did believe that his young nation would be rooted in a like-minded community and would have taken as a great betrayal of his mission the idea that Liberland would only represent a virtual home for some collection of far-flung tax evaders, people who had nothing to do with one another beyond personal greed.", "The ambassador was less interested about where the money was coming from than he was in its conversion to cryptocurrency.

The next stop was San Francisco; his Facebook post of the supporters\u2019 dinner there remarked that, among the various techno-libertarians he had been courting, a young relative of Kafka had been present. In Washington, he was disappointed not to meet Rand Paul, but he had the chance to meet with representatives at the Cato Institute.

But, it seemed to me, it was helping him even more by barring him and his future citizens from actually settling the land. If the land were settled, it would become obvious to all that Liberland had courted an impossible coalition of fantasists. For some, it was a hedge against resurgent nationalism; for others, a bastion of euroskepticism. It was a haven for exiles and refugees and, at the same time, the promised land of the xenophobe and the techno-pirate. Jedlicka, so profligate with his sympathies, could sell a version of Liberland to tax reformers and another to Bitcoin traders. He could sell it just as well to a Pole in London as he could to a member of UKIP.", "The huge-tent dissonance had even been designed into the Liberlandian flag itself, with its yellow, symbolizing voluntary exchange; the black, symbolizing rebellion against the system; and the tree, symbolizing abundance. The bird symbolized freedom, which in practical terms meant support for equal-opportunity disaffection. It was an unassailable social-media strategy in a time of worldwide resentment toward governance, and as long as Jedlicka did not have to govern the terrain of an actual country, it would continue to redound to his credit across the world.", "Jedlicka was never more than five minutes away from Facebook, and from his tiny theoretical country, he spoke a plastic message of faith and empowerment. The elites in Brussels and the national capitals, both elected and unelected, had never seemed so haughty, distant and undemocratic. But he was tired.

For example, \u201ctoddler resisting naps,\u201d \u201csleep training a toddler,\u201d and, of course, \u201ctoddler sleep regression.\u201d (Because when it comes to children, all undesirable behavior is a \u201cregression.\u201d)", "4.

Perhaps as a coping mechanism, my disdain for the show has gradually morphed into morbid fascination. Hence one other search: \u201cWhy is Caillou bald?\u201d", "5. Everything is a phase \u2026\nSome of my searches related to issues that seemed like crises at the time, but are now distant memories: \u201ctoddler prefers dad,\u201d (a brief chapter for my firstborn that my husband doesn\u2019t even remember); \u201cwhy does my baby suddenly hate baths\u201d; and \u201cterrible 2\u2019s at 1.\u201d Usually, by the time I had gathered enough knowledge to feel as if I could tackle a problem, my child had already moved onto a new frustrating habit.", "6. \u2026 except when it isn\u2019t.\nSome things never change.

More than anything, my searches reminded me of what I was like as a new-ish parent: a little bit anxious, a little bit lonely, a little bit insecure.", "These days, I\u2019m more confident in my parenting abilities (or maybe I\u2019ve just come to accept that no matter what I do, I\u2019ll probably flub it.) And I have more friends to commiserate with when my children are driving me crazy, so I\u2019m less reliant on the virtual parenting community. But I still need guidance, and I still have questions.

Ulrich\u2019s primary concern was a new online service called Napster, which had debuted a little more than a year before. As Ulrich explained in his statement, the band began investigating Napster after unreleased versions of one of their songs began playing on radio stations around the country. They discovered that their entire catalog of music was available there for free.", "Ulrich\u2019s trip to Washington coincided with a lawsuit that Metallica had just filed against Napster \u2014 a suit that would ultimately play a role in the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing. But in retrospect, we can also see Ulrich\u2019s appearance as an intellectual milestone of sorts, in that he articulated a critique of the Internet-\u00adera creative economy that became increasingly commonplace over time. \u2018\u2018We typically employ a record producer, recording engineers, programmers, assistants and, occasionally, other musicians,\u2019\u2019 Ulrich told the Senate committee. \u2018\u2018We rent time for months at recording studios, which are owned by small-\u00adbusiness men who have risked their own capital to buy, maintain and constantly upgrade very expensive equipment and facilities. Our record releases are supported by hundreds of record companies\u2019 employees and provide programming for numerous radio and television stations. ... It\u2019s clear, then, that if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable. All the jobs I just talked about will be lost, and the diverse voices of the artists will disappear.\u2019\u2019", "The intersection between commerce, technology and culture has long been a place of anxiety and foreboding. Marxist critics in the 1940s denounced the assembly-line approach to filmmaking that Hollywood had pioneered; in the \u201960s, we feared the rise of television\u2019s \u2018\u2018vast wasteland\u2019\u2019; the \u201980s demonized the record executives who were making money off violent rap lyrics and \u2018\u2018Darling Nikki\u2019\u2019; in the \u201990s, critics accused bookstore chains and Walmart of undermining the subtle curations of independent bookshops and record stores.", "But starting with Ulrich\u2019s testimony, a new complaint has taken center stage, one that flips those older objections on their heads. The problem with the culture industry is no longer its rapacious pursuit of consumer dollars. The problem with the culture industry is that it\u2019s not profitable enough. Thanks to its legal troubles, Napster itself ended up being much less important as a business than as an omen, a preview of coming destructions. Its short, troubled life signaled a fundamental rearrangement in the way we discover, consume and (most importantly) pay for creative work. In the 15 years since, many artists and commentators have come to believe that Ulrich\u2019s promised apocalypse is now upon us \u2014 that the digital economy, in which information not only wants to be free but for all practical purposes is free, ultimately means that \u2018\u2018the diverse voices of the artists will disappear,\u2019\u2019 because musicians and writers and filmmakers can no longer make a living.", "Take a look at your own media consumption, and you can most likely see the logic of the argument. Just calculate for a second how many things you used to pay for that now arrive free of charge: all those Spotify playlists that were once $15 CDs; the countless hours of YouTube videos your kids watch each week; online articles that once required a magazine subscription or a few bucks at the newsstand. And even when you do manage to pull out a credit card, the amounts are shrinking: $9 for an e-book that used to be a $20 hardcover. If the prices of traditional media keep falling, then it seems logical to critics that we will end up in a world in which no one has an economic incentive to follow creative passions. The thrust of this argument is simple and bleak: that the digital economy creates a kind of structural impossibility that art will make money in the future. The world of professional creativity, the critics fear, will soon be swallowed by the profusion of amateurs, or the collapse of prices in an age of infinite and instant reproduction will cheapen art so that no one will be able to quit their day jobs to make it \u2014 or both.", "The trouble with this argument is that it has been based largely on anecdote, on depressing stories about moderately successful bands that are still sharing an apartment or filmmakers who can\u2019t get their pictures made because they refuse to pander to a teenage sensibility. When we do see hard data about the state of the culture business, it usually tracks broad industry trends or the successes and failures of individual entertainment companies. That data isn\u2019t entirely irrelevant, of course; it\u2019s useful to know whether the music industry is making more or less money than it did before Ulrich delivered his anti-\u00adNapster testimony. But ultimately, those statistics only hint at the most important question. The dystopian scenario, after all, isn\u2019t about the death of the record business or Hollywood; it\u2019s about the death of music or movies. As a society, what we most want to ensure is that the artists can prosper \u2014 not the record labels or studios or publishing conglomerates, but the writers, musicians, directors and actors themselves.", "Their financial fate turns out to be much harder to measure, but I endeavored to try. Taking 1999 as my starting point \u2014 the year both Napster and Google took off \u2014 I plumbed as many data sources as I could to answer this one question: How is today\u2019s creative class faring compared with its predecessor a decade and a half ago? The answer isn\u2019t simple, and the data provides ammunition for conflicting points of view. It turns out that Ulrich was incontrovertibly correct on one point: Napster did pose a grave threat to the economic value that consumers placed on recorded music. And yet the creative apocalypse he warned of has failed to arrive. Writers, performers, directors and even musicians report their economic fortunes to be similar to those of their counterparts 15 years ago, and in many cases they have improved. Against all odds, the voices of the artists seem to be louder than ever.", "The closest data set we have to a bird\u2019s-eye view of the culture industry can be found in the Occupational Employment Statistics, an enormous compendium of data assembled by the Labor Department that provides employment and income estimates. Broken down by general sector and by specific professions, the O.E.S. lets you see both the forest and the trees: You can track employment data for the Farming, Fishing and Forestry Occupations (Group 45-0000), or you can zoom in all the way to the Fallers (Group 45-4021) who are actually cutting down the trees. The O.E.S. data goes back to the 1980s, though some of the category definitions have changed over time. This, and the way the agency collects its data, can make specific year-to-year comparisons less reliable. The best approximation of the creative-class group as a whole is Group 27-0000, or Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media Occupations. It\u2019s a broader definition than we\u2019re looking for \u2014 I think we can all agree that professional athletes are doing just fine, thank you very much \u2014 but it gives us a place to start.", "The first thing that jumps out at you, looking at Group 27-0000, is how stable it has been over the past decade and a half. In 1999, the national economy supported 1.5 million jobs in that category; by 2014, the number had grown to nearly 1.8 million. This means the creative class modestly outperformed the rest of the economy, making up 1.2 percent of the job market in 2001 compared with 1.3 percent in 2014. Annual income for Group 27-0000 grew by 40 percent, slightly more than the O.E.S. average of 38 percent. From that macro viewpoint, it hardly seems as though the creative economy is in dust-bowl territory. If anything, the market looks as if it is rewarding creative work, not undermining it, compared with the pre-\u00adNapster era.", "The problem with the O.E.S. data is that it doesn\u2019t track self-\u00ademployed workers, who are obviously a large part of the world of creative production. For that section of the culture industry, the best data sources are the United States Economic Census, which is conducted every five years, and a firm called Economic Modeling Specialists International, which tracks detailed job numbers for self-\u00ademployed people in specific professions. If anything, the numbers from the self-\u00ademployed world are even more promising. From 2002 to 2012, the number of businesses that identify as or employ \u2018\u2018independent artists, writers and performers\u2019\u2019 (which also includes some athletes) grew by almost 40 percent, while the total revenue generated by this group grew by 60 percent, far exceeding the rate of inflation.", "What do these data sets have to tell us about musicians in particular? According to the O.E.S., in 1999 there were nearly 53,000 Americans who considered their primary occupation to be that of a musician, a music director or a composer; in 2014, more than 60,000 people were employed writing, singing or playing music. That\u2019s a rise of 15 percent, compared with overall job-\u00admarket growth during that period of about 6 percent. The number of self-\u00ademployed musicians grew at an even faster rate: There were 45 percent more independent musicians in 2014 than in 2001. (Self-\u00ademployed writers, by contrast, grew by 20 percent over that period.)", "Of course, Baudelaire would have filed his tax forms as self-\u00ademployed, too; that doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t also destitute. Could the surge in musicians be accompanied by a parallel expansion in the number of broke musicians? The income data suggests that this just isn\u2019t true. According to the O.E.S., songwriters and music directors saw their average income rise by nearly 60 percent since 1999. The census version of the story, which includes self-\u00ademployed musicians, is less stellar: In 2012, musical groups and artists reported only 25 percent more in revenue than they did in 2002, which is basically treading water when you factor in inflation. And yet collectively, the figures seem to suggest that music, the creative field that has been most threatened by technological change, has become more profitable in the post-\u00adNapster era \u2014 not for the music industry, of course, but for musicians themselves. Somehow the turbulence of the last 15 years seems to have created an economy in which more people than ever are writing and performing songs for a living.", "How can this be? The record industry\u2019s collapse is real and well documented. Even after Napster shut down in 2002, music piracy continued to grow: According to the Recording Industry Association of America, 30 billion songs were illegally downloaded from 2004 to 2009. American consumers paid for only 37 percent of the music they acquired in 2009. Artists report that royalties from streaming services like Spotify or Pandora are a tiny fraction of what they used to see from traditional album sales. The global music industry peaked just before Napster\u2019s debut, during the heyday of CD sales, when it reaped what would amount today to almost $60 billion in revenue. Now the industry worldwide reports roughly $15 billion in revenue from recorded music, a financial Armageddon even if you consider that CDs are much more expensive to produce and distribute than digital tracks. With such a steep decline, how can the average songwriter or musician be doing better in the post-\u00adNapster era? And why does there seem to be more musicians than ever?", "Part of the answer is that the decline in recorded-\u00admusic revenue has been accompanied by an increase in revenues from live music. In 1999, when Britney Spears ruled the airwaves, the music business took in around $10 billion in live-\u00admusic revenue internationally; in 2014, live music generated almost $30 billion in revenue, according to data assembled from multiple sources by the live-music service Songkick. Starting in the early 1980s, average ticket prices for concerts closely followed the rise in overall consumer prices until the mid-1990s, when ticket prices suddenly took off: From 1997 to 2012, average ticket prices rose 150 percent, while consumer prices grew less than 100 percent. It\u2019s elemental economics: As one good \u2014 recorded music \u2014 becomes ubiquitous, its price plummets, while another good that is by definition scarce (seeing a musician play a live performance) grows in value. Moreover, as file-\u00adsharing and iTunes and Spotify have driven down the price of music, they have also made it far easier to envelop your life with a kind of permanent soundtrack, all of which drives awareness of the musicians and encourages fans to check them out in concert. Recorded music, then, becomes a kind of marketing expense for the main event of live shows.", "It\u2019s true that most of that live-\u00admusic revenue is captured by superstar acts like Taylor Swift or the Rolling Stones. In 1982, the musical 1-\u00adpercenters took in only 26 percent of the total revenues generated by live music; in 2003, they captured 56 percent of the market, with the top 5 percent of musicians capturing almost 90 percent of live revenues. But this winner-\u00adtakes-\u00adall trend seems to have preceded the digital revolution; most 1-\u00adpercenters achieved their gains in the \u201980s and early \u201990s, as the concert business matured into a promotional machine oriented around marquee world tours. In the post-\u00adNapster era, there seems to have been a swing back in a more egalitarian direction. According to one source, the top 100 tours of 2000 captured 90 percent of all revenue, while today the top 100 capture only 43 percent.", "The growth of live music isn\u2019t great news for the Brian Wilsons of the world, artists who would prefer to cloister themselves in the studio, endlessly tinkering with the recording process in pursuit of a masterpiece. The new economics of the post-\u00adNapster era are certainly skewed toward artists who like to perform in public. But we should remember one other factor here that is often forgotten. The same technological forces that have driven down the price of recorded music have had a similar effect on the cost of making an album in the first place. We easily forget how expensive it was to produce and distribute albums in the pre-\u00adNapster era. In a 2014 keynote speech at an Australian music conference, the indie producer and musician Steve Albini observed: \u2018\u2018When I started playing in bands in the \u201970s and \u201980s, most bands went through their entire life cycle without so much as a note of their music ever being recorded.\u2019\u2019 Today, musicians can have software that emulates the sound of Abbey Road Studios on their laptops for a few thousand dollars. Distributing music around the world \u2014 a process that once required an immense global corporation or complex regional distribution deals \u2014 can now be performed by the artist herself while sitting in a Starbucks, simply through the act of uploading a file.", "The vast machinery of promoters and shippers and manufacturers and A&R executives that sprouted in the middle of the 20th century, fueled by the profits of those high-\u00admargin vinyl records and CDs, has largely withered away. What remains is a more direct relationship between the musicians and their fans. That new relationship has its own demands: the constant touring and self-\u00adpromotion, the Kickstarter campaigns that have raised $153 million dollars to date for music-\u00adrelated projects, the drudgery that inevitably accompanies a life without handlers. But the economic trends suggest that the benefits are outweighing the costs. More people are choosing to make a career as a musician or a songwriter than they did in the glory days of Tower Records.", "Of the big four creative industries (music, television, movies and books), music turns out to be the business that has seen the most conspicuous turmoil: None of the other three has seen anywhere near the cratering of recorded-\u00admusic revenues. The O.E.S. numbers show that writers and actors each saw their income increase by about 50 percent, well above the national average. According to the Association of American Publishers, total revenues in the fiction and nonfiction book industry were up 17 percent from 2008 to 2014, following the introduction of the Kindle in late 2007. Global television revenues have been projected to grow by 24 percent from 2012 to 2017. For actors and directors and screenwriters, the explosion of long-form television narratives has created a huge number of job opportunities. (Economic Modeling Specialists International reports that the number of self-\u00ademployed actors has grown by 45 percent since 2001.) If you were a television actor looking for work on a multiseason drama or comedy in 2001, there were only a handful of potential employers: the big four networks and HBO and Showtime. Today there are Netflix, Amazon, AMC, Syfy, FX and many others.", "What about the economics of quality? Perhaps there are more musicians than ever, and the writers have collectively gotten a raise, but if the market is only rewarding bubble-\u00adgum pop and \u2018\u201850 Shades Of Grey\u2019\u2019 sequels, there\u2019s a problem. I think we can take it as a given that television is exempt from this concern: Shows like \u2018\u2018Game Of Thrones,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Orange Is The New Black,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019\u2019 and so on confirm that we are living through a golden age of TV narrative. But are the other forms thriving artistically to the same degree?", "Look at Hollywood, and at first blush the picture is deeply depressing. More than half of the highest grossing movies of 2014 were either superhero films or sequels; it\u2019s clearly much harder to make a major-\u00adstudio movie today that doesn\u2019t involve vampires, wizards or Marvel characters. This has led a number of commentators and filmmakers to publish eulogies for the classic midbudget picture. \u2018\u2018Back in the 1980s and 1990s,\u2019\u2019 Jason Bailey wrote on Flavorwire, \u2018\u2018it was possible to finance \u2014 either independently or via the studio system \u2014 midbudget films (anywhere from $5 million to $60 million) with an adult sensibility. But slowly, quietly, over roughly the decade and a half since the turn of the century, the paradigm shifted.\u2019\u2019 Movies like \u2018\u2018Blue Velvet,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019\u2019 that succeeded two or three decades ago, the story goes, would have had a much harder time in the current climate. Steven Soderbergh apparently felt so strongly about the shifting environment that he abandoned theatrical moviemaking altogether last year.", "Is Bailey\u2019s criticism really correct? If you make a great midbudget film in 2015, is the marketplace less likely to reward your efforts than it was 15 years ago? And has it become harder to make such a film? Cinematic quality is obviously more difficult to measure than profits or employment levels, but we can attempt an estimate of artistic achievement through the Rotten Tomatoes rankings, which aggregate critics\u2019 reviews for movies. Based on my analysis, using data on box-\u00adoffice receipts and budgets from IMDB, I looked at films from 1999 and 2013 that met three categories. First, they were original creations or adaptations, not based on existing franchises, and were intended largely for an adult audience; second, they had a budget below $80 million; and third, they were highly praised by the critics, as defined by their Rotten Tomatoes score \u2014 in other words, the best of the cinematic midlist. In 1999, the most highly rated films in these categories combined included \u2018\u2018Three Kings,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Being John Malkovich,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018American Beauty\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Election.\u2019\u2019 The 2013 list included \u2018\u201812 Years a Slave,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Her,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Zero Dark Thirty,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018American Hustle\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Nebraska.\u2019\u2019 In adjusted dollars, the class of 1999 brought in roughly $430 million at the box office. But the 2013 group took in about $20 million more. True, individual years can be misleading: All it takes is one monster hit to skew the numbers. But if you look at the blended average over a three-year window, there is still no evidence of decline. The 30 most highly rated midbudget films of 1999 to 2001 took in $1.5 billion at the domestic box office, adjusted for inflation; the class of 2011 to 2013 took in the exact same amount. Then as now, if you make a small or midsize movie that rates on the Top 10 lists of most critics, you\u2019ll average roughly $50 million at the box office.", "The critics are right that big Hollywood studios have abandoned the production of artistically challenging films, part of a broader trend since the 1990s of producing fewer films over all. (From 2006 to 2011, the combined output of major Hollywood studios declined by 25 percent.) And yet the total number of pictures released in the United States \u2014 nearly 600 in 2011 \u2014 remains high. A recent entertainment research report, The Sky Is Rising, notes that most of that growth has come from independent production companies, often financed by wealthy individuals from outside the traditional studio system. \u2018\u2018Her,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u201812 Years a Slave,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Dallas Buyers Club,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018American Hustle\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018The Wolf of Wall Street\u2019\u2019 were all funded by major indies, though they usually relied on distribution deals with Hollywood studios. At the same time, of course, some of the slack in adventurous filmmaking has been taken up by the television networks. If Francis Ford Coppola were making his \u2018\u2018Godfather\u2019\u2019 trilogy today, he might well end up at HBO or AMC, with a hundred hours of narrative at his disposal, instead of 10.", "How have high-\u00adquality books fared in the digital economy? If you write an exceptional novel or biography today, are you more or less likely to hit the best-\u00adseller list than you might have in the pre-\u00adKindle age? Here the pessimists might have a case, based on my analysis. Every year, editors at The New York Times Book Review select the 100 notable books of the year. In 2004 and 2005, the years before the first Kindles were released, those books spent a combined 2,781 weeks on The Times\u2019s best-\u00adseller list and the American Booksellers Association\u2019s IndieBound list, which tracks sales in independent bookstores. In 2013 and 2014, the notable books spent 2,531 weeks on the best-\u00adseller lists \u2014 a decline of 9 percent. When you look at the two lists separately, the story becomes more complicated still. The critical successes of 2013 and 2014 actually spent 6 percent more weeks on the A.B.A. list, but 30 percent fewer weeks on the broader Times list. The numbers seem to suggest that the market for books may be evolving into two distinct systems. Critically successful works seem to be finding their audience more easily among indie-\u00adbookstore shoppers, even as the mainstream market has been trending toward a winner-\u00adtakes-\u00adall sweepstakes.", "This would be even more troubling if independent bookstores \u2014 traditional champions of the literary novel and thoughtful nonfiction \u2014 were on life support. But contrary to all expectations, these stores have been thriving. After hitting a low in 2007, decimated not only by the Internet but also by the rise of big-box chains like Borders and Barnes & Noble, indie bookstores have been growing at a steady clip, with their number up 35 percent (from 1,651 in 2009 to 2,227 in 2015); by many reports, 2014 was their most financially successful year in recent memory. Indie bookstores account for only about 10 percent of overall book sales, but they have a vastly disproportionate impact on the sale of the creative midlist books that are so vital to the health of the culture.", "How do we explain the evolutionary niche that indie bookstores seem to have found in recent years? It may be as simple as the tactile appeal of books and bookstores themselves. After several years of huge growth, e-book sales have plateaued over the past two years at 25 to 30 percent of the market, telegraphing that a healthy consumer appetite for print remains. To many of us, buying music in physical form is now simply an inconvenience: schlepping those CDs home and burning them and downloading the tracks to our mobile devices. But many of the most ardent Kindle converts \u2014 and I count myself among them \u2014 still enjoy browsing shelves of physical books, picking them up and sitting back on the couch with them. The trend might also reflect the social dimension of book culture: If you\u2019re looking for literary community, you head out to the weekly reading series at the indie bookstore and buy something while you\u2019re there. (Arguably, it\u2019s the same phenomenon that happened with music, only with a twist. If you\u2019re looking for musical community, you don\u2019t go out on a CD-\u00adbuying binge. You go to a show instead.)", "All these numbers, of course, only hint at whether our digital economy rewards quality. Or \u2014 even better than that milquetoast word \u2018\u2018quality\u2019\u2019 \u2014 at whether it rewards experimentation, boundary-\u00adpushing, satire, the real drivers of new creative work. It could be that our smartphone distractions and Kardashian celebrity culture have slowly but steadily lowered our critical standards, the aesthetic version of inflation: The critics might like certain films and books today because they\u2019re surrounded by such a vast wasteland of mediocrity, but if you had released them 15 years ago, they would have paled beside the masterpieces of that era.

The Napsterization of culture turned out to be less of a threat to prices than it initially appeared. Consumers spend less for recorded music, but more for live. Most American households pay for television content, a revenue stream that for all practical purposes didn\u2019t exist 40 years ago. Average movie-\u00adticket prices continue to rise. For interesting reasons, book piracy hasn\u2019t taken off the way it did with music. And a whole new creative industry \u2014 video games \u2014 has arisen to become as lucrative as Hollywood. American households in 2013 spent 4.9 percent of their income on entertainment, the exact same percentage they spent in 2000.", "At the same time, there are now more ways to buy creative work, thanks to the proliferation of content-\u00addelivery platforms. Practically every device consumers own is tempting them at all hours with new films or songs or shows to purchase. Virtually no one bought anything on their computer just 20 years ago; the idea of using a phone to buy and read a 700-page book about a blind girl in occupied France would have sounded like a joke even 10 years ago. But today, our phones sell us every form of media imaginable; our TVs charge us for video-\u00adon-\u00addemand products; our car stereos urge us to sign up for SiriusXM.", "And just as there are more avenues for consumers to pay for creative work, there are more ways to be compensated for making that work. Think of that signature flourish of 2000s-\u00adera television artistry: the exquisitely curated (and usually obscure) song that signals the transition from final shot to the rolling credits. Having a track featured during the credits of \u2018\u2018Girls\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018True Blood\u2019\u2019 can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to a songwriter. (Before that point, the idea of licensing a popular song for the credits of a television series was almost unheard-\u00adof.) Video-\u00adgame budgets pay for actors, composers, writers and song licenses. There are YouTube videos generating ad revenue and Amazon Kindle Singles earning royalties, not to mention those emerging studios (like Netflix and Yahoo) that are spending significant dollars on high-\u00adquality video. Filmmakers alone have raised more than $290 million on Kickstarter for their creations. Musicians are supplementing their income with instrument lessons on YouTube. All of these outlets are potential sources of revenue for the creative class, and all of them are creatures of the post-\u00adNapster era. The Future of Music Coalition recently published a list of all the revenue streams available to musicians today, everything from sheet-\u00admusic sales at concerts to vinyl-\u00adalbum sales. They came up with 46 distinct sources, 13 of which \u2014 including YouTube partner revenue and ringtone royalties \u2014 were nonexistent 15 years ago, and six of which, including film and television licensing, have greatly expanded in the digital age.", "The biggest change of all, perhaps, is the ease with which art can be made and distributed. The cost of consuming culture may have declined, though not as much as we feared. But the cost of producing it has dropped far more drastically. Authors are writing and publishing novels to a global audience without ever requiring the service of a printing press or an international distributor. For indie filmmakers, a helicopter aerial shot that could cost tens of thousands of dollars a few years ago can now be filmed with a GoPro and a drone for under $1,000; some directors are shooting entire HD-\u00adquality films on their iPhones. Apple\u2019s editing software, Final Cut Pro X, costs $299 and has been used to edit Oscar-\u00adwinning films. A musician running software from Native Instruments can recreate, with astonishing fidelity, the sound of a Steinway grand piano played in a Vienna concert hall, or hundreds of different guitar-\u00adamplifier sounds, or the Mellotron proto-\u00adsynthesizer that the Beatles used on \u2018\u2018Strawberry Fields Forever.\u2019\u2019 These sounds could have cost millions to assemble 15 years ago; today, you can have all of them for a few thousand dollars.", "From the bird\u2019s-\u00adeye perspective, it may not look as though all that much has changed in terms of the livelihoods of the creative class. On the whole, creators seem to be making slightly more money, while growing in number at a steady but not fast pace. I suspect the profound change lies at the boundaries of professionalism. It has never been easier to start making money from creative work, for your passion to undertake that critical leap from pure hobby to part-time income source. Write a novel or record an album, and you can get it online and available for purchase right away, without persuading an editor or an A&R executive that your work is commercially viable. From the consumer\u2019s perspective, blurring the boundaries has an obvious benefit: It widens the pool of potential talent. But it also has an important social merit. Widening the pool means that more people are earning income by doing what they love.", "These new careers \u2014 collaborating on an indie-\u00admovie soundtrack with a musician across the Atlantic, uploading a music video to YouTube that you shot yourself on a smartphone \u2014 require a kind of entrepreneurial energy that some creators may lack. The new environment may well select for artists who are particularly adept at inventing new career paths rather than single-\u00admindedly focusing on their craft. There are certainly pockets of the creative world, like those critically acclaimed books dropping off the mainstream best-\u00adseller lists, where the story is discouraging. And even the positive trends shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as a mindless defense of the status quo. Most full-time artists barely make enough money to pay the bills, and so if we have levers to pull that will send more income their way \u2014 whether these take the form of government grants, Kickstarter campaigns or higher fees for the music we stream \u2014 by all means we should pull those levers.", "But just because creative workers deserve to make more money, it doesn\u2019t mean that the economic or technological trends are undermining their livelihoods. If anything, the trends are making creative livelihoods more achievable. Contrary to Lars Ulrich\u2019s fear in 2000, the \u2018\u2018diverse voices of the artists\u2019\u2019 are still with us, and they seem to be multiplying. The song remains the same, and there are more of us singing it for a living."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/the-internet-of-things-and-the-future-of-farming/": ["The Internet of Things \u2014 the vision of a world brimming with communicating sensors and digital smarts \u2014 occupies the peak of Gartner\u2019s most recent \u201chype cycle.\u201d And a report released two months ago by the McKinsey Global Institute laid out the potential multitrillion-dollar payoff from the emerging technology.", "At a two-day workshop last week in San Jose, Calif., hosted by the National Science Foundation and the National Consortium for Data Science, a few dozen academics, corporate technologists and government officials met and mostly wrestled with the thorny technical and policy issues that must be addressed if the potential of the Internet of Things is to be realized. They were working to come up with a research agenda to make practical progress on challenges like security, privacy and standards. A glimpse of the looming security concerns came two weeks ago, when Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles after two researchers hacked into a Jeep Cherokee and showed they could remotely control its engine, brakes and steering.", "But the Silicon Valley gathering also underlined the societal needs that Internet-of-Things technology could help address. Lance Donny, founder of an agricultural technology start-up, OnFarm Systems, gave a wide-ranging talk that laid out the history of farming and presented the case for its data-driven future. Inexpensive sensors, cloud computing and intelligent software, he suggested, hold the potential to transform agriculture and help feed the world\u2019s growing population.", "Venture capitalists seem to share some of Mr. Donny\u2019s optimism. In the first half of this year, venture investment in so-called agtech start-ups reached $2.06 billion in 228 deals, according to a study published last week by AgFunder, an equity crowdfunding platform for agricultural technology. The half-year total was close to the $2.36 billion raised in all of 2014, which was a record year.", "In his presentation, Mr. Donny placed the progression of farming in three stages. The first, preindustrial agriculture, dating from before Christ to about 1920, consisted of labor-intensive, essentially subsistence farming on small farms, which took two acres to feed one person. In the second stage, industrial agriculture, from 1920 to about 2010, tractors and combine harvesters, chemical fertilizers and seed science opened the way to large commercial farms. One result has been big gains in productivity, with one acre feeding five people.", "The third stage, which Mr. Donny calls Ag 3.0, is just getting underway and involves exploiting data from many sources \u2014 sensors on farm equipment and plants, satellite images and weather tracking. In the near future, the use of water and fertilizer will be measured and monitored in detail, sometimes on a plant-by-plant basis.", "Mr. Donny, who was raised on a family farm in Fresno, Calif., that grew table grapes and raisin grapes, said the data-rich approach to decision making represented a sharp break with tradition. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different world than walking out on the farmland, kicking the dirt and making a decision based on intuition,\u201d he said.", "The benefits should be higher productivity and more efficient use of land, water and fertilizer. But it will also, Mr. Donny said, help satisfy the rising demand for transparency in farming. Consumers, he noted, increasingly want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used, and when and how it was harvested. \u201cData is the only way that can be done,\u201d Mr. Donny said.", "In the United States, major agriculture companies are making sizable investments to position themselves for data-driven farming. John Deere, for example, wants to make the farm tractor a data-control center in the field. Monsanto made a big move with its $930 million purchase in 2013 of Climate Corporation, a weather data-analysis company started by two Google alumni. American farmers are embracing the technology, though warily at times.", "Yet the most intriguing use of the technology may well be outside the United States. By 2050, the global population is projected to reach nine billion, up from 7.3 billion today. Large numbers of people entering the middle class, especially in China and India, and adopting middle-class eating habits \u2014 like consuming more meat, which requires more grain \u2014 only adds to the burden.", "To close the food gap, worldwide farm productivity will have to increase from 1.5 tons of grain per acre to 2.5 tons by 2050, according to Mr. Donny. American farm productivity is already above that level, at 2.75 tons of grain per acre.", "\u201cBut you can\u2019t take the U.S. model and transport it to the world,\u201d Mr. Donny said, noting that American farming is both highly capital-intensive and large scale. The average farm size in the United States is 450 acres. In Africa, the average is about two acres.", "\u201cThe rest of the world has to get the productivity gains with data,\u201d he said.", "The prospect of dirt-cheap sensors, Mr. Donny said, will help, but so will increasingly sophisticated and inexpensive remote imaging from satellites. Heavy machinery and big farms, he insists, will not be needed. Higher yields and less waste, he said, can be achieved with better information on weather, soil conditions and market demand for specific crops \u2014 all delivered via cellphone.", "\u201cThey can skip buying the combine,\u201d he said, \u201cand instead rely on systems like Watson,\u201d referring to IBM\u2019s question-answering cloud service."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/daily-report-theres-no-tech-news-if-theres-no-uber-news/": ["Uber, the ride-hailing service, has become one of the tech industry\u2019s newsmakers of the moment.

Among the most-quoted of Google\u2019s big thoughts has been that corporations should \u201cdo one thing really, really well.\u201d Google\u2019s one thing, the document said, was obvious: \u201cWe do search.\u201d", "That idea may now seem absurdly quaint, given Google\u2019s expanding universe of products, which are as varied as operating systems, a web browser, email, cloud storage, self-driving cars and, yes, even a search engine. But even when the document was posted, in 2000, there was uncertainty at Google about whether the company could really maintain its focus on search. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, its two founders, had long harbored far-reaching visions for how technology could transform the world, and it looked unlikely that they would limit their ideas to a web search engine.", "\u201cI wrote it and they approved it, but Larry knew that at some point we were going to have to update that,\u201d said Douglas Edwards, an early marketing director at Google and the original author of Google\u2019s \u201cTen Things\u201d document. Mr. Edwards said he faced particular resistance from Mr. Page on the \u201cdo one thing\u201d item.", "\u201cLarry\u2019s vision was always to be something like General Electric, and Google was only his first proof-of-concept,\u201d said Mr. Edwards, whose book \u201cI\u2019m Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59\u201d recounts his years at the company. \u201cIt was never going to be the endpoint.\u201d", "This history is worth recounting in light of Mr. Page\u2019s announcement on Monday that Google will restructure its operations into a General Electric-like conglomerate called Alphabet, of which the search company will become just one division.", "From the start, Mr. Page has been afflicted with a desire for two competing corporate virtues: focus and expansiveness.

In terms of stock market valuation, Google is outmatched in Silicon Valley by Apple, but it is peerless in the industry as an exporter of corporate culture.

Even outlets, like The New York Times, with robust online subscription bases must increase their audiences on the web and try to convert more to paying readers. For newspapers and magazines, which must make up for increasing losses in print advertising and circulation, the need is even more urgent.", "That, Mr. Topolsky said, means that the news industry must churn out stories that are the equivalent of blockbuster superhero franchises, with mass-audience appeal, but light on nuance and creative risk.", "\u201cI think that we have, in trying to attack the totality of possible eyeballs on the Internet, lost the things that make publications great,\u201d he said.", "The shift is, perhaps inevitably, rooted in money. According to Brian Wieser, a web, advertising and media analyst at Pivotal Research Group, and a former advertising agency executive, in the early days of the web, publications operated much as they always had \u2014 selling advertising space to companies, person to person. \u201cThen, of course, we got to the nuclear meltdown era, the vast wasteland,\u201d he said.", "Some advertising executives realized that the same people who were browsing the websites of glossy magazines were also buying pet food online, Mr. Wieser said. So why should the magazine sell its advertising at a higher rate, when companies could develop technology to track potential customers, and target them wherever they browsed online? That process became automated, and now many ads on the web are served, via algorithms, by specialized exchanges where they are bought and sold in bulk at steeply discounted rates. \u201cThe economics of producing original content, and the value of being associated with it, diminished,\u201d he said.", "Publishers, who used to get print sales prices and premium advertising dollars for every reader, now get cents or fractions of cents in revenue for the same reader. Many have grown more aggressive with their advertising tactics. According to research by Facebook, news pages, often heavy with advertising, take an average of eight seconds to load, the longest for any kind of content. That can feel like a lifetime to a smartphone user seeking a quick glimpse of the news while waiting in line or commuting. When readers finally arrive at the story, they must steel themselves for a fight \u2014 to dismiss pleadings to subscribe or register, or to shut down advertisements that play automatically, by touching a tiny, moving \u201cX\u201d with the fingertip precision of a surgeon.", "At the same time, every publication now requires a greater number of readers to make ends meet.

Nearly half of the renters in the United States spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, according to Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies.

If Bandwagon finds a match, it notifies both parties and then allows them to chat via the app so they can meet. At La Guardia, first-time users are generally signing up through on-site kiosks. When passengers are matched, they receive a text message telling them to go to the front of the line and meet their taxi share. Each party then pays a $5 fee for the service and is sent a receipt via text. The first person to be dropped off pays a portion of the metered fare plus a tip to the last person being dropped off, either through the Bandwagon app or in cash. The last person being dropped off pays the cabdriver in full.", "If the program is successful at La Guardia, Bandwagon said, it will also be introduced at Kennedy International Airport in New York and expanded at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where it is currently offered only in Terminal C.

We wound up on a bench, staring at a tour boat passing under a bridge, wondering aloud to each other if it was the boat that was moving or the bridge.", "Two decades later, we decided to return, this time with our offspring in tow. What would it be like to return to our honeymoon destination with our children? Probably a bit less romantic. Certainly less trippy. We knew there would be no space cakes this time around.", "We headed out in April with 11-year-old Paulina and 15-year-old Dean, just as the flowers and trees were starting to bloom in the Netherlands. But before we even boarded our plane at Kennedy International Airport, the trouble started.", "Paulina was stopped at security when T.S.A. officers found a pair of scissors in her carry-on backpack.

I comforted her and admitted I should have supervised her packing. She was only 11, after all, and didn\u2019t think of crafting scissors \u2014 for art projects on the long, boring plane ride \u2014 as a potentially mortal weapon. Surprisingly, the officer gave the scissors back. They were apparently one centimeter shorter than the length considered lethal. And we were off.", "Once in Amsterdam, the real fun began. I\u2019d forgotten how truly lovely the brightly painted, narrow canal houses were, and the children were just as enchanted as I had been 20 years earlier, seeing them for the first time. After a couple of hours of wandering the cobblestone streets, we set out on our first quest.

Within an hour, we spotted the bench on Leidsegracht Street, where two canals met and a lovely bridge stretched, just past Spui Square. The tip-off that this was the right bench was the small group of tourists gathered around it, taking photos with their long selfie sticks.", "We waited patiently for our turn to take our own photos, sans selfie stick. Twenty years ago, selfie sticks had not been invented, of course. We didn\u2019t even have cameras on our phones, I told the kids. They looked at me as if I\u2019d said we had once churned butter on this very spot.", "As we sat there on the bench, a man in a tiny painted boat decorated with fake flowers pulled up beside us on the canal and, while spinning in circles, began playing the trumpet and barrel organ. A larger crowd gathered as he played song after song, nudging the boat\u2019s rudder with his elbow. Most clapped, though one man with a basket on his head started barking, then began to sing opera.", "Soon he was joined by another man, who arrived in another boat, also singing opera.

Afterward, we wandered the theater, admiring the architecture and antique lighting and furniture.", "The next day, we returned to another favorite spot: the Caf\u00e9 Americain, inside the American Hotel, with its stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings circa 1900. No tables were available, only seats at the bar. We turned to leave, figuring the kids wouldn\u2019t be welcome there, but the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 insisted they sit at the bar with us.", "Dean was served a towering lemonade in an elegant flute and Paulina drank a Shirley Temple with three skewered cherries, served in a martini glass. My husband and I happily downed our elderflower cocktails. Paulina knocked her round lip balm behind the bar, sending it like a pinball ricocheting off the glasses, but Dean reached in and rescued it before the bartender even noticed.", "That night we decided to walk to the restaurant Bern, where we had enjoyed our first fondue ever as a married couple. (Fondue has since become a New Year\u2019s tradition in our home.) We had made a reservation earlier in the day and walked across town to Nieuwmarkt square, past the brightly lit, castle-like de Waag building, and down the street Wendell vividly remembered, only to find the restaurant wasn\u2019t there.", "At my urging, he grudgingly searched for it on Google (another convenient invention since our honeymoon days) and found it on a street nearby, a temporary location while the original was being renovated.", "Paulina was famished by this point and asked every few minutes when the fondue and entrec\u00f4te steak would arrive.

It was the warmest, sunniest day yet. In a cafe inside the park, we ordered cappuccino \u2014 Paulina\u2019s first ever. She practically licked the cup clean and declared her newfound love: coffee.", "She bounced and danced back to the hotel, but an hour later was alarmed when her hands began to shake and her stomach started aching. She crawled into bed with me and announced that would be her last cup of coffee. I agreed.", "Dean complained every morning that we were waking him too early (9:30 a.m., just in time for the tail end of our hotel breakfast). He also complained of the church outside our window waking him up with its quarter-hour bells in the middle of the night. We let him have a half-cup of coffee at breakfast so he would stop complaining, even though Paulina told him it was mistake. Shaking and stomach pains did not ensue.", "The next day, we visited the Anne Frank House, which I hadn\u2019t realized was right around the corner from our hotel. Before \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d Paulina\u2019s favorite book had been \u201cAnne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.\u201d The museum has a cameo in \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d so her two favorite books were linked. She was excited to visit. Dean, a history buff, was also looking forward to seeing the house where Anne and her family hid during the Nazi occupation.", "When we visited 20 years ago, the effects of the space cakes hadn\u2019t quite worn off yet, and I found myself sobbing quietly as I read the displays and gazed at Anne\u2019s red-checked diary. I hoped to approach the museum with a clear head this time.", "The house, like the rest of Amsterdam, was much more crowded now with tourists. And since our last visit, the house had undergone a major renovation, making it look more like a modern museum than a typical canal house. But as soon as I saw enlarged black-and-white snapshots of young Anne, the tears welled up again. The fact that Anne was so close in age to my children set me off.", "When we climbed to the top of the steep stairs and peered out the back window Anne had looked out of, we could see the same church steeple she had gazed upon, the Westerkerk, and hear the same bells that had been waking Dean each night. It was the same steeple we could see from our hotel balcony. The coincidence gave me chills, and I suddenly realized just how lucky we were to be here together under such radically different circumstances, on a carefree family vacation, free to complain to each other and tease each other and eat together whatever meals we chose, free to aimlessly wander the beautiful streets of Amsterdam.", "On our last night in town, we booked a table at the restaurant d\u2019Vijff Vlieghen (Five Flies), a hodgepodge of five small structures built in 1627, with etchings by our old pal Rembrandt, antiques and original blue Delft tiles lining the walls.", "Ours were the only children in the upscale, romantic spot, otherwise filled by English and French couples. But our children made us proud. The conversation zipped along, as it had the entire trip, far more animated than at our dinner table in Brooklyn following a long day of work and school.", "The waiter, impressed by their behavior, even gave Dean a glass of Champagne to toast our trip. A different trip, indeed. At the meal\u2019s end, Paulina decided to forgo the coffee and later, when packing, left her crafting scissors on the bedside table."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/opinion/diet-advice-that-ignores-hunger.html": ["TOWARD the end of the Second World War, researchers at the University of Minnesota began a legendary experiment on the psychology and physiology of human starvation \u2014 and, thus, on hunger. The subjects were 36 conscientious objectors, some lean, some not. For 24 weeks, these men were semi-starved, fed not quite 1,600 calories a day of foods chosen to represent the fare of European famine areas: \u201cwhole-wheat bread, potatoes, cereals and considerable amounts of turnips and cabbage\u201d with \u201ctoken amounts\u201d of meat and dairy.", "As diets go, it was what nutritionists today would consider a low-calorie, and very low-fat diet, with only 17 percent of calories coming from fat.", "What happened to these men is a lesson in our ability to deal with caloric deprivation, which means, as well, a lesson in any expectations we might have about most current weight-loss advice, and perhaps particularly the kind that begins with \u201ceat less\u201d and \u201crestrict fat.\u201d", "The men lost an average of a pound of body fat a week over the first 12 weeks, but averaged only a quarter-pound per week over the next 12, despite the continued deprivation. And this was not their only physiological reaction. Their extremities swelled; their hair fell out; wounds healed slowly. They felt continually cold; their metabolism slowed.", "More troubling were the psychological effects. The men became depressed, lethargic and irritable. They threw tantrums. They lost their libido. They thought obsessively about food, day and night. The Minnesota researchers called this \u201csemi-starvation neurosis.\u201d Four developed \u201ccharacter neurosis.\u201d Two had breakdowns, one with \u201cweeping, talk of suicide and threats of violence.\u201d He was committed to the psychiatric ward. The \u201cpersonality deterioration\u201d of the other \u201cculminated in two attempts at self-mutilation.\u201d He nearly detached the tip of one finger and later chopped off three with an ax.", "When the period of imposed starvation ended, the subjects were allowed to \u201crefeed.\u201d At first they were allowed to eat more calories, but restricted as to how much. A subset under continued observation was then allowed to eat to satiety, which was surprisingly hard to achieve. The men consumed prodigious amounts of food, up to 10,000 calories a day. They regained weight and fat with remarkable rapidity. After 20 weeks of recovery, they averaged 50 percent more body fat than they had when it began \u2014 \u201cpost-starvation obesity,\u201d the researchers called it.", "Implicit in many discussions of how best to lose weight is the assumption that hunger, which is a consequence of caloric deprivation, is not an issue. Health and government organizations tell the obese and overweight, who now make up just over two-thirds of our adult population, to do what the study\u2019s subjects did: Eat less, cut back on calories.", "That advice implies that the ensuing hunger will be an easily bearable burden (no depression, lethargy, irritability \u2014 no tantrums, please!). And bearable not just for 24 weeks, but a lifetime. The Minnesota experiment tells us that when semi-starvation ends, the refeeding period will not end well.", "This issue of how to diet, and how to lose weight, was in the news again recently when a study was published by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. The researchers confined their obese subjects (nine women, 10 men) to a hospital ward and then put them on diets that approached semi-starvation, feeding them an average of more than 820 fewer calories a day than they needed to maintain their weight. They averaged about 1,920 calories a day, but one diet was composed of foods that were 29 percent carbohydrates and 50 percent fat \u2014 the carb-restricted diet \u2014 and the other was composed of foods that were 71 percent carbohydrates and only 8 percent fat \u2014 the fat-restricted diet.", "The subjects were then required to eat these diets, not a calorie more or less, for six days \u2014 not 24 weeks.", "An N.I.H. official hailed the study as providing \u201cinvaluable evidence on how different types of calories affect metabolism and body composition.\u201d Google News referenced well over 200 entries about the study in the first three days after publication.", "What made the headlines? That the subjects lost more fat by restricting dietary fat than they did by restricting the same number of carbohydrate calories. \u201cScientists (sort of) settle debate on low-carb vs. low-fat diets,\u201d as The Washington Post put it.", "But the devil in nutrition studies is always in the kind of details that are encapsulated by phrases like \u201csort of.\u201d Whether the evidence was invaluable, as the N.I.H. claimed, depends on a number of issues. Is the experience of six days relevant to what happens over months, years or a lifetime? There\u2019s little reason to think so. Can humans survive (and if so, for how long) on a diet of 8 percent fat? The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has said 15 percent is the lower limit. And then is a diet with about 30 percent carbohydrates sufficiently restricted to be considered a low-carb diet \u2014 the N.I.H. diet included blueberry muffins at breakfast, spaghetti at lunch and wraps for dinner.", "Those who argue publicly (as I do) that refined grains and sugars cause obesity believe that losing meaningful weight requires far more significant changes in the quality of carbohydrates consumed (far less refined) and in the amount (less than 20 percent, perhaps less than 10).", "Finally, what about hunger? By inflicting caloric deprivation for only six days, the researchers seem to have made the implicit decision that hunger \u2014 the biological response to caloric deprivation \u2014 is irrelevant to how we should think about a weight-loss diet. That the subjects might be hungrier on one diet than the other was also not addressed.", "The low-fat diet of the N.I.H. experiment had significantly less fat (8 percent vs. 17 percent) and only 350 more calories a day than the diet on which the Minnesota researchers drove their conscientious objectors to the point of character neurosis and mental breakdowns. The N.I.H. diet had more protein, too. But the history of diet studies (and human populations) suggests that caloric deprivation is unsustainable.", "That humans or any other organism will lose weight if starved sufficiently has never been news. The trick, if such a thing exists, is finding a way to do it without hunger so weight loss can be sustained indefinitely. A selling point for carbohydrate-restricted diets has always been that you can eat to satiety; counting calories is unnecessary, so long as carbohydrates are mostly avoided.", "But this advice raises a pair of obvious questions, or at least it should: If people on low-carb diets eat less (the conventional explanation for any loss of fat that ensues), why aren\u2019t they hungry? Where\u2019s the semi-starvation neurosis? And if they don\u2019t eat less, why do they lose weight? It implies a mechanism of weight loss other than caloric deprivation and suggests that the carbohydrates and fats consumed make a difference.", "Questions like these about the relationship between calories, macronutrients and hunger have haunted nutrition and obesity research since the late 1940s. But rarely are they asked. We believe so implicitly in the rationale of eat less, move more, that we (at least those of us who are lean) will implicitly fault the obese for their failures to sustain a calorie-restricted regimen, without ever apparently asking ourselves whether we could sustain it either. I have a colleague who spent his research career studying hunger. Asking people to eat less, he says, is like asking them to breathe less. It sounds reasonable, so long as you don\u2019t expect them to keep it up for long.", "Much of the obesity research for the past century has focused on elucidating behavioral techniques that could induce the obese to eat less, tolerate hunger better, and so, by this logic, lose weight. The obesity epidemic suggests that it has failed.", "For those who believe that hunger is somehow all in the mind, rather than a powerful biological response to caloric deprivation, it is tempting to wish on them the fate that the goddess Ceres bestowed on King Erysichthon of Thessaly in Greek mythology. She \u201cdevised a punishment to rouse men\u2019s pity\u2026 to torment him with baleful Hunger.\u201d Erysichthon then eats himself out of castle and kingdom and ultimately dies by feeding, \u201clittle by little, on his own body.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/universal/es/mas-alla-de-la-busqueda-con-alphabet-google-le-apuesta-a-sonar-en-grande.html": ["MOUNTAIN VIEW, California \u2014 Poco despu\u00e9s de su nacimiento, Google public\u00f3 un documento llamado \u201cDiez cosas que sabemos que son ciertas\u201d, un esfuerzo por condensar su inusual cultura corporativa en una lista sucinta de prescripciones: los 10 mandamientos de la esencia Google.

Ad blocking has been around for years, but adoption is now rising steeply, at a pace that some in the ad industry say could prove catastrophic for the economic structure underlying the web. That has spurred a debate about the ethic of ad blocking. Some publishers and advertisers say ad blocking violates the implicit contract that girds the Internet \u2014 the idea that in return for free content, we all tolerate a constant barrage of ads.", "But in the long run, there could be a hidden benefit to blocking ads for advertisers and publishers: Ad blockers could end up saving the ad industry from its worst excesses. If blocking becomes widespread, the ad industry will be pushed to produce ads that are simpler, less invasive and far more transparent about the way they\u2019re handling our data \u2014 or risk getting blocked forever if they fail.", "\u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the ads ecosystem is broken,\u201d said Ben Williams, a spokesman for Eyeo, the German company that makes Adblock Plus, the most popular ad-blocking software. \u201cWhat we need is a sea change in the industry to get to a place where we have a good amount of better ads out there, ads that users accept.\u201d", "The industry may not have much time to wait. In a report last week, Adobe and PageFair, an Irish start-up that tracks ad-blocking, estimated that blockers will cost publishers nearly $22 billion in revenue this year. Nearly 200 million people worldwide regularly block ads, the report said, and the number is growing fast, increasing 41 percent globally in the last year.", "Today ad-blocking is mostly restricted to desktop web browsers. But iOS 9, Apple\u2019s latest mobile operating system, will include support for ad blockers when it becomes available in the fall. Several ad-blocking firms are already creating apps for the new OS; when it\u2019s out, you\u2019ll simply download an ad blocker and no longer have to see ads on the iPhone\u2019s version of Safari and possibly in other apps that open web links.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s likely to happen is that of the 200 million people who use ad blocking now, let\u2019s say half of them have iPhones \u2014 they\u2019re all going to install one of these things,\u201d said Sean Blanchfield, the chief executive of PageFair. \u201cThen they\u2019ll start telling all their friends about this amazing app that saves your battery, saves your data and speeds up the web, and it\u2019s likely to go viral. A lot of people are going to get accustomed to having an ad-free mobile experience.\u201d", "It\u2019s important to note that PageFair has skin in this game, and some have accused the company of self-interested alarmism.", "PageFair also sells technology that allows web publishers to determine if users are running blocking software \u2014 and then serves them ads anyway, going around the blockers. PageFair\u2019s software, which Mr. Blanchfield said is currently being tested with a number of large websites, circumvents ad blocking by using \u201clow-level networking\u201d technology that he declined to detail in order to stay ahead of ad companies.", "Showing ads to people who have downloaded ad blockers sounds a little spammy. But in a twist, it may also lead to better ads. Here\u2019s how: PageFair\u2019s canny strategy to mitigate users\u2019 outrage is that it will only show ads that aren\u2019t \u201cintrusive,\u201d Mr. Blanchfield said. That means the ads won\u2019t feature animations, they won\u2019t block content, and they won\u2019t load \u201ctrackers\u201d that monitor and report back to some unknown server what you do on a web page.", "By requiring companies to run ads that are simple and transparent, Mr. Blanchfield said, PageFair would return sanity to the ad business. \u201cWe as an industry have lost the trust of our users, who are right \u2014 there are a lot of very bad ads out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have one shot as an industry to get this right.\u201d", "PageFair is just one of the firms trying to create an ecosystem that produces better ads. After wrestling with the implications of their software, the founders of AdBlock Plus created an initiative called \u201cAcceptable Ads,\u201d which sets out a standard for ads that the software will let users see despite having ad-blocking turned on. These ads are also low-fi \u2014 they can\u2019t be animated or cover up a page\u2019s content. (Eyeo charges some large companies a fee to show these ads; Google, for instance, pays Eyeo to have its search ads show up for Adblock Plus users.)", "Then there\u2019s Ghostery, which makes a plug-in that lets users find and block online tracking tools \u2014 the code in a page that sends data about your surfing habits to marketers. According to the company, the number of such trackers has exploded in recent years because marketing software used to analyze consumer behavior has become much easier to use. Ghostery reported 22 trackers on a page for Slate, 18 on one for Business Insider, 22 at The Wall Street Journal, and 26 for The New York Times.", "Not only do these trackers represent efforts to profile you, but they also waste time \u2014 when you see a web page stuck loading, you can usually blame one of these trackers. Ghostery aims to fix that. For a fee, the company reports to site owners which trackers are slowing down pages \u2014 which in turn may improve how ads are served. It will also soon unveil a \u201cGhostery score\u201d that will show users which sites to trust based on the trackers that sites are loading up.", "The pattern here is ironic: PageFair, AdBlock Plus and Ghostery, which all depend to some extent on consumers\u2019 interest in blocking ads, are also all pushing innovative efforts to create better ads.", "Even some in the ad industry acknowledge this dynamic. Scott Cunningham, the general manager of the technology lab for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the trade group that comes up with online advertising standards, said his group had already begun to respond to users who are downloading the software; most recently, he said, the bureau has been working to create clearer guidelines for the trackers\u2019 coded web pages.", "\u201cAs we\u2019ve watched the incidence rate of ad blocking, we\u2019ve said, \u2018O.K., it\u2019s time for us to put the clamps onto some of the areas we haven\u2019t addressed yet,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Cunningham said.", "That suggests another practical utility of ad blocking \u2014 it appears to be an effective form of protest.

Like you, I\u2019ve been a bit skeptical about these perks. Once I asked Laszlo Bock, Google\u2019s director for people operations (Google\u2019s name for human resources), about them: Do you calculate the return-on-investment of all this stuff, and are you only offering perks when they help you keep employees working longer, or improve recruitment, or reduce attrition?", "His answer: Not directly. Mr. Bock argues that what Google cares about is not the number of hours people work, but rather their happiness while they\u2019re there. He says happiness is one of the key ingredients for creativity, and at tech companies, whose overriding mission is often to create stuff that doesn\u2019t exist, employee creativity is all that matters. Through scientifically rigorous research techniques, Google does attempt to measure happiness. Insofar as things like expanded maternity and paternity leave improve happiness, they improve Google\u2019s overall fortunes, he says.", "Does this sound like dreamy, Bay Area progressive pap? Probably! But according to Google, the policies that improve people\u2019s happiness also often make economic sense for the company. Maternity and paternity leave is a good example. In 2007, after noticing that women were leaving the company at a higher rate than men, Google expanded paid maternity leave to 18 weeks from 12 weeks, and later the rate at which new mothers left fell by 50 percent. The policy change paid for itself in reduced turnover alone, Google said. But it could benefit the company even more if one of those people who decided not to leave invents the next big thing.", "In other words, altruism pays.", "Oh, and Mike, this whole discussion got me thinking: I wish you\u2019d take unlimited leave.", "Mike: Funny you say that!

In May, Google stopped enrolling any new self-publishing authors. At the same time, a team of employees went through all of the complaints filed by publishers. Pirate accounts were deleted.

(One blurb praises its \u2018\u2018actionable insights.\u2019\u2019) Musicians today know that you have to be a pro to succeed: compliant, controlled, image-focused and customer-service-oriented. Tossing vending machines off balconies is not cost-effective and just sends the wrong message.", "Years ago, in the early \u201990s, I took a copywriting class at a large Chicago ad agency, and the teacher told us a story about how, a few years earlier, he tried to persuade the indie band Timbuk3 to allow his client \u00ad\u2014 I think it was Procter & Gamble \u2014 to use its song \u2018\u2018Hairstyles and Attitudes\u2019\u2019 in a commercial, but the musicians refused. I was struck by his contempt for their decision, and how fresh his anger seemed. He kept sputtering the reason they gave for turning down his agency\u2019s offer \u2014 \u2018\u2018They didn\u2019t want to sell out!\u2019\u2019 \u2014 as if it constituted not just an unthinkable betrayal but also a reprehensible moral lapse. He seemed to expect us to mirror his indignation, but we just sat there, feeling uncomfortable.", "Today, not only would the band that wrote the song about hairstyles accept the shampoo company\u2019s offer without hesitating, it would also gratefully participate in any and all cross-promotional efforts, cheerfully splicing its DNA with that of its benevolent sponsors on social media and on TV. It would go on late-night shows and gamely participate in any attendant self-mockery. The copywriter would use it as an example of leveraging brand synergies through 360-degree cross-platform campaigns, and the kids in his class would think he was a rock star."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/upshot/is-the-new-google-more-like-berkshire-hathaway-general-electric-or-att.html": ["Google\u2019s decision to restructure is the strongest signal yet that it intends to be a 21st-century innovator, a bold creator of new products, not simply a harvester of profits from its lucrative search engine business.", "But 20th-century business history offers three ways to think about what Google is up to here, embodied in three potential analogues: Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett; General Electric, the industrial conglomerate; and AT&T, which operated the wildly innovative Bell Labs until 1996.", "Google is to become but one (very large, very profitable) subsidiary of a holding company called Alphabet. The other (so far unprofitable) ambitious initiatives Google has taken on (driverless cars, life-extension technology and more) will be separate subsidiaries, as will future shoot-the-moon ventures that the firm buys or builds.", "Here\u2019s what each of the three pathways looks like and what they might mean for Alphabet, Google and innovation in the decades ahead.", "Berkshire Hathaway", "When Google announced its new structure Monday, a rather uncommon word started appearing in business media: \u201cconglomerateur.\u201d As in, that may just be what the Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are becoming \u2014 builders of a corporate empire that will stretch across industries into whatever field they find interesting and lucrative.", "That is the strategy that has made Mr. Buffett one of the world\u2019s wealthiest people and Berkshire Hathaway one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. Its largest interests are in insurance, but those interests stretch far afield, from mobile homes and private jets to Heinz ketchup and Duracell batteries. This week\u2019s $37 billion deal for the aerospace parts maker Precision Castparts is Mr. Buffett\u2019s largest acquisition to date.", "Already Mr. Page gave a nod to this strategy in his letter announcing the new structure. \u201cAlphabet is about business prospering through strong leaders and independence,\u201d he said, with the subsidiaries each having a strong C.E.O. He and Mr. Brin \u201cwill rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well.\u201d", "Mr. Buffett could say much the same; he gives his managers wide discretion to manage the operational details of their business; Berkshire\u2019s corporate office in Omaha is minuscule \u2014 24 employees overseeing a company with 340,000 employees.", "But the differences may be more important. Berkshire is all about acquiring companies that are well established, with proven models for profitability, at favorable prices. Mr. Buffett has eschewed technology businesses or pretty much any company with a business model or prospects that are hard to project.", "Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, by contrast, build things that have never existed before, or that are hard to imagine. It would be a major reversal if they changed their focus to trying to find steady, reliable assets that are undervalued by the marketplace. A more Buffett-style approach might be welcome news for Google shareholders, but it would mean a pivot from the grand ambitions of their recent ventures.", "General Electric", "Maybe a different type of conglomerate is the model for Alphabet. Thomas Edison helped found General Electric, and a long-lasting light bulb and electric lights were some of the original products. It soon expanded into locomotives and then X-ray machines and electrical appliances. It made radios and then televisions, and the broadcast networks that produced content for them. Its researchers played key roles inventing fiber optic cables, M.R.I. body scanners and countless other technologies.", "The parallels with Alphabet are obvious. It may be that running a search engine has about as much in common with running a driverless car company as, say, a locomotive has in common with a television broadcaster.", "But G.E. has prospered by combining a strong organizational culture in which the different arms of the company are operationally independent, but have linkages that benefit them all. The ability to take centralized research and development work and apply it to a wide range of usable products has been a boon; the laser, on which G.E. researchers did key work, found its way into both medical uses and telecommunications uses, for example.", "The idea is that different though the G.E. business lines might be, each is stronger together than any one of them would be on its own. It\u2019s easy to see why Google\u2019s leadership might want to emulate General Electric \u2014 G.E. has created products over the last century that have revolutionized daily life and rewarded its shareholders handsomely in the process.", "Less clear is whether the various arms of Alphabet will, over time, be as integrated into a coherent whole as G.E. is. Executives at G.E. make their way through the ranks, across industries and geographies, creating a strong corporate culture (nicely parodied by the fictional Jack Donaghy in \u201c30 Rock,\u201d who was \u201cVice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming\u201d).", "Alphabet may have the same grand ambitions that G.E. had a century ago to create groundbreaking products. An important question is whether it becomes a centralized innovation machine or a bunch of separate projects that happen to have the same corporate parent but not much else in common. Can it make its various initiatives more than the sum of their parts?", "AT&T/Bell Labs", "Google\u2019s leaders want to invest in ambitious science and great innovation. Perhaps no corporate entity has done more of that than Bell Labs, which was the research offshoot of the telecommunications firm AT&T from 1925 to 1996. (It was spun off as Lucent Technologies and is now part of Alcatel-Lucent.)", "Just as G.E.\u2019s history dates to Edison, Bell Labs dates to the telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell. It played key roles inventing the transistor, the laser, communications satellites, solar cells and several important computer programming languages. It counts eight Nobel Prizes for work done at the labs.", "AT&T, as the monopoly telephone service provider in the United States for decades, earned vast sums and funneled some of the money into Bell Labs.", "Some of those Bell Labs innovations paid off in the form of profits that benefited AT&T shareholders. But the connection between dollars spent on research and dollars earned from future products was a tenuous one, especially for work on basic research.", "Alphabet could emulate this. In this example, Google\u2019s dominant position in search advertising plays the role of the old AT&T phone monopoly. It earns a lot of money, and its managers will siphon off a portion of the profits to fund all sorts of basic research.", "That parallel shows the risks for Google executives of going too far down the Bell Labs route. That all worked so long as AT&T was earning monopoly profits as the nation\u2019s telephone provider. But after the breakup of the company by federal antitrust enforcers in 1982, the expense became harder to justify.", "In other words, it\u2019s an approach that can fund world-changing research \u2014 but only so long as the underlying business remains a cash cow.", "If the new Alphabet can be remotely as successful \u2014 in terms of innovation or financial returns \u2014 as these companies, its shareholders and users of its products will be very happy. But the historical parallels suggest that there may be a trade-off in which what is best for shareholders and what is best for innovation aren\u2019t always the same thing."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/us/bay-areas-disjointed-public-transit-network-inspires-a-call-for-harmony.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 There is much to relish about the Bay Area, from the intoxicating landscape to the blissful lack of humidity.", "One thing is not perfect, though: the daunting nature of the region\u2019s public transportation system, a patchwork of more than 20 operators spread across nine counties and 101 municipalities that have yet to spawn a cohesive map.", "As housing costs here continue to escalate, with growing numbers of people moving farther afield in search of affordability, the disjointed nature of the region\u2019s transportation fiefs, each with its own fare structures and nomenclature, has become the topic of increasingly intense debate among transportation policy experts.", "A study released this year by SPUR, a Bay Area urban planning and policy think tank, encapsulated much of the public frustration on the subject and has been widely discussed on blogs and in public forums, including one at the venerable Commonwealth Club of California.", "\u201cNinety percent of the people in the Bay Area are essentially tourists when it comes to transit,\u201d said Ratna Amin, SPUR\u2019s transportation policy director. \u201cThey don\u2019t use it.\u201d", "The study recommends a variety of changes, from better trip-planning tools to smoother transfers. But there are roughly two dozen transit agencies in the region, and each operates and plans its system independently, with its own funding sources, which makes any uniform change difficult.", "Unlike in New York and Boston, where consistent maps and signage aid navigation and a single fare card generally takes riders all over the city, passengers in the Bay Area juggle multiple maps, timetables and a bewildering number of fare combinations, said Randy Rentschler, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the region\u2019s transportation planning and finance agency.", "\u201cNobody would set out to invent the system we have now,\u201d Mr. Rentschler said.", "For example, those age 12 and under get a youth discount on the Bay Area Rapid Transit, known as BART, which connects the East Bay, including Berkeley and Oakland, to San Francisco proper, but also goes all the way to San Francisco International Airport. But those age 18 and under get a youth discount on CalTrain, which goes from San Jose and other points in Silicon Valley to San Francisco. CalTrain has zoned fares in six zones, with different fares for each of the six bus companies that are also within its purview. Golden Gate Transit ferries and buses have their own zoned passes. And there are numerous types of passes \u2014 monthly, weekly, daily \u2014 on different systems.", "Part of the problem is geography. At the Bay Area\u2019s heart \u201cis an obstacle \u2014 the bay,\u201d said Jarrett Walker, a transportation planning and policy consultant who edits the blog HumanTransit.org and has written a book of the same title (Island Press, 2011). \u201cThere are three cities that with some justification regard themselves as important centers in their own right,\u201d he said, referring to San Francisco itself, Oakland and San Jose. \u201cPeople live \u2018over the hill\u2019 or \u2018across the water.\u2019 There\u2019s a weaker sense of region.\u201d", "The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency oversees the city proper\u2019s surface transportation network, including bike lanes, public transit, traffic, parking and taxis. But it carries less than half of the region\u2019s trips. Commuters traveling by public transportation from the East Bay to Mountain View or other Silicon Valley locations face a train ride and at least three buses \u2014 a connection possible only if everything is on time.", "And demand has grown for these services. The traffic lull that occurred after the dot-com bust is long gone. In 2014, drivers wasted an average of 78 hours of delays in traffic, with San Francisco and San Jose ranking among the top five worst cites in the United States for traffic, said Jim Bak, a director of Inrix, a transportation data and analysis company in Kirkland, Wash.", "Ridership on CalTrain is up by 10 percent, for example, \u201ca reflection of the economy and the appeal of San Francisco,\u201d said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association in Washington, D.C.", "Still, only about 10 percent of Bay Area commuters take public transportation, Mr. Rentschler said. The ascendance of the so-called Google buses, which ferry workers from various tech companies between far-flung suburban campuses and their neighborhoods in and around San Francisco and have drawn criticism from residents, underscores the need for a more efficient system, according to SPUR.", "Even transit operators agree that transfer points like Embarcadero Station in downtown San Francisco \u201care the places where we should be doubling down,\u201d said Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which oversees long-term planning and administers funding. The authority is working with BART on a rewards program that would coax riders into traveling during nonpeak hours either by offering points on electronic payment cards or luring them with prizes, like coupons from local businesses.", "Though certainly preferable to clogged highways, stations like Embarcadero test the mettle of even the most intrepid commuter. There, a transfer from BART to the city\u2019s light rail, known as MUNI, requires negotiating two levels, exiting through a turnstile, paying a new fare, entering another turnstile and descending another flight of stairs to reach a different platform.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a little intimidating,\u201d said Michael Beadle, 41, who completes that transfer daily in his commute from Castro Valley to his job at Ubisoft, a video game company. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve helped many travelers who got lost.\u201d", "Two creative citizens took the chaos into their own hands. Jay Primus, a 39-year-old transportation planner, and David Wiggins, a 43-year-old cartographer, were so frustrated by the cluttered 1970s San Francisco transit map that they decided to design their own. Nearly 10 years after they began, after protracted funding travails, they gave the design to the city\u2019s transportation agency, which made it the official system map. It uses thickness and color of lines to connote places where buses run on time and where service is more sporadic.", "\u201cA good map can help people understand how transit can serve them,\u201d Mr. Primus said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just where does the transit go, but how often it comes and how long might I have to wait?\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/24/business/big-investors-are-finding-ripe-start-up-targets-in-europe.html": ["Klaus Hommels has invested in some of Europe\u2019s most successful start-ups.

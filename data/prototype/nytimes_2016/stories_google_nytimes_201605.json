They said that Gawker abused its journalistic platform, it routinely invaded people\u2019s private lives, including outing their sexual orientation, and in other ways made life very difficult for wealthy coastal techies.", "I\u2019ve certainly not been a fan of everything Gawker has done. But I\u2019m struck by the inability of techies to consider both the proportionality of this punishment and the chilling effects this case could induce on the media generally. First, to me, it doesn\u2019t make sense that a small excerpt from a sex tape should result in a company-ending decision. And I don\u2019t see how techies could support that.", "Mike: I remember tech versus the F.B.I. squaring off a few months ago. The government said that the iPhone they wanted to hack was a special, one-off case and that it wouldn\u2019t force Apple to hack its own phones again in the future. Apple, and techies, said they feared the precedent it could set. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!", "Farhad: Right, it\u2019s a strange twist. And imagine if this same kind of punishment \u2014 the idea that a single post could lead to damages of $140 million \u2014 were applied to to the rest of the tech industry. It would be ruinous to a business whose mantra is to move fast and break things. For example: The blood-testing start-up Theranos just had to invalidate two years of blood tests because of alleged lab mismanagement. The adult meetup site Ashley Madison protected its user database so poorly that its whole collection was leaked after a hack, ruining many lives. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Snapchat and several other tech companies have been forced to sign 20-year legal agreements with the Federal Trade Commission over their reckless privacy standards.", "All of these examples are potentially far more damaging to the world than a leaked sex tape. But none of these companies were fined anywhere near hundreds of millions of dollars for their recklessness. Do tech venture capitalists really want to support a system in which moving fast and breaking things results in company-ending lawsuits?", "Mike: Here\u2019s the flip side of that argument: I\u2019ve had quite a few tech workers tell me via Twitter that the reason anti-Slapp laws \u2014 or those that protect against frivolous lawsuits \u2014 exist is because of this very thing. If the system is doing its job, then the news organization has nothing to worry about, and the frivolous will be sorted out while those cases with merit will soldier on.", "I\u2019m not sure I quite believe that. But it\u2019s fair to say that Gawker had its day in court \u2014 with a lot of caveats over jurisdiction and judge and jury, Gawker supporters would say \u2014 and that the company lost the case. This should be a deterrent to \u201cbad\u201d journalism.", "That\u2019s a rosy view, but again, I don\u2019t quite buy it wholesale. Do I agree with every story Gawker chooses to publish? No. Do I think they do good journalism? Absolutely. Do I think people with money will use a tactic such as Thiel\u2019s for only its \u201cproper\u201d and intended purpose of eliminating the wrong in the world? No way, Jos\u00e9.", "Farhad: That\u2019s Mr. Jos\u00e9 to you, pal. Anyway, sure, Gawker had its day in court and it lost (and it is appealing). But as the journalist Felix Salmon has argued, if Thiel-like litigation financing becomes widespread, it could place burdens on all publications, even ones that aren\u2019t as reckless as Gawker was. It essentially forces media companies to put more of their articles through legal review, an idea that doesn\u2019t scale to the kind of freewheeling media that tech types are themselves financing \u2014 sites like BuzzFeed, Vox, Business Insider and Vice.", "But I don\u2019t want to get too carried away with this. Because, taking a cue from Wired, I should add here that I love Peter Thiel! He\u2019s a gentleman and a scholar, a first-rate chap. Peter, I have two children and a mortgage.

This allowed me to look into ancient questions. Do we turn to humor because we are happy or sad?", "I thought we used humor to deal with the horror of human existence. Many famous comedians have experienced trauma and depression. Personally, I turn to comedy when I am unhappy. Granted, I\u2019m almost always miserable and almost always looking to laugh, so that doesn\u2019t tell us much.", "I am not alone in thinking pain and humor are connected. Soren Kierkegaard wrote, \u201cThe more one suffers, the more, I believe, has one a sense for the comic.\u201d Or as Charlie Chaplin put it, \u201cLaughter is the tonic, the relief, the surcease from pain.\u201d Mark Twain felt the same way: \u201cThe secret source of humor itself is not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.\u201d", "Our collective Google searches can\u2019t tell us whether pain and sorrow drive professional comedians, but the database does give some clues about the rest of us.", "There are many potential humor-related searches you can make \u2014 \u201cDaily Show clips,\u201d \u201cLouis C. K. stand-up,\u201d \u201cKnicks highlights.\u201d To keep it simple, I counted any search that included the word \u201cjokes,\u201d though I also checked the results against a broader set of searches.", "There are more than 100 million searches every year in the United States that include the word \u201cjokes.\u201d Americans make more searches for \u201cjokes\u201d than they do for \u201csweaters,\u201d \u201cwhiskey\u201d or \u201cvitamins.\u201d", "I looked first at searches for jokes by day of the week. Monday, psychological and sociological evidence suggests, is the most miserable day of the week. If we seek humor to alleviate suffering, we should search for jokes most frequently on Mondays.", "But Monday is actually the day we are least likely to search for jokes. Searches for jokes climb through the week and are highest on Friday through Sunday. This isn\u2019t because people are too busy with work or school on Mondays. Searches for \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201cdoctor\u201d are all highest on Mondays.", "Second, I compared searches for jokes to the weather. I did this for all searches in the New York City area over the past five years. Rain was a wash, but there were 6 percent fewer searches for jokes when it was below freezing. There were also 3 percent fewer searches for jokes on foggy days.", "Finally, I looked at searches for jokes during traumatic events. Consider, for example, the Boston Marathon bombing. Shortly after the bombing, searches for \u201cjokes\u201d dropped nearly 20 percent. They remained almost as low in the days after the attack, including the Friday when Boston was in lockdown while the authorities searched for the bomber who was still on the loose. They didn\u2019t return to normal until two weeks later.", "Sure, some other entertainment searches, like \u201cmusic\u201d and \u201cshopping,\u201d also dropped after the bombing. Declines in these searches, however, were smaller than declines in searches for jokes, and some entertainment searches, like \u201cgames,\u201d actually rose during the manhunt.", "Google searches can also give us new clues on the content of jokes. Do people look for jokes that relate to the darkness and void of human existence? Sometimes, but not that often. About 53 percent of searches Americans make for jokes are for light or corny jokes \u2014 searches like \u201cfun jokes,\u201d \u201ckids jokes\u201d or \u201cdad jokes.\u201d", "About 29 percent are for vicious jokes \u2014 those making fun of other people.

Popular joke topics include physical deformity (\u201cHelen Keller jokes\u201d), uncomfortable subjects (\u201cpoop jokes\u201d) and inappropriate topics (\u201cdirty jokes\u201d).", "Perhaps the clearest evidence that jokes can be used to deal with taboo subjects is the popularity of \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In the United States, \u201cdead baby jokes\u201d are now the 13th most popular joke topic, with about 600,000 Google searches every year. Searches for \u201cdead baby jokes\u201d have nearly caught up in popularity to \u201cblonde jokes\u201d and are within an order of magnitude of \u201cknock knock jokes.\u201d", "Interestingly, Americans do not seem to seek out dark jokes even when they are suffering. Searches for jokes on uncomfortable topics are also lowest on Mondays. They also fell sharply after the Boston Marathon bombing.", "There is more evidence that distance from trauma is a necessary condition for joking about trauma. Return to \u201cdead baby jokes,\u201d but this time consider search rates around the world. The higher a country\u2019s infant mortality rate, the less it searches for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In countries with the lowest infant mortality rates, 1 in 180 jokes searches is for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d In countries with the highest infant mortality rates, about 1 in 1,300 jokes searches is for \u201cdead baby jokes.\u201d", "It is not clear exactly how to interpret this relationship, since Internet users in developing countries are not a representative sample. But the relationship is so strong, it does at least suggest that some exposure to a horror can substantially curtail jokes about it.", "Another interesting data point on the relationship between trauma and jokes is a search unusually popular among Hebrew speakers about one of history\u2019s most horrific events, which wiped out nearly half of my family. In Israel, \u201cHolocaust jokes\u201d is the 12th most popular Hebrew-language search for jokes.", "Holocaust jokes are extremely crude.

This seems to support a view of humor as helping people deal with extreme suffering and fear. But the timing of these searches reveals a more nuanced story.", "Hebrew-language searches for Holocaust jokes tend to be lowest when threats to Israel are highest. In June 2014, after three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped by Hamas operatives, Israelis\u2019 searches for Holocaust jokes dropped to their lowest level in more than five years.", "Our Google searches represent a small slice of how we consume humor.

He went to see his doctor, and learned he had a genetic disease that enlarges and weakens the heart. Segal was about to turn 50, but his heart was pumping at one-eighth of a normal heart\u2019s effectiveness. He needed a transplant.", "He got on a waiting list, and for the next five years, he was in and out of hospitals while his heart deteriorated further. He underwent multiple 12-hour operations. A defibrillator was installed in his chest. Then came mechanical pumps for both ventricles. \u201cI got a belt from a police wholesale site to carry around these huge batteries,\u201d he said. Because the heart pumps had an 18-month life span, an imminent transplant became his only option.", "So he and his family played a risky card. \u201cYou are allowed to choose a 30-day period where you can be listed as \u20181A,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the highest priority designation for transplant. During that month, Segal needed to be matched with a donor with blood type O who weighed at least 180 pounds.

Today, donors and recipients can be precisely matched through tissue typing, organs can be transported long distances, and organ rejection and debilitating side effects can be controlled with improved immunosuppressant drugs. Last year, nearly 31,000 lives were saved in the United States through transplants.", "But there is a problem: Demand for organ transplants vastly outstrips supply, as my colleague Tina Rosenberg has reported. In 2015 in the United States, there were only about 9,000 deceased donors (each of whom can save up to eight lives) and 6,000 living donors (who most often donate a kidney or liver lobe). Today, more than 121,000 people are on waiting lists, roughly 100,000 for kidney transplants, 15,000 for livers, and 4,000 for hearts. And the lists keep getting longer \u2014 3,000 people are added to the kidney list each month. Last year, more than 4,000 people died while waiting for a new kidney; 3,600 dropped off the waiting list because they became too sick to qualify for a transplant.", "Although 95 percent of Americans support organ donation, fewer than half of American adults are registered as donors. Research suggests that the number who donate organs after death could be increased greatly. Moreover, surveys indicate untapped support for living donation, too; nearly one in four people have told pollsters they would be willing to donate a kidney to save the life of a friend, community member or stranger. \u201cIf one in 10,000 Americans decided to donate each year, there wouldn\u2019t be a shortage,\u201d said Josh Morrison, who donated a kidney to a stranger and founded WaitList Zero, an organization that works to increase living kidney donation.", "What could be done to harness people\u2019s generous impulses more effectively to save lives?", "One group attacking the question is Organize, which was founded in 2014 by Rick Segal\u2019s son Greg, and Jenna Arnold, a media producer and educator who has worked with MTV and the United Nations in engaging audiences in social issues. Organize uses technology, open data and insights from behavioral economics to simplify becoming an organ donor.", "This approach is shaking up longstanding assumptions.", "For example, in the last four decades, people have most often been asked to register as an organ donor as part of renewing or obtaining a driver\u2019s license. This made sense in the 1970s, when the nation\u2019s organ procurement system was being set up, says Blair Sadler, the former president and chief executive of Rady Children\u2019s Hospital in San Diego. He helped draft the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act in 1967, which established a national legal framework for organ donation. \u201cHealth care leaders were asking, \u2018How do we make this more routine?\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get people to put it in their wills. Oh, there\u2019s a place where people have to go every five years\u201d \u2014 their state Department of Motor Vehicles.", "Today, governments allow individuals to initiate registrations online, but the process can be cumbersome. For example, New York State required me to fill out a digital form on my computer, then print it out and mail it to Albany. Donate Life America, by contrast, allows individuals to register online as an organ donor just by logging in with email or a Facebook or Google account \u2014 much easier.", "In practice, legal registration may be overemphasized. It may be just as important to simply make your wishes known to your loved ones. When people tell relatives, \u201cIf something happens to me, I want to be an organ donor,\u201d families almost always respect their wishes. This is particularly important for minors, who cannot legally register as donors.", "Using that insight, Organize is making it easier to conduct social media campaigns to both prompt and collect sentiments about organ donation from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "If you post or tweet about organ donation, or include a hashtag like #iwanttobeanorgandonor, #organdonor, #donatemyparts, or any of a number of other relevant terms, Organize captures the information and logs it in a registry. In a year, it has gathered the names of nearly 600,000 people who declare support for organ donation. Now the big question is: Will it actually increase organ donation rates?", "We should begin getting an idea pretty soon. Organize has been working with the Nevada Donor Network to test its registry. And in the coming months, several other states will begin using it.", "Most of the time, when a death occurs under circumstances that qualify for organ donation, it\u2019s still the next of kin who authorize donation. \u201cWhen families are going through the most horrific, tragic time of life, when family advocates on the ground talk about donation, the words they hear almost 100 percent of the time are, \u2018I just wish I knew what they wanted,\u2019\u201d explained Simon Keith, the chief operating officer of the Nevada Donor Network. (Keith was the first person to play a professional sport \u2014 soccer \u2014 after undergoing a heart transplant.)", "\u201cIt\u2019s a moral imperative to help next of kin make the most educated decision about their deceased loved one,\u201d said Arnold, the Organize co-founder. \u201cThey\u2019re often desperately looking for a sign. Seeing \u2018I want to be an #organdonor\u2019 explicitly, in someone\u2019s own words, could be that sign.\u201d", "Each year, organ procurement organizations identify thousands of potential donors in cases that don\u2019t lead to donations. Organ donation rates are lowest among people between the ages of 50 and 75. Many assume wrongly that organs from older people are not as valuable as those from someone younger. Others worry that donation violates religious beliefs, although mainstream religions strongly encourage it as an act of charity.", "What\u2019s needed are more conversations among parents, spouses and children, so everyone can be fully informed and understand one another\u2019s convictions. \u201cThe beautiful thing about social media, especially Facebook, is that it\u2019s cross generational,\u201d says Arnold. \u201cWe target millennials in our marketing because they tend to be the earliest adopters of new technology, but we specifically feed them content to share with their parents.\u201d", "Of course, concerns arise from using social declarations to inform major decisions. Can identity be confirmed? Is a tweet a compelling indication of intent? In the end, families must decide these questions based on information available. Legally speaking, any \u201cstatement or symbol\u201d that indicates a donor\u2019s wish can serve as consent. \u201cThe law is written broadly enough that you could write it on a cocktail napkin,\u201d Greg Segal says.", "Since 2015, the Nevada Donor Network has been using Organize\u2019s registry experimentally, said Keith. \u201cIn 2015, we identified 10 additional matches that would have provided another 35 organs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat translates to an 11 percent increase over the 320 organs we transplanted that year. We\u2019re now at a point where if we get a match, we\u2019ll begin using the information in conversations.\u201d", "He\u2019s captivated by the potential. It took 40 years to reach 150 million registered donors, he said. \u201cHow many of the others have phones? All of them. You can literally have Taylor Swift stand in front of 60,000 people and say, \u2018If you support organ donation, tweet #isupportorgandonation.\u2019\u201d", "Through Instagram, Arnold added, celebrities could share photos of transplant beneficiaries and reach millions of people in demographics that are largely untapped for organ donation education.", "\u201cThe game change of what Organize is doing \u2014 and I think it will save lives \u2014 is to build on the increasing acceptance of people making public declarations about their beliefs on a whole variety of things and applying that to their wishes about organ donation,\u201d said Sadler, who helped draft the original organ donation act. \u201cMost of us don\u2019t have these conversations. This could change the dynamic for grieving families \u2014 being able to acknowledge the wishes of their family member and find purpose in a tragedy.\u201d", "For Rick Segal, as the recipient of a gift of life, there is a dimension to Organize\u2019s work that has brought an added measure of comfort. \u201cThere\u2019s something called survivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that if you were given an organ, three other people didn\u2019t get it. You are walking around every day with the very thing that would have saved their lives \u2014 so you have this tremendous drive to prove that you are worthy. This phantom competition never leaves your mind. I feel that at least, by having what happened to me instill the vision and motivation in Greg and Jenna to take on this challenge, I\u2019m doing good in terms of payback.\u201d", "I\u2019ll continue to track Organize\u2019s work.

So it sat there.", "My interest heightened during the debates over the Iran nuclear deal, which seemed to highlight the increasingly sophisticated use of digital tools by powerful interests \u2014 including the White House \u2014 to achieve their policy aims, a practice that both amazed and troubled me. The campaign to sell the deal, it seemed to me, had been constructed by someone very smart, someone with a real mastery of an art that I recognized immediately, because I had built my entire career on it and had also taught it for 10 years to graduate students at N.Y.U. and Columbia University: narrative. Through a cascade of tweets, quotes and other social-media posts, a story was being told, with the purpose of motivating people to feel a certain way, in order to achieve a specific foreign-policy aim. The other side was doing the exact same thing, of course, but they weren\u2019t very good at it \u2014 and they weren\u2019t in the White House. When I started asking some of my colleagues for the name of the master storyteller whose narratives I was watching unfold, only one name came back at me: Ben Rhodes.", "So in my spare time, I began thinking harder about Rhodes and what he actually did, with the aim of writing a long magazine story about him.", "After the dust-up over the Iran deal was safely over \u2014 I thought \u2014 I pitched my editors at The New York Times Magazine on a profile of Ben Rhodes. They agreed to it. I then asked Rhodes in December of last year if he would be willing to cooperate for the story. He almost immediately said yes. And that is where the story gets complicated \u2014 at least for the people who have written, blogged and tweeted about it over the past week.", "Rhodes knew who I was. How do I know that? Because the White House is equipped with Google. And because Rhodes told me so himself. He earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at N.Y.U., where I taught, and he appreciates longform narrative journalism, which is what I do. He is a regular reader of the magazines \u2014 like Harper\u2019s, The New Yorker and The Atlantic \u2014 in which I have published dozens of deeply reported stories over the past 20 years. We met a few times, and when I told him what I wanted to write, and why, he understood immediately why it was important and why I wanted to do it. He decided to help me. During the course of my reporting, he opened every door I asked him to open (except for one question I wanted to ask the president). He was always incredibly direct and candid with me. In more than a dozen hours of taped conversation, he went off the record, for very brief periods, only twice.", "Rhodes wasn\u2019t afraid of the fact that I strongly disagreed with him on specific matters of policy \u2014 like the war in Syria. He welcomed disagreement and encouraged it. He vociferously supported the president\u2019s policies on every single issue we spoke about \u2014 and made some excellent points, some of which changed my mind about things that I thought I felt clearly about. It turned out that Rhodes had been instrumental in reopening diplomatic relations with Cuba and Myanmar. None of the diplomats he worked with seemed to have a single bad word to say about him.", "When a White House adviser \u2014 not Rhodes \u2014 mentioned a \u201cwar room\u201d for selling the Iran deal, a phrase that disturbed me, I went back to Rhodes and asked what it was and who ran it. He arranged for me to interview anyone I wanted. They were all candid and factual. They explained to me how they had used state-of-the-art tools and a sophisticated understanding of the way information moves in the social-media age to sell a deal that they clearly believed to be in the United States\u2019 national interest.", "But why were any of them talking to me? I soon surmised that Rhodes\u2019s motivation in allowing me to peek behind the curtain came from a disquiet he felt at the possibility, or the likelihood, that the machinery he managed so brilliantly would soon be in the hands of his successors, who might use it to do things that he thought could be quite dangerous \u2014 like goading the United States into another pointless, bloody foreign war. Rhodes readily admitted to me that the work he does is a potentially dangerous distortion of democracy, but he also felt that it had become a necessary evil, caused by the fracturing of the 20th-century mass audience and the decline of the American press. He expressed a deep personal hopelessness about the possibility of open, rational public debate in a brutally partisan climate. But didn\u2019t the country deserve better? I kept asking him. Over time, our conversations around this point evolved, without either of us directly mentioning it, into a kind of gentleman\u2019s bet: My article would go as hard as I could at the truth as I saw it, The Times would publish it, and one of us would be proved right while the other would be proved wrong.", "My article, \u201cThe Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama\u2019s Foreign-Policy Guru,\u201d was published online on May 5.

I stand behind every single word I wrote. This newspaper does, too. The New York Times has looked closely at every complaint leveled against the piece and has found absolutely nothing to correct. If anything is found to merit a correction, it will certainly be corrected.", "2. I think Ben Rhodes is the bravest person I\u2019ve ever met in Washington.

This hot take, which has been tweeted and retweeted by thousands of people, is a fever-dream caricature, one that willfully ignores and obliterates the many hundreds of thousands of words I have written during my 20 years as a reporter. The most important article I ever wrote, according to this take, was one for Slate in 2009 titled, \u201cWhy Israel Will Bomb Iran,\u201d which \u2014 along with a YouTube clip of a panel that I was on last year at Hudson Institute \u2014 apparently demonstrates that I was a kind of wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing whose true aim in writing a profile of Rhodes was to discredit the nuclear agreement with Iran.", "Let\u2019s consider the Slate article first. It was, like a lot of Slate articles, intentionally provocative. It unfolds as an exercise in rational choice superpower-client state theory. It was designed to be provocative on the way to making a serious point.", "Near the top of the article I state: \u201cFrom a U.S. point of view, at least, there is little reason to doubt the analysis that a nuclear Iran with a few dozen bombs can be contained at relatively limited cost using the same strategies that successfully constrained an aggressive Soviet Empire armed with nearly 45,000 nuclear warheads at the height of the Cold War.\u201d", "The rest of the article proceeds to explain exactly why, \u201cfrom the standpoint of international relations theory, the scariest thing about recent Israeli rhetoric is that an attack on Iran lines up quite well with Israel\u2019s rational interests as a superpower client.\u201d", "My analysis of how Israel might see its own rational self-interest was apparently shared by no less distinguished a neocon than President Obama. As Leon Panetta noted in my magazine article, perhaps his main job as secretary of defense was to restrain Israel from bombing Iran \u2014 by convincing them that America would do it for them, if Iran actually threatened to build a bomb.", "The panel at the Hudson Institute was organized by Lee Smith, an ardent opponent of the Iran deal. Smith is definitely a right-winger, rabid even. He is also my friend, and he knows a ton about things beyond politics that I also care about, like the novels of Naguib Mahfouz and how to make the pivot at second base. And, believe it or not, Smith was also my friend back when we were neighbors in Brooklyn. He was the editor of the Village Voice Literary Supplement and an ardent admirer of Edward Said (sorry, Lee). I agreed to sit on his panel after he called me up to interview me about an article that I wrote in The New Yorker about a truck driver named John Coster-Mullen, who reverse-engineered the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.", "I explained to Smith what I considered to be an important difference between nuclear know-how and infrastructure, one that I thought was being blurred by the rhetoric of both sides in the Iran deal debate. Thanks to Coster-Mullen, I told him, I had the plans for a nuclear bomb in my desk drawer at home \u2014 but I lacked the tens of billions of dollars necessary to proliferate. I thought that Smith\u2019s article was fair to what I wrote, so I agreed to be on his panel.", "Here\u2019s what I said at the opening of the panel \u2014 which hasn\u2019t been tweeted or written about by anyone yet, so far as I can tell, even though it\u2019s the very first thing I say in the video:", "\u201cUnlike many of you, I\u2019m a writer. I\u2019m a journalist. I\u2019m not involved in partisan politics. I\u2019ve generally considered myself to be a liberal Democrat. These principles [of bipartisanship and consensus] historically are noncontroversial ones. They\u2019ve been embraced by every American administration since World War II. To find them being undone in this very rapid way, given the potential consequences of unchecked nuclear proliferation \u2014 not just in the region but also in Asia \u2014 is and should be a terrifying thing for Americans to contemplate, whatever their feelings about this president or Republicans or Democrats. As someone who has reported in and around questions related to nuclear programs and gray market economies, I am startled by the lack of attention and clarity that is obvious in the way these stories are being reported.\u201d", "About an hour into the discussion, I suggested, in response to a question, that a nuclear deal with Iran \u2014 if it destroyed existing nonenrichment standards \u2014 might lead to widespread nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. Another person who thought the same thing, it turned out, was Hillary Clinton, speaking to Fareed Zakaria the previous year. \u201cI believe strongly that it\u2019s really important for there to be so little enrichment or no enrichment at least for a long period of time because I do think any enrichment will trigger an arms race in the Middle East,\u201d Clinton said. Maybe the things Clinton said on CNN in 2014 weren\u2019t supposed to be true in Washington in 2015, but they were, and still are. For anyone who has thought much about nuclear weapons \u2014 which I have, having written long pieces on the subject for both Harper\u2019s and The New Yorker \u2014 the prospect of dismantling nonproliferation safeguards and standards that have kept tens or hundreds of millions of people safe since Hiroshima and Nagasaki is terrifying.", "So, do I support the Iran deal? On balance, I suppose I do. It\u2019s a complicated agreement and I\u2019m not an expert (I\u2019m a journalist), but after talking to people who are experts \u2014 including Leon Panetta, who told me that he supports the deal with reservations \u2014 I imagine it\u2019s probably a good-enough idea that I should have some reservations about, too.. I will wait and watch and see what happens, just like everyone else.", "Finally, I would like to turn to the protestations of two journalists, Jeffrey Goldberg and Laura Rozen, who felt wounded by a very brief passage in my article, in which they were named as people who \u201chelped retail\u201d the administration\u2019s talking points.", "The reason I chose to cite Rozen and Goldberg as important conduits for the administration\u2019s foreign policy message is based on two kinds of evidence. One: This very idea was suggested to me in taped interviews with White House staff members who dealt with these journalists; in interviews with other journalists; and in interviews with other people who read their work. Two: My own reading of both Rozen and Goldberg for years had suggested to me that this was a fair thing to say about their work. It seemed at least worth mentioning the names of some journalists in a 9,500-word article about a writer who tells stories to the public, using journalists as one of his instruments. If I didn\u2019t name any of those journalists, readers might fairly conclude that Rhodes was in fact terrible at his job \u2014 or that journalists, especially those who live in Washington, belong to a special category of person who must never be criticized, even gently.", "And this is why, I think, my story ignited such a firestorm. It was a portrait of an honest, dedicated person with a great deal of power in Washington who happens to be deeply critical of the press \u2014 not out of cynicism or anger, but out of regret over the seemingly vanishing possibilities of free and open discourse. I did not pry this critique out of Rhodes, nor did I introduce him to it. He has far more familiarity with the 21st-century news cycle than I do. It has been fascinating for me to watch my story, which was largely read on its own terms outside of Washington and even by the White House itself, go through the looking glass of social media. The story itself has vanished, replaced by a digital mash-up of slurs and invective, supported by stray phrases that have been mechanically tweezered from different texts. The issues that Rhodes raises in my profile \u2014 about the reshaping of the media, the way American foreign policy has shifted, the way the world works now \u2014 none of these things are being discussed, either. Somehow, for a small group of people with very loud megaphones, the point right now seems to be me \u2014 or rather, a digital pi\u00f1ata they have slapped my name on.

He heads downstairs to his windowless basement office, which is divided into two parts.

Large pictures of Obama adorn the walls.

Now, from the flat screens, a challenge to that narrative arises: Iran has seized two small boats containing 10 American sailors. Rhodes found out about the Iranian action earlier that morning but was trying to keep it out of the news until after the president\u2019s speech. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep a secret for two hours,\u201d Rhodes says, with a tone of mild exasperation at the break in message discipline.", "As the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, Rhodes writes the president\u2019s speeches, plans his trips abroad and runs communications strategy across the White House, tasks that, taken individually, give little sense of the importance of his role. He is, according to the consensus of the two dozen current and former White House insiders I talked to, the single most influential voice shaping American foreign policy aside from Potus himself. The president and Rhodes communicate \u201cregularly, several times a day,\u201d according to Denis McDonough, Obama\u2019s chief of staff, who is known for captaining a tight ship. \u201cI see it throughout the day in person,\u201d he says, adding that he is sure that in addition to the two to three hours that Rhodes might spend with Obama daily, the two men communicate remotely throughout the day via email and phone calls. Rhodes strategized and ran the successful Iran-deal messaging campaign, helped negotiate the opening of American relations with Cuba after a hiatus of more than 50 years and has been a co-writer of all of Obama\u2019s major foreign-policy speeches. \u201cEvery day he does 12 jobs, and he does them better than the other people who have those jobs,\u201d Terry Szuplat, the longest-tenured member of the National Security Council speechwriting corps, told me. On the largest and smallest questions alike, the voice in which America speaks to the world is that of Ben Rhodes.", "Like Obama, Rhodes is a storyteller who uses a writer\u2019s tools to advance an agenda that is packaged as politics but is often quite personal. He is adept at constructing overarching plotlines with heroes and villains, their conflicts and motivations supported by flurries of carefully chosen adjectives, quotations and leaks from named and unnamed senior officials. He is the master shaper and retailer of Obama\u2019s foreign-policy narratives, at a time when the killer wave of social media has washed away the sand castles of the traditional press. His ability to navigate and shape this new environment makes him a more effective and powerful extension of the president\u2019s will than any number of policy advisers or diplomats or spies. His lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations \u2014 like military or diplomatic service, or even a master\u2019s degree in international relations, rather than creative writing \u2014 is still startling.", "Part of what accounts for Rhodes\u2019s influence is his \u201cmind meld\u201d with the president. Nearly everyone I spoke to about Rhodes used the phrase \u201cmind meld\u201d verbatim, some with casual assurance and others in the hushed tones that are usually reserved for special insights. He doesn\u2019t think for the president, but he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power. One day, when Rhodes and I were sitting in his boiler-room office, he confessed, with a touch of bafflement, \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore where I begin and Obama ends.\u201d", "Standing in his front office before the State of the Union, Rhodes quickly does the political math on the breaking Iran story. \u201cNow they\u2019ll show scary pictures of people praying to the supreme leader,\u201d he predicts, looking at the screen. Three beats more, and his brain has spun a story line to stanch the bleeding.

I peek over his shoulder, to get a sense of the meta-narrative that will shape dozens of thumb-suckers in the days and weeks to follow. One sentence reads: \u201cBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.\u201d He retypes a word, then changes it back, before continuing with his edit. \u201cMasses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages \u2014 they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence.\u201d", "Watching Rhodes work, I remember that he is still, chiefly, a writer, who is using a new set of tools \u2014 along with the traditional arts of narrative and spin \u2014 to create stories of great consequence on the biggest page imaginable. The narratives he frames, the voices of senior officials, the columnists and reporters whose work he skillfully shapes and ventriloquizes, and even the president\u2019s own speeches and talking points, are the only dots of color in a much larger vision about who Americans are and where we are going that Rhodes and the president have been formulating together over the past seven years. When I asked Jon Favreau, Obama\u2019s lead speechwriter in the 2008 campaign, and a close friend of Rhodes\u2019s, whether he or Rhodes or the president had ever thought of their individual speeches and bits of policy making as part of some larger restructuring of the American narrative, he replied, \u201cWe saw that as our entire job.\u201d", "Having recently spent time working in Hollywood, I realize during our conversations that the role Rhodes plays in the White House bears less resemblance to any specific character on Beltway-insider TV shows like \u201cThe West Wing\u201d or \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d than it does to the people who create those shows.

The brothers are close, but they often go months without seeing each other. \u201cHe was like the kid who carried the briefcase to school,\u201d Ben says of his brother, who worked at Fox News and Bloomberg before moving to CBS. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t do that great in high school because I was drinking and smoking pot and hanging out in Central Park.\u201d", "Rhodes\u2019s impassioned yet depressive vibe, which I feel in his stray remarks and in the strangeness of his decision to allow me to roam around the White House, stems in part from feeling overloaded; he wishes he had more time to think and write. His mother is Jewish from the Upper East Side, and worships John Updike, and reads The New Yorker. His father is a Texan lawyer who took his sons to St. Thomas Episcopal Church once a month, where Rhodes felt like the Jewish kid in church, the same way he felt like a \u201cJewish Christian\u201d at Passover Seders. His New York City prep-school-kid combination of vulnerability, brattiness and passionate hatred for phonies suggests an only slightly updated version of what Holden Caulfield might have been like if he grew up to work in the West Wing.", "Rhodes\u2019s windowless back office, which doesn\u2019t have a TV screen, is an oasis of late-night calm in a building devoted to the performance of power. The walls are painted a soft creamy color, which gives it the feel of an upscale hotel room with the drapes closed. He arrives here every morning between 8 and 9 from a modest two-bedroom apartment in a grad-student-type building in an unpretentious Washington neighborhood around the corner from his favorite post-collegiate bar. Before coming to work, he walks his 1-year-old daughter to day care. Then he drives to work in his Beamer, which appears to be the one grown-up luxury he and his wife, Ann Norris, who works in the State Department and longs to return to her childhood home of California, can afford. When his wife takes the car, he rides the bus, which offers him a touch of the anonymity he craves.

Lewis makes an appearance here, alongside a volume of Lincoln speeches (Obama tells all his speechwriters to read Lincoln) and George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAll Art Is Propaganda.\u201d I have seen the same books on the shelves of plenty of Brooklyn apartments. Yet some large part of the recent history of America and its role in the world turns on the fact that the entirely familiar person sitting at the desk in front of me, who seems not unlike other weed-smokers I know who write Frederick Barthelme-type short stories, has achieved a \u201cmind meld\u201d with President Obama and used his skills to help execute a radical shift in American foreign policy.", "So I wonder: How did he get from there to here?", "The story that Rhodes published in The Beloit Fiction Journal is a good place to start.", "The editor at Foreign Policy who read \u201cGoldfish,\u201d which Rhodes attached with his query letter, said that the young M.F.A. would be bored with fact-checking. Instead, he suggested that he apply for a job with Lee Hamilton, the onetime congressman from Indiana, who was looking for a speechwriter.", "\u201cI was surprised,\u201d Hamilton remembered. \u201cWhat the hell does a guy who wanted to write fiction come to me for?\u201d But he had always found writers useful, and Rhodes\u2019s writing sample was the best in the pile. So he hired him on at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank. Though Rhodes never said a word in meetings, Hamilton says, he had a keen understanding of what was going on and a talent for putting the positions of distinguished participants down on paper. \u201cI immediately understood that it\u2019s a very important quality for a staffer,\u201d Hamilton explained, \u201cthat he could come into a meeting and decide what was decided.\u201d I suggested that the phrase \u201cdecide what was decided\u201d is suggestive of the enormous power that might accrue to someone with Rhodes\u2019s gifts. Hamilton nodded. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said.", "Rhodes served as Hamilton\u2019s staff member on the 9/11 Commission, where he met Denis McDonough, another Hamilton prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who had gone on to work for Tom Daschle in the Senate. Rhodes then became the chief note-taker for the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan commission that excoriated George Bush\u2019s war in Iraq. He accompanied Hamilton and his Republican counterpart on the group, former secretary of state and Bush family intimate James Baker, to their meetings with Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley, David Petraeus and many others (Vice President Dick Cheney met with the group but didn\u2019t say a word). According to both Hamilton and Edward Djerejian, Baker\u2019s second on the I.S.G., Rhodes\u2019s opinions were helpful in shaping the group\u2019s conclusions \u2014 a scathing indictment of the policy makers responsible for invading Iraq. For Rhodes, who wrote much of the I.S.G. report, the Iraq war was proof, in black and white, not of the complexity of international affairs or the many perils attendant on political decision-making but of the fact that the decision-makers were morons.", "One result of this experience was that when Rhodes joined the Obama campaign in 2007, he arguably knew more about the Iraq war than the candidate himself, or any of his advisers. He had also developed a healthy contempt for the American foreign-policy establishment, including editors and reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker and elsewhere, who at first applauded the Iraq war and then sought to pin all the blame on Bush and his merry band of neocons when it quickly turned sour. If anything, that anger has grown fiercer during Rhodes\u2019s time in the White House. He referred to the American foreign-policy establishment as the Blob. According to Rhodes, the Blob includes Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates and other Iraq-war promoters from both parties who now whine incessantly about the collapse of the American security order in Europe and the Middle East.", "Jon Favreau, then the campaign\u2019s lead speechwriter, felt as if he could use a foreign-affairs expert who could write. \u201cForeign-policy advisers kept changing all the language that made Obama sound like he wasn\u2019t part of the Democratic foreign-policy establishment,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe idea of someone with a masters in fiction who had also co-authored the Iraq Study Group and 9/11 Commission reports seemed perfect for a candidate who put so much emphasis on storytelling.\u201d The two young speechwriters quickly found themselves to be in sync. \u201cHe truly gives zero [expletive] about what most people in Washington think,\u201d Favreau says admiringly of Rhodes. \u201cI think he\u2019s always seen his time there as temporary and won\u2019t care if he\u2019s never again invited to a cocktail party, or asked to appear on \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 or inducted into the Council on Foreign Relations hall of fame or whatever the hell they do there.\u201d", "\u201cHe was easily underestimatable,\u201d Samantha Power recalls, of Rhodes\u2019s arrival on the Obama campaign in 2007.

Power is now the American ambassador to the United Nations. Her attire suggests a disingenuous ambivalence about her role in government that appears to be common among her cohort in the Obama administration, with a cardigan made of thick, expensive-looking cashmere worn over a simple frock, along with silver spray-painted rock \u2019n\u2019 roll sneakers. See, I\u2019m sympatico, the sneakers proclaim.", "Early on, what struck her about Rhodes was how strategic he was. \u201cHe was leading quietly, initially, and mainly just through track changes, like what to accept and reject,\u201d she says. When I ask her where Rhodes\u2019s control over drafts of the candidate\u2019s speeches came from, she immediately answers, \u201cObama,\u201d but then qualifies her answer. \u201cBut it was Hobbesian,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe had the pen. And he understood intuitively that having the pen gave him that control.\u201d His judgment was superior to that of his rivals, and he refused to ever back down. \u201cHe was just defiant,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, I\u2019m not. That\u2019s bad. Obama wouldn\u2019t want that.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Obama relies on Rhodes for \u201can unvarnished take,\u201d in part, she says, because \u201cBen just has no poker face,\u201d and so it\u2019s easy to see when he is feeling uncomfortable. \u201cThe president will be like, \u2018Ben, something on your mind?\u2019 And then Ben will have this incredibly precise lay-down of why the previous half-hour has been an utter waste of time, because there\u2019s a structural flaw to the entire direction of the conversation.\u201d", "The literary character that Rhodes most closely resembles, Power volunteers, is Holden Caulfield. \u201cHe hates the idea of being phony, and he\u2019s impetuous, and he has very strong views.\u201d", "On his first day in the West Wing, Rhodes remembers thinking how remarkably small the space was, and noticing that the same few dozen people he worked with at campaign headquarters in Chicago were now wearing suits instead of jeans. The enormousness of the endeavor sank in on that first day, and he realized that for all the prep work, there was no manual for how to be on the staff of the person who is running the country, particularly at a time when the global economy was in free fall and 180,000 Americans were fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. He became aware of two things at once: the weight of the issues that the president was confronted with, and the intense global interest in even the most mundane presidential communications.", "The job he was hired to do, namely to help the president of the United States communicate with the public, was changing in equally significant ways, thanks to the impact of digital technologies that people in Washington were just beginning to wrap their minds around. It is hard for many to absorb the true magnitude of the change in the news business \u2014 40 percent of newspaper-industry professionals have lost their jobs over the past decade \u2014 in part because readers can absorb all the news they want from social-media platforms like Facebook, which are valued in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars and pay nothing for the \u201ccontent\u201d they provide to their readers. You have to have skin in the game \u2014 to be in the news business, or depend in a life-or-death way on its products \u2014 to understand the radical and qualitative ways in which words that appear in familiar typefaces have changed. Rhodes singled out a key example to me one day, laced with the brutal contempt that is a hallmark of his private utterances. \u201cAll these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t. They call us to explain to them what\u2019s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That\u2019s a sea change. They literally know nothing.\u201d", "In this environment, Rhodes has become adept at ventriloquizing many people at once. Ned Price, Rhodes\u2019s assistant, gave me a primer on how it\u2019s done. The easiest way for the White House to shape the news, he explained, is from the briefing podiums, each of which has its own dedicated press corps. \u201cBut then there are sort of these force multipliers,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have our compadres, I will reach out to a couple people, and you know I wouldn\u2019t want to name them \u2014 \u201d", "\u201cI can name them,\u201d I said, ticking off a few names of prominent Washington reporters and columnists who often tweet in sync with White House messaging.", "Price laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey, look, some people are spinning this narrative that this is a sign of American weakness,\u2019\u2009\u201d he continued, \u201cbut \u2014 \u201d", "\u201cIn fact it\u2019s a sign of strength!\u201d I said, chuckling.", "\u201cAnd I\u2019ll give them some color,\u201d Price continued, \u201cand the next thing I know, lots of these guys are in the dot-com publishing space, and have huge Twitter followings, and they\u2019ll be putting this message out on their own.\u201d", "This is something different from old-fashioned spin, which tended to be an art best practiced in person. In a world where experienced reporters competed for scoops and where carrying water for the White House was a cause for shame, no matter which party was in power, it was much harder to sustain a \u201cnarrative\u201d over any serious period of time. Now the most effectively weaponized 140-character idea or quote will almost always carry the day, and it is very difficult for even good reporters to necessarily know where the spin is coming from or why.", "When I later visited Obama\u2019s former campaign mastermind David Axelrod in Chicago, I brought up the soft Orwellian vibe of an information space where old media structures and hierarchies have been erased by Silicon Valley billionaires who convinced the suckers that information was \u201cfree\u201d and everyone with access to Google was now a reporter. Axelrod, a former newspaperman, sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as standing in front of a press conference and speaking to 70 million people like past presidents have been able to do,\u201d he said. The bully pulpit by and large doesn\u2019t exist anymore, he explained. \u201cSo more and more, over the last couple of years, there\u2019s been an investment in alternative means of communication: using digital more effectively, going to nontraditional sources, understanding where on each issue your constituencies are going to be found,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve approached these major foreign-policy challenges as campaign challenges, and they\u2019ve run campaigns, and those campaigns have been very sophisticated.\u201d", "Rhodes\u2019s innovative campaign to sell the Iran deal is likely to be a model for how future administrations explain foreign policy to Congress and the public. The way in which most Americans have heard the story of the Iran deal presented \u2014 that the Obama administration began seriously engaging with Iranian officials in 2013 in order to take advantage of a new political reality in Iran, which came about because of elections that brought moderates to power in that country \u2014 was largely manufactured for the purpose for selling the deal. Even where the particulars of that story are true, the implications that readers and viewers are encouraged to take away from those particulars are often misleading or false. Obama\u2019s closest advisers always understood him to be eager to do a deal with Iran as far back as 2012, and even since the beginning of his presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s the center of the arc,\u201d Rhodes explained to me two days after the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was implemented. He then checked off the ways in which the administration\u2019s foreign-policy aims and priorities converged on Iran. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to kind of be in cycles of conflict if we can find other ways to resolve these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do things that challenge the conventional thinking that, you know, \u2018AIPAC doesn\u2019t like this,\u2019 or \u2018the Israeli government doesn\u2019t like this,\u2019 or \u2018the gulf countries don\u2019t like it.\u2019 It\u2019s the possibility of improved relations with adversaries. It\u2019s nonproliferation. So all these threads that the president\u2019s been spinning \u2014 and I mean that not in the press sense \u2014 for almost a decade, they kind of all converged around Iran.\u201d", "In the narrative that Rhodes shaped, the \u201cstory\u201d of the Iran deal began in 2013, when a \u201cmoderate\u201d faction inside the Iranian regime led by Hassan Rouhani beat regime \u201chard-liners\u201d in an election and then began to pursue a policy of \u201copenness,\u201d which included a newfound willingness to negotiate the dismantling of its illicit nuclear-weapons program. The president set out the timeline himself in his speech announcing the nuclear deal on July 14, 2015: \u201cToday, after two years of negotiations, the United States, together with our international partners, has achieved something that decades of animosity has not.\u201d While the president\u2019s statement was technically accurate \u2014 there had in fact been two years of formal negotiations leading up to the signing of the J.C.P.O.A. \u2014 it was also actively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had begun in mid-2012, many months before Rouhani and the \u201cmoderate\u201d camp were chosen in an election among candidates handpicked by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The idea that there was a new reality in Iran was politically useful to the Obama administration. By obtaining broad public currency for the thought that there was a significant split in the regime, and that the administration was reaching out to moderate-minded Iranians who wanted peaceful relations with their neighbors and with America, Obama was able to evade what might have otherwise been a divisive but clarifying debate over the actual policy choices that his administration was making. By eliminating the fuss about Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the administration hoped to eliminate a source of structural tension between the two countries, which would create the space for America to disentangle itself from its established system of alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel and Turkey. With one bold move, the administration would effectively begin the process of a large-scale disengagement from the Middle East.", "The nerve center for the selling of the Iran deal to Congress, which took place in a concentrated three-month period between July and September of last year, was located inside the White House, and is referred to by its former denizens as \u201cthe war room.\u201d Chad Kreikemeier, a Nebraskan who had worked in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, helped run the team, which included three to six people from each of several agencies, he says, which were the State Department, Treasury, the American delegation to the United Nations (i.e., Samantha Power), \u201cat times D.O.D.\u201d (the Department of Defense) and also the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. Rhodes \u201cwas kind of like the quarterback,\u201d running the daily video conferences and coming up with lines of attack and parry. \u201cHe was extremely good about immediately getting to a phrase or a way of getting the message out that just made more sense,\u201d Kreikemeier remembers. Framing the deal as a choice between peace and war was Rhodes\u2019s go-to move \u2014 and proved to be a winning argument.", "The person whom Kreikemeier credits with running the digital side of the campaign was Tanya Somanader, 31, the director of digital response for the White House Office of Digital Strategy, who became known in the war room and on Twitter as @TheIranDeal. Early on, Rhodes asked her to create a rapid-response account that fact-checked everything related to the Iran deal. \u201cSo, we developed a plan that was like: The Iran deal is literally going to be the tip of everything that we stand up online,\u201d Somanader says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to map it onto what we know about the different audiences we\u2019re dealing with: the public, pundits, experts, the right wing, Congress.\u201d By applying 21st-century data and networking tools to the white-glove world of foreign affairs, the White House was able to track what United States senators and the people who worked for them, and influenced them, were seeing online \u2014 and make sure that no potential negative comment passed without a tweet.", "As she explained how the process worked, I was struck by how na\u00efve the assumption of a \u201cstate of nature\u201d must seem in an information environment that is mediated less and less by experienced editors and reporters with any real prior knowledge of the subjects they write about. \u201cPeople construct their own sense of source and credibility now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey elect who they\u2019re going to believe.\u201d For those in need of more traditional-seeming forms of validation, handpicked Beltway insiders like Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Laura Rozen of Al-Monitor helped retail the administration\u2019s narrative. \u201cLaura Rozen was my RSS feed,\u201d Somanader offered. \u201cShe would just find everything and retweet it.\u201d", "Rhodes\u2019s messaging campaign was so effective not simply because it was a perfectly planned and executed example of digital strategy, but also because he was personally involved in guiding the deal itself. In July 2012, Jake Sullivan, a close aide to Hillary Clinton, traveled to Muscat, Oman, for the first meeting with the Iranians, taking a message from the White House. \u201cIt was, \u2018We\u2019re prepared to open a direct channel to resolve the nuclear agreement if you are prepared to do the same thing and authorize it at the highest levels and engage in a serious discussion on these issues,\u2019\u2009\u201d Sullivan remembers. \u201cOnce that was agreed to, it was quickly decided that we resolve the nuclear agreement in two steps, the interim agreement and the final agreement.\u201d Subsequent meetings with the Iranians followed, during which he was joined by Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns. \u201cBill and I had a huge amount of license to explore what the terms would look like, within the negotiating parameters,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWhat the precise trade-offs would be, between forms of sanctions relief and forms of restraints on their programs, that was left to us to feel out.\u201d", "The fact that the president largely let his surrogates do the talking and the selling of the Iran deal \u2014 and even now, rarely talks about it in public \u2014 does not reflect his level of direct engagement. Sullivan and Burns spent hours before and after every session in Oman with the president and his closest advisers in the White House. When the president wasn\u2019t present, Rhodes always was. \u201cBen and I, in particular, the two of us, spent a lot of time thinking through all the angles,\u201d Sullivan says. \u201cWe spent three, four, five hours together in Washington talking things through before the meetings.\u201d In March 2013, a full three months before the elections that elevated Hassan Rouhani to the office of president, Sullivan and Burns finalized their proposal for an interim agreement, which became the basis for the J.C.P.O.A.", "The White House point person during the later stage of the negotiations was Rob Malley, a favored troubleshooter who is currently running negotiations that could keep the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power. During the course of the Iran talks, Malley told me, he always kept in close contact with Rhodes. \u201cI would often just call him and say, \u2018Give me a reality check,\u2019\u2009\u201d Malley explained. \u201cHe could say, \u2018Here is where I think the president is, and here is where I think he will be.\u2019\u2009\u201d He continued, \u201cBen would try to anticipate: Does it make sense policywise? But then he would also ask himself: How do we sell it to Congress? How do we sell it to the public? What is it going to do to our narrative?\u201d", "Malley is a particularly keen observer of the changing art of political communication; his father, Simon Malley, who was born in Cairo, edited the politics magazine Afrique Asie and proudly provided a platform for Fidel Castro and Yasir Arafat, in the days when the leaders\u2019 words might take weeks to travel from Cuba or Cairo to Paris. \u201cThe Iran experience was the place where I saw firsthand how policy, politics and messaging all had to be brought together, and I think that Ben is really at the intersection of all three,\u201d Malley says. \u201cHe reflects and he shapes at the same time.\u201d", "As Malley and representatives of the State Department, including Wendy Sherman and Secretary of State John Kerry, engaged in formal negotiations with the Iranians, to ratify details of a framework that had already been agreed upon, Rhodes\u2019s war room did its work on Capitol Hill and with reporters. In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. \u201cWe created an echo chamber,\u201d he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. \u201cThey were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.\u201d", "When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America\u2019s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. \u201cIn the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.\u201d He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. \u201cWe drove them crazy,\u201d he said of the deal\u2019s opponents.", "Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way that the agreement itself was sold. \u201cLook, with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They\u2019re agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif\u201d \u2014 Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister \u2014 \u201care real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.\u201d", "In fact, Rhodes\u2019s passion seems to derive not from any investment in the technical specifics of sanctions or centrifuge arrays, or any particular optimism about the future course of Iranian politics and society. Those are matters for the negotiators and area specialists. Rather, it derived from his own sense of the urgency of radically reorienting American policy in the Middle East in order to make the prospect of American involvement in the region\u2019s future wars a lot less likely. When I asked whether the prospect of this same kind of far-reaching spin campaign being run by a different administration is something that scares him, he admitted that it does. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d prefer a sober, reasoned public debate, after which members of Congress reflect and take a vote,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201d", "Getting Rhodes to speak directly about the man whose gestalt he channels is a bit like asking someone to look into a mirror while describing someone else\u2019s face. The Obama he talks about in public is, in part, a character that he has helped to create \u2014 based on a real person, of course \u2014 and is embedded in story lines that he personally constructs and manages. At the same time, he believes very deeply in Obama, the man and the president, and in the policies that he has helped to structure and sell on his behalf.", "Obama\u2019s particular revulsion against a certain kind of global power politics is a product, Rhodes suggests, of his having been raised in Southeast Asia. \u201cIndonesia was a place where your interaction at that time with power was very intimate, right?\u201d Rhodes asks. \u201cTens or hundreds of thousands of people had just been killed. Power was not some abstract thing,\u201d he muses. \u201cWhen we sit in Washington and debate foreign policy, it\u2019s like a Risk game, or it\u2019s all about us, or the human beings disappear from the decisions. But he lived in a place where he was surrounded by people who had either perpetrated those acts \u2014 and by the way, may not have felt great about that \u2014 or else knew someone who was a victim. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been an American president who had an experience like that at a young age of what power is.\u201d", "The parts of Obama\u2019s foreign policy that disturb some of his friends on the left, like drone strikes, Rhodes says, are a result of Obama\u2019s particular kind of globalism, which understands the hard and at times absolute necessity of killing. Yet, at the same time, they are also ways of avoiding more deadly uses of force \u2014 a kind of low-body-count spin move.", "He leans back and opens a drawer in the file cabinet behind his desk, and removes a folder. \u201cI was going to show you something,\u201d he says, removing a sheaf of yellow legal paper covered in longhand. \u201cJust to confirm for you that he really is a writer.\u201d He shows me the president\u2019s copy of his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, a revision of an original draft by Favreau and Rhodes whose defining tension was accepting a prize awarded before he had actually accomplished anything. In his longhand notes, Obama relocated the speech\u2019s tension in the fact that he was accepting a peace prize a week after ordering 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. King and Gandhi were the author\u2019s heroes, yet he couldn\u2019t act as they did, because he runs a state. The reason that the author had to exercise power was because not everyone in the world is rational.", "We sit for a while, and I examine the president\u2019s thoughts unfolding on the page, and the lawyerly, abstract nature of his writing process. \u201cMoral imagination, spheres of identity, but also move beyond cheap lazy pronouncements,\u201d one note reads. Here was the new American self \u2014 rational, moral, not self-indulgent. No longer one thing but multiple overlapping spheres or circles. Who is described here? As usual, the author is describing himself.", "Valerie Jarrett has been called the president\u2019s work wife and is the only member of the West Wing staff who knew Obama before he began contemplating a run for the presidency. What I want to understand better, I tell her, are the swirls of the president\u2019s emotional fingerprint, which I saw in the longhand draft of his Nobel speech. We talk for a while about being American and at the same time being from somewhere else, and the split-screen experience of reality that experience allows. Jarrett was born in Iran and spent her early childhood there.", "\u201cWas it a point of connection between you and the president that you had each spent some substantial part of your childhoods living in another country?\u201d I ask. Her face lights up.", "\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she answers. The question is important to her. \u201cThe first conversation we had over dinner, when we first met, was about what it was like for both of us to live in countries that were predominantly Muslim countries at formative parts of our childhood and the perspective it gave us about the United States and how uniquely excellent it is,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talked about what it was like to be children, and how we played with children who had totally different backgrounds than our own but you would find something in common.\u201d She recalls her very first dinner together with the new fianc\u00e9 of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Michelle Robinson. \u201cI remember him asking me questions that I felt like no one else has ever asked me before,\u201d she says, \u201cand he asked me from a perspective of someone who knew the same experience that I had. So it felt really good. I was like, \u2018Oh, finally someone who gets it.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Barack Obama is not a standard-issue liberal Democrat. He openly shares Rhodes\u2019s contempt for the groupthink of the American foreign-policy establishment and its hangers-on in the press. Yet one problem with the new script that Obama and Rhodes have written is that the Blob may have finally caught on.", "\u201cHe is a brilliant guy, but he has a real problem with what I call the assignment of bad faith,\u201d one former senior official told me of the president. \u201cHe regards everyone on the other side at this point as being a bunch of bloodthirsty know-nothings from a different era who play by the old book. He hears arguments like, \u2018We should be punching Iran in the nose on its shipments of arms, and do it publicly,\u2019 or \u2018We should sanction the crap out of them for their ballistic-missile test and tell them that if they do it again we\u2019re going to do this or we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019 and he hears Dick Cheney in those arguments.\u201d", "Another official I spoke to put the same point more succinctly: \u201cClearly the world has disappointed him.\u201d When I asked whether he believed that the Oval Office debate over Syria policy in 2012 \u2014 resulting in a decision not to support the uprising against Assad in any meaningful way \u2014 had been an honest and open one, he said that he had believed that it was, but has since changed his mind. \u201cInstead of adjusting his policies to the reality, and adjusting his perception of reality to the changing realities on the ground, the conclusions he draws are exactly the same, no matter what the costs have been to our strategic interests,\u201d he says. \u201cIn an odd way, he reminds me of Bush.\u201d The comparison is a startling one \u2014 and yet, questions of tone aside, it is uncomfortably easy to see the similarities between the two men, American presidents who projected their own ideas of the good onto an indifferent world.", "One of the few charter members of the Blob willing to speak on the record is Leon Panetta, who was Obama\u2019s head of the C.I.A. and secretary of defense and also enough of a product of a different culture to give honest answers to what he understands to be questions of consequence. At his institute at the old Fort Ord in Seaside, Calif., where, in the days before he wore Mr. Rogers sweaters, he served as a young Army intelligence officer, I ask him about a crucial component of the administration\u2019s public narrative on Iran: whether it was ever a salient feature of the C.I.A.\u2019s analysis when he ran the agency that the Iranian regime was meaningfully divided between \u201chard-line\u201d and \u201cmoderate\u201d camps.", "\u201cNo,\u201d Panetta answers. \u201cThere was not much question that the Quds Force and the supreme leader ran that country with a strong arm, and there was not much question that this kind of opposing view could somehow gain any traction.\u201d", "I ask Panetta whether, as head of the C.I.A., or later on, as secretary of defense, he ever saw the letters that Obama covertly sent to Khamenei, in 2009 and in 2012, which were only reported on by the press weeks later.", "\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, before saying he would \u201clike to believe\u201d that Tom Donilon, national security adviser since 2010, and Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, had a chance to work on the offer they presented.", "As secretary of defense, he tells me, one of his most important jobs was keeping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, from launching a pre-emptive attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. \u201cThey were both interested in the answer to the question, \u2018Is the president serious?\u2019\u2009\u201d Panetta recalls. \u201cAnd you know my view, talking with the president, was: If brought to the point where we had evidence that they\u2019re developing an atomic weapon, I think the president is serious that he is not going to allow that to happen.\u201d", "Panetta stops.", "\u201cBut would you make that same assessment now?\u201d I ask him.", "\u201cWould I make that same assessment now?\u201d he asks. \u201cProbably not.\u201d", "He understands the president\u2019s pivot toward Iran as the logical result of a deeply held premise about the negative effects of use of American military force on a scale much larger than drone strikes or Special Forces raids. \u201cI think the whole legacy that he was working on was, \u2018I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s going to bring these wars to an end, and the last goddamn thing I need is to start another war,\u2019\u2009\u201d he explains of Obama. \u201cIf you ratchet up sanctions, it could cause a war. If you start opposing their interest in Syria, well, that could start a war, too.\u201d", "In Panetta\u2019s telling, his own experience at the Pentagon under Obama sometimes resembled being installed in the driver\u2019s seat of a car and finding that the steering wheel and brakes had been disconnected from the engine. Obama and his aides used political elders like him, Robert Gates and Hillary Clinton as cover to end the Iraq war, and then decided to steer their own course, he suggests. While Panetta pointedly never mentions Rhodes\u2019s name, it is clear whom he is talking about.", "\u201cThere were staff people who put themselves in a position where they kind of assumed where the president\u2019s head was on a particular issue, and they thought their job was not to go through this open process of having people present all these different options, but to try to force the process to where they thought the president wanted to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d say, \u2018Well, this is where we want you to come out.\u2019 And I\u2019d say \u2018[expletive], that\u2019s not the way it works. We\u2019ll present a plan, and then the president can make a decision.\u2019 I mean, Jesus Christ, it is the president of the United States, you\u2019re making some big decisions here, he ought to be entitled to hear all of those viewpoints and not to be driven down a certain path.\u201d", "But that can\u2019t be true, I tell Panetta, because the aides he is talking about had no independent power aside from the authority that the president himself gave them.", "\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good question,\u201d Panetta allows. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy, he\u2019s not dumb.\u201d It\u2019s all part of the Washington blame game. Just as Panetta can blame young aides in order to avoid blaming the president for his actual choices, the president used his aides to tell Panetta to take a hike. Perhaps the president and his aides were continually unable to predict the consequences of their actions in Syria, and made mistake after mistake, while imagining that it was going to come out right the next time. \u201cAnother read, which isn\u2019t necessarily opposed to that,\u201d I continue, \u201cis that their actual picture is entirely coherent. But if they put it in blunt, unnuanced terms \u2014 \u201d", "Panetta completes my sentence: \u201c \u2014 they\u2019d get the [expletive] kicked out of them.\u201d He looks at me curiously. \u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you present this theory to Ben Rhodes?\u201d", "\u201cOh, God,\u201d Rhodes says. \u201cThe reason the president has bucked a lot of establishment thinking is because he does not agree with establishment thinking. Not because I or Denis McDonough are sitting here.\u201d He pushes back in his chair. \u201cThe complete lack of governance in huge swaths of the Middle East, that is the project of the American establishment,\u201d he declares. \u201cThat as much as Iraq is what angered me.\u201d", "There is something dangerously na\u00efve about this kind of talk, in which words like \u201cbalance,\u201d \u201cstakeholders\u201d and \u201cinterests\u201d are endlessly reshuffled like word tiles in a magnetic-poetry set, with little regard for the immutable contingencies that shaped America\u2019s role in the world. But that\u2019s hardly fair. Ben Rhodes wanted to do right, and maybe, when the arc of history lands, it will turn out that he did. At least, he tried. Something scared him, and made him feel as if the grown-ups in Washington didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, and it\u2019s hard to argue that he was wrong.", "What has interested me most about watching him and his cohort in the White House over the past seven years, I tell him, is the evolution of their ability to get comfortable with tragedy. I am thinking specifically about Syria, I add, where more than 450,000 people have been slaughtered.", "\u201cYeah, I admit very much to that reality,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a numbing element to Syria in particular. But I will tell you this,\u201d he continues. \u201cI profoundly do not believe that the United States could make things better in Syria by being there. And we have an evidentiary record of what happens when we\u2019re there \u2014 nearly a decade in Iraq.\u201d", "Iraq is his one-word answer to any and all criticism. I was against the Iraq war from the beginning, I tell Rhodes, so I understand why he perpetually returns to it. I also understand why Obama pulled the plug on America\u2019s engagement with the Middle East, I say, but it was also true as a result that more people are dying there on his watch than died during the Bush presidency, even if very few of them are Americans. What I don\u2019t understand is why, if America is getting out of the Middle East, we are apparently spending so much time and energy trying to strong-arm Syrian rebels into surrendering to the dictator who murdered their families, or why it is so important for Iran to maintain its supply lines to Hezbollah. He mutters something about John Kerry, and then goes off the record, to suggest, in effect, that the world of the Sunni Arabs that the American establishment built has collapsed. The buck stops with the establishment, not with Obama, who was left to clean up their mess.", "It is clearly time for me to go. Rhodes walks me out into the sunlight of the West Wing parking lot, where we are treated to the sight of the aged Henry Kissinger, who has come to pay a visit. I ask Rhodes if he has ever met the famous diplomat before, and he tells me about the time they were seated together at a state dinner for the president of China. It was an interesting encounter to imagine, between Kissinger, who made peace with Mao\u2019s China while bombing Laos to bits, and Rhodes, who helped effect a similar diplomatic volte-face with Iran but kept the United States out of a civil war in Syria, which has caused more than four million people to become refugees. I ask Rhodes how it felt being seated next to the embodiment of American realpolitik. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d he says, looking off into the middle distance. \u201cI told him I was going to Laos,\u201d he continues. \u201cHe got a weird look in his eye.\u201d", "There is nothing snarky about his delivery. Rhodes just was bothered by seeing legless kids and unexploded cluster bombs in the jungle. He is not Henry Kissinger, or so his logic runs, even as the underlying realist suspicion \u2014 or contempt \u2014 for the idea of America as a moral actor is eerily similar. He is torn. As the president himself once asked, how are we supposed to weigh the tens of thousands who have died in Syria against the tens of thousands who have died in Congo?

In a rough-and-tumble presidential election year in which social media is playing an increasingly large role, some Republican leaders say they have lost trust in Facebook\u2019s ability to maintain impartiality as a communication and news platform.", "An examination of Trending Topics, based on interviews with current and former Facebook employees and a demonstration of the curator tools, found that Facebook\u2019s employees were not directed to squelch conservative news on the site, nor would that be easily accomplished by a staff member who wished to do so.", "Instead, these people said, Trending Topics was a fledgling, ill-managed group \u2014 made up largely of recent college graduates with little work experience \u2014 where individual judgment of news was encouraged. That led to inconsistencies in how the most popular stories were presented, along with departures from the team, eventually landing the group in the controversy that spotlights Facebook\u2019s huge role in the type of information people see every day.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve reflected a lot,\u201d said Justin Osofsky, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global operations and media partnerships, which includes Trending Topics. He said Facebook had \u201cidentified ways in which we should have improved.\u201d", "Trending Topics, introduced in a handful of countries in January 2014 with a small staff based in New York, was Facebook\u2019s first major attempt to comb through the avalanche of information being posted on the social network and to make it easier for people to find current events \u2014 such as the pope\u2019s visit to the United States and anything involving the Kardashians \u2014 and to read and talk about them on Facebook.", "It was a shot at competitors like Google and Twitter, according to two former news curators who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Facebook wanted people to search for more content \u2014 like news \u2014 on its own site instead of on Google, the search king, or Twitter, which was widely regarded as better for real-time news, they said.", "There was one big problem: Facebook\u2019s trending algorithms, which identify the most-talked-about terms, were not very good at discerning what was and was not news. Left to their own devices, roughly 40 percent of what Facebook\u2019s algorithms dug up would be junk or \u201cnoise,\u201d a result of many people using the same word at the same time across the network. The algorithm might pick up a sharp rise in the word \u201cSkittles\u201d and deem it a trending topic \u2014 not exactly the events Facebook had in mind.", "That is where humans came in. Facebook enlisted a set of 20-somethings as curators, copy editors and team leads, charged with sifting through the material the algorithms unearthed. They were crucial, they were told, to improving Facebook\u2019s ability to discern, over time, what constitutes news.", "\u201cEven if you want to have computers do everything, for technical reasons, resource limitations and product positioning, you may want humans to oversee the algorithms,\u201d Jonathan Koren, a former Facebook employee who worked on algorithmic ranking for Trending Topics, wrote in a LinkedIn post this week.", "Mr. Fearnow, who was terminated from Facebook in April for breaking his nondisclosure agreement, said his job as a curator was to \u201cmassage the algorithm.\u201d Managers were ambivalent about allowing staff members to identify themselves as curators or editors on their LinkedIn profiles, he said, given concerns that outsiders would notice the element of human judgment and ask questions about it.", "Facebook declined to comment, citing employee confidentiality.", "During each eight-hour shift, curators were presented with a continuously refreshing list of trending terms they had to sort through and identify as junk or relevant, and draft descriptions for those topics. After labeling them and checking whether they had been independently reported by a number of major news outlets, curators gave topics a value that would make them more or less likely to show up on individual users\u2019 pages. Each user saw a different list of personalized Topics based on their past actions on Facebook.", "In Facebook\u2019s editorial guidelines, curators were also told to \u201cblacklist,\u201d or push aside, junk topics that appeared in their queue for a period of eight to 24 hours before they could potentially appear again, according to current and former employees. When duplicate or confusing topics arose, curators were told to \u201cinject\u201d a more accurate Topic term. Copy editors and team leads would also oversee and approve the choices being made.", "The work was monotonous \u2014 and not entirely gratifying. Workers were incentivized to compete against one another to clear the most trends from their queue, former employees said. Top performers were given \u201cpoints\u201d that could be spent on Facebook paraphernalia like T-shirts.", "Staff turnover was high, they said. Most on the team were contractors, though some were full-time employees. That led to a sense of inequality between the two groups, some said. Starting annual salaries for contractors were in the mid-to-high $50,000s, according to former staff members.", "The disgruntlement may have led to leaks to news media. On May 9, the news site Gizmodo quoted anonymous sources who claimed to be former Facebook journalists, alleging that curators \u201croutinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers\u201d in Trending Topics.", "Facebook denied the allegations. In a demonstration of its internal tools this week at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., Facebook showed multiple layers of scrutiny by staff members that would make it extremely difficult for other workers not to notice an intentional manipulation of the system, nor was it likely to be technically possible.", "Former employees agree. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see any kind of intentional, outright bias,\u201d Mr. Fearnow said. \u201cThere were an amazing amount of steps taken to avoid that.\u201d He said he regularly wrote headlines and descriptions for far-right conservative sites or personalities that were visible on Trending Topics.", "Still, current and former Facebook employees said the personal judgment of curators was integral. Unconscious bias, they said, is tough to prevent. Facebook\u2019s 28-page editorial guidelines were also constantly updated and changed, former curators said, and engineers would tweak the product with little or no notice, making it difficult to keep up.", "The reaction to the Gizmodo report has been fiery. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, has demanded answers about how Trending Topics works. A group of 16 conservatives, including Glenn Beck and Brent Bozell, traveled to Facebook for a fence-mending meeting with top executives, including the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. Some conservative sites, like Breitbart, are calling for Mr. Zuckerberg to further explain himself.", "Facebook said it was improving employee training to make its guidelines for news curators clearer, including renaming some of the more nefarious-sounding terminology in its guidelines, changing \u201cblacklist\u201d to \u201crevisit,\u201d and \u201cinjection\u201d to \u201ctopic correction.\u201d The company continues to investigate whether any curators intentionally tried to suppress conservative news.", "Executives said that for an experimental product, they got a lot wrong.", "\u201cThis is a relatively early product,\u201d Mr. Osofsky said. \u201cThere are aspects of it that clearly we\u2019re continuing to work on.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/nyregion/how-daveed-diggs-of-hamilton-spends-his-sundays.html": ["Daveed Diggs is still getting to know the city.

The Environmental Protection Agency issued a health advisory for two compounds: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is used in the manufacture of Teflon and other nonstick substances, and the related perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). An E.P.A. health advisory is not a regulation; it is nonbinding and nonenforceable. It does, however, require a public water system to notify its customers of the presence of the chemical and the dangers it poses. As a result, the E.P.A.\u2019s announcement had immediate effects. Within hours, public wells were shut down in Horsham, Pa., and Maricopa County, Ariz. West Virginia\u2019s Bureau for Public Health ordered a \u201cdo not drink\u201d advisory for the water in three communities: Parkersburg, the site of a Teflon factory that until recently was operated by DuPont; the adjacent town of Vienna; and Martinsburg, four hours east, near the Maryland border. The West Virginia National Guard sent convoys of tankers containing drinking water to Vienna.", "Rob Bilott, a lawyer at the Cincinnati firm of Taft, Stettinius and Hollister, has demanded that the E.P.A. take action on PFOA since 2001. (See \u201cThe Lawyer Who Became DuPont\u2019s Worst Nightmare.\u201d) By that point, Bilott had read more than 110,000 pages of internal corporate documents related to PFOA. He had learned that DuPont, despite knowledge that the chemical was linked to increased rates of cancer and other horrific health conditions in animals and human beings, had dumped mountains of the stuff into the local water supply for decades. It was even known in 2001 that perfluorinated chemicals had been detected nationwide in nearly every sample tested at blood banks. At least once a year since then, Bilott has written to the E.P.A. to renew his request.", "Anyone who wants to understand how seriously the United States government considers its duty to protect the health of its citizens need only review the history of the correspondence between Bilott and the agency. It is a one-sided correspondence. In his annual letters, Bilott attaches previous correspondence, new scientific findings about the dangers of PFOA and disclosures from the legal cases he has waged continuously against DuPont since 1998. The E.P.A.\u2019s responses are curt, usually less than a single page. In recent years the E.P.A. has claimed to be close to issuing a health advisory. But it did not do so until last Thursday.", "Who has been drinking this poisoned water? More than five million American citizens, according to the Environmental Working Group, which analyzes data released publicly by the E.P.A. It has been found in dangerous concentrations in 52 public water systems across 19 states and two Pacific island territories. But Bilott said that the new E.P.A. advisory \u2014 warning against long-term exposure to drinking water with a concentration of PFOA or PFOS higher than 0.07 parts per billion \u2014 is too conservative. \u201cIt needs to be much, much lower,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cEven at the lowest detectable levels, it still builds up in the blood over time.\u201d The Environmental Working Group has proposed a limit of 0.001 parts per billion, though Bilott suspects that anything above zero may be dangerous, because of PFOA\u2019s extraordinary \u201cbio-persistence\u201d in the blood. Once it enters your body, it stays there.", "It is relatively easy to remove perfluorinated chemicals from drinking water. All that is required is the installation of a carbon-filtration system, not a particularly expensive endeavor.

Had it been successful, I\u2019d classify it as suicidal manslaughter. I climbed into the antique wrought iron bed I shared with my partner and passed out.

I got up in a daze and went to work feeling like I was moving under water, so heavy was my triple hangover from booze, pills and shame. I kept moving, kept drinking (I was blind then to the cause and effect of booze and depression) and kept silent.", "My silence nearly killed me. Eleven years later, I tried again. I had been fantasizing about suicide every day for months. I was more hopeless. I was drunker. That time I did it with sleeping pills I\u2019d been taking to prevent me from drinking as much at night. Booze, pills, suicide attempts: it was all one big happy \u201cValley of the Dolls\u201d family.

Now that I\u2019ve been sober for almost eight years and my artistic dreams are coming true, the secret made me feel like a house rebuilt on a foundation still riddled with termites. I knew I would have to own the attempt eventually, so when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released a report that suicides had surged to the highest levels in 30 years, I knew it was time for me to come clean. With two attempts on my score card, I forever remain in a suicide high risk group. According to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, a history of suicide attempt is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention reports that approximately 40 percent of those who have died by suicide have made a previous suicide attempt at some point in their lives. I don\u2019t want the third time to be the charm.", "The further away from that first attempt, the deeper the secret grew and the less real it became. I didn\u2019t really do that. I didn\u2019t think a few painkillers would kill me. I didn\u2019t mean it. But I did do it and I did mean it. I\u2019m mortified by that.

According to the A.F.S.P., approximately 30 percent of those who die by suicide have blood alcohol levels in the range of intoxication at the time of their deaths.", "After my second attempt, I went to rehab and then to sober meetings. The focus quickly shifted from my suicide attempt to my alcoholism, and rightfully so. Once my alcoholism was treated, the depression lifted. It was alcohol that brought on my depression and thoughts of suicide, and ultimately twice gave me the courage to try it. Since I\u2019ve been sober, I no longer suffer from depression, do not take antidepressants and no longer think about killing myself.", "I\u2019m fortunate to live in New York City, where there are almost as many sober meetings as there are bars.

Ms. Broadwell was never charged.", "Nearly four years later, Mr. Petraeus is now a partner in a New York private equity firm, and has advised the White House on the war against the Islamic State.

For weeks, reporters camped outside her home in Charlotte, N.C., where she was trying to restore her marriage. Friends sent over groceries and hot meals for her family \u2014 her husband, Scott, and sons, 8 and 10 \u2014 and staged interference so Ms. Broadwell could cut across her neighbors\u2019 lawns, climbing over fences, to escape for a morning run.", "She lost her military security clearance; her promotion from major to lieutenant colonel was revoked when the news broke. The F.B.I. still has her computers \u2014 including her dissertation research \u2014 and she withdrew from her Ph.D. program.

In the aftermath, he reached out to both by email to offer sympathy and support. \u201cBut, I think it\u2019s equally the danger \u2014 the white-hot danger \u2014 for the private citizen caught in an affair with a public figure.\u201d", "Ms. Broadwell was not exactly an entirely private figure before, of course; it was just that what she was known for publicly was him. And so her fall seemed to elicit a particular brand of female schadenfreude: She seemed a little too eager, a little too ambitious, a little too self-promoting, enjoying the attention just a little too much. Yes, she would challenge Jon Stewart to a push-up competition \u2014 to raise money for wounded veterans \u2014 and win. She could also run a six-minute mile. \u201cMy immediate reaction was, \u2018Oh no, they\u2019re going to destroy her,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Fulton, who did not know Ms. Broadwell at the time but reached out after the affair became public to offer her support.", "To journalists, she was the woman who \u2014 without any journalistic experience \u2014 had persuaded the highest commander in the land to give her unusual access and then abused it. (When the book came out, and she appeared on \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\u201d Mr. Stewart joked that \u201cthe real controversy here is, is he awesome or incredibly awesome?\u201d)", "To military colleagues, she was guilty of \u201cHollywooding\u201d: commanding the attention to herself in a culture that is all about the team. And then there was the infidelity, a crime for active duty officers for a reason. \u201cService members are required to deploy for months and months at a time \u2014 so you have to be able to trust your spouse,\u201d Ms. Fulton said. It happens, of course, so often that there\u2019s a name for it (\u201ca zipper malfunction\u201d). And yet \u201cto violate that trust is viewed as particularly egregious.\u201d", "And so the public inquisition into the \u201cmistress\u201d began, with everything from her fitness acumen \u2014 could she really run a six-minute mile? \u2014 to her body fat (13 percent) to her \u201cusually tight shirts and pants\u201d scrutinized. She was called, by a senior military source, \u201ca shameless self-promoting prom queen\u201d who \u201cgot her claws\u201d into him. She was \u201ccurvaceous,\u201d with \u201cexpressive green eyes.\u201d One general described her as \u201cseemingly immune to the notion of modesty,\u201d referring to the attire she was said to have worn in Afghanistan.", "Mr. Petraeus, meanwhile, was described by former aides as \u201cthe consummate gentleman and family man.\u201d He had \u201clet his guard down,\u201d The Washington Post said in a headline. Supporters said he\u2019d done the \u201chonorable\u201d thing by quitting. When he resigned, the president offered his prayers for the general and his wife; the Petraeus family, friends lamented in the news media, would get through this.", "And then there was the \u2014 in hindsight \u2014 unfortunate title of Ms. Broadwell\u2019s book, \u201cAll In: The Education of General David Petraeus.\u201d There were porn parodies, and a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit in which a buttoned-up book event is actually a live reading of a steamy sex scene. There were rape and death threats, one sent in a handwritten letter to her home. Her Facebook page still vacillates between, \u201cYou ruined America!\u201d and \u201cWill you go out on a date with me?\u201d", "\u201cI think the worst feeling is when you don\u2019t have control over your life,\u201d Ms. Broadwell said. She was sitting on the couch in her living room in Charlotte while her children were at school. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this felt like.\u201d", "The first year was hell, she said. She and her husband, a radiologist with whom she is still together, went into counseling. She went into therapy. They explained to the children that \u201cMommy made a really big mistake.\u201d She had panic attacks, lost weight and retreated from public view, hiring a team to manage the legal threat against her. Would she be tried for conspiracy to commit espionage? For cyberstalking? For something else? She was often reading about her legal status in the news.", "Mr. Petraeus had many defenders \u2014 and a four-decade career of service to stand on. Ms. Broadwell did not. She said she never heard from her best friend \u2014 a crime agent with the F.B.I. She asked another friend, a woman she had mentored, if she\u2019d be willing to speak up on her behalf, but this woman was applying for a job with the C.I.A. \u201cIt was too controversial to even touch; certainly if you were active duty you would pay a price,\u201d Ms. Fulton said.", "There was the emotional toll of the abrupt severing of an intensely personal relationship. But there was also the professional one: her career tangled up with this man with whom she was once in love, her advocates, his allies. Mr. Petraeus had been helping her with her Ph.D., at King\u2019s College London, on military and organizational innovation. (His unit was one of the case studies.) They were working on another book together, this one focused on his leadership style, called \u201cRelentless.\u201d", "Before the fallout, the Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina had sat her down in Mr. Burr\u2019s office to discuss a future congressional run, she said. Suddenly, overnight, she became \u2014 in her word \u2014 \u201cradioactive.\u201d (A spokeswoman for Senator Burr\u2019s office confirmed that the meeting took place, but said that he could not recall the precise nature of it.)", "\u201cShe has such confidence, such presence in the way she carries herself, and she commands this attention,\u201d said Rose Keravuori, a longtime friend and former West Point classmate. \u201cI think people expected her to go into politics, or do something different. And then this happened, and just, nobody helped her up. It was hard to reconcile so many people being sort of gleeful in it.\u201d", "In March, Ms. Kelley, the Florida woman caught up in the Petraeus soap opera, self-published a book in which she printed dozens of her email exchanges with the general, as well as emails sent by Ms. Broadwell. It is called \u201cCollateral Damage,\u201d and in it she describes her own struggle to restore a damaged reputation, which led her and her husband to sue the government for invading their privacy (the suit was dropped in March).", "The book landed Ms. Kelley on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d as well as a flurry of media attention, while Ms. Broadwell was on a camping trip with her family in the mountains.

She is on the board of multiple local leadership organizations, and she\u2019s a member of an opera club. She volunteers for a group that provides safe houses for human trafficking victims, another that helps veterans rehabilitate. She drops off her sons at the bus stop each day, then goes for a morning run. She continues to push for women in combat, and is active in a group called West Point Women, which planned the event at her alma mater.", "She is emotional when she speaks about the Charlotte community that embraced her family. But she\u2019s torn: Should she try to reclaim her past \u2014 her dream of becoming a national security adviser \u2014 or should she pursue something entirely different? Should she fight to restore her military status, or simply move on?", "\u201cThe truth is, the military is not a place where you can rehabilitate,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018Zero Defects\u2019 policy \u2014 that\u2019s military code.

Gawker has said it has already spent as much as $10 million on its side of the case.", "Mr. Denton has begun to question whether Mr. Harder has a benefactor, perhaps one of the many subjects of Gawker\u2019s skewering coverage.", "\u201cMy own personal hunch is that it\u2019s linked to Silicon Valley, but that\u2019s nothing really more than a hunch,\u201d Mr. Denton told me. \u201cIf you\u2019re a billionaire and you don\u2019t like the coverage of you, and you don\u2019t particularly want to embroil yourself any further in a public scandal, it\u2019s a pretty smart, rational thing to fund other legal cases.\u201d", "Mr. Denton\u2019s view is based on the huge expenses of legal cases and settlements, the fact that Mr. Hogan\u2019s financial health has been erratic \u2014 and on the rich history of lawsuits in which lawyers make money only if they win the case. There is an entire industry that exists to provide lines of credit to lawyers working on contingency. There is also a small netherworld of investors who back certain lawsuits.", "\u201cThe answer may be entirely innocent,\u201d Mr. Denton said, musing on the question of whether Mr. Harder was paid by someone other than Mr. Hogan, \u201cbut I think in order for people to understand what\u2019s going on here, what the stakes are, I think it\u2019s important that it be out in public, or at least that he\u2019d be asked the question in public.\u201d", "Based on my conversation with Mr. Denton as well some independent lawyers who first raised questions about the financing of Mr. Hogan\u2019s suit, I approached Mr. Harder and asked him the question directly. In an email, he said, \u201cI do not discuss the finances of my clients, including any financial arrangements they have with my firm. This applies to all clients.\u201d", "Stepping aside from this case, it\u2019s clear that some lawsuits have been funded for reasons beyond strict economics. Kenneth G. Langone, the co-founder of Home Depot and former director of the New York Stock Exchange, helped fund Maurice R. Greenberg\u2019s lawsuit against the United States government over the bankruptcy of the American International Group, which was viewed as being as much as about money as about principle.", "And Max Mosley, the former head of Formula One who successfully brought a series of suits against News of the World for publishing pictures of him involved in an orgy, later funded a number of lawsuits against the same tabloid by people who said its journalists had hacked their phones.", "As for the lawsuits against Gawker Media, \u201cthe evidence has built up over time that there are questions that are unanswered here,\u201d Mr. Denton said. \u201cThe data point that really got us thinking was the move that they made on insurance, which seemed designed to prevent insurance paying for our defense.\u201d", "Mr. Denton is referring to a decision by Mr. Hogan\u2019s legal team to abruptly drop one of the claims \u2014 for \u201cnegligent infliction of emotional distress\u201d \u2014 from its case. That claim had a particularly special meaning: It was the one claim that required Gawker\u2019s insurance company to pay for its defense as well as potential payouts in the case of a settlement. (That provision of Gawker\u2019s insurance policy became public after the insurance company, Nautilus, sued Gawker to try to limit payment for defense.)", "Several legal experts said that it was particularly unusual for a plaintiff using a lawyer being paid on a contingency basis not only to turn down settlement offers (several sizable settlements were proffered by Gawker) but also to pursue a strategy that prevented an insurance company from being able to contribute to a settlement.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a very unusual thing to do, because the insurance company would have deeper pockets than Gawker,\u201d said Larry Geneen, a risk management consultant who has long dealt with lawsuits involving insurance companies. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a situation where the plaintiff intentionally took out the claim involving the insurance company.\u201d", "And given that Mr. Hogan has had financial ups and downs, the cost of the hundreds of motions his lawyers made is significant, and the chances the award is significantly reduced based on previous cases he lost making the same claims in federal court, it\u2019s hard to completely understand the motivations at play.", "Additionally, Mr. Harder has brought two new cases against Gawker that seem puzzling. One is a defamation case on behalf of Shiva Ayyadurai, who claimed to have invented email. Gawker had written an article challenging his argument, similar to an article from The Washington Post and others on the same topic.", "\u201cIn L.A. and New York power centers, people are pretty used to an independent and critical press,\u201d Mr. Denton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we write that much about Hollywood\u2019s celebrities that isn\u2019t written in TMZ or in other celebrity news sites.\u201d", "But some subcultures aren\u2019t used to the glare, Mr. Denton added. \u201cSilicon Valley coverage with coverage on Valleywag, and the coverage on Gawker and Gizmodo \u2014 I think that has been a change for them.\u201d", "Gawker has made a virtual industry of skewering the industry. The company got into a public battle with Steve Jobs over the publication of pictures of a prototype iPhone that was found at a bar. It has also poked at the private lives of virtually every member of Silicon Valley\u2019s royalty and outed many. (I\u2019ll spare them being name-checked here because it will invariably send readers scurrying to Google to search the names.)", "Admittedly, it is a bit hard to defend Gawker Media. I often disagree with Gawker\u2019s news judgment, and it has routinely published items over the years that crossed the line of good taste. I\u2019ve been on the other side of Gawker\u2019s critical pen, and it is not fun. Even so, I believe in a free press, and that means freedom of speech for Gawker\u2019s brand of journalism.", "Mr. Denton does too, but he also would like to see more transparency on the financial side. As for the Hulk Hogan lawsuit, \u201cit\u2019s a big case that involves the balance of power between public figures and the press,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the public\u2019s interest and the media interest for the motives of people on both sides to be out there.\u201d", "It would be great to know the answer."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/us/aging-research-disease-dogs.html": ["SEATTLE \u2014 Ever since last summer, when Lynn Gemmell\u2019s dog, Bela, was inducted into the trial of a drug that has been shown to significantly lengthen the lives of laboratory mice, she has been the object of intense scrutiny among dog park regulars.", "To those who insist that Bela, 8, has turned back into a puppy \u2014 \u201cLook how fast she\u2019s getting that ball!\u201d \u2014 Ms. Gemmell has tried to turn a deaf ear.

That means that even treatment breakthroughs in these areas, no matter how vital to individuals, would yield on average four or five more years of life, epidemiologists say, and some of them likely shadowed by illness.", "A drug that slows aging, the logic goes, might instead serve to delay the onset of several major diseases at once. A handful of drugs tested by federally funded laboratories in recent years appear to extend the healthy lives of mice, with rapamycin and its derivatives, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for organ transplant patients and to treat some types of cancer, so far proving the most effective. In a 2014 study by the drug company Novartis, the drug appeared to bolster the immune system in older patients. And the early results in aging dogs suggest that rapamycin is helping them, too, said Matt Kaeberlein, a biology of aging researcher at the University of Washington who is running the study with a colleague, Daniel Promislow.", "But scientists who champion the study of aging\u2019s basic biology \u2014 they call it \u201cgeroscience\u201d \u2014 say their field has received short shrift from the biomedical establishment.

By removing genes that produced certain proteins, or adding genes that produced others, researchers found they could significantly extend the lives of simple laboratory organisms like budding yeast, roundworms and flies.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not just wearing out, it\u2019s a program,\u201d Dr. Ruvkun said. \u201cThe genetics told us that. If you can modulate it with a few simple perturbations, that\u2019s the definition of a program.\u201d", "Since genes cannot be so easily manipulated in humans, it was significant in 2006 when Dr. Kaeberlein and others demonstrated that rapamycin, the drug now being tested in dogs, suppressed one of the crucial proteins in yeast, resulting in a longer life span without removing a gene. The protein is known to be involved in cell growth. But just how its suppression works to extend life is still unclear, raising questions about potential unknown downsides.", "And it has not helped the field\u2019s reputation that what emerged as a higher-profile hope for fighting aging, amplifying proteins called sirtuins, has not yet panned out. Initially believed to be activated by resveratrol, a substance found in red wine, sirtuins provided a seemingly excellent excuse to imbibe. But the pharmaceutical giant GSK, which had purchased a company for $720 million with the intention of developing a resveratrol-like drug, cut back its efforts in 2013 after the results of the original genetic experiments came under question. A year later, one of only two major foundations funding longevity research stopped making new grants in the field.", "Besides the standard scientific road bumps, biology of aging researchers say their field\u2019s reputation suffers from its association with snake-oil peddlers selling anti-aging creams, hormones and fountains of youth, not to mention the likes of Dorian Gray, Voldemort and assorted Sith lords.

As a result, the mice were 20 months old \u2014 the equivalent of about 60 human years \u2014 when the trial began. That the longest-lived mice survived about 12 percent longer than the control groups was the first indication that the drug could be given later in life and still be effective.", "Dr. Kaeberlein said he had since achieved similar benefits by giving 20-month-old mice the drug for only three months. (The National Institute on Aging rejected his request for funding to further test that treatment.) Younger mice, given higher doses, have lived about 25 percent longer than those not given the drug, and mice of varying ages and genetic backgrounds have been slower to develop some cancers, kidney disease, obesity and symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In one study, their hearts functioned better for longer.", "\u201cIf you do the extrapolation for people, we\u2019re probably talking a couple of decades, with the expectation that those years are going to be spent in relatively good health,\u201d Dr. Kaeberlein said.", "Still, drugs that work in mice often fail in humans. It is also hard to ask rodents about their quality of life. The side effects, depending on the dose and duration, include mouth sores, cataracts, insulin resistance and, for males, problems with testicular function. No one knows if people, who already live a lot longer than mice, would see a proportional increase in life span. And some researchers say there would be serious concerns in testing rapamycin, or any drug, in healthy people just to slow aging. What if a drug lengthened life for some and shortened it for others? Could anyone ethically put a healthy person into a test that might actually shorten life span?", "\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as cancer, where patients are going to die anyway if they don\u2019t get the drug,\u201d said Andrew Dillin, a biology of aging researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who recently raised the questions in Nature, a scientific journal.", "Ethical concerns aside, such a trial would take decades. But what dog lovers have long considered the sad fact that their pets age about seven times as fast as they do, Dr. Kaeberlein knew, would be a boon for a study of rapamycin that would have implications for both species. An owner of two dogs himself, he was determined to scrounge up the money for the pilot phase of what he and Dr. Promislow called the Dog Aging Project.", "Last month, he reported at a scientific meeting that no significant side effects had been observed in the dogs, even at the highest of three doses. And compared with the hearts of dogs in the control group, the hearts of those taking the drug pumped blood more efficiently at the end. The researchers would like to enroll 450 dogs for a more comprehensive five-year study, but do not yet have the money.", "Even if the study provided positive results on all fronts, a human trial would carry risks.", "Dr. Kaeberlein, for one, said they would be worth it.", "\u201cI would argue we should be willing to tolerate some level of risk if the payoff is 20 to 30 percent increase in healthy longevity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, we know what the outcome is going to be.

Google, the mightiest exception to the digital fragility rule, is a platform business that does not benefit primarily from network effects but rather from traditional economies of scale.", "Second, the strength of network effects is often a function of the existence of reinforcing competitive advantages like economies of scale and, notably, customer captivity. The digital economy has undermined both of these barriers to entry by lowering both customer switching costs and the fixed-cost base that drives scale economies.", "So the Aventura Mall benefits from the long-term leases signed by retailers on the one hand and the fact that local shoppers need to go out of their way to find a comparable experience. Operators of digital malls, by contrast, rarely secure long-term commitments from either advertisers or sellers, and shoppers have multiple alternatives just a click away.

Perhaps no one in American public life channels this thought more than Donald J. Trump. He not only doesn\u2019t fear contradiction, he embraces it. And he is downright scornful of those little minds that are bothered by his performances.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to be inconsistent \u2014 even in a single interview, or the same speech \u2014 has baffled political strategists for months. Even more puzzling is his followers\u2019 happy toleration of it. It is as though the content of what Mr. Trump says doesn\u2019t matter; only the fact that he is saying it does. But how could that be? After all, other candidates are seemingly held to different standards, by their supporters and others. They are held responsible for what they say.", "A striking early example of this was Mr. Trump\u2019s initial refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan and other white nationalists who had been endorsing him. Mr. Trump later denounced such groups. Yet many white supremacists, including David Duke, continue to support Mr. Trump. Why?", "The explanation, I think, lies in the power of contradictions themselves. That power, and Mr. Trump\u2019s effective use of it, tells us as much about ourselves and our culture\u2019s attitude toward truth as it tells us about him.", "From the standpoint of classical logic and mathematics, what\u2019s bad about a contradiction is that it leads to absurdity. You can derive any proposition you wish from a contradiction in a few simple steps. Yet that\u2019s precisely what makes them so useful from the point of view of political psychology \u2014 indeed, the more blatant the contradiction the better.", "Of course, politicians often \u201cwalk back\u201d comments \u2014 either because they misspoke, or because of unwelcome attention generated by the remark. Yet an explicit contradiction isn\u2019t the same thing as \u201cmassaging\u201d a comment. A contradiction doesn\u2019t signal that you misspoke and that you really believe something else.", "Walking a comment back says you are taking responsibility for what you\u2019ve said. Blatant contradiction puts the responsibility back onto the shoulders of the listener. If I simply deny what I earlier affirmed and act as if nothing has happened, then you are left having to decide what I really meant. And psychology, as well as common sense, tells us that human beings are prone to \u201cconfirmation bias.\u201d That is, we tend to interpret evidence so that it conforms to what we already believe.", "So if we like the Klan, we can read into Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks that he does, too.

In part, that\u2019s because Mr. Trump\u2019s contradictions are loud and confident. (\u201cI love Hispanics!\u201d he tweeted on Thursday, Cinco de Mayo, along with a picture of him with a taco bowl.) But it is also because when a person says something as well as its opposite, his listeners can infer that he really believes whichever statement they wish him to believe.", "That contradictions are particularly useful to Mr. Trump also tells us something about what some people find appealing about him. Indeed, it reveals an even deeper contradiction. Mr. Trump\u2019s explicit lack of authenticity is what makes him so authentic. He is like a walking oxymoron (which is perhaps not surprising, given that reality TV is the medium in which he has most flourished). To some, that he is contradicting himself so freely shows that he really doesn\u2019t care what \u201cthey\u201d (read: the news media, liberals, women, minorities) think. The signal this sends is one of strength: Only the strong can afford not to care.", "There is also a deeper philosophical issue here. The most disturbing power of contradiction is that its repeated use can dull our sensitivity to the value of truth itself. That\u2019s particularly so given that most Americans live in a digital world that both makes it easier and harder to figure out what is true. Googling is like being in a room with a million shouting voices. It is only natural that we\u2019ll hear those voices that are most similar to our own, shouting what we already believe, and as a result Google can find you confirmation for almost anything, no matter how absurd.", "Of course we are aware that those with different views can do the same. And that very fact, if we aren\u2019t careful, can lead us into thinking that objectivity is a \u201cdead value.\u201d We get so used to contradictory information, rival sources, that we find ourselves no longer valuing truth.", "In George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d the protagonist is tortured until he agrees that two plus two equals five. The point, his torturer makes clear, is to make him see that there is no objective truth other than what the party says is true. That\u2019s the deep power of contradiction. Repeated enough, political contradictions can lull us into giving up on critical thought altogether. And once that happens, we risk giving up on truth.

I don\u2019t read a DeLillo novel for its plot, character, setting; for who betrayed whom and how hard life with Mother was; for Phoenix days and Bombay nights; or for how to tune a fiddle. I read a DeLillo novel for its sentences. And sentence by sentence, DeLillo magically slips the knot of criticism and gives his readers what Nabokov maintained was all that mattered in life and art: individual genius. Sentence by sentence, DeLillo seduces. And I don\u2019t just mean on the question of thumbs up or down; I mean that his sentences juke and weave around the best defenses, so that not only is the playing field of the past 50 years strewn with conservative critics of all stripes, but text, subtext, ultimate meanings remain elusive and the game, at least in part, now seems original to him.", "For instance. Charles Maitland, a British security consultant in DeLillo\u2019s 1982 novel \u201cThe Names,\u201d compares Western expatriates \u2014 diplomats, businessmen, risk analysts \u2014 to members of the British Empire whose insouciant lives were full of \u201copportunity, adventure, sunsets, dusty death.\u201d Even with so dour a conclusion, it all sounds winsome and romantic in Maitland\u2019s formulation, which fails to take into account at whose expense opportunity and adventure are made. Later, Maitland complains: \u201cThey keep changing the names .\u2008.\u2008. Persia for one. We grew up with Persia. What a vast picture that name evoked. A vast carpet of sand. .\u2008.\u2008. I find I take these changes quite personally. .\u2008.\u2008. Every time another people\u2019s republic emerges from the dust, I have the feeling someone has tampered with my childhood.\u201d Clueless but effervescent, this is wit and world-weariness as two sides of the Western coin, the sort of thing one might smile at when spoken at a cocktail party. But it masks a deeper intent. DeLillo artfully reveals Maitland\u2019s Western view of things while guiding the reader to ask: Who\u2019s changing the names, and why? Smile, and the history of colonialism and the civil wars it ignited will be scrubbed out with a quip.", "Local pleasures make palatable \u00adDeLillo\u2019s deep and disquieting engagement with the world on many levels: \u00adsocial, political, philosophical, linguistic, interpersonal. In book after book, his characters fall through constructed surfaces and constructed selves into deeper, more terrifying but also more numinous realities. They quest for truer or purer or more permanent identities, for the hidden key that will resolve them of their limitations, weaknesses and mortal bearings. More often than not, that quest leads to disillusionment and death. Thus does David Bell, in \u201cAmericana,\u201d hope to discover in the small towns and bit players of this uncontainable country something that will make him one with the pure incandescent image. Thus does Owen Brademas, searching in \u201cThe Names\u201d for the resolution of a fallen world in a language of divine order, find that search travestied by a murderous cult seeking similar ends. And thus does Lee Harvey Oswald, in \u201cLibra,\u201d hope to be absorbed into History with a single act of violence in order to be absolved of his otherwise small and insignificant self.", "In \u201cZero K,\u201d DeLillo\u2019s 16th and latest novel, Jeffrey Lockhart arrives in the middle of the desert at a remote compound called the Convergence. Variously described as an \u201cendeavor,\u201d a \u201cfaith-based technology\u201d and \u201cthe first split second of the first cosmic year,\u201d the Convergence is a cross between a think tank and a state-of-the-art hospice: the Santa Fe Institute meets Sloan Kettering, with a dollop of Heaven\u2019s Gate, all of it given over to Christo for interior decorating. Whatever it is, the Convergence coolly ignites the imagination. Jeff hopes to get his bearings, at least geographically, when he asks his father, the billionaire Ross Lockhart, where they are. \u201cThe nearest city of any size is across the border, called Bishkek,\u201d Ross answers from deep within blastproof walls. He continues: \u201cOnce you know the local names and how to spell them, you\u2019ll feel less detached.\u201d", "We are, in other words, far from the neocolonial world described so tendentiously by Charles Maitland. We are in a vision of the future, a postracial, post-postcolonial world where Westerners like Ross and Jeff are but one contingent of a technocratic cult with a single aim: to rid the world of that absolute, all-\u00addefining force, that ultimate despotic colonizer, death. For the Convergence, as it turns out, is a cryonic suspension facility where the dead are frozen in anticipation of that day when resuscitation is medically feasible. Jeff has arrived there to say a temporary goodbye to his stepmother, the archaeologist \u00adArtis Martineau, who is dying of several disabling diseases.", "Ross Lockhart, who made his billions assessing the financial risk of natural disasters, is a true believer in the promise of the Convergence. He pours money and \u00adresources into the endeavor, not to mention old-fashioned dogma. The first half of the book is devoted to abolishing any skepticism Jeff (and the reader) might have for the cryogenically inclined. \u201cRespect the idea,\u201d Ross tells Jeff of the Convergence, after Jeff, intending only a little disrespect, says, \u201cPeople \u00adenroll their pets.\u201d Yet, despite the proselytizing, Jeff, who spends his downtime wandering past door after door in a series of unending hallways, can\u2019t bring himself to understand what\u2019s all around him as anything more than it seems: a lark, a punch line, a cruel delusion. Artis \u201cwould die,\u201d he thinks, \u201cchemically prompted, in a subzero vault, in a highly precise medical procedure guided by mass delusion, by superstition and arrogance and self-deception.\u201d His skepticism extends to the very rooms and doorways of the Convergence, as he becomes convinced they\u2019re decoys, elaborate fictions to some inscrutable end. He knocks on one, and to his surprise, a man answers in turban and tie. Not a lark, after all. \u201cI must have the wrong door,\u201d Jeff says by way of apology. \u201cThey\u2019re all the wrong door,\u201d the man replies. A lark, after all.", "This is fiction in touch with the starker parables, with Kafka and Beckett, with the austerity of bare rooms and declarative, uninflected sentences. I was uncertain as I read these early pages. Had DeLillo created a world of pure abstraction where the reader would be left to float in the \u00adzero-gravity chamber of the death fable, everything to think about and nothing to latch on to? But this is only one of several canny feints in the book, which continually shape-shifts and reimagines itself. In the end, it all adds up to one of the most mysterious, emotionally moving and formally rewarding books of DeLillo\u2019s long career.", "Slowly, Jeff comes to understand what\u2019s intended out there on the outskirts of Bishkek: technological utopia. Cells will be refashioned. Nanobots will restore the body and augment the brain. The old factions born of religion and geopolitics will be permanently mooted in a post-death world. Jeff\u2019s incredulity at such things \u00adallows DeLillo to render the Convergence at once otherworldly and entirely believable, one more high-flying human scheme revved on false hope and doomed to fail. What put me in mind, in the early going, of brushed-steel surfaces and lonely centrifuges becomes something warmer and more elegiac as Artis\u2019s death nears and the enormity of Ross\u2019s loss comes into view. Death, even at the Convergence, remains just that, at least for the foreseeable future. And the man does love his wife.", "At about the same time, the philosophical implications of cryogenic success deepen. The primary architects of the Convergence, a pair of siblings Jeff calls the Stenmark twins, hold a kind of slapstick seminar on their project; it plays like the Marx Brothers doing a TED talk with the mind-body philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland. I found myself asking: What would happen if the souls of the cryogenically preserved went to heaven? Would they resurrect as zombies when science restored their bodies? The book inspires a lot of intellectual play as it drifts away from stark Kafka landscape into Borges-\u00adinspired mindspace, even flirting with the trippier themes of Philip K. Dick, and elegy starts to compete not with science fiction, exactly, but with fiction about science.", "Meanwhile, the real world \u2014 I mean yours and mine (and Jeff\u2019s), the world of headlines and global warming \u2014 enters from the wings in the form of disaster footage projected onto white screens in those hallways Jeff roams. \u201cThere were temples flooded, homes pitching down hillsides,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI watched as water kept rising in city streets, cars and drivers going under.\u201d If literature is Pound\u2019s \u201cnews that stays news,\u201d this is news about news that stays news, for in a place like the Convergence where death has been antiquated, newspaper headlines turn into art installations. Soon the book is pulling a good number of levers, both emotional and intellectual, and really humming, so much so that when Ross, perfectly healthy, announces his intention to follow his wife on the first leg of what they hope to be a round-trip journey \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going with her,\u201d he tells his son, in a cold declaration of his suicide \u2014 I was wide-eyed, and reading as much for plot as for prose style.", "DeLillo, the most perceptive (almost occult) chronicler of contemporary life, has not invented the Convergence out of whole cloth: Its DNA comes from an old evangelism dressed in a new rhetoric and streaming out of Silicon Valley. \u201cDeath makes me very angry,\u201d Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, told his biographer, perhaps to explain why he has given nearly half a billion dollars to medical research to halt human aging. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, together with his wife, has given millions of dollars to the research of biological resiliency. Then there is the Breakthrough Prize, founded by Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and other tech luminaries, with an annual pot of $3 million going to researchers who make discoveries that extend human life. And there is Larry Page\u2019s founding of Calico (or California Life Company), an \u00adanti-aging research center in San Francisco, with a multimillion-dollar \u00adinvestment from Google. The list goes on. We have entered an age of messianism through philanthropy and are only a billionaire\u2019s whim away from the Convergence and its dreams of \u201ca promise more assured than the ineffable hereafters of the world\u2019s organized religions.\u201d", "The full scope of DeLillo\u2019s vision for \u201cZero K\u201d comes into view with the book\u2019s second half, when the real world, in the form of New York City and the crisis in Ukraine, floods the page. Two years have passed since Artis\u2019s death, and Jeff now finds himself involved with a woman named Emma and her politically precocious son, whom she adopted from Ukraine. The strife there, hopeless and cyclical, is soon to rear its terrible head, with consequences for all of them. But before any of this can transpire, we get familiar DeLillo street life, witty repartee in the backs of cabs, rooftop views of the city at dusk. We have our attention focused on those easily overlooked moments of everyday life, like standing shoeless in the airport, and those quotidian \u00addetails \u2014 \u201cfresh towels on the racks, nice new bar of soap, clean sheets on the bed\u201d \u2014 that give texture and pleasure to the day. We visit Emma at the school where she works with developmentally disabled children, admiring her, as Jeff does, for her tenderness with troubled souls. This teeming life, these unexpectedly touching scenes, come to the reader as both refreshing breeze and melancholy plaint, for what is observed here, what is gloried, is also what is inevitably lost with dying. The careful structure of the book won\u2019t let us forget that: The Convergence, the dying part, came first. This is \u00adelegy as formal design. We carry the Convergence with us through the vibrant city like a memento mori, for toward a convergence we all must go, and with it, every attachment, every lustful look, the whole worldly kit and caboodle.", "The Convergence, with its promises of everlasting life, is a seductive dream, just as Charles Maitland\u2019s assessment of Western entanglement in far-flung lands is seductive. \u201cIt will be very gentle,\u201d Ross says about Artis\u2019s death. \u201cIt will be quick, safe and painless.\u201d Death, painless! \u201cThis is real,\u201d one of the Stenmark twins says. \u201cTake the existential leap. Rewrite the sad grim grieving playscript of death in the usual manner.\u201d When death is indistinguishable from a long night\u2019s sleep among excellent accommodations and in the company of loved ones, after which one awakes rejuvenated and augmented by nanobots with spoken Greek and all of Proust, who wouldn\u2019t love the turndown service at the Convergence?", "But the seduction is every bit as illusory as Charles Maitland\u2019s. After all, we are as far from a postracial, post-postcolonial world as we are near to arriving at whatever technique or technology is necessary for eternal life. For those inclined to believe that the rationalist mind-set, in league with science and technology, is better poised to bring about results than the old emissaries of heaven, \u201cZero K\u201d reminds them that human nature is one of permanent conflict. Eternal life would only become one more instrument of power and source of human sorrow.", "The good news, modest as it must be, is \u201cZero K.\u201d DeLillo\u2019s novels generally \u00adoffer consolation simply by enacting so well the mystery and awe of the real world, by probing deeply and mystically into so much, and by offering the pleasures of his unique style. Just as his characters plunge through constructed realities in quest of truer selves, so do we, as DeLillo\u2019s readers, find in his pages something akin to insight of a gnostic order. DeLillo\u2019s characters long to penetrate the enigmas and intrigues of his conjured worlds; DeLillo\u2019s readers devour his sentences, images and narratives for what amounts to something similar: for all that DeLillo \u2014 the seeker, the prophet, the mystic, the guide \u2014 sees.", "That consolation is every bit as present in \u201cZero K\u201d as it is in the best of DeLillo\u2019s previous novels, down to the pleasures of the final page. The scene takes place in New York, with Jeff on a crosstown bus. It ends the book powerfully. I finished it stunned and grateful. DeLillo has written a handful of the past half-century\u2019s finest novels.

Per my server\u2019s suggestion, I dressed each piece with only a small amount of a salt-and-pepper mixture that was on the table.

The simple salt dressing was a perfect complement, highlighting the sweetness of the fat but not obscuring the taste of the beef.", "Working off the beef would prove easy enough: Kobe is a delightful and interesting place to walk around. I followed a suggestion that came from a follower of the Frugal Traveler Twitter account and went in search of the Kobe Mosque, opened in 1935, the first mosque in Japan. When I saw two minarets peeking out from some pink cherry blossoms, I knew I had arrived. I removed my shoes and went inside. An elderly man greeted me and offered me a date, which I took. There weren\u2019t any worshipers when I was there, but I went inside the musalla (prayer hall) for a few minutes before looking at some old pictures that illustrated the history of the mosque, including how it survived Allied bombings during World War II.", "From the mosque it was an easy and meandering walk toward the mountains and up through Kitano-cho, or foreign residence neighborhood.

Two particularly notable houses are the Weathercock house, built in 1909 and the Moegi house, built in 1903. You can purchase tickets to tour each house individually for 350 yen; I bought a dual ticket for 650 yen that allowed me to walk through both Weathercock and Moegi.", "At the nearby tourist information center, I had a nice, if slightly labored conversation (due to my lack of Japanese) with some lovely old women who worked there. They patiently recommended that I visit one of Kobe\u2019s onsen. I set out late one afternoon in search of one I\u2019d randomly decided on based on poring over the area Google Maps.", "I began the journey at the foot of the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, a massive piece of construction that has the longest central span of any suspension bridge in the world. From Maiko station (about 20 minutes west of downtown Kobe), it\u2019s a separate 410-yen bus ride across the bridge to Awaji Island. The bus is not the easiest thing to find \u2014 it requires walking up four or five flights of stairs and meeting the bus directly on the bridge itself. I asked a local woman for help (a good habit if you don\u2019t read Japanese) and was led to the correct bus.", "From where I exited the bus to my destination seemed a reasonable 18-minute walk. There was just one problem: I couldn\u2019t find it. I looked and looked; I asked around, hunted for signs, but there was nothing. Finally, as it was getting dark, I imposed upon a group of university students who were studying in a nearby building. They informed me that my destination was, in fact, another 3 kilometers away. So I started walking. I did it so you don\u2019t have to, but my recommendation is: Don\u2019t make that walk. It\u2019s dangerous. Call a taxi, if possible. There are too many areas with no sidewalk and at night, it\u2019s a bad idea.", "I did make it to my onsen, though, and once there, managed to let my ire toward the bad maps experience melt away as I looked out over Akashi Strait from an outdoor bubbling pool of soothing hot water. Admission to the springs is 700 yen; a very thin towel costs 200 yen, and you\u2019ll need additional 100-yen coins to use as deposits for the lockers. There are separate male and female sides \u2014 once you\u2019re in your section, check any Puritanism you may have at the door and be prepared to hang out with a large number of naked people. Relaxing in the outdoor pool, while looking out over the mammoth bridge I\u2019d crossed a couple of hours before, was one of the best moments of the trip.", "But it wasn\u2019t the only good moment. I spent one afternoon walking around the Nada district, one of the top sake-producing areas of the country. It\u2019s said by many in Japan that Kobe is a perfect place to brew sake, with the availability of quality rice, a good water supply, conducive weather and proximity to the harbor for exporting. I took the train to Mikage station and walked to the Hakutsuru Brewery Museum. Over two levels, the sake-making process from centuries past is illustrated, from rice preparation to fermentation to storage in giant wooden casks. I then made the brief walk \u2014 about 15 minutes \u2014 to another brewery/museum called Shu-Shin-Kan. They have a full-on sake bar at Shu-Shin-Kan, and I got a very nice (and free) sake tasting from one of the employees. One sake I tried, Daiginjo, tasted smooth, clean and floral. Another, called Junmai-shu, was subtle and mellow.", "Drinking always goes better with music, however, and I remedied that with a visit to the legendary Sone jazz club. Established in 1969 and considered by some to be the birthplace of the Japanese jazz scene, Sone is all wood, polished brass, whiskey and sharply dressed waiters. The place emanates cool, the way a jazz club should. When I went in, the jazz trio was midway through their set. I paid the 1,140-yen cover, took a seat alone at a table, and ordered a beer for 790 yen. After a few songs, a singer, Junko Koyanagi, joined the trio and made some introductions in Japanese. Then, as if someone flipped a switch, she began singing jazz standards in perfect English. \u201cJust squeeze me, but please don\u2019t tease me,\u201d she crooned over the trio, belting the 1941 Duke Ellington classic. She went through a few other standards, including a flawless \u201cRoute 66\u201d \u2014 no mean feat, as \u201cKingman, Barstow, San Bernardino\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue.", "The set ended \u2014 far too soon \u2014 and the group took their bows. It\u2019s often said that music has no language or, rather, that it is its own language. That proved to be true that evening in Kobe, as I was reminded that even halfway across the world, it\u2019s possible to feel entirely at home."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/technology/farhad-and-mikes-week-in-tech-the-technology-we-love-to-hate.html": ["Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.", "Mike: Good morning, Farhad!

I know that we planned to do a list called \u201c14 Reasons Mike Looks Up to Farhad,\u201d but I actually worried we\u2019d run out of space. So I had another idea.

So I was thinking that we could both list a couple of our most-hated products or services in tech. What gadget gets you really steamed, Mike?", "Mike: My most-hated tech product has to be the popularization of the \u201crugged\u201d Bluetooth speaker designed to clip to one\u2019s belt loop, essentially a modern take on the boombox, but 10 times more obnoxious.", "It\u2019s marketed as an outdoorsy-type thing, something to take to the beach, or camping or, in your case, glamping. \u201cImagine yourself scaling Mount Everest and listening to Sugar Ray at the peak!\u201d the ad copy (probably) goes.

I\u2019m lucky if I get six months out of these cables before they start acting up \u2014 usually the connector begins separating from the cable or you get a kink in the line that begins to crack, and soon your phone stops charging. I hate it. Will someone please make a superstrong charging cable, please?", "Mike: I am totally with you there. I have a drawer full of cheap Chinese knock-off Lightning cables, and they all work for a day and then bust. If I buy the real $30 one from Apple, it still goes bad in less than a year. Forget the annual new iPhone events, I want the company to hold an ultimate, indestructible Lightning cable event.", "Here\u2019s something else that I wanted to like, but actually hate: streaming, stationary digital cameras like those offered by Nest for the home.", "I really liked the whole safety and security pitch at first. When I lived in New York, the editors unfortunately wanted me to leave my house and go into the office to work \u2014 something I\u2019m pretty sure you have never done in the San Francisco bureau.

Conglomerates like iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications) and other online services like Pandora, which are required to pay artists for digital streams, have exploited federal copyright law to deny payments for work recorded before 1972 (songwriters are paid; performers are not).

First, Congress should update the safe harbor rules of the copyright act to achieve the balance that was intended: protecting creators with effective tools in exchange for not burdening Internet companies with liability. That means strong, well-defined consequences for repeat offenders, easing the process for filing notices and ensuring that services are using the best technology to take pirated material off their sites and keep it off.", "Second, Congress can address the original sin of AM and FM radio and close the loophole that allows radio companies to use music without paying artists.

It prods society to criticize itself and learn from mistakes. It fosters the independence of mind we need to be responsible grown-ups. Take away free speech, and liberal democracy \u00adceases to be truly liberal or democratic. Free speech hunts out truth and spreads knowledge. When stifled, it responds with soaring words of defiance. Think of Milton or Voltaire, Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel, Salman Rushdie or Kamel Daoud.", "Defending free speech, alas, takes more than standing up for science, sound argument and brave eloquence. It takes standing up as well for the right to say things that are false, hateful, mindless, base, vulgar, stupid or reckless. It is easy to defend what we admire and believe in. To defend free speech, you have to allow for bad speech. Free speech gave us Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a dream.\u201d It also gave us Donald Trump.", "It would be nice to have one without the other. But that is not what free speech promises. Free speech is complicated and comes at a high price. We pay for it in terms of other things we also need to care about: public order and security, children\u2019s needs, private reputations, civic courtesy, cultural worth, the social \u00addignity of vulnerable minorities. As Timothy Garton Ash makes admirably clear in his wise, up-to-the-minute and wide-ranging new survey, \u201cFree Speech: Ten Principles for a Connected World,\u201d most of the difficult arguments about free speech bear on its price in terms of other things that also ought to matter to us.", "The controversies are fierce and familiar. Ought leakers be punished, and how can whistle-blowers be protected? Should pornography be restricted? Do libel laws gag the press? May religion be shielded from mockery? Ought hate speech be criminalized? Garton Ash pursues each in depth. He follows the common practice of taking \u201cfree speech\u201d to mean a cluster of freedoms to express yourself and your thoughts as you please: not just voicing words but printing what you want, \u00adproclaiming your faith as you wish, campaigning for your chosen causes and making art without interference.", "Speech in that broad sense was once suspect unless expressly permitted; monitored speech was the norm. But in liberal modernity, unmonitored speech is the norm and limits to speech are suspect unless specifically justified. The main arguments now separate laxists from restrictionists. Laxists favor few limits, restrictionists many. The kinds of limits matter. Coercive laws, whether prior censorship or after-the-fact sanctions, provide one kind of limit. Garton Ash is generally against them. High standards of public argument and common decency are another kind of limit. Garton Ash is broadly for them. You could say he is laxist about law and restrictionist about standards. His approach has the great merit of keeping distinct what is legally permissible and what is or ought to be socially acceptable. Garton Ash treasures the jewel but recognizes and regrets the mud. His guiding maxim, never wholly lost amid near encyclopedic detail, is \u201cMore free speech but also better speech.\u201d", "As a scholar-journalist, Garton Ash knows what he is talking about from a career of reading, writing, listening and, more lately, web-clicking. When reporting on the breakup of the Communist world in the 1980s, he befriended East European dissidents, saw how truthful speech could sap the will of wrongful power and collected a private lexicon of sardonic political jokes that here lighten the going. Now a fellow at St. Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, he supervises a 13-language online debating platform \u2014 freespeechdebate.com \u2014 for promoting free speech and arguing with all sides about its proper limits. His travels and interviews for \u201cFree Speech\u201d spanned the world, or what he calls the \u201ccosmopolis,\u201d a global space that is virtual as well as geographic. That range alone will squelch the fantasy that free speech is a purely Western concern.", "Garton Ash invokes recent work by lawyers and philosophers but sees that fine distinctions and tight reasoning get you only so far in public argument. Talk of freedom is empty, he recognizes, when it neglects unequal power. In illustration, he offers a nice cartoon metaphor. Speech, he writes, is fought over by dogs (big state powers like the United States, the European Union and China), cats (big Internet and media concerns) and mice (that is, us). Government and corporations, he thinks, should interfere with speech very little. We should accordingly not look to them to improve speech. Making speech better is up to us, the mice.", "Law to Garton Ash is a poor tool for \u00adcivic education. He questions hate-speech laws and Holocaust-denial laws, fearing a \u00ad\u201ctaboo ratchet.\u201d Corporations in their turn are after profit, not civic uplift. He distrusts the idea that Google, Amazon and Facebook, for example, serve \u00adequally the values of free speech and good speech. His preferred answer to the more flagrant vices of liberty \u2014 hate speech, manipulative journalism, coarsened debate and a vast sewer of abuse on social media \u2014 is to encourage \u201cshared norms and practices that enable us to make best use of this essential freedom.\u201d", "In lesser hands, that recommendation might sound overabstract or simply pious. Garton Ash, \u00adhowever, applies and tests it in 10 chapters offering \u201ccomplex, contextual judgments\u201d that pretty well cover the field of present controversy. He writes with panache and understands the world he works in, especially the virtual world of the Net. Practical answers interest him more than doctrinal purity.

He performed with the National Ballet of Ukraine before moving to Canada to dance with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. It was there, under its artistic director, John Meehan, that he transformed as a dancer, performing works by George Balanchine, Frederick Ashton, Jerome Robbins and Twyla Tharp. He acquired speed and, he said, more turnout in the hips. He also learned how to push more from the floor for jumps.", "\u201cI did change quite fast I think,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took a year, and then I was completely opposed to the Russian school, which was not right of course, but it was my reaction. And then I learned how to see balance: good things and less good things on both sides.\u201d", "Mr. Royal, who has worked extensively with Mr. Ratmansky over the years, described his style as composed of many elements. \u201cExpressive, dramatic, demanding,\u201d he said. \u201cQuick feet, a very lush port de bras. He\u2019s always asking us to make his movements look more organic. To look more natural, but not necessarily at ease. It\u2019s organic in making it seamlessly fit with the music and the people you\u2019re dancing with onstage.\u201d", "Dancers in a Ratmansky piece form a society. There is an insistence that they must work together \u2014 performing with and for each other to immerse themselves into the perfume of each particular world.

He said that he doesn\u2019t see himself as any more American now: \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve changed much. Of course, my understanding of ballet is completely different from when I was at school.\u201d The loosening of the Iron Curtain, as he put it, changed much for Mr. Ratmansky. \u201cWe started to get information, and that really made a big impact on me,\u201d he said. Even now, he added, \u201cI love Google Books.\u201d", "Mr. Ratmansky may make his home in America, but he has something that can\u2019t be taken away: a kind of Russian poetry, and a reverence for ballet history. His reconstructions of \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty\u201d and, more recently, \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d performed in February by the Zurich Ballet, are just as important in advancing the classical form as his new productions. (Of all his reconstructions, he said, he has a soft spot for \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d)", "Mastering the Stepanov notation \u2014 a system of recording dance that dates to the turn of the 20th century \u2014 took time, but, he said, \u201cIt opened the treasury room for me.\u201d", "He has inserted vintage steps into recent ballets; there will be some in his Bernstein premiere. \u201cWhen I run out of steps, that gives me steps,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut I know that Petipa did a lot of that, and I know Balanchine did a lot of that. I believe that all choreographers do that. Petipa presented the works of his predecessors like Balanchine did with Petipa\u2019s ballets. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m stealing something.

Roberts of Comcast took in $27.5 million.", "Technology company chiefs also did well. Marissa A. Mayer of Yahoo was awarded $36 million. Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive of Salesforce, received a $33.4 million package. And Mr. Khosrowshahi of Expedia, the lucky high earner of 2015 according to Equilar, had compensation of $94.6 million. (Mr. Khosrowshahi is a director of The New York Times Company.) His package, reflecting a new five-and-a-half-year contract, was almost exclusively stock that vests over time, so much of its value is closely linked to Expedia\u2019s share price.", "Defenders of executive pay cite factors like those as evidence that seemingly astronomical rewards really don\u2019t add up to that much money. In a statement, Sarah Gavin, an Expedia spokeswoman, said Mr. Khosrowshahi \u201chas been a transformational C.E.O. for Expedia,\u201d adding that much of his compensation was structured to give him \u201can additional incentive to create long-term shareholder value.\u201d", "All told, tech and media C.E.O.s made up 17 of the highest-paid 30 spots on Equilar\u2019s list last year.", "According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data compiled by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the average worker in the United States who doesn\u2019t have management responsibility earns $36,875 a year. By that measure, the average chief executive on the Equilar list makes roughly 523 times the average worker salary.", "It\u2019s not a perfect comparison. Executive pay includes stock grants, often with multiyear payouts and performance targets, while low-paid workers rarely receive stock, let alone long-term incentive packages. Nonetheless, the discrepancy is stark. A bank teller at Wells Fargo making that average wage would have to work more than half a millennium, until 2539, to earn what that company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Stumpf, who made the average among chiefs on the Equilar list, earned last year.", "Incomplete as such ratios may be, chief executives will have to get used to them. Starting in 2018, companies will be required to disclose the ratio of their C.E.O.s\u2019 pay to the median compensation of their employees. The Securities and Exchange Commission will allow companies significant leeway when interpreting their own data, which could keep ratios down.", "In the interim, data from other sources offers a hint of what to expect. PayScale, a company that makes enterprise software, has surveyed more than 80,000 workers about their pay. Using that data, it is possible to roughly approximate ratios of the sort that the S.E.C. will soon require.", "The biggest gap between C.E.O. and worker pay was at Expedia, where Mr. Khosrowshahi made 993 times the median pay of his employees, as reported to PayScale. That is not so surprising given Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s enormous multiyear contract. But it held true even with Expedia\u2019s high median salary of $95,300.", "Perhaps more glaring was the discrepancy between the Walmart chief executive, C. Douglas McMillon, who made $19.4 million, nearly the average among the Equilar 200, and his workers, who reported a median salary of just $24,600. Mr. McMillon thus made 789 times the income of his median employee, using PayScale and Equilar data.", "Walmart said it had raised wages for more than 1.2 million employees in February. Mr. McMillon himself started as an hourly worker at Walmart and the company said that most of his compensation was based on company performance.", "Such huge gulfs between worker and executive pay are a recent phenomenon.

By 1989, chiefs were making 59 times what their average workers made; by 2000, they were making 383 times what the average workers made.", "\u201cIt\u2019s an eye-popping number,\u201d said Ms. Slavkin Corzo. \u201cThat means the typical worker would have to work for hundreds of years to make what a C.E.O. makes in one year.\u201d", "Eye-popping as such numbers may be, compensation specialists don\u2019t expect the S.E.C.\u2019s ratio rule to change these disparities very much. But Mr. Johnson said it might embarrass retailers like Walmart. \u201cIt will throw another log on the fire, but I don\u2019t think it will have a huge impact,\u201d he said.", "Being the chief executive of a big publicly traded company isn\u2019t the only way to get paid these days.", "Masimo, a small medical device company with a market value of just $2.4 billion and annual sales of about $630 million, saw fit to award its chief executive, Joe Kiani, $119.2 million in cash and stock. Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise technology company with just under $1 billion in sales, awarded its chief executive, Mark D. McLaughlin, $66.6 million. And Paul J. Taubman, an investment banker who recently took his firm, PJT Partners, public, received a package composed almost entirely of stock worth $75.5 million.

Big companies employ thousands of people and generate billions in sales. Competition for top executive talent is intense, especially in today\u2019s global marketplace. From that perspective, Mr. Kaplan said: \u201cIn this day and age, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly overpaid.\u201d", "And chief executive pay declined in 2015, according to the Equilar 200, which included companies with $1 billion in revenue, not $1 billion in market capitalization, as was the case last year. Cash compensation fell to $6 million on average, compared with $6.9 million in 2014, while stock and option awards slumped to $13.3 million, down from $15.7 million in 2014. Some executives with large stock holdings felt a twinge when their company\u2019s share price fell.", "But it is too soon to call this decline a trend. In 2012, after years of steady increases, average pay dipped 10 percent. What followed were two years of strong gains, until last year. And for all the talk about measures designed to incentivize long-term performance, many chief executives took home enormous cash bonuses, which do little to promote foresight. Mr. Moonves got $23.7 million in cash, while Mr. Dauman received $18.3 million.", "What is more, when executive compensation is compared with worker salaries, today\u2019s pay packages seem gargantuan.", "Seen in this light, the compensation committees that set C.E.O. pay are orchestrating a large-scale transfer of wealth to a few hundred individuals \u2014 most of them men, most of them white.", "Previous efforts to rein in executive pay haven\u2019t yielded many results. So-called \u201csay on pay measures,\u201d which let investors voice their opinions on executive pay, have had little effect.

Dissociation kicks in, mercifully and efficiently, almost like a response of the immune system, as well as a twisted, desperate desire on the part of the victim to please the rapist, in the desperate hope of a quicker conclusion, a better chance for survival. And yet, while these reactions appear to be almost universal, their emotional wake is intensely personal, possessing \u2014 at times obsessing \u2014 each individual in a unique way. Consider, for example, these two memoirs, which explore the 20-year aftermath of being raped by a stranger.", "\u201cJane Doe January,\u201d by the crime novelist Emily Winslow, chronicles in relentless detail the drama of the justice system\u2019s attempt to indict her rapist after matching DNA evidence is finally secured. Her story reveals a stark, maddening \u00adreality: that rape victims must often become their own legal advocates if they want an \u00adopportunity for retribution. In Winslow\u2019s case, this required more than 20 years of persistent inquiry before the scattered legal and forensic components of her 1992 rape coalesced into something the police and prosecutors were able to pursue.", "During her junior year at Carnegie Mellon University, Winslow was sexually assaulted by a man who followed her into her apartment building. Less than a year later, a man raped another young woman in the same Pittsburgh neighborhood; thus the two victims became Jane Doe January and Jane Doe November. In the decades that followed, Winslow would encounter a revolving door of detectives, reacquainting them with her case, keeping it alive mostly through her own persistence. By pure luck, a friend of the second victim reached an aggressive detective, who was able to match the DNA sample in the women\u2019s evidence kits to a man named Arthur Fryar.", "Fryar had also been convicted of rape in the 1970s, but it was a 2002 drug conviction that put his DNA into the system. By the time Winslow learns this, she is living in Cambridge, England, now happily married and the mother of two sons. As she assembles a detailed composite of the rapist\u2019s legal profile, she returns again and again to the same official documents. Yet she is wary of researching Fryar\u2019s personal life, content with surface-skimming Google searches and speculation drawn from the Facebook pages of his sister and his supposed girlfriend.", "Surprisingly, given Winslow\u2019s career writing crime fiction, there\u2019s nothing novelistic about the way this memoir unfolds. The detectives and prosecutors who emerge as significant supporting characters are given scant descriptions. Settings are all but invisible. Instead, the focus is on the finer points of law enforcement procedure, with every excruciating moment of the process painstakingly recounted. While much of this is bureaucratic, even tedious, Winslow attempts to inject drama with explosive bits of dialogue and many short, declarative stand-alone sentences, a device repeated to diminishing effect.", "Eventually, the judicial bureaucracy begins to seem almost as destructive as the rapist. Winslow must confront issues like extradition, statutory limits and sentencing guidelines. She must endure lab tests and postponements of the legal proceedings. During all this, she must go through the motions of her daily life in England. She fixates on what she should wear at the trial, how tightly she should try to harness her emotions, how she might be judged as a victim: \u201cBeing angry was appropriate. A jury, though, or a more formal judge, is more likely to reward sadness in a victim and disapprove of anger.\u201d", "Winslow channels her rage into this meticulously constructed and ultimately terrifying memoir. In the end, writing it proves a necessary release since the proceedings hit a roadblock: A Supreme Court decision overrides the Pennsylvania law on extending the statute of limitations, and the rape charges are withdrawn. Arthur Fryar is a free man.", "In \u201cI Will Find You,\u201d Joanna Connors, a reporter for The Cleveland Plain Dealer with a college-age daughter, embarks on a quest to understand the man who raped her two decades earlier, a crime she had never discussed with her children. Using her journalistic skills, she sets out to investigate the world that produced a man capable of such an act. The result is a searing narrative that plumbs both emotional and political depths.", "Like Winslow, Joanna Connors is a white woman raped by a black man, but this fact, largely ignored in Winslow\u2019s memoir, becomes a point of serious moral and political inquiry in Connors\u2019s \u201cI Will Find You.\u201d In July 1984, Connors, then a drama critic for The Plain Dealer, walked into an empty theater on the Case Western Reserve campus, late for a 5 o\u2019clock interview. Claiming to be working the lights, a man in the lobby offered to take her inside. Ignoring her internal alarm, Connors followed him, and there the man (who had been released on parole just a week earlier) raped her at knife point. Asked why she went with him, Connors privately, and with great shame, admits to herself, \u201cI could not allow myself to be the white woman who fears black men.\u201d Despite being \u201cthe perfect victim\u201d (white, educated, middle-class, married, with proof of a struggle and an immediate police report) and her perpetrator, David Francis, the perfect assailant (black, poor, with a criminal record), she is subjected to painful scrutiny and degradation before he is finally convicted.", "Connors\u2019s forthright exploration of race and poverty enlarges her personal story, turning it into a richer, more complex and ultimately more harrowing account of interwoven traumas. David Francis, she discovers, was one of eight children born into a family that one surviving member describes as \u201ccursed.\u201d That\u2019s as apt an explanation as any other: When Connors interviews some of Francis\u2019 siblings and family friends, she confronts a dizzying intersection of addiction, alcoholism, violence, racism, poverty and crime. (Even small children can\u2019t escape: In this extended family not one but two toddlers are killed, one by violence, the other through gross negligence.) What\u2019s miraculous about this memoir is Connors\u2019s ability to identify, in clean, lucid prose, evidence of hope \u2014 and even beauty \u2014 amid such an abundance of misery.", "In searching for the reasons the man who raped her became such a monster, Connors hoped to find freedom from the PTSD that haunted her for so long. She discovers instead a complicated web of tragedy connecting her family and his, a discovery that deepens her sense of compassion and allows her finally to heal. Winslow hasn\u2019t been granted the luxury of such closure. Her memoir illuminates the many ways in which legal and criminal institutions succeed in deepening the sense of violation, helplessness and anguish felt by the survivors of rape. Together both books serve as powerful evidence of our society\u2019s failure to address the \u00adcauses and consequences of sexual violence.", "JANE DOE JANUARY\nMy Twenty-Year Search for Truth and Justice\nBy Emily Winslow\n279 pp. William Morrow/ HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.\nI WILL FIND YOU\nBy Joanna Connors\n256 pp. Atlantic Monthly Press. $25."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/technology/twitter-appoints-debra-lee-adding-diversity-to-its-board.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter has a new board member who fits the company\u2019s mantra of diversification.", "On Monday, the social media company said that Debra Lee, chairman and chief executive of BET Networks, was joining its board.

He recently answered questions about the building and its chair.", "This interview has been edited and condensed.", "Q. How is Via 57 West different from other apartment buildings?", "A. The building is about creating that corner, and the courtyard. Because of the extreme asymmetry, the southwest corner is the height of a handrail and the northeast corner is the height of a high-rise.", "The courtyard building is at the architectural scale what Central Park is at the urban scale \u2014 an oasis in the middle of the city. It\u2019s communal. I have a feeling that this building will function a little like a social condenser. It might actually be a building where you get to know your neighbors.", "Q. Why design a chair to go with it?", "A. We thought there would be something fun about doing it for this project. Arne Jacobsen, the Danish architect \u2014 some of his nicest work was designed for the Royal Hotel in Copenhagen, including the Swan and the Egg chair. It was Fritz Hansen who did that. We came up with this idea of Scan-American: If Scandinavia is known for this very simple aesthetic, then American, in the clich\u00e9 way, could be about comfort. Our first design was almost the idea of a beanbag chair with skinny legs.", "Q. How did the building inspire it?", "A. It\u2019s not like we wanted the chair to look like the building, or vice versa. In the courtyard, it\u2019s really open to one side and really well defined to the other side, which makes it cozy. The chair has a little bit of that. It\u2019s an interesting hybrid that\u2019s neither an armchair nor just a seat \u2014 it has a little bit of both.", "Q. Will the chairs be used in the building?", "A. Yes, there are going to be a handful of them in all of the common areas. Then, hopefully, it gets a life on its own. Just like the Swan: Even though it was designed for the Royal Hotel, it\u2019s not like it needs to only be there.", "Q. But is there something about it that works particularly well there?", "A. What I think works well is that it groups together quite nicely. As free-standing lobby or living room furniture, it almost forms a mini-sofa. You have quite a variety of seating possibilities.", "Q. What\u2019s happening with your other projects in New York?", "A. We\u2019re starting up on the second phase of the BIG U.

You put green space in a lot of your buildings, both residential and commercial. Why?", "A. When we came here six years ago, this idea of outdoor space \u2014 and even balconies in a rental building \u2014 wasn\u2019t really seen as contributing a lot of value. But now, for both residential and office, outdoor space has become increasingly in demand. With the Spiral, every floor has a little dedicated outdoor space. At 2 World Trade Center, it\u2019s like six plazas or parks.", "Q. You sound very busy. When did you find time to design a chair?", "A. The funny thing is that you would expect designing a chair is easy compared to designing a house. But it pretty much took the same amount of time to design, permit and build Via as it took to design, develop and manufacture the Via chair. It\u2019s kind of shocking.", "Q. So why do it?", "A.

The rule has received a groundswell of support from a bipartisan group of former S.E.C. commissioners, state treasurers and law professors, and has generated more than one million public comments.", "Defenders of the status quo argue the companies are simply exercising their right to free speech; critics contend that such speech, when anonymous, does immense harm to the democratic process.", "But as lawyers who specialize in investor rights, we see another critical, nonpartisan reason to support the rule: When it comes to political spending, companies are often not as informed as one might think \u2014 especially when it comes to dark money.", "By mandating disclosure, the rule would allow investors to serve as a potential check on risky political donations, and help investors determine whether a company\u2019s political spending habits make its shares a good investment in the first place.", "In theory, a company gives money to influence politics in its favor.

One major reason is that the very nature of dark-money giving means that investors have virtually no information about it, and therefore cannot hold companies accountable for their mistakes.", "Political spending is considered an ordinary business expense under corporate law, which means that companies have no obligation to disclose it to shareholders (and rarely do so voluntarily). It is therefore impossible for investors to track dark-money spending, at best learning about it long after the fact from watchdog groups and investigative journalists.", "The rule wouldn\u2019t restrict the companies\u2019 right to give money, and there may be instances where political spending is a smart move.

Which is a very savvy approach to self-promotion.", "\u201cZero to One\u201d distills lectures from a class about start-ups that Thiel taught at Stanford in 2012, based on the scribblings of his former student Blake Masters, who is credited with a writing assist and who capably narrates the book. The lessons of Thiel\u2019s course are too important to be limited to a few lucky undergraduates, we are told in the preface: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon Valley.\u201d", "So what future-shaping advice does Thiel have for the next generation of entrepreneurs? First, competition is expensive, risky, and it invariably reduces profits. So your goal is not to dream up a company in a field that already exists and then fight for market share. No, the smart move is to found a business in a still unimagined realm \u2014 an act of creation that Thiel, a serial catchphrase coiner, calls \u201cgoing from zero to one.\u201d", "Once you\u2019ve pioneered a new industry, you and your colleagues should set your sights on a very specific goal: building a monopoly. \u201cWhereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price,\u201d Thiel tells us, \u201ca monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices.\u201d Thiel\u2019s favorite example is Google, which all but invented the online \u00adadvertising market and has dominated it for years.", "As advice goes, \u201cCreate the next Google\u201d is both unassailable and perfectly useless. Thiel glancingly acknowledges that the type of start-up he is describing is rare, but the fortune he made at PayPal, and later as an investor in Facebook, has apparently convinced him that the exceptional would be far more common if people were just bolder and more imaginative. He makes this and other points in brief chapters packed with references to Pythagoras, the Unabomber, Tolkien, Karl Marx, Jim Morrison, \u00adNietzsche, John Rawls and Shakespeare. In interviews and speeches, Thiel has displayed a sense of humor that would have been helpful here. Listening to this five-hour production is like getting stuck at a dinner party beside a guy whose money and surfeit of ideas has convinced him that he should do all the talking.", "It takes a while to figure out the real point of \u201cGood \u00adProfit: How Creating Value for Others Built One of the World\u2019s Most Successful Companies,\u201d by Charles Koch, the chief executive of Koch Industries. The preface, narrated by Koch himself \u2014 Paul Michael, whose voice you might recall from \u201cThe Da Vinci Code\u201d audiobook, handles the rest \u2014 is a folksy origins story, traced to the family patriarch, Fred Koch, a \u201cJohn Wayne-type\u201d chemical engineer. The younger Koch, now 80 years old, quickly segues into the tale of the astounding growth of the company, which currently employs some 100,000 people in fields as varied as oil, ranching and commodities trading. One thousand dollars invested in this privately held behemoth in 1960, Koch states, would be worth $5 million today.", "The secret? Market-Based Management, Koch says, which turns out to be a perfectly sensible, five-part framework for making decisions about hiring, firing and managing a company. But that framework was the subject of Koch\u2019s 2007 book, \u201cThe Science of Success.\u201d So what we have here is a rehash and, at a running time that exceeds nine hours, quite a slog, despite Michael\u2019s comfortingly authoritative voice. The bulk of \u201cGood \u00adProfit\u201d is self-\u00adevident truths that have been repackaged as wisdom. Typical is this mouthful from a chapter called \u201cIncentives\u201d: \u201cEvery company should strive to leverage incentives to motivate all employees to fully develop and apply their capabilities to maximize long-term value for the company in a principled way.\u201d", "O.K. Did someone suggest otherwise?", "The liveliest part of \u201cGood Profit,\u201d and arguably its reason for being, is a series of homilies in favor of free markets and against corporate welfare and special pleading of any kind. Profit that is \u201cgood\u201d is earned honestly, without favors from the government. Giving a counterexample, Koch denounces a 2014 French law intended to aid independent bookstores by banning online booksellers from offering free shipping. \u201cArtificially propping up businesses is bad for consumers,\u201d he writes, \u201cand ultimately bad for the employees of those businesses, since change is inevitable.\u201d", "There is hardly a hint here that Koch and his younger brother David are among the most politically active executives in American history. Together, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars backing candidates who stand against regulations and taxes. By the midterm elections of 2010, according to Jane Mayer\u2019s book \u201cDark Money,\u201d these efforts yielded astounding results. Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives and Republicans gained 675 seats in state legislatures across the country.", "Given that Koch Industries is among the country\u2019s leading producers of toxic waste and has spent millions settling cases in federal court, these guys are not exactly disinterested parties. No, they don\u2019t lobby politicians. They just have them replaced. Whether you think this strategy leads to \u201cgood profit\u201d depends on where you stand politically. But Koch\u2019s very hands-on role in American politics is a bizarre omission in a book about the intersection of business and government.", "\u201cTeam of Teams,\u201d by retired Gen.

It works as a calling card for his consulting firm, McChrystal Group, which brings \u201clessons from the battlefield to the boardroom,\u201d as the company\u2019s website says. The book is also a history of one of his great victories: the pursuit and eventual killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the elusive and sociopathic leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq.", "Unfortunately, McChrystal the consultant keeps interrupting McChrystal the general. After every twist and complication in the al-Zarqawi story, we pause so that some theoretical concept \u2014 usually related to how groups are organized, and how McChrystal tinkered with command structure in Iraq \u2014 can be illustrated with a historical anecdote. Thus we get a potted biography of Frederick Taylor, the father of industrial efficiency; an account of NASA in its moonshot era; the story of Horatio Nelson\u2019s victory at Trafalgar; and mini-lectures on subjects as diverse as game theory and the Navy SEALs.", "McChrystal turns up to narrate five-minute summaries at the end of each chapter (Paul Michael, once again, handles everything else). No doubt these are meant as refreshers, but they make you wonder if this hybrid of management course and combat memoir really needs to be 12 hours long. That\u2019s especially true when McChrystal describes his great \u201caha\u201d moment in the battle against Al Qaeda in Iraq: \u201cWe realized that our goal was not the creation of one massive team. We needed to create a team of teams.\u201d He means an organization in which groups from different fiefs, like the C.I.A. and the Army Special Forces, work together, rather than in competitive silos.", "That\u2019s the big reveal. Which is heartbreaking, because right after September 11 it was obvious that the intelligence agencies hadn\u2019t been communicating. McChrystal addresses this failure in a section called \u201cSharing.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t explain how lessons of that calamity could have been forgotten a few years later, let alone stand as the \u00adtitle-worthy insight of this overstuffed audiobook.", "ZERO TO ONE\nNotes on Startups; Or, How to Build the Future\nBy Peter Thiel with Blake Masters\nRead by Blake Masters\n5 hours.

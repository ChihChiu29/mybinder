The road leads to Martin\u2019s Beach, once a revered hideaway for surfers, fishers and beachgoers drawn by its isolation, dramatic cliffs and sweep of soft sand.", "But these days, the future of this hidden beach on the San Francisco Peninsula is being fought in a courthouse 25 miles away, in a battle that has become the latest class-charged standoff involving a wealthy entrepreneur in this polarized part of California. Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, paid $37.5 million in 2008 for a 53-acre parcel of ocean land that includes the beach and the road \u2014 and proceeded to close the gate, posting armed guards and signaling that he was prepared to spend what it takes to keep the public off what he contends is private land.", "\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Talk about entitlement: Rich people think they can get away with anything,\u2019 \u201d said Rob Caughlan, the former president of the Surfrider Foundation, the nonprofit organization that brought the suit. \u201cAll we want is to get Khosla to follow the same law as everyone else does.\u201d", "Mr. Khosla, who is best known as a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, declined a request for an interview. One of his lawyers, Jeffrey Essner, said the have-and-have-not argument had hijacked, at least in public perception, what he described as a cut-and-dried case about private property rights. \u201cIt\u2019s being sensationalized in the media to focus on populist sentiments and the 1 percent,\u201d he said.", "California is a state with many beautiful beaches and almost as many millionaires who want their own beachfront homes, and this is hardly the first fight to be fought over an ocean view. But by every measure, this one has taken on added resonance, taking place against the backdrop of tensions in San Francisco caused by the influx of high-paid Silicon Valley executives and embodied by the Google buses that take them to work each day.", "The lawsuit being fought at the San Mateo County Courthouse \u2014 a decision is expected in the summer \u2014 signals the latest stage in a five-year flurry of litigation, protests, civil disobedience, indignation and arrests, aimed at forcing Mr. Khosla, who does not live on the property, to let people back on the beach (which is variously called Martin\u2019s Beach and Martins Beach). His opponents contend he is defying the State Constitution, state law and the mind-set of \u201cthe beach belongs to everyone\u201d that is fundamental to many Californians.", "Compelled by a judge to testify, Mr. Khosla said on the stand: \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me why any gate is locked, it\u2019s to restrict public access. That\u2019s a general statement about gates.\u201d", "While the previous owner of Martin\u2019s Beach gave people access to the beach for a fee, Mr. Khosla has put up a forbidding gate, albeit a low one that can be sidestepped. While a few surfers and bathers do trespass and use the beach, some have been arrested, the surfers say, though fewer recently as the dispute has heated up.", "The fight has moved to Sacramento as well. Last month, the California Senate approved a bill that would permit the state to use the power of eminent domain to seize enough land to provide a public passageway to the beach. Next, the bill will be considered by the Assembly, where it faces an uncertain future. \u201cThe coast is protected, and when somebody does something that\u2019s going to affect that, there\u2019s going to be a reaction \u2014 and a strong one,\u201d said the sponsor of the bill, Jerry Hill, a Democratic state senator from San Mateo.", "An earlier court challenge to Mr. Khosla failed when a San Mateo judge ruled that the Constitution, which declares that all property below the mean tide line is public, and a 1976 law mandating that property owners provide access to these beaches were superseded by the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The treaty ended the Mexican-American War by requiring that the United States recognize Mexican land grants, including one that awarded rights to this plot well before the Constitution was adopted.", "This latest case is in some ways more narrow: The Surfrider Foundation contends that under the Coastal Act of 1976, Mr. Khosla was required to obtain a permit from the California Coastal Commission before he blocked access to the beach.", "\u201cThis is not a rocket-science case,\u201d said Joe Cotchett, the lawyer representing the Surfrider Foundation. \u201cThis is a case all about arrogance. This is a case where a multibillionaire \u2014 not a millionaire, a billionaire \u2014 has just decided to build a castle on that beach, and the public is going to be barred.\u201d", "Mr. Khosla said at the trial that he did not have a plan in mind for the property. Dori L. Yob, another of his lawyers, called the case \u201ca property right issue just like any other \u2014 just like you or I would want to protect our private property rights.\u201d She added, \u201cJust because where your house sits used to be a public beach doesn\u2019t mean people can walk through your backyard while you are having breakfast.\u201d", "The presumption of opening the beach is powerful in California. About six miles up the road from the beach, the Ritz-Carlton, a lush complex of golf courses and high-end living overlooking the Pacific, provides free \u201ccoastal access\u201d parking and a marked trail leading to the beach.", "Down south in Malibu, outside Los Angeles, beach advocates fought successfully with David Geffen, the billionaire who owns a home on Broad Beach, to force him to open a gate leading down to the ocean. Jenny Price, one of the leaders of that coastal access battle, said, \u201cIt\u2019s tricky, because I realize this is private property, but the Constitution requires that the public have access to the public beach.\u201d", "A walk down Martin\u2019s Beach Road reveals about 40 or more weathered beach shacks nestled around the water, most of them leased through 2021, with names like Cozy Cabin and Casa Blanca. On a recent morning, there was not a person in sight on the beach.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a gem; it\u2019s beyond compare,\u201d said Pete McCloskey, a Republican former member of Congress who represented the area and is involved in the court battle.", "Although Mr. McCloskey and others said they assumed that Mr. Khosla had bought the land intending to bulldoze the cottages and build something newer and grander, he testified that was not necessarily so. \u201cI bought the beach, but I had no plan for the beach,\u201d Mr. Khosla said.", "To some, Mr. Khosla\u2019s actions seem particularly surprising because he has been closely identified with advocating green technology.", "\u201cI thought Khosla was going to be a good guy,\u201d said Mr. Caughlan of the Surfrider Foundation, who once posed with Mr. Khosla for a photograph in an environment issue of Vanity Fair with a group of men on the California coastline. \u201cWhen he bought Martin\u2019s Beach, I thought, \u2018Oh great, an environmentalist bought that beach.\u2019 And then he cut off access to everyone and we went, \u2018What? Where did that come from?\u2019 \u201d"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/26/googles-grand-plans-a-conversation-with-googles-larry-page-and-sundar-pichai/": ["Shortly after Google\u2019s keynote presentation at the company\u2019s developer conference on Wednesday, I was ushered into a green room backstage at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.", "As workers broke down the huge conference stage around us \u2014 with the lights flickering on and off, somewhat apocalyptically \u2014 I spent a half hour talking to Larry Page, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s senior vice president in charge of Android and Chrome. Sergey Brin, who founded Google with Mr. Page, popped in and out of the room but did not take part in the interview.", "We chatted about Google\u2019s efforts to usher in the multidevice future of computing, and the challenges it may face in that task. We also discussed how Google\u2019s ambitions might alter its image.", "I wrote a column about some of our discussion, but Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai made other comments that are also worth airing. Here is a fuller, though edited transcript of the discussion:", "One of the themes here is that Android is going to be a platform for more than phones \u2014 you want to have it in multiple devices. What\u2019s the long-term vision for how Google services will be in different devices?", "Mr. Page: That\u2019s a very broad question. We\u2019ve been talking about a multiscreen world for a long time. I think you see it culminating in something that\u2019s a great experience across lots of different kinds of devices, from the watch to the TV to the laptop to the tablet to the phone.", "But I think there\u2019s much more to do. I think it\u2019s exciting to see developers \u2014 if we\u2019re reasonably clever and thoughtful about what we do, we can get experiences that make sense to users and are reasonably easy for developers to implement.", "How useful is the multiscreen world now?", "Mr. Page: More and more of my time is on phones \u2014 though also it\u2019s nice to use a big screen and have something plugged in. Some of the basic things we\u2019ve done like Chrome tab synchronization and the ability to access your email across devices, we take those things for granted, but if you use them 100 times a day it\u2019s a really important thing.", "Mr. Pichai: I also think we are just at the beginning stages. Today, computing mainly automates things for you. But there\u2019s an evolution from, today we tell computers to do stuff for us, to where computers can actually do stuff for us. For example, if I go and pick up my kids, it would be good for my car to be aware that my kids have entered the car and change the music to something that\u2019s appropriate for them.", "What are the hurdles in that path?", "Mr. Page: Like anything, it\u2019s just work. It\u2019s easier to talk about things than do them.", "Do you worry that the more devices we have that are connected to Google, there\u2019s not just a privacy question but also something like creepiness?", "Mr. Page: I think that the Internet and mobile devices in general is changing people\u2019s lives a lot. And we\u2019re feeling that. Everyone can tell that their lives are going to be affected, but we don\u2019t quite know how yet, because we\u2019re not using these things \u2014 and because of that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. I think we\u2019ll figure that out and we\u2019ll get products, services and technologies that really benefit people a lot, and that make their lives significantly better. And as we do that people will understand those \u2014 and then there\u2019ll be the next set of things.", "You\u2019re saying the usefulness of the products will change how people feel about them?", "Mr. Page: Yeah, and we know that if we talk about things before people see them, there\u2019s a much more negative reaction. That\u2019s one of the things we learned. It\u2019s really important for people to be able to experience products; otherwise you fear the worst without seeing those benefits.", "I\u2019m not trying to minimize the issues. For me, I\u2019m so excited about the possibilities to improve things for people, my worry would be the opposite. We get so worried about these things that we don\u2019t get the benefits. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in health care. We\u2019ve decided, through regulation largely, that data is so locked up that it can\u2019t be used to benefit people very well.", "Right now we don\u2019t data-mine health care data. If we did we\u2019d probably save 100,000 lives next year. I\u2019m very worried that the media and governments will try to stoke the people\u2019s fears and we\u2019ll end up in a state where we could benefit a lot of people but we\u2019re not able to do that. That\u2019s the likely outcome.", "What can you do about that?", "Mr. Page: I think talking about it \u2014 being honest that these things are going to change people\u2019s lives, these are major issues we should be talking about. But not trying to sensationalize it and figuring out how to have a good dialogue about the issues that are out there.", "I would encourage people to have an open mind, and to look to the future with a sense of optimism.", "You bought Nest and Dropcam recently. But you also sold Motorola. What are your thoughts on Google\u2019s approach to building hardware?", "Mr. Pichai: When Larry and Sergey founded Google Search, one of the things that struck me is that it was available for everyone to use. We deeply desire our services to work for everyone. And that inherently means we have to work with partners. That is the thesis underlying everything we do.", "Mr. Page: That\u2019s why our services work on iOS.", "Mr. Pichai: We do hardware when we think we need to guide the industry, which is why we do things like Nexus. Philosophically we\u2019re deeply committed to working on an ecosystem at scale.", "So where do Nest and Dropcam fit in?", "Mr. Page: Nest has a very strong team. I\u2019ve had home control stuff since 10 years ago. I was installing various things and it never quite worked. It\u2019s a nascent market. I think Nest is able to lead that ecosystem. At the early stages, that\u2019s what you see.", "Mr. Pichai: Nest is one vertical implementation of a set of smart products for the home. But we will support other people\u2019s smart products for the home.", "Was there some part of the Nest acquisition that was aimed at improving Google hardware generally \u2014 they\u2019re good at hardware, and you need that expertise for other Google hardware?", "Mr. Page: A lot has been written about that, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the primary motivation. It was a pretty expensive company. They have a lot of product traction, which seemed important to us. The idea that we want to distract them from that doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.", "What we got with Nest was a complete, functioning company and brand in an important, emerging area, that\u2019s doing really well.", "What\u2019s going on with Google Plus?", "Mr. Page: I think there\u2019s a lot of things going on with Google Plus. I\u2019m a very excited user of it. You saw some demos showing how it works with Chromecast \u2014 that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ve been excited about. The service has been growing tremendously. People are always like, \u201cOh, what\u2019s going on?\u201d But for us, we\u2019re superexcited about it because it\u2019s a big service, growing continuously, since we launched it, at a high rate, and we\u2019re making it better and better every day.", "Is \u201csocial\u201d as important to you now as it was two years ago?", "Mr. Page: Yes, if anything, probably more important. We have a very excited, dedicated community. People forget we\u2019re able to make our services better by understanding your relationships, making sharing work and understanding identity. These are deep and important things for us as a company.", "When people ask about Google Plus they think about it as, \u201cI\u2019m going to the stream.\u201d For us, Google Play reviews are part of Google Plus, too. We see all those things growing and being important for us.", "I wanted to ask about the European \u201cright-to-forget\u201d ruling. What was your reaction to that?", "Mr. Page:  \u201cRight to be forgotten.\u201d You can\u2019t forget, but you can be forgotten. I think in general the issues about how you might be represented online when people search for you is an important issue. To date, we\u2019ve said we\u2019ll try our best to represent the things that are out there on the Internet about you. It\u2019s worked for 15-plus years. It makes a lot of sense. We\u2019re a search engine. It seems like we should represent what\u2019s in the world.", "So it was a pretty surprising ruling \u2014 it\u2019s a different statement. You guys are now in charge of editing what\u2019s out there in the world. In the past that\u2019s not a responsibility we felt we had. I think given that\u2019s the ruling, we\u2019ve obviously said we\u2019re going to start complying with that. We\u2019re going to start removing some stuff pretty quickly \u2014 I think in the next week. We\u2019re obviously going to try to do the best job we can.", "I think it would have been better to have more of a discussion about what to do and how to do it. We could have arrived at a more practical place than a court ruling. The previous system, where content is removed at the source of publishing, means that once it\u2019s removed there, it\u2019s removed for all other services. Whereas with the ruling, it has to be removed from all services \u2014 so if you\u2019re an aggrieved user, you have to get your information removed from many sites that have that data. That doesn\u2019t seem very practical.", "I want to return again to this idea of Google\u2019s image. There were a couple of protests here. There have been protests about Google buses.", "Mr. Page: We\u2019re in San Francisco, so we expect that.", "Do you think it\u2019s just that? One of the things that\u2019s happening in the world is that people are worried about technology and how it\u2019s changing our lives \u2014 is this a manifestation of that worry?", "Mr. Page: I\u2019m sure that people are worried about that. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s contributing to it. But I do think there are serious issues in San Francisco. There\u2019s a rich history of protest in San Francisco. I think some of the issues \u2014 we have complaints about some things that are not that related to the company. To some extent we\u2019re being used as a way to attract attention. We had protests about the C.I.A. and I don\u2019t know what else, but it didn\u2019t make any sense to me with respect to the company. As a big company we\u2019re a target for some of these things. But I think people have legitimate issues with it as well.", "Mr. Pichai: We\u2019re doing a lot about it as well. There are a host of initiatives for the city. I think in some ways it\u2019s good that there\u2019s an open debate about it and I think we needed it.

As I go around America \u2014 indeed, as I go around the world \u2014 this is among the biggest questions out there today. Everyone senses that something is up \u2014 something has changed in the world of technology that is changing every job, every workplace, every institution \u2014 but no one is explaining it to people, let alone giving them the guidance they need for how to navigate this new era. That is what we hope to do today.", "And by the way, what people are sensing is right. Data released the other day by the Federal Reserve revealed that 44 percent of young college graduates in 2012 were working in jobs that didn\u2019t require a college degree, up from 38 percent before the recession in 2007. Think about that: Nearly half the people who have either paid out or gone into debt to cover tuitions of $10,000, $50,000 or $250,000 to get a college degree are not working in a job that requires it.", "Houston, we have a problem.", "No doubt, a big part of the explanation is traceable to the sharp drop-off in demand for labor that accompanied the 2008 Great Recession. But I would argue that something else is going on and it is this: The Great Recession coincided with a Great Inflection \u2013 a huge technological shift of Gutenberg-scale proportions in how the world is wired, in what machines can now do in terms of substituting for human labor and in how many people around the world can compete for any job. And this technological shift is roiling the job market.", "For starters, it is wiping out what sustained the American middle class for the six decades after World War II \u2013 the high-wage, middle-skilled job. There is no such thing anymore. There is only a high-wage, high-skilled job.

It is being pulled up, out and down \u2013 all at the same time. How so?

But what is it exactly? We know the answer is more and better education. But what does that look like in a classroom? We know it will require each of us to learn and relearn more often. But how?

We know that our kids are likely to work in many more jobs than we ever had to, but how does one go about applying and interviewing for a job that was just invented last week?", "I think before the day is over many of you may come to the same conclusion I have. We need a whole new social contract, a whole public private partnership for this new world, because more will be on you. The way I like to put it is that we are now in a 401(k) world. We have gone from a world of \u201cdefined benefits\u201d \u2014 just do your job every day, show up, be average and here are the benefits you will get \u2014 into a world of \u201cdefined contributions\u201d \u2014 your wages and returns will now be more and more directly correlated to you exact contribution, and with big data we will get better and better at measuring just that every day.", "If you turn on late-night TV or look at the subway ads, there are lot of people who will tell you how to invest your 401(k).

So here is some sample dialogue, by way of introduction. Humphrey, an older man with a heavy Russian accent, is explaining Russian history to Tooly, an eager 10-year-old girl who will grow up to become the book\u2019s tough, quick-witted main character and the most important person in Humphrey\u2019s life.", "\u201cThere is long tradition,\u201d Humphrey begins. \u201cFirst, we must have bald leader. After, hairy leader. Bald, then hairy. Czar Alexander II, he is bald. Then, Nicholas II. He got hair. Next comes Lvov. Bald like cucumber. Then Kerensky. Lots of hair. Lenin is very bald. Who must come next? Stalin.\u201d", "\u201cHe was hairy?\u201d the girl asks.", "\u201cThis is reason he wins leadership battle. Trotsky also has fool head of hair, so it is close race. But Stalin has more. Also, he is more idiot. So he wins. After hairy Stalin, they need bald. They look around Politburo and see Khrushchev \u2014 perfect! Then Brezhnev, also fool head of hair. Then Andropov: Bald. Chernenko: hair. Gorbachev: bald.\u201d", "\u201cWith the stain on his head?\u201d", "\u201cYes, but you don\u2019t make fun of. It\u2019s not nice.\u201d", "That conversation is held in 1988. Mr. Rachman zigzags from that year to 1999-2000 to 2011, as he tells the story of a woman who bears witness to decades of rapid cultural, political and technological changes. She is also someone who, by all rights, should not be able to get out of bed in the morning. Her own story is one of having no real home, being abandoned by parents and being passed from one companion to another. By having Tooly call all the adults in the book by their first names \u2014 since she is a conversational match for any of them \u2014 Mr. Rachman succeeds in keeping readers almost as baffled about her origins as she is.", "Besides, this novel is more ambitious than a mere family story. As in \u201cThe Imperfectionists,\u201d Mr. Rachman needs only a few well-drawn characters to fill a large canvas and an impressive swath of history. That book was about the life of a newspaper (with a strong resemblance to what was then called The International Herald Tribune) but also about a changing world. This one reaches from the eras of Humphrey\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d \u2014 all authors, including John Stuart Mill and Sir Isaac Newton (\u201cwe are like two peas in a pond\u201d) \u2014 to the age in which kids sit at the dinner table, watching videos, not having to know anything they can\u2019t Google.", "The richness of this book is more apparent once the reading is over. In other words, \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Great Powers\u201d is knottier than \u201cThe Imperfectionists,\u201d and more deliberately confusing. Tooly has no home, and she moves through the world with different traveling companions.", "First there is Paul, who takes her to Thailand from Australia and enrolls her in an odious international school. She has a fourth-grade teacher, Mr. Priddles, who heartily dislikes her and makes pronouncements like, \u201cTo say that someone called W. B. Yeats is \u2018better\u2019 than someone called Sting is a construct, basically.\u201d Luckily, Tooly is smart enough to educate herself.", "In 1999, she has just moved to New York with Humphrey, who has taken on the role of parent or companion to her. But at 21, Tooly is old enough to fend for herself. She is in the thrall of a smooth operator whose name, Venn, can\u2019t be coincidental; a set of Venn diagrams of how the book\u2019s characters overlap would reveal many secrets about its story. Venn protects Tooly, notably at the downtown haven for nerd geniuses he seems to be running; the place has a school bus as a fun bit of d\u00e9cor and has spawned many terrible start-up ideas and one that could be worth a fortune.", "Venn also teaches Tooly to check out college students\u2019 apartments by ringing doorbells, pretending each apartment was the one in which she grew up and then casing the place. This gives the book a set of glib students who get their opinions from cable news and whose superficial political debates give Mr. Rachman much to skewer. For all its serious points, this book is never too busy for hilarity. When someone insists on playing Prince\u2019s \u201c1999\u201d in that very year, one kid says: \u201cIf you party like it\u2019s 1999, we all leave, and you log on to a chat room with people from Finland.\u201d", "The Tooly of 2011 has settled down enough to own a small, failing but lovingly maintained bookstore on the Welsh side of the Welsh-English border. The place is lucky to sell a used copy of \u201cLand Snails of Britain,\u201d as it does on the book\u2019s opening page. And it has only one employee, who declaims at Tooly when she\u2019s trying to read and revels \u201cin pronouncing on grand issues, like the man of consequence he most certainly was not.\u201d She is a true bibliophile, a free spirit and a content Luddite when it comes to the computer age, and she seems to accept rootlessness as her natural state.", "But during the later parts of the novel, when it touches back down in 2011 and shows Tooly the true nature of all the adults she has known, there are scenes of breathtaking cruelty. Mr. Rachman doesn\u2019t milk them. He doesn\u2019t have to. This would be a much less potent book if it collapsed into a sob story.", "And Mr. Rachman means to balance the individual characters in this story with the ways the world changes them. As Humphrey, who instills Tooly with a sense of world history, puts it: \u201cI know what the 20th century has for breakfast. It is too much work getting to know new century.\u201d", "For a character who is more cynical, we now live a cyberhell that not even science fiction could have anticipated. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for having been swallowed by your times,\u201d this person tells Tooly. \u201cThey eat nearly everyone.\u201d", "THE RISE & FALL OF GREAT POWERS\nBy Tom Rachman\n384 pages.

He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case.", "\u201cISIS gets some money from outside donors, but that pales in comparison to their self-funding,\u201d said an American counterterrorism official. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of its money comes from criminal activities like extortion, kidnapping, robberies and smuggling. In Mosul, ISIS has probably been hauling in several million dollars monthly just from its extortion racket. In overrunning the town the group is better off financially, but probably to the tune of millions \u2014 not hundreds of millions \u2014 of dollars.\u201d", "While ISIS \u201cis among the wealthiest terrorist groups on the planet,\u201d the official said, \u201cit also has significant expenses.

It operates primitive refineries to make products for local use by ISIS\u2019s own fighters, but sells much of the crude to its enemy \u2014 the Syrian government.

Not surprisingly, cabdrivers who have enjoyed being part of tightly regulated cartels in cities like Madrid, Miami, London and Los Angeles do not much care for the San Francisco-based upstart that brings them new competition.", "But whether Uber will ultimately become the kind of wildly profitable company that will justify the valuation of $40 billion reportedly assigned to it by its latest funding round [this was $18.2 billion in June] doesn\u2019t come down to those regulatory battles. If the recent past is a guide, it will eventually win them.", "The question for Uber as a business boils down to two words: network effects.

It isn\u2019t much use being the only person to own a fax machine, or the only person to show up at a stock exchange. Things like these become more valuable the more widely they are embraced. Network effects are the key to the wild profitability of a firm like Microsoft; Windows and Office are hard to displace, even if a competitor offers a better, cheaper product, because Microsoft products are entrenched as an industry standard.", "And when one company controls a market with strong network effects, it can be one of the few sustainable ways to generate huge profits, holding on to customers and fending off competitors. The billion-dollar question is whether Uber\u2019s model for offering transportation services has some of the same network effects as those of great information industry monopolies (Microsoft, Google), or is more like, say, the travel website business, a brutally competitive industry of middlemen.", "Uber is itself a middleman, of course. On one side, it recruits drivers, who typically own or lease their cars. On the other side, it markets to consumers who may want a ride. Then it matches them up; the consumer orders a car, a driver accepts the request, the service is provided, and Uber charges the consumer\u2019s credit card.

Every driver wants to be part of the network with the most consumers, so that they spend more time driving and less time waiting for a call. Every consumer wants to use the service with the most drivers, to minimize the wait time when they need a ride. Uber, because it is first and biggest, will have both more users and better data with which to match up supply and demand.", "The bullish case for Uber, then, is that it rapidly becomes entrenched as the biggest, most vibrant marketplace for both buyers and sellers of ride services. Competitors may arise, offering lower commissions and better software, but the fact that everybody already uses Uber will make it impossible for them to get a toehold.", "But here\u2019s the negative case: That 20 percent commission is a big, honking target for competitors.

Uber would face the choice of matching the lower commissions (cutting into its profitability) or risk losing drivers and consumers to more favorable prices offered by others.", "You can imagine situations in which both consumers and drivers stick not with Uber but with whichever service offers the best deal at any given moment. Rather than automatically ordering a car through Uber, a person looking for a ride might check several competing services to see which has the closest car at the best price at that moment. Drivers might sign up with multiple services, and take rides that will offer them the highest pay at any given time. Aggregation services like Kayak might even spring up, allowing riders to instantly compare the prices and wait times on offer.", "Note that this question assumes that the basic Uber business model will prevail: that car-sharing services, ordered from phones and charged automatically, will become more and more common around the world, overcoming resistance by local authorities and the taxi industry, and expanding the aggregate taxi market.", "The task facing Uber is not just to overcome the hurdles and make ride-sharing a multibillion dollar industry. It\u2019s to try to entrench the advantages it has from being first: continually refining its offerings to have the best possible user experience, the best data analytics to ensure that people can get a car when they need one, and not to be greedy with regard to its commission, lest it be all the more inviting a target for rivals.

For both teams, the goal is to give blind people a form of sight \u2014 or at least an experience analogous to sight.", "At Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, where Zeev Zalevsky is head of the electro-optics program, these efforts have taken shape in the form of a smart contact lens. The device begins with a camera mounted on a pair of glasses, and the contact lens, Dr. Zalevsky explained, is embedded with an electrode that will produce an image of what is before the camera directly on the cornea. The image would be experienced in one of two ways: If an apple is placed before the camera, it could be \u201cseen\u201d either as the contour of an apple or as a Braille-like shape that a trained user would recognize as a representation of an apple.", "Yevgeny Beiderman, a graduate student who worked with Dr. Zalevsky in testing the prototype, said: \u201cThe first time, the usage of the glasses feels strange. It takes at least a few attempts to start using it.\u201d", "The image captured by Dr. Zalevsky\u2019s device is 110 by 110 pixels \u2014 hardly photograph-quality resolution, but Dr. Zalevsky said by email that the camera captures several images in time, and the compressed and encoded result \u201cis enough to allow functionality to the blind person (for example: Braille contains only six points and is enough for reading.)\u201d", "Dr. Zalevsky is awaiting permission from a hospital to test the electrode lens on people, so in the meantime he has conducted preliminary trials using lenses that apply air pressure to the cornea instead. He has also conducted tests in which participants identified various shapes based on electrical stimulation of the tongue, after the same sort of training that would let someone wearing his lens \u201csee\u201d an apple as a Braille-like pattern.", "Because the electrodes are clear and the lenses are standard soft polymers, Dr. Zalevsky said, the lens should be virtually unnoticeable to the wearer. \u201cSoft contact lenses you put in in the morning and take out in the evening, if all is O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess the same will be true here.\u201d", "Dr. Jason Moss, an ophthalmologist at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn who was not involved in the research, said he found the idea of a smart contact lens interesting, but expressed caution about the limitations of resolution and the effects of the lens rubbing on the eye. \u201cThe cornea is a very delicate structure that is very susceptible to injury,\u201d he said.", "Such concerns are certain to arise as technology-equipped contact lenses find a broader audience. Google recently filed a patent for a camera to be part of a smart contact lens \u2014 including a proposed feature in which absorbed data could indicate via a voice warning, for example, whether a crosswalk is safe to cross.", "A separate technique meant to assist the blind, developed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, spares the cornea entirely, instead recruiting the ears as a substitute sense. The device, like Dr. Zalevsky\u2019s, incorporates a camera mounted on a pair of glasses, but in this case the images are translated into sound in a free iPhone app.", "Known as EyeMusic, the app is the work of Professor Amir Amedi, who at a TEDx Talk in 2012 demonstrated that by assigning sounds that correspond to specific images, people with visual impairment could \u201csee\u201d blue squares, lean over and grab shoes on the floor, identify individuals by the sound of their eyes and nose and eyebrows, and tell whether someone was smiling or frowning.", "EyeMusic works by assigning distinctive sounds to certain visual properties, and like Dr. Zalevsky\u2019s lens, it requires practice to use. At its simplest, if a dog walked through your field of vision \u2014 low to the ground, moving in a straight line \u2014 the app would create a low, steady sound. A bird flying in a straight line through your field of vision would create a high, steady sound. A baseball rising up into the air \u2014 creating a diagonal line \u2014 would create a rising sound.", "But firsthand use of the app is slightly more complicated than that. The program bases the audio output on a kind of infrared approximation of what\u2019s before the camera, and when the image is complicated, the output can sound like someone dragging both hands across an organ. Listen to it often enough, though \u2014 film someone walking down the street, for example \u2014 and a user begins to notice subtle shifts and variations, pockets of sound changing as the image changes.", "\u201cOne user blind from birth used the EyeMusic to look at the sky and was astounded by the shape and presence of clouds,\u201d Dr. Amedi said by email. \u201cHe thought the sky would be blue and didn\u2019t understand initially what are the white things that disrupt the image. Then he learned these are clouds \u2014 that create rain \u2014 and loved it.\u201d", "Dr. Amedi said he is working on a new iteration of the app that will add games to teach geometry and math, and he is pursuing several other sensory substitution projects to benefit people with impaired vision.", "Devices like the EyeMusic app and Dr. Zalevsky\u2019s smart contact lens have the potential to open up possibilities for people like Tanja Milojevic, a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts-Boston who is studying to be a Braille teacher.", "Ms. Milojevic, 24, who developed glaucoma at age 5, has 20/800 sight within a narrow field of vision.

Enough for a short stay, nothing more.", "My initial reaction to what she was doing was resentment. Why would she want to complicate this? Why couldn\u2019t she just let me go? But then I pictured her returning to our apartment alone in the event of my death, carrying that bag of stuff I would never use. And that image stuck with me, and started taking up space in my head.", "I am not sure if we can sway the outcome either way: to just let go and die, or to will ourselves to live. To think we can strikes me as more of a hopeful fiction that people cling to in such situations. What I think saved me that night was the competence of the professionals responsible for my care and the good fortune to live in a city with superb emergency services.", "But what Sarah did in packing that bag for me, the quiet hope her act spoke to \u2014 that was the reason I listened to my doctors, took my medication and even quit smoking. As much as her intention was affirming and positive, it also exposed my own selfishness, the pettiness of giving up on life just because sometimes life is hard. It embarrassed me the way being caught in a lie is embarrassing. Love doesn\u2019t afford us the luxury of caring, or not caring, only about ourselves.", "How love reveals itself is sometimes a slow process, the gradual accretion of all the seemingly mundane acts of kindness, sacrifice, mindfulness and even bad behavior two people share. Sarah\u2019s act was an instance of what love looks like, stripped of all the usual bells and whistles. To have the opportunity to witness that, regardless of the circumstances, left me feeling like a fortunate man.", "It also made me want to match the level of commitment she so clearly demonstrated. Sarah had raised the bar for me in a way I could not ignore.", "Part of what changed in my life arose from my working backward from that night to see how I ended up near death on a gurney, with my skin the color of slate and the weight of an elephant on my chest. It is embarrassingly simple to see how smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for 30 years would lead to my particular physical difficulties. It is far less clear how to identify and perhaps even repair the more indistinct emotional damage that accrues over time.", "One thing I am sure of is how badly I have misused the phrase \u201cI love you\u201d over the years. I have used it as an emotional lever and said it as something expected of me. I even have said it because I needed to hear it echoed back. These days, though, the weight of those words is something new. I understand that phrase anew, just as I now have a fresh appreciation of the phrase \u201cnear-death experience.\u201d", "I had lost the connection between saying \u201cI love you\u201d and meaning it when I started to allow the fear of loss in my life to overwhelm me. I would adopt a scientific remove to insulate myself from life\u2019s uncertainties, particularly uncertainties surrounding love. As a result I became emotionally stunted, less likely to engage with people I cared about. I was smart enough to see how things had to end, but I was not smart enough to know how to live with that truth.", "The inevitable heartbreak built into lifelong commitments is that one of you is likely going to watch the other die. The idea of a Sarah-size hole in my existence used to be more than I could manage. But when Sarah faced that possibility, she didn\u2019t blink. She had every opportunity to back away from her commitment but instead decided to stay, to deal with the uncertainties and potential sorrow common to any relationship of real value.", "Sarah is now 30, and I am 52. If things take their natural turn, the arithmetic is that she probably will watch me die instead of me watching her. I painted that likelihood for her in neon three and a half years ago, but she never wavered in her decision to marry me.", "There is an obvious connection to be made between rehabilitating my physical heart and what Sarah has helped me change in my life. Every day that I wake up and everything seems to be working correctly is a good day, and I am grateful for that. But the metaphorical heart \u2014 the heart that shows us the difference between simply living and actually feeling alive \u2014 is the one I have come to cherish above all else.", "Thanks to that packed bag and what it taught me about love, mine seems to be working fine these days."], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/freshdesk-raises-31-million-for-customer-support-software/": ["Stock market investors have rallied around Zendesk, a customer service software company that went public last month.", "But big investors are betting that a young rival, Freshdesk, whose software also helps companies with customer support, can grow into a dominant firm in its own right.", "Freshdesk is expected to announce on Thursday that it has raised $31 million from three investment firms including Google Capital, which manages money for the software giant.

If he stopped, imprisonment was guaranteed. But he decided to keep running toward an unknown, and well, we know that ended in an ice hole.", "Where does all this leave our heroine? The character of Deputy Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman), was patterned closely on that of Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) in the original Coen brothers film of the same name, right down to their pregnancies\u2019 nearing a due date.

Nor was Marge as timid in voicing her opinions.", "Still, the starkest contrast is how Molly, unlike Marge, becomes sidelined at the height of the manhunt, while others, including her husband and the F.B.I. agents Budge and Pepper, are zeroing in on the killers.", "Although she does finally rebel and head toward the scene, she\u2019s not the one who confronts Malvo, the dark lord she identified so many months ago. Instead, Gus shakily blows him away with several shots, fitting compensation, perhaps, for letting Malvo go free in the first place, back in Duluth.", "Consider how Marge, who was just as buddingly pregnant, chased and gunned down the icily stoic murderer who had been stuffing his partner into a wood-chipper.", "What\u2019s the message here, if there is one?

In a recent column you recalled covering those events with your wife, Sheryl WuDunn, which earned you both a Pulitzer Prize. Do you see that moment as a turning point that led to the very different China we know today?\n\nA: It\u2019s the turning point that wasn\u2019t. The reformist Communist Party leaders, like Zhao Ziyang, Bao Tong, Hu Qili and Zhu Houze, envisioned responding to the democracy protests by turning the country toward political as well as economic reforms. They thought that China would go in the direction of Taiwan and South Korea, with free speech and free press. Instead, they were ousted, and hardliners won the political struggle. So China has blossomed economically but is still largely on the same trajectory that Deng Xiaoping set it on back in 1978.", "Q: Your reporting from Tiananmen captured the drama of the massacre without the help of much of the technology we use today, say, during the Arab Spring uprising. Given your embrace of blogging and social media, would you cover that event differently today?", "A: It would have been fabulous to have Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and Instagram in China back then. Of course, it would be nice to have them in China today. There was a long period in the 2000s when China was steadily relaxing the rules on the Internet, but now the new emperor, Xi Jinping, is tightening them. That\u2019s why readers in China aren\u2019t able to read this article.", "Q: You noted that many young people in China don\u2019t know what happened in Tiananmen. Is there a sort of cultural memory loss in the country and if so, why?\n\nA: To control a people, you control the narrative. China\u2019s Communist Party has done that quite successfully, and in speaking Chinese it\u2019s difficult to refer to the 1949 Communist revolution except as \u89e3\u653e, jie fang, or Liberation. The Maoist famine, the worst in world history, is known as \u4e09\u5e74\u707e\u5bb3, san nian zai hai, or three years of natural disasters, even though they were very much Communist Party-caused disasters. And the June 4 massacre of 1989 has been erased from history. But you can only do that so far: Truth festers. And the party has been unable to conceal the mindboggling corruption that is widely resented.", "Q: You also said that Chinese protesters in 1989 were insisting that they wanted not just rice but rights. Do you think the country\u2019s capitalist boom has provided so much \u201crice\u201d they\u2019ve forgotten about rights?", "A. There has been an implicit deal: We\u2019ll raise your living standards, and in exchange don\u2019t complain about lack of political power. The problem is that when you raise living standards, create a middle class, educate people and build international connections, you also create demand for political participation. That\u2019s the same process that unfolded in Franco\u2019s Spain, Pinochet\u2019s Chile, Chun Doo Hwan\u2019s South Korea\u2014and that\u2019s why they\u2019re all democratic today.", "Q: You\u2019ve been a columnist since 2001, the year of the 9/11 attacks. Do you feel you\u2019ve been witness to a unique time in history?", "A: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s unique, but what a tumultuous time it has been. And what a privilege it has been to wield a journalistic spotlight during this time.", "Q: You\u2019re often out reporting in dangerous places. Has there ever been a time when you feared for your life?\n\nA: Plenty of times. On some trips, I spend much of my time with a knot in my stomach. My most traumatic trip was to Congo to cover the civil war there. It began with an airplane crash. Then I was chased through the jungle for days by a warlord\u2019s soldiers, after I interrupted them murdering Hutus. And in the course of that I caught the most lethal strain of malaria. After that, my wife pretty much put me in leg irons.", "Q: When you write about the most urgent issues \u2014 war, human rights catastrophes, a global health crisis or any injustice \u2014 what do you hope to accomplish?", "A: I think of myself as in the lighting business, not the heating business. So I want to spotlight global problems or injustices and make people spill their coffee in the morning. I want to project urgent issues onto the agenda, as the first step to getting them solved.", "Q: Which of your columns have had the most impact, in your view?", "A: My writing on hot-button topics hasn\u2019t had much impact. In the six months leading to the Iraq war, I wrote endlessly (including from Iraq) about the foolishness of invading Iraq, and I didn\u2019t convince anybody, including fellow liberals or even my own paper\u2019s editorial page. Likewise, I\u2019ve written interminably on gun violence and I don\u2019t know that I changed anyone\u2019s mind to favor limits on guns. But where it is possible to have more impact is to highlight a troubling issue and make people think about it\u2014including people in the White House. So my columns on Darfur had an impact, I think, in calling attention to the crisis there and supporting efforts to provide aid. I think my columns on obstetric fistula helped make that issue much more prominent and get far more funding for it. And I think my columns on sex trafficking at home and abroad led to more awareness of what is, in its extreme, a modern form of slavery.", "Q: What have you been wrong on in your time as an opinion columnist? Are there any columns you regret writing?", "A:  Oh, I\u2019ve been wrong about plenty of things. I regret writing columns about Steve Hatfill, the \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the anthrax cases. Recently, there\u2019ve been doubts raised about the back story of Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist against human trafficking, and while I don\u2019t know what the truth is, I wouldn\u2019t have written about her if I\u2019d been aware of the doubts. While some of my criticisms of the Iraq war were right, I warned that the war would trigger the Arab street to rise up and that turned out to be totally wrong \u2014 at the time! I wrote many columns saying that President Bush\u2019s Iraq \u201csurge\u201d wouldn\u2019t work, and in fact it pretty much did. I wrote a column saying that economic sanctions against Myanmar wouldn\u2019t work, and they did.", "There were also times when some nastiness crept into my tone toward people I disagreed with vehemently, and I regret that. It\u2019s very easy in a column to smack people in power and taunt them (especially Republicans during the Bush years). I regret the mean-spiritedness that sometimes got the better of me.", "Q: Does reporting on human suffering for so long ever get you down? Has it affected your sense of hope?", "A: It\u2019s a strange thing, but reporting on horrors can actually leave you feeling more optimistic about our species. The truth is that side by side with the worst kind of evil, you tend to find the greatest altruism and nobility. I remember interviewing a warlord in Congo who was responsible for mass rape and murder, and who underscored the human capacity for depravity. But I also met a little Polish nun who was singlehandedly feeding the starving, raising orphans and negotiating to keep the warlord at bay. She expressed her humanity by responding to evil with courage, decency and nobility in a way that left an even deeper impression on me than the warlord did.

Two popular smartphone apps, Secret and Whisper, took off this spring, especially in the tech communities, offering users the opportunity to speak to their friends and a broader audience, anonymously, on just about any subject. Reddit, an anonymous discussion and linking site, has recently witnessed a traffic explosion; with more than 110 million unique monthly visitors, it has more traffic than Netflix or any American newspaper. Users of these anonymous outlets make it clear they\u2019re looking for a break from Facebook and other social media. One comment: \u201cMaybe the reason Secret is . . . interesting . . . is because it doesn\u2019t have to be happy all the time.\u201d", "If Facebook is like a never-ending high school reunion, and Twitter serves up water-cooler chatter, the anonymous spaces promise some mixture of drunken party talk, group therapy and the confession booth, absent the hangovers, scheduled meetings and Hail Marys. Any old-timer will tell you that anonymity online is nothing new, but how things originally were. There has, of course, always been an anonymous culture, usually tied to deviancy or dissidents. In the \u201980s and \u201990s, anonymity was indelibly linked to online culture, concurrent with getting at stuff that was otherwise hard to find or illegal. It was kind of the point really, to go where, as one early adopter wrote, \u201cno one knows you\u2019re a dog.\u201d It allowed users to escape to a place with few restrictions, where you could say things, and maybe do things wholly without social consequence. In the early days, there was no need for any consistency with the rest of your life, and that\u2019s what was so great about it.", "The new generation of anonymous apps feeds off the same electric energy. As Secret advertises, \u201cIt\u2019s not about who you are \u2014 it\u2019s about what you say.\u201d Like then, and now, anonymity\u2019s attraction is that you can share as much as you like, but nothing you say sticks to the \u201creal\u201d you. Given the chance to speak freely, what sort of things do people use this space for? Things, safe to say, that are a far cry from what people post on Facebook or Twitter. There are messages about work frustrations probably better not shared on Facebook: \u201cThis chicken pot pie is big but not as big as our C.E.O.\u2019s head.\u201d Confessions of bad parenting: \u201cI ate all of the Easter candy I was going to give to my kids.\u201d Endless tech gossip: \u201cI work at Google, and no one uses Glass anymore.\u201d", "But there\u2019s more to it than just the odd stuff that would get the poster in trouble in what used to be called real space. On Secret and Whisper, in particular, a lot of what\u2019s posted are expressions of emotions that aren\u2019t sinful so much as hard to say in other places. Like vanity: \u201cI\u2019m so rich.\u201d Or chastity: \u201cI tried sex parties, poly, hookups and know they are not for me. And now I feel like a stupid prude who no one likes.\u201d Sentimentality: \u201cTen years later, she\u2019s just as amazing and beautiful as the day we met.\u201d Anxiety: \u201cI never feel comfortable in my skin and I make up for it by working more.\u201d Weakness: \u201cFaking it till I make it, but anxiety and self-doubt are killing me.\u201d Pain: \u201cBreak-ups. When does the hurt stop.\u201d", "If people like being anonymous so much, you might ask, just what happened to the trend in the \u201990s? The short story is that the online scene soured, showing how inherently fragile anonymous scenes are. It turned out that, for some, anonymity was an excuse to try and seduce anyone female or pretending to be. For others, anonymity summoned darker instincts, urges to be cruel and abusive. Racist, sexist, offensive, horrible; a new creature, the troll, took over anonymous spaces like rats invading a New York building. They bit some people, scaring others, leaving behind their mark. Whole parts of the online world were soon uninhabitable. In no time, anonymous chat rooms, which were once exciting and fresh, gained a bad reputation as a hangout for miscreants.", "There was, however, something too great about online anonymity for it to go away forever. Eventually, like classic cocktails, punk rock or electronic music, it was too irresistible an idea not to come back in some form. And now, here it is again. While anonymity is most obviously a reaction to Facebook, the funny thing is that, once upon a time, Facebook traded on the same appeal. While never anonymous, in its early days it was more like a club, away from the outside world. Drunk party pictures were its hallmark; some people used it to find dates. At the time, the use of real names seemed great, because it made the space virtually troll-free. You\u2019d have to be openly insane, not a closet sociopath, to troll on Facebook, because it was your real reputation talking, not just your id. The idea of Facebook as a good time ended when the well-intentioned relatives and co-workers arrived. They were nice and all, but at that exact moment Facebook transformed, and it became the whole you, not just the you who posed drunk at parties, but the you who was supposed to be a diligent worker, a responsible mother, a Christian, straight or not straight, or whatever it was you said you were or wanted others to think. Facebook became everything oppressive about identity. By 2013, experimental psychologists at the University of Michigan tested subjects and found that \u201cthe more they used Facebook over two weeks, the more their life-satisfaction levels declined over time.\u201d", "Just like physical neighborhoods or cultural fads, online spaces go through their own cycles of promise, greatness, decay and collapse. Consider that Craigslist was once, especially in San Francisco, an actual community, or at least a place with a distinctive group attached to it. AOL was once a community, albeit a big one, not as it is today, a media operating company. Even email, the most banal and oppressive application of all, was once an exciting place to spend time, when only college kids or programmers had it.", "Maybe knowing that their time may be limited, spaces like Whisper or Secret seem to be fighting hard to prevent the trolls from destroying their spaces. The founders of Secret don\u2019t allow strangers to comment on someone\u2019s secrets. Instead, the app uses your phone and email contact list to connect you to secrets posted by friends. It also asks users to \u201csay something kind\u201d as an appeal to the collective conscience. But the greatest threat to anonymity this time around might just be too much anonymous bragging, boring chatter and the inherent tension between user-secrecy and the founders\u2019 desires to make money. Whisper has already started to share confessions with BuzzFeed, which feels close to a violation of the confessional seal. Secret is more careful of its content, but listening to too many \u201cpreening douchebags,\u201d as someone put it, gets exhausting. Talking politics, celebrities, TV shows and tech gossip is fine chatter, but it\u2019s hardly worth a special app. That\u2019s why someone recently posted a golden rule: \u201cIf you can post it on Facebook, don\u2019t post it in Secret."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/blackberry-to-add-amazon-app-store-to-phones/": ["OTTAWA \u2014 In a side story to Amazon\u2019s expected move into the smartphone business, the ailing handset maker BlackBerry said on Wednesday that it would include Amazon\u2019s app store on its phones.", "John S.

He offered this theory in the video, \u201cIn order to avoid detection by Facebook\u2019s fraud algorithm, they like pages other than the ones they\u2019ve been paid for, to seem more genuine.\u201d That led him to conclude that these fraudulent likes were decreasing the value of advertising on Facebook. \u201cWherever you\u2019re targeting,\u201d he said in the video, \u201cadvertising your page on Facebook is a waste of money.\u201d", "Tim Rathschmidt, a spokesman for Facebook, said that Facebook played no role in generating fake likes and that there was in fact another explanation for likes that don\u2019t seem genuine. It happens, Mr. Rathschmidt said, because businesses don\u2019t target their ads narrowly enough \u2014 by gender, interest, Zip code, etc. And as a result, he said, business owners \u201cthink likes are fake, but they aren\u2019t.\u201d Actually, he said, people who have been poorly targeted may like the business\u2019s page, but then they do not end up engaging with it. Those poorly targeted likes, he said, are being mistaken for fake likes. He said Mr. Muller\u2019s targeting on Virtual Cat was too wide.", "Facebook also makes clear that it won\u2019t widely distribute content that \u201cisn\u2019t interesting,\u201d said Mr. Rathschmidt, who suggested reviewing this information about news feed posts and what is likely to foster engagement.", "In February, Glenn Jimerson, an Internet marketing consultant in Phoenix and founder of the blog Snake Oil Social Media, tried to recreate Mr. Muller\u2019s findings using very narrow targeting. He ran an ad campaign on his Facebook page that targeted those who have an interest in Internet marketing and reputation management and who live in the Phoenix area. \u201cTheoretically,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe number of fake profiles should be small to nonexistent.\u201d He ran several ads for 30 days and wound up with 17 authentic likes, six that were suspicious (they appeared to have real profiles but lacked any connection with the targeted topics and, on average, had liked 1,000 pages or more) and three that were clearly fake. \u201cDespite focused targeting on a niche topic, the fake likers found me,\u201d he wrote.", "\u201cExperiments\u201d like Mr. Muller\u2019s or Mr. Jimerson\u2019s aren\u2019t valid, Mr. Rathschmidt said, because they target different people in different areas, and every Facebook user\u2019s news feed is different. \u201cIt\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison,\u201d he said, adding that neither Mr. Muller nor Mr. Jimerson could really know if a like is fake. \u201cThere\u2019s no profile link that says, \u2018this is a fake like.\u2019 That\u2019s just their conclusion.\u201d", "Still, Mr. Rathschmidt said Facebook had a security team and proprietary tools in place to address the issue. \u201cWe have recently increased our focus on abuse from fake accounts,\u201d he said. Facebook tries to catch fake accounts at different points of interaction, including registration on the site, when the account holders \u201cfriend\u201d people and when they click like buttons. \u201cIf there are enough signals from the automated system that something is wrong, we\u2019ll block the account or look at it individually,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s on a case-by-case basis, and if it\u2019s blocked but is a legitimate account, the user gets a chance to tell us that.\u201d", "Mr. Muller said he wished Facebook \u201cwould remove the fakes from the Veritasium page, which has 187,000 followers.\u201d Unlike a fraudulent click on a Google ad, he said, a fraudulent page like stays with the page forever, decreasing the value of a page because fake fans don\u2019t engage with organic posts, which means Facebook will show those posts to fewer people. That may force a business owner to pay Facebook once more to promote a post just so that genuine fans can see it. But Mr. Rathschmidt said that\u2019s not why Facebook doesn\u2019t allow page administrators to clear out likes they don\u2019t want. \u201cFake likes don\u2019t benefit anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t help us make more money because they make the ad less effective.\u201d", "He said Facebook was simply trying to respect the choices of its users, including what they like.

(We also use WordPress for many of our blogs.) Scoop was initially designed and developed in 2008 in close partnership with the newsroom. Unlike many commercial systems, Scoop does not render our website or provide community tools to our readers. Rather, it is a system for managing content and publishing data so that other applications can render the content across our platforms. This separation of functions gives development teams at The Times the freedom to build solutions on top of that data independently, allowing us to move faster than if Scoop were one monolithic system. For example, our commenting platform and recommendations engine integrate with Scoop but remain separate applications.", "This post was written and edited in Scoop.", "The vision for Scoop has evolved over the years.

Its user base has swelled from a few dozen web producers to more than 1,000 users, including reporters, copy editors, photo editors and video producers.", "Perhaps the biggest change has been the reversal of our publishing process. The original idea was that articles would be written in the Microsoft Word-based print system, CCI, and then sent to Scoop, where a web producer would add multimedia, tag the content and publish it on NYTimes.com. Today, instead of writing articles in CCI and then sending them to Scoop, our journalists can create articles in Scoop and publish to web and mobile first before sending them to CCI for the print newspaper.

Scoop publishes roughly 700 articles, 600 images, 14 slide shows and 50 videos per day. With that power comes significant complexity, especially in comparison to the content management systems of our digital-only competitors. Unlike many simpler systems where a journalist can single-handedly take an article all the way from inception to publication, Scoop is role-based to reflect the segmentation of duties and the checks and balances in our newsroom. Managing that complexity \u2014 making the system as easy to use as possible without diminishing its features and functionality \u2014 is a balancing act we face every day.", "Here\u2019s a look at a selection of Scoop\u2019s features and what we\u2019re planning for the future.", "Once upon a time, editors used to plan out the print edition of The Times by printing out story lists and circulating them among the various desks in the newsroom. Many trees were killed in this archaic and inefficient process. A few years ago, we built a separate tool to bring all planning online and then integrated that tool into Scoop. Editors still bring a lot of paper to Page One meetings, but online budgeting makes managing a global news operation of multiple desks and bureaus possible in a digital age. It\u2019s also often the first step before an article or other type of content is created in Scoop. We plan to extend this functionality into a system that knows the status of each article, when it is will run online and in print, what multimedia will run with each article and how that article is performing once it is published.", "", "One of the most distinguishing features of Scoop is its ability to do in-line track changes similar to what you would find in Microsoft Word. Many other browser-based text editors, such as Google Docs, show changes in the margin. Our editors prefer (well, demand) Word-style track changes for text editing, not a diff engine that compares the current text to previous versions. This style of track changes dates back to the earliest computer text editors such as Atex, which were the standard in newsrooms in the 1980s, and the style definitely has its merits by showing all edits in context. At our editors\u2019 insistence, we also provide in-line comments and notes rather than notes in the margin. To accomplish this, we built our own text editor called ICE, and then open sourced it.", "Our editors can create unlimited drafts of articles. Many content management systems support a published version and a single draft, but in Scoop, we can have a live version of an article, a version where minor edits are being made, a version where the story is going through major updates and a print-specific version edited to fit in the paper. Each of those drafts can go through our editing workflow steps independently and then become the published version of that article.", "We lock content so that editors can\u2019t overwrite each other\u2019s work.

For example, a reporter can work on the article while an editor is writing the headline and summary and a producer is adding multimedia. But one editor can\u2019t work on the headline while another works on the summary.", "We will soon release a new article user interface that will include field-level locking and real-time collaboration. In this new UI, editors will be able to see who else is working on the article and which fields each editor has locked. When an editor saves a change, it is updated for all the other collaborators in real time. (At this point, at our editors\u2019 request, we are not showing every keystroke each collaborator is making as Google Docs does, but with a minor implementation tweak we could, and we are also exploring ways to have more than one person work on the text of an article at the same time.)", "When working with highly sensitive material, our editors can mark an article as private and restrict access by user or group.

Today, tags are automatically suggested based on the content of the article using sophisticated algorithms that can tell the difference between \u201cGeorgia\u201d the state and \u201cGeorgia\u201d the country. Editors use those suggestions to tag the article. They can also manually select additional tags from the taxonomy or request that a new term be added. Our digital taxonomy team evaluates those requests, maintains the suggestion rules, adds new terms and reviews how articles are tagged on a daily basis.", "Scoop has a notification system that allows users to customize alerts that will let them know when articles matching custom criteria have been created, reached a certain workflow state, been updated or been published. This system can help prevent some editors from standing over the shoulders of harried reporters writing on deadline. It also helps producers who may want to know when every story in their sections are ready to be published, or copy editors who want to know when a particular story is ready for review. Notifications are sent via email or through Scoop itself.", "When Scoop launched, our photo editors and producers only needed to crop a few different aspect ratios and sizes for each image. As the number of apps and platforms that published our content grew, so did the number of image crops we needed to provide. We didn\u2019t want to change the newsroom\u2019s workflow each time we launched a new app or the resolution on the iPad changed, so we revamped our image cropping tools to simplify the cropping process while increasing the number of sizes and aspect ratios that we publish for each photo. Today, editors use Scoop to draw the \u201cmaster\u201d crop of the photo and the \u201csmall square\u201d or thumbnail of the photo.

But this can create workflow problems as stories continue to develop late in the day. Keeping articles up to date both in Scoop and our print system is problematic. To solve this, we are working on a project to allow our editors to copy-fit for print directly from Scoop. Once that is completed, all print content will be edited in Scoop, while page design will continue to take place in the print system.", "Scoop is designed around workflows where a reporter writes text, a copy editor writes a headline and summary, a photo editor selects the images and a producer puts it all together. This describes how most of our report is currently assembled, but we don\u2019t think this is necessarily the model for the future. Scoop does not do a good job of accommodating writers who want to do all of those things themselves to tell a story. Nor is it a tool for a reporter who only wants to write and wants the simplest, most elegant interface possible to accomplish that task. Working with our newsroom, we are exploring ways in which we can have the best of both worlds \u2014 an elegant user interface for writers and (with the click of a button) a powerful editing and workflow management tool for editors and producers.", "The Times has many talented people investigating traffic and social media trends for each piece of our content. At the newsroom\u2019s request, we have never integrated that data back into Scoop to help inform our editors on how to best reach our readers. That attitude is shifting in our organization, and we plan to explore new ways to display this type of information for our editors.", "We are a large technology organization that includes a team of engineers in the newsroom working directly with editors and reporters to cover the news. Our graphics desk also includes engineers and data visualization journalists who create interactive charts and timelines that readers regularly see in our daily coverage. Scoop provides some read/write APIs to contribute to this effort, so that those tools can write directly to Scoop where they can be associated with articles and published. This interaction isn\u2019t as smooth as it should be, and we are working together with those teams to make Scoop and these external tools feel like a cohesive unit to our newsroom. This should simplify the tools and result in even more interactive pieces appearing in our coverage.", "The NYTimes.com home page and most of our section fronts are manually curated so that our readers can tell which stories our editors have deemed the most important throughout the day. This curation powers the sections of our apps and mobile site as well. The manner in which section fronts are \u201cranked\u201d is tied to the desktop website\u2019s layout, which means we then need to translate those layout decisions to our apps and mobile site where the layouts are different. With the majority of our traffic shifting to mobile devices, we want to give our editors the same level of control over the presentation of content in mobile that they have today on the web. We are re-evaluating our current approach to come up with a less labor-intensive way to convey the importance of each piece of content, and to structure the data in a way that can be more directly applied in different layouts on phones and tablets. This will require some significant changes to Scoop, our mobile apps and the newsroom workflow. The good news is that we have a system that we control and a team more than capable of making those changes."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/technology/a-smartphone-keyboard-app-that-anticipates-what-you-want-to-type.html": ["LONDON \u2014 Typing on the glass of a smartphone can be a headache. The keyboards are tiny. Errors are easy to make, even on the simplest of words. And autocorrect, the function meant to fix typing mistakes, often introduces errors, switching words that have little to do with what people actually mean.", "Consumers\u2019 irritation with typing has enticed the likes of Google, Apple and several start-ups to try to put the smart into smartphone keyboards \u2014 knowing that there is a big opportunity in having such a prominent place in users\u2019 hands.", "Perhaps no company, though, has found more success with enhancing keyboards than SwiftKey, a London start-up that first released a keyboard app in 2010. SwiftKey says the app, which cost $4 until last Wednesday, when it became available free, was downloaded more than 30 million times. It ranked as one of the most popular paid smartphone applications on Google\u2019s Play Store.", "The app predicts what you will type next by using artificial intelligence and reams of online data, including what you type on other apps, to learn what words you typically use. It then applies that information to predict what you will type next.", "\u201cThere\u2019s huge strategic value in owning the keyboard,\u201d said Jon Reynolds, 28, a co-founder of SwiftKey, whose app is now used on almost 250 million handsets. \u201cWhatever app you use across your phone, we\u2019re there.\u201d", "SwiftKey\u2019s technology and growth have gained the attention of some global tech giants. Google and Facebook, for example, have made inquiries about a potential takeover of the company, though no deal has ever been reached, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about such talks.", "A spokeswoman declined to comment about takeover rumors.", "Finding a long-term growth plan has not been easy. SwiftKey announced last week that it was ending its paid app business model. Instead, the app is now free, and the company charges users for extras like different colored keyboard themes.", "This so-called freemium model, which is popular with online gaming companies like King, the maker of the CandyCrush franchise, is an effort by SwiftKey to woo new consumers, particularly in developing markets. In countries like India and China, people often balk at paying for smartphone apps, preferring to download them free and pay for premium content.", "\u201cChina represents the next billion smartphone users,\u201d said Ben Medlock, 35, a SwiftKey co-founder. \u201cThe freemium model will help us to build our user base.\u201d", "So far, the app has been limited to Android, which allows third-party developers like SwiftKey to alter the look and feel of the operating system. SwiftKey has also teamed with handset makers including Samsung and LG, and the app is installed on many of their new high-end phones.", "Yet while the start-up is still looking to increase its users on Android, which has roughly 80 percent of the global smartphone market and typically is used in low-cost models, SwiftKey also wants to attract Apple users.", "This month, Apple announced it was opening its keyboard to third-party apps like SwiftKey. The start-up had already teamed with Evernote, the popular note-taking app, to offer its predictive keyboard on Apple\u2019s iPhones. But now SwiftKey says it is working on a keyboard app that will work across Apple smartphone software.", "\u201cAs the Android experience gets better, Apple will have to consider opening up more,\u201d said Richard Wong, a partner at the venture capital firm Accel Partners in California, which has invested in SwiftKey. \u201cDespite phones\u2019 becoming smart, most apps have remained dumb.\u201d", "Finding success with Apple will not be easy. While Apple said other companies could develop apps for its operating system, Apple also introduced its own predictive keyboard that it will include on its new mobile operating system \u2014 a keyboard that operates a lot like SwiftKey\u2019s product. That could make it hard to persuade users to download a separate keyboard app.", "\u201cYou need to have control of the operating system,\u201d said Nick Dillon, a senior analyst at the technology research company Ovum in London. \u201cThat favors Apple and Google. For SwiftKey, there\u2019s a limit to what they can do.\u201d", "SwiftKey has built its success so far on personalization.", "By mining data from its users and other online sources, the start-up can offer different text predictions for each individual, depending on how they type, what their interests are and which language they use.", "An American user, for example, might be prompted to use the word \u201csoccer\u201d in a text message related to the World Cup in Brazil, while a British user would be offered \u201cfootball.\u201d In total, SwiftKey now offers word predictions in 66 languages, including Mongolian and Welsh. It is running a trial of a Japanese version and soon plans to introduce a Chinese edition.", "\u201cWe tap into a lot of different sources \u2014 it\u2019s the best way to figure out what people are trying to type,\u201d said Joe Osborne, who leads SwiftKey\u2019s text prediction team. \u201cFrom the get-go, we can understand exactly how you write.\u201d", "SwiftKey can personalize its keyboard according to what and how each person writes across emails, social networks like Facebook, and mobile Internet searches on Google.", "Users have the option to link their online accounts to the app\u2019s predictive text algorithms. SwiftKey then analyzes their personal habits on the likes of Twitter to tailor its suggestions to each user.", "The company says it complies with European data protection rules, which are more stringent than those in the United States. SwiftKey also says people must opt in to add their accounts to its system, and they are not automatically signed up for the personalization service.", "As part of SwiftKey\u2019s global rollout, Caroline Gasperin, a Brazilian who runs the company\u2019s language group, spent more than two years working on the Japanese version before its introduction last month. Her 11-person team had to crack the complexity of predicting words in the character-based language. The process took two years \u2014 in contrast to less than a week needed to build a similar model for a European language.", "\u201cWe started the company to make a better keyboard,\u201d said Mr. Reynolds, the co-founder. \u201cFrom the beginning, our focus has been to get on a billion handsets.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/us/your-evening-briefing.html": ["Welcome to NYT Now, the new app from The New York Times.

No web browsing, no apps, no emails, no voice-mail messages, no text messages. While Rishikesh doesn\u2019t lack digital connections, I, like many New Yorkers, felt too plugged in, my iPhone at times feeling hooked to my person like a respirator. That all-too-common feeling was exacerbated by having spent the previous month reporting nonstop at the Winter Games in Sochi, which, in spite of its infamous logistical hurdles (yes, I was one of those who got locked in her hotel room and had to be busted out by a colleague), was a round-the-clock, wired experience.", "After checking in and getting a power nap, I went to my first yoga class at the ashram with Swami Yogananda, a man who claimed to be 105 years old. He attributes his astonishing achievement in oldness to both the yoga practice he is said to have begun in the 1920s and a grainless diet of fruit, milk and nuts.

I felt ridiculous in my yoga pants imitating a lion, but if he was really 105, whatever Yogananda Ji was doing was clearly working. So, I roared.", "I was fully aware that I had become yet another Westerner making a spiritual voyage to India, a tradition even older than Yogananda Ji, one that is at times complicated, littered with over-romanticization and, occasionally, tension.", "But as I continued my big cat growls, I was struck by how far the chasm was between what I had experienced in some North American forms of the practice, in which throngs of neurotic yet limber women wear $100 Lululemon pants while channeling their inner pretzel.

The famed Mooji, a Jamaican guru, was among those who held satsangs in Rishikesh during my stay, attracting hundreds of followers daily.", "One by one and in front of the large crowd, they asked often-raw questions of Mooji, who answered or used them as springboards for riffs on faith. One question was from a married man with children who said simply, \u201cI\u2019m tired of being a person.\u201d Another was a young woman who was struggling with her conservative Jewish family accepting her as lesbian. At one satsang, a young man made his way onstage and buried himself in Mooji\u2019s lap, in tears. I sat watching cross-legged, feeling somewhere between moved and confused.", "Three days in, I was doing six to eight hours of yoga a day. When I told yogis and gurus of my tech sabbatical, their reactions reinforced my suspicion that cellphones are something of a Buddhist nightmare, their sole purpose being to take you out of the present.

A master of reiki, a Japanese relaxation practice, taught me how she uses a pendulum to read electromagnetic fields and how to sense auras. I learned about the virtues of mudra, or hand gestures, that the teacher said aided in warding off everything from fatigue to back pain to insomnia. Another yogi talked to me at length over ginger tea about quantum physics, which included the lesson that the pain from holding a pose is only a construct because none of us is real. My leg muscles felt otherwise.", "Not one of the instructors professed the virtues of slate tummies or trimmer thighs. Instead, the visiting Rishikesh yoga teachers, as diverse as their students, seemed more focused on the spiritual rather than the pure fitness side of yoga. None of the studios had mirrors, and much of each class took place with eyes closed.", "There\u2019s a temptation among Rishikesh-goers to oversimplify India\u2019s mystique. And surely there is something indescribably wonderful about the place, but more than a week into my cellphone furlough, my head mostly cleared of New York and Olympic cacophony, I realized that I, like many of my fellow Americans, am terrible at something the early yogis strove for: balance. Yet Rishikesh itself provided a strange paradox in extremes: while it was a vacation from modernity for those like me, many locals often struggled for the bare necessities, let alone Wi-Fi access. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 takeaway perhaps, but a real one that you can\u2019t just roll a yoga mat over.", "The idea that I (or anyone) could steal away to Rishikesh and come back Myself 2.0, exuding Beyonc\u00e9-like confidence every moment, is a lovely one. But I knew the greatest test of the Rishikesh trip would be upon my return to an anxiety-filled New York.", "I left my yoga mat at the ashram and placed rupees in the donation box.

The National Geographic-ready sight of five monks sitting in front of me and laughing over video clips on their iPads reminded me that I was still digitally disconnected, a fact I had almost forgotten.

Now, Detroit has introduced a new plan with the cooperation of its unions, which have been among the most vocal opponents of cutbacks.", "The new plan is called a hybrid, which means the workers will keep some of their current plan\u2019s most valuable features but will give up others. If it succeeds, the city\u2019s cost-cutting hybrid pension plan could be a model for solving government budget crises across the country. Under the new hybrid plan, which goes into effect on July 1, the city\u2019s current workers will still earn so-called defined-benefit pensions \u2012 a specified monthly payment based on tenure, age and earnings history.

I know that story well. In it, my great-great-grandfather, Patrick Lavin, a 19th-century Irish immigrant and New York City policeman, was such a favored member of Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s security detail that when Roosevelt traveled back to the city as president, he was called in to protect him. There is zero evidence of this. But we did have Patrick Lavin\u2019s billy club, his photo from the turn of the 20th century in his police uniform and the retirement certificate noting his 27 years of service to the New York Police Department. He retired in 1911 with an annual pension of $700.", "There was never a hint that he had killed two men while on duty, and had been indicted on a charge of manslaughter in one of the killings.", "My family had never heard that story until recently, when I was browsing the New York Times\u2019s online archives. Out of a general curiosity I typed in my great-great-grandfather\u2019s name, and the first story that surfaced was from March 20, 1889: \u201cPoliceman Patrick Lavin was indicted yesterday by the Grand Jury for the murder of Janitor Caspar Pfost, who was recently clubbed to death in front of 443 West Twenty-sixth-street.\u201d", "So began my obsession to get to the truth of what happened, and the more unlikely endeavor of finding the family of the man Patrick Lavin killed.", "While my great-great-grandfather is only a name and a few pieces of paper to me, I remember my great-grandfather, and loved his stories about the city of yore, and about his father, the burly, gregarious Irish cop who served the city from the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge to when automobiles replaced the horse and buggy. If my great-great-grandfather told his son the darker side of his story, he never passed it along.", "Digging deeper into the Times\u2019s online archives I came across a report of the first killing perpetrated by Patrick Lavin. In this case, it was clearly self-defense. The headline, from May 10, 1887, read: \u201cSTABBING A POLICEMAN. Officer Lavin\u2019s Possibly Fatal Encounter With Thomas Moore.\u201d Thomas Moore was an Irish immigrant, a coal shoveler and, according to friends and family interviewed by The Times, a quick-tempered and quarrelsome person when drunk, which was often. One day, Officer Lavin started to arrest the belligerent drunkard for being a public nuisance, but relented when his friends impressed upon my great-great-grandfather that Moore was \u201charmless but erratic.\u201d", "A week later, the paper said, my great-great-grandfather broke up a fight between Mr. Moore and another person on 10th Avenue, and told Mr. Moore to go home. Mr. Moore went to a liquor store, and an hour after the scuffle he pounced on Officer Lavin at 16th Street and 10th Avenue screaming, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d and plunging a knife into his chest.", "Officer Lavin was speaking to a stevedore at the time, and stumbled back, exclaiming to the man, \u201cMart, I\u2019m a dead man.\u201d He then drew his revolver, fired four shots at Thomas Moore and lunged at him, striking him in the head with his club. Both were taken to New York Hospital, where Officer Lavin recovered from his severe wound to the breast and Thomas Moore died.", "Asked before he died why he had stabbed Officer Lavin, Mr. Moore said he had done it for fun. At the coroner\u2019s inquest, even Mr. Moore\u2019s sisters testified against their brother, and the jury ruled that my great-great-grandfather was justified in the killing, having acted in self-defense.", "Then, two years later, came the incident in the backyard of the tenement at 443 West 26th Street, where Patrick Lavin, in \u201ccitizen\u2019s dress,\u201d was physically accosted by a German janitor, who spoke little or no English, and seemed to have no clue that serving beer in the bar on the ground floor of his building was prohibited on Sunday.", "I read every New York City newspaper account of this killing, on microfilm at the New York Public Library. The story was in the papers here and across the country, and the details varied greatly. Some of the papers were sympathetic to the police and my great-great-grandfather; others took the side of the deceased German immigrant, Casper Pfost (the most common spelling of his name). One tiny item in an evening paper mentioned that Patrick Lavin had posted $1,000 bail, and that his lawyer was William Howe. A Google search led to a tsunami of information. William Howe of Howe & Hummel was one of the most notorious attorneys of late-19th-century New York, representing Broadway stars, gangsters, politicians, prostitutes and policemen. At one point, of the 25 people on trial for murder in New York City, Howe & Hummel represented 24 of them.", "Cait Murphy, the author of \u201cScoundrels in Law,\u201d a 2010 book about the firm, directed me to the Department of Records at the Municipal Archives on Chambers Street, which keeps a record of all murder and manslaughter criminal indictments in the city.", "When I visited, the clerk handed over a treasure trove: 90 pages of documents, including the coroner\u2019s report, the indictment, the autopsy, the witness statements and even a diagram of the scene.", "My great-great-grandfather, as it turned out, was one of about two dozen policemen who belonged to the Pequod Club, a Tammany Hall political group that got caught up in an investigation conducted by the Lexow Committee of 1894, a State Senate group looking into police corruption. The testimony from the committee is readily available online, and I consumed hundreds of pages about police corruption in Patrick Lavin\u2019s precinct, the 16th, on West 20th Street (now the 10th Precinct), the adjacent, infamous Tenderloin District and the Pequod Club. The story of my great-great-grandfather became both clearer and murkier.", "On a Sunday night, March 3, 1889, Patrick Lavin and his partner, John Bannon, went into a tenement building where a saloon popular with Germans and \u201canarchists\u201d (socialists) occupied the ground floor. They were undercover, and ostensibly arresting bar owners who were violating the Excise Law by serving alcohol to patrons on Sunday.", "Further research revealed that the bar\u2019s owner could have avoided any harassment that evening if his weekly payments to the precinct captain had been more forthcoming. Indeed, in the indictment testimony, the owner of the saloon admitted that four months earlier he had been arrested by Officer Lavin for violating the Excise Law, and that his lawyer had recommended that he just pay the $10 per week to Captain Grant of the 16th Precinct to stay open on Sundays. The owner had only $5 with him; he sought out Patrick Lavin behind the Jefferson Market Courthouse and offered it to him. My great-great-grandfather refused, saying that someone else would collect on behalf of the captain.", "The Lexow Committee\u2019s testimony is filled with saloon owners saying that the price to stay open on Sunday was anywhere from $10 to $50 per week.", "On that Sunday, Officer Bannon went into the saloon while Officer Lavin stayed in the hallway. According to one account in The Times, Officer Bannon was served a beer and then initiated the arrest. According to witness statements, and sworn testimony by Officer Bannon himself, no beer was actually served.", "What is known is that a terrific brawl broke out inside the saloon, and that the patrons quickly locked the doors. Hearing his partner scream for help and finding the doors locked, Officer Lavin began furiously trying to knock the door down. In the middle of this adrenaline-infused violence, and fearing for the life of his partner inside, Officer Lavin created such a raucous scene that the janitor, Casper Pfost, and his wife, Antoinette, who followed behind, came downstairs with a club to roust the \u201cloafers\u201d causing the disturbance.", "According to witnesses, Officer Lavin showed the badge he wore inside his coat and yelled that he was a policeman. Understanding little English, and equally excited by the commotion, Mr. Pfost swung his club at Patrick Lavin, just as Mr. Pfost\u2019s wife put out the gaslight in the hallway to give her husband an advantage. The fight rolled out the back door of the tenement and onto the backyard steps.", "Here witnesses diverge in their stories. Officer Lavin said he struck Mr. Pfost but once; others saw five or 10 blows, and one witness, who observed the whole scene from the backyard outhouse, said he swung a dozen times. Mr. Pfost\u2019s wife, pleading for my great-great-grandfather to stop, said her husband was struck 20 times. Casper Pfost was bludgeoned to death.", "The initial inquiry into Mr. Pfost\u2019s death ruled that Patrolman Lavin was justified in the killing, but a reporter for The Times was in attendance, and the next day, March 13, a headline blared: \u201cA ONE-SIDED INQUEST.\u201d The Times reported that the Pfost family lawyer had not been told the time of the inquest, and that Antoinette Pfost had testified in German, without a translator. The court clerk, who spoke German, only read his notes to the jury after a reporter asked to hear them. The New York City German-American organization also protested, and enough pressure was put on the district attorney that charges of manslaughter were filed against Patrick Lavin.", "In my great-great-grandfather\u2019s favor was the fact the Pequod Club\u2019s president was a police commissioner: John C. Sheehan, the leader of the 13th Assembly District. Commissioner Sheehan was one of the biggest targets of the Lexow Committee, before which he appeared as an angry and obstinate witness; eventually he was forced to resign. Yet within a year he was the head of Tammany Hall. Even before he established the Pequod Club, Mr. Sheehan had such influence that it is not surprising to see the court proceedings delayed time after time until, four years later, in 1893, on the trial\u2019s scheduled starting date, the assistant district attorney dismissed the case, writing that he had interviewed five of the witnesses and thought the jury would acquit Officer Lavin.", "Casper Pfost left a wife and two small children, all recent immigrants from Germany. I became fixated on what had happened to his family. At first, I assumed that his wife, speaking no English and with two toddlers, would flee back to her homeland after such a horrific experience. But then again, that would have been an expensive escape. She must have stayed in America.", "I had her name from the manslaughter indictment. And with names like Antoinette and Casper Pfost, I hoped they were rare enough to be found in immigration archives.", "Through an online genealogy site I found that a Casper and Antoinette Pfost had a baby boy named Joseph Dominico Pfost, christened in Hechingen, Germany, in 1885. Immigration records showed that Casper Pfost emigrated to New York City in 1886. Antoinette Pfost came a year later, with a female whose name seems to have been Chernia, age 5, and \u201cJ,\u201d a male, age 2. I discovered that there were not an insignificant number of Joseph, or even Casper, Pfosts in the United States in the 1890s. But then I found a Joseph Pfost living in Brooklyn in 1910, followed by a World War I draft card that lists a Joseph Domick Pfost living in Brooklyn. This had to be the son of Casper!", "By the time of the 1920 census Joseph had two daughters, which would make tracking his lineage more difficult. By 1930, the Joseph Pfost I was tracking had moved to Babylon, on Long Island, and, thankfully, had two more children, both boys.", "Here the archive material ended. Hoping that young boys from 1930 were still alive, I started calling all the Pfosts in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. After about seven calls I happened on a Steven F. Pfost II of Farmingdale, N.Y.", "When I called what turned out to be his cellphone number, Steven Pfost was in his car. \u201cDo you happen to be related to a Joseph Dominico Pfost who once lived in Babylon?\u201d I asked.", "He said he didn\u2019t think so, but his great-grandfather was named Joseph; he didn\u2019t know his middle name. I named the children from the 1930 census and, yes, his grandfather was among them: Francis, the youngest.", "I then told him what I knew, that my great-great-grandfather had killed his, during a tragic encounter outside a saloon, and had been indicted but never tried; the man he killed had left behind a widow and children, from whom he most likely was descended.", "There was silence on the other end. Then the wind static over the cellphone evaporated as the car windows were rolled up, the radio turned down, and Steven asked me to repeat what I just said.", "He had never heard of Casper or his untimely death. He didn\u2019t know whether Antoinette had struggled after her husband\u2019s killing, or how she felt when the charges were dismissed. He told me that his great-grandfather had been a policeman on Long Island for many years, an interesting twist of fate, but that was all he knew. The same silence that had reigned in my family had reigned in his.", "There was still the small, nagging doubt as to whether this was indeed the same family, but when Steven made a trip to the family burial plot he saw something he had never noticed before on his great-grandfather\u2019s tombstone, the middle initial: Joseph D. Pfost, 1886-1950. There was now no doubt. I was speaking to the great-great-grandson of the man my great-great-grandfather had killed.", "Not long after Patrick Lavin\u2019s manslaughter indictment was swept away for good, Theodore Roosevelt became a police commissioner and president of the Police Board, ordered all the police out of their political clubs and ushered in an era of major reforms for the city. On a recent afternoon, I met Steven and we took a walk to the spot where Casper Pfost died.

The Fire phone, the product of four years of research and development, offers Amazon fans the chance to live in an Amazon-themed world, where just about every element can be identified, listed, ranked, shared and, of course, ordered.", "It offered a view of a mobile future that will be alluring to some but might repel others.", "If the device works as described, and Amazon entices even a small portion of its 250 million active customers to buy one, the Fire could accelerate Amazon\u2019s already intense competition with other retailers and tech companies, not to mention heightening some of its current battles with suppliers.", "As if to underline the no-gloves nature of the battle, a promotional video in the first few moments of the presentation took a direct slap at Apple.

Microsoft brought out a tablet; Facebook tried a phone; Google is experimenting with a shopping and delivery service.", "Against such a frenzy of competition and innovation, an Amazon phone was inevitable. The company\u2019s leaders asked themselves only one question, Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, told the crowd at the event: \u201cCan we build a better phone for our most engaged customers?\u201d", "Mr. Bezos promoted Firefly heavily, as well as something Amazon calls Dynamic Perspective. Cameras on the phone allow the user to gain another view of a video game or see layered information on a map, like a Yelp review. Whether Dynamic Perspective is a gimmick or something more will depend on how aggressively developers invent new apps for it.", "\u201cThis is the next big battleground in the ecosystem war,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie. \u201cAmazon is not going to turn the tide decisively in its favor with this, but just needs to establish a beachhead.\u201d", "The announcement took place in a warehouselike space filled with 300 members of the news media, app developers and handpicked Amazon fans.

Phones are a graveyard of tech dreams. Just ask Google, which was hailed as a genius for buying the handset maker Motorola, and then hailed again for cutting its losses and promptly selling the faded icon. Only Apple and Samsung have found making phones consistently profitable.", "But Amazon, as always, is operating with a different playbook.", "When Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire in 2011, there was a lot of chatter about its being a challenge to Apple\u2019s iPad. It was not. In the first quarter of this year, Apple had about a third of the tablet market, according to the research firm IDC. Amazon had less than 2 percent.", "Still, that is a million more consumers taking up residence in the Amazon ecosystem. Just about anyone who has a Kindle Fire is a candidate for membership in Amazon\u2019s fast-shipping club, Amazon Prime, and just about any Prime member might be enticed to buy a Kindle. Amazon Prime has an estimated 20 million subscribers, who pay $99 a year.", "The Fire Phone, which will be available late next month, costs $199 with a two-year contract with AT&T. But Amazon, as expected, is sweetening the deal with a year of free membership in the Prime club.", "\u201cIf they are able to capture 10 percent of those Prime subscribers in the near term, then that would likely constitute a success,\u201d said Eugene Signorini, vice president of mobile insights at Mobiquity.", "That would force Google and Apple, and possibly Facebook and Microsoft as well, to introduce innovations and new features in their own products.

Instead, the Internet will be everywhere, and we will be able to get to it and log in to see our digital stuff from any wall or table, or on a bracelet or contact lens. \u201cI think 10 years from now it will be increasingly clear that the smartphone was a transition technology on the way to full ubiquitous computing,\u201d Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist who helped invent the web browser 21 years ago, said in a recent interview. (Yes, technology shifts fast, doesn\u2019t it.)", "This so-called Internet of things is why many tech companies are already looking beyond mobile to bet on what the next computing platform will be. The speed of the consumer love affair with smartphones took them by surprise, and they weren\u2019t ready for it when it upended their business models. They are determined not to let that happen again. That is one reason they are spending billions of dollars to buy companies that might seem like puzzling fits at first, such as Google\u2019s acquisition of Nest, which makes smoke alarms and thermostats, and Facebook\u2019s purchase of Oculus Rift, which makes a virtual reality headset.", "\u201cThe next thing was mobile. Mobile is now the last thing,\u201d Fred Wilson, the venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. \u201cAnd all of these big tech companies are looking for the next thing to make sure they don\u2019t miss it.\u201d", "Surely Jeff Bezos understands all this. So why is Amazon seemingly looking backward, by introducing a phone? Maybe the phone is just a decoy for what Amazon is really betting the next computing platform to be, in whatever form it takes, like wearable computers.", "The special things about the phone are not in the device itself, but in its connection to Amazon\u2019s enormous cloud and computing power. The phone uses computer vision and other tools to recognize everything from art to TV shows to a shoe box. It lets people seamlessly buy from among 100 million items at Amazon, and it offers unlimited photo storage.", "Many of the things Amazon\u2019s phone can do are already on the phone you have. Many of the things you use most on your phone, like Google Maps, aren\u2019t on the Fire. But even if the Fire\u2019s 3D-like images and tangle-free earbud cords are not enough to make you switch phones, Amazon must be thinking: What if, say, a contact lens could do all that?

The case began in 2010, but officials had been making informal inquiries since at least mid-2009.", "In recent weeks, Mr. Almunia has begun the process of dismissing the 20 existing complaints in the antitrust case. That is the normal procedure before a definitive settlement is signed.", "At the heart of the proposed deal is a system that will display rivals\u2019 search services \u2014 for mapping, hotels and shopping, among others \u2014 more prominently when people conduct searches using Google.", "Google would use a box to display at least three competitors each time its own results appear in specialized searches. The deal would last for five years and affect any search and promoted-product services that Google introduces in Europe.", "Mr. Almunia said in his letter that this deal still could \u201cbe modified in some respects.\u201d", "The case is far from the only regulatory headache Google faces in Europe. The highest court in the bloc decided last month that Google must grant users of its search engine a right to delete links about themselves in some cases, obliging the company to do far more to protect individual privacy.", "Yet vigorous antitrust enforcement still remains one of the biggest threats to Google in Europe, and elsewhere if other regulators follow Europe\u2019s lead.", "Last month Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, speaking in Brussels, called for a more aggressive stance toward American companies like Google, \u201cwith regard to antitrust laws\u201d to help improve the bloc\u2019s ability to generate competition.", "Critics from industry groups have called Mr. Almunia\u2019s proposal flawed, saying it is unlikely to dent Google\u2019s market power in Europe, where it has an even stronger position in Internet search than it has in the United States.", "\u201cThis settlement totally misses the big picture,\u201d said Thomas H\u00f6ppner, a lawyer for the German industry groups Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger, which represents newspapers, and Verband Deutscher Zeitschriftenverleger, which represents magazines. \u201cThe companies I represent lose traffic to Google or get demoted in its search engine every time they launch a new service for things like finding places to eat or viewing videos, and that problem just won\u2019t be addressed by this deal.\u201d", "It is against that background that Mr. Almunia wrote his letter, in which he resisted calls to bundle a welter of recent antitrust complaints into the ongoing investigation. That would prolong the case and could lead to more serious consequences for Google.", "Mr. Almunia also suggested that he was being pressured to take action outside the realm of antitrust, on issues like how Google manages its tax liabilities and treats personal data.", "\u201cIt seems that the commitments proposed by Google in February have become the focal point of all the concerns and fears that consumers, competitors, and governments have about the company,\u201d he wrote, referring to the month this year when the terms of the proposed settlement were formally announced. \u201cThis is an unfortunate state of affairs.\u201d", "Mr. Almunia \u2014 who needs the support of his colleagues to finalize the current proposed deal \u2014 has promoted settling with technology companies as a way of getting quicker results for consumers in the fast-moving sector. That approach would be tarnished if Mr. Almunia, who leaves office in October, leaves his successor, who still must be chosen, saddled with unfinished business.", "A spokesman for Mr. Almunia declined to comment on the letter.", "The letter will make grim reading for Google, which has been determined to avoid a guilty finding that would restrict its ability to expand in Europe and which could be extremely costly.", "Without a settlement, Google could be fined up to 10 percent of its annual global sales, or nearly $6 billion. Fines have never gone that high. But antitrust experts say that such penalties are set to rise. This month, the second-highest court in the European Union upheld a 1.06 billion euro, or $1.44 billion, fine against Intel representing 4 percent of the maximum.", "A spokesman for Google referred to previous comments by the company\u2019s general counsel, who said in February that the agreement with the commission \u201caddresses its competition concerns.\u201d", "Google successfully settled a similar investigation with the authorities in the United States without major changes to its business. Its proposed European deal already goes much further than that American agreement.", "Beyond the current inquiry, the \u201cmost advanced investigation\u201d concerns the company\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones, wrote Mr. Almunia.", "The issue here is \u201cGoogle\u2019s promotion of Android,\u201d where Google has up to 80 percent of the European market, wrote Mr. Almunia. \u201cThe allegations relate to practices that may prevent the development of alternative operating systems to Android\u201d and to \u201crestrictive conditions in agreements\u201d with phone makers and networks.", "Additional complaints \u201clodged in recent weeks\u201d fell into at least three other broad areas concerning the ways that Google was said to use its video catalogue to help give YouTube an unfair advantage; it uses its AdWords product to sell advertising space; and it uses another advertising product it calls AdSense.", "The letter also said that \u201cother complaints include one relating to Google\u2019s use of images from third-party websites and, more recently, a potential complaint about the pressure Google is putting on independent music labels to extract better terms in its negotiations for a new streaming product on YouTube.\u201d", "Lawyers for Google\u2019s rivals said Mr. Almunia\u2019s letter, which foresees an almost endless series of antitrust battles for Google in the future, should do nothing to ease concerns about the current proposed deal. \u201cWe have repeatedly offered studies like eye-tracking data proving that people will not look at these display boxes or click them,\u201d said David Wood, legal counsel for Icomp, an industry group backed by Microsoft. \u201cThe display idea is manifestly inadequate, and Mr. Almunia has put forward no studies or arguments proving otherwise.\u201d"], "https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/kids-and-parents-happy-to-move-up-sad-to-say-goodbye/": ["This morning was the \u201cstep-up\u201d ceremony at my children\u2019s school.

I\u2019m not one bit bored; I\u2019m hanging on every word of every speech.", "And yet as I sit there, sniffling and grabbing for another tissue out of my camera bag, a part of me would still chew that arm off to escape, not the ceremony, but the emotion. I may have embraced all that has been said about being truly present in life, and appreciating the marvel of an ordinary day, but I am so much better at fresh beginnings and I would so much rather flee the goodbyes.

What\u2019s more, wealth advisers used to rely on commissions, meaning that they would make money from every transaction executed on a client\u2019s behalf. But the industry has shifted more toward a fee-based model, which pays an adviser a percentage of the money under management. That may be fine for an older adviser who has a large book of clients, but it can be a deterrent for people just starting out in the business.

There are too few women in the Equilar study to make anything of that difference in pay or to come to any definitive conclusions about gender and pay at the C.E.O. level.

The pay gap at the executive level does not seem as extreme or inevitable as at lower levels, according to half a dozen studies on executive compensation.

But if a woman on a path to management sticks around for 15 years or more, she has a greater chance than a man of being C.E.O.

Rather, they were dissatisfied with their jobs, sometimes because of discrimination, disrespect or family caretaking responsibilities, according to his analysis of previous research.", "\u201cPeople who rise to the top from the smaller group of women are going to be the extraordinary ones, more so than the ones that rise to the top of the larger group of men,\u201d Mr. Gayle said. \u201cMen stick around longer and they basically wait out the women.\u201d", "Tech Rock Stars", "If business as a whole is difficult for many women holding executive posts, one industry seems to be better: technology.", "That is surprising, because tech is a particularly unwelcoming industry for women.

I suspect we\u2019ll view this year as the real beginning of the post-Jobs Apple. There were some subtle but powerful psychological shifts on display.", "Given Apple\u2019s power in the marketplace, some of them \u2013 like a health and fitness clearinghouse, a smart home automation development kit, and a serious foray into cloud hosting and development environments \u2013 could have big effects down the road. Plus, did I mention the third-party keyboards!? That is huge!", "Farhad: So we pretty much agree, except for the part about expecting a parade of minor design tweaks. My expectations were not that low, but I will admit to a sense of apathy beforehand. We had all heard the rumors that there would not be anything huge here; I had even considered skipping the show. And I too wasn\u2019t bowled over by the initial design changes in OS X Yosemite \u2013 feel the translucency!", "But then Apple began to pile surprise upon surprise.

For instance, the fact that I couldn\u2019t add an app like Dropbox to the share menu. Or that I have got to go through hoops to add a link-shortening shortcut to Safari. All the little power-user customizations I\u2019m used to on my desktop and in most other computing environments have long been shut out on the iPhone and iPad.", "Mostly, I have been O.K. with these sacrifices.

And I wonder how well Apple\u2019s new developer tools will play out in practice. Will all the various third-party extensions clutter your phone? Will third-party keyboards invite malware or invasions of your privacy? Will the whole OS still feel welcoming to novices?", "I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m happy to see this play out. And I\u2019m very surprised.", "Molly: I think we both agree that the coolest announcements concerning Yosemite (yes, that\u2019s the name) have to do with the Handoff capabilities between iOS and OS X. You\u2019ll be able to see text messages in the iMessage interface, see who\u2019s calling your phone as a pop-up on your computer and even answer the call \u2013 and even place calls from either your contacts or say, a web page.", "Proximity awareness will let your phone know you are near your computer and either automatically create a Wi-Fi hot spot or pass off an email that is in progress.", "Personally, the latter sounds like a battery killer to me; always-on proximity means the phone is always listening, right? And the email handoff requires you to be using the Mail app, which almost no one I know uses. Same with the ability to get texts in iMessage \u2013 presumably, you have to use iMessage, which I do not.", "Those things sound handy, but instead of having constant pop-ups on my phone or computer nudging me to migrate to a different device, I\u2019m a lot more interested in seamless cloud-based sharing, maybe in the newly announced iCloud Drive, and smooth AirDrop capabilities. (Although I do really want the caller ID on my computer. That\u2019s pretty great.)", "Farhad: Handoff was my favorite thing of the day. That\u2019s not because it looks like it will be able to do much of anything, yet, that I can\u2019t already do through other methods. I can already start an email on my phone and finish it on my computer (I use Gmail). I can already hand off web windows between different machines (I use Chrome). I can even get phone calls to ring my computer (I use Google Voice, which works in Google\u2019s Hangouts app).", "But all of my solutions to multimachine complexity \u2013 all of which are run by Google \u2013 feel piecemeal, and they are not at all easy to use. Handoff might not offer much of anything novel now, but I\u2019m intrigued by its long-term potential. Managing the transitions between lots of different computing devices could very well be the primary software problem of the next five to 10 years. And until now, Apple had pretty much ignored the problem.", "Handoff and iCloud Drive suggest that the company is now going to put serious effort into making your many devices work together as one. And it\u2019s going to do so in an Apple-y way, making the transitions between your devices one-touch and automatic. If it works (which is always a question with Apple\u2019s cloud stuff) it could be the beginning a big improvement in how we manage the headache of owning too many gadgets.", "Molly: For me, Health and the HealthKit framework, plus HomeKit, were the most interesting announcements in iOS 8, or at least the ones with the most long-term potential. I guess I\u2019ll probably come to appreciate family sharing and interactive notifications, but if my iPhone can become a true clearinghouse for storing health and fitness information from apps, wearables and even medical databases or doctors\u2019 offices, that could be huge.", "And home automation is looking for a unifying principle: right now it\u2019s a lot of disparate devices with varying control mechanisms. If developers start building devices that can talk to iPhones and iPads \u2013 a way that people are already starting to control light bulbs and Nest thermostats \u2013 they can really corner that market. I also like that Apple is opening up TouchID for use by other apps, although mine almost never works.", "Farhad: I\u2019m lukewarm on HealthKit and HomeKit. Both could transform two chaotic sectors of the so-called \u201cInternet of Things\u201d into something useful. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to seem them failing on the launchpad for the same reasons that Apple\u2019s card-managing app PassBook never took off.", "Both will need buy-in from device makers, and I\u2019m not sure many makers of health and home devices want to turn over all of their user interaction to Apple, which could well become a competitor in both markets. So we\u2019ll see.", "Molly, is it really true that your Touch ID almost never works? Mine works almost all the time, and I feel safer keeping it on. I can\u2019t wait until other apps get to tap into it.", "Molly: It\u2019s true. It almost never works. But I\u2019m open to the possibility that it\u2019s just faulty hardware \u2013 I just don\u2019t have time to go have it checked out.", "Molly: I think app extensibility is the biggest announcement of the day. The ability for apps to talk to other apps and to Apple apps will address one of my biggest complaints about my iPhone compared with my Android phone. Right now, apps can\u2019t talk to each other or to default apps \u2013 or really even the OS, at least not very much.", "That limits the platform\u2019s ability to do true contextual computing, it prevents things like password managers from autofilling passwords in apps, which I can do on Android with LastPass, and it puts the information in one app in a little silo when it could be useful to many others.", "Also, extensibility is the key to things like smartwatch integration (so maybe they don\u2019t have to build their own), to HealthKit and HomeKit integration and to so many of the other services they announced today. To me, this is a sign of Apple maturing into the spider at the center of the web. You don\u2019t have to build everything when you can work with everything: that\u2019s a huge change in Apple\u2019s thinking, in my opinion.", "I\u2019ve been saying for a long time that Apple won\u2019t make a TV and maybe won\u2019t even make a watch. It would be easier to build those things now that they have these new frameworks in place, but they might not need to, when they can just control someone else\u2019s TV or smartwatch or fitness wearable.", "Farhad: Yup, I totally agree, as I said above.", "But let me say something else about developers. What do you think of the fact that Apple is now baking into its apps so many features that were first deployed by outside developers? (It borrowed from Dropbox, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Android and Windows Phone, as far as I can tell.) Is this unfair, or just part of the game? And more to the point: Do you think it will dissuade developers from banking on iOS?", "I\u2019ll answer my own question in the negative. The App Store is too lucrative a place for many developers to quit out of a sense of being wronged. Apple\u2019s liberal borrowing also helps users \u2013 they get innovative features without having to download any apps. But as I said on Twitter, it is cocky of Apple to use its developer conference to release a bunch of features aimed directly at third-party apps.", "Molly: Let\u2019s just say it like it is: a lot of features we saw announced this week are catch-up features, like cloud-based photo sharing with auto-uploading and instant photo touch-ups \u00e0 la Google\u2019s \u201cauto-awesome\u201d feature.", "I was happy to see iCloud pricing come down, though, to just under $50 a year for 200GB. Still worth noting that you only get 5GB for free, however, compared to Flickr\u2019s 1TB free. But there\u2019s a lot of benefit in auto-uploading to a service that is integrated into all your Apple devices, if you are an all-Apple household.", "But features like predictive typing that learns from your language are pretty obvious, as are accessing Siri by saying \u201chey, Siri\u201d or being able to swipe a message to the left to delete it in mobile Mail app. I\u2019m glad they are there, but I\u2019m not going to pretend they are new inventions.", "Farhad: I\u2019m happy about the iCloud price cut too, but not that happy. Apple has more than $150 billion in cash. Last year, it decided to give away many of its own apps and its operating system updates for free. So would it really kill Apple to let me store all my photos on all my devices in iCloud, for free?", "I swear to you, if Apple made this promise \u2013 if you buy an iDevice, you\u2019ll get storage for every photo you take as long as you keep your device \u2013 it would make for a killer ad campaign.

As it happened, few of the takers were smooth-cheeked, lavish growths of facial hair being another notable Pitti Uomo trend.", "Behind the apparent quaintness of all that revivalism there is real local and global economic significance: \u201cOne by one, the lights are going back on in little factories,\u201d said Alison Hargreaves, head of publicity for Grenson shoes, whose booth at the Touch pavilion was crowded with buyers drawn to newly reimagined classics that appeal to influencers like Nickelson Wooster, the Instagram style hero known in the blogosphere as the WoostGod. \u201cAt the moment, I\u2019m obsessed with them,\u201d he said.", "A generation that grew up wearing jeans and sneakers has some catching up to do, according to Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W magazine and curator of a specially commissioned installation at Pitti Uomo titled \u201cDe\u2019 (Millennials) Costumi.\u201d", "\u201cThe codes are being rewritten,\u201d said Mr. Tonchi, whose exhibit took as its inspiration a timeless book of etiquette for young men, created in the 16th century by the Florentine Giovanni Della Casa. \u201cFirst you learn the rules and then you can break them,\u201d Mr. Tonchi added. \u201cWell, maybe not all the rules: Signore Della Casa said, \u2018Don\u2019t stick your hands in places you keep covered.\u201d\u2019 Advice like that has lost no relevance since it was written.", "Fascinating things happen where rules are torqued, when rote codes meet innovation. Take the capsule collection that Pharrell Williams\u2019s Bionic Yarn created in a partnership with G-Star RAW jeans. Using fibers spun from recycled plastic waste gathered from the world\u2019s oceans, they produced jeans that both look cool (Mr. Williams\u2019s Otto the Octopus logo is incorporated subtly into the weave) and help humans \u201ccome together for Big Blue,\u201d as Mr. Williams noted in a written statement.", "Consider another capsule collection, this one generated by the pairing of Kazumasa Kobayashi, designer of a Japanese cult bicycle and bike wear, and Spiewak, a 110-year-old U.S. label founded to provide stevedores on the Brooklyn waterfront with work clothes and now owned by a Swiss company. From that collaboration came a gunmetal gray bomber jacket detailed with such precision that its zippered front opens to reveal an inner zippered half lining of mesh, a way of keeping covered and ventilated as you fly around the city on your fixed-gear bike.", "\u201cYou know, there is more humor in physics than fashion,\u201d said Sebastian Dollinger, the 30-year-old designer for Eton, a Swedish shirtmaker founded in 1928.

And now Super Duper hats are sold at Barneys New York.", "Their best seller, the Hobo Hat, is as good an example as any of the prevalent spirit of adaptive reuse. \u201cWe thought it was boring that the only hats you could find for traveling were rolling hats,\u201d said Mr. Gioli. Consulting vintage images of the itinerant railway track-layers known as gandy dancers, the partners came up with a hat intentionally designed to be squashed, its rumpled crown part of the charm.", "Consistent with a spirit of cross-pollination that has characterized Mr. Napoleone\u2019s tenure as head of Pitti, certain Super Duper styles come lined with Japanese high tech fabric, introduced to the pair by fellow exhibitors from a label called Norwegian Rain.", "\u201cIn Norway, it rains two days out of three,\u201d explained T-Michael, a former tailor who designs this line of elegantly severe raincoats. \u201cWe met Matteo and Veronica at Pitti and thought that meshing their Florentine tenderness with Norwegian functionalism would be a brilliant idea.\u201d", "And it is."], "https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/the-t-m-i-pregnancy/": ["Becoming a mother was so simple when I became a mother.

The contracts continue. Some employees do not want Palantir aiding Israel, because they disagree with its policies toward Palestinians. There are still contracts with the Israeli government. Palantir has decided not to work with China.

It figured out how computers could spot activity \u2014 like a flurry of payments to a brand new account \u2014 at a global scale. The flagged actions would then be put before a PayPal employee to investigate.", "Palantir\u2019s founders thought the same approach would work for national security. Almost no one in the venture capital world agreed except In-Q-Tel, the C.I.A.\u2019s venture fund, which gave Palantir $2 million; Mr. Thiel eventually put in about $30 million of his own money. In-Q-Tel gave the founders introductions to the C.I.A. and other spy outfits.", "Palantir\u2019s first full-fledged C.I.A. job was in 2008. Mr. Karp got more work from word of mouth, and donated Palantir\u2019s technology to cyberactivists, who mapped Russian hackers attacking the nation of Georgia in 2008. (The spyware was rumored to have found Osama bin Laden, but Palantir would not confirm or deny such jobs.)", "To drum up private-sector business, Mr. Thiel called on Mr. Ovitz, whom he knew through Marc Andreessen, the former Netscape whiz kid turned venture capitalist. At first, Mr. Ovitz thought Palantir could be used in selling online ads, but the housing crisis changed his thinking. Banks had thousands of homes in foreclosure across the country, and no idea how to efficiently clear the backlog in a collapsing market.", "\u201cThe idea was to pick one bank, and the rest would follow,\u201d Mr. Ovitz said. JPMorgan was the first. Much as Palantir figured out navigating Baghdad by analyzing recent roadside attacks, satellite images and moon phases, it derived home-sale prices by looking at school enrollments, employment trends and retail sales. Data that JPMorgan thought would take two years to integrate was put into action in eight days.", "JPMorgan still uses Palantir for cybersecurity, fraud detection and other work, loading half a terabyte of data onto a Palantir system each day, according to a Palantir video.

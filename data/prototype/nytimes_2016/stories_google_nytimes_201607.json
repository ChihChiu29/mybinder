Part of the challenge has been direct comparisons to Facebook, which lures more than 1.65 billion monthly visitors to its site.", "For a time, Twitter was able to sidestep concerns about its ability to add new users because of the strength of its advertising business; revenue was growing in the high double-digit figures.", "That has changed. Over the last six months, Twitter has experienced slower growth in advertiser demand, spooking investors and causing its stock to plummet.", "Twitter\u2019s inability to attract new users caught up to it, analysts said, causing a stagnation in advertiser demand. As Twitter is less able to increase the size of its user base, advertisers are more likely to buy ads on Facebook, which has a huge global reach, or perhaps Snapchat, which caters largely to younger audiences.", "\u201cIt all goes back to the company focusing on building a ubiquitous product and failing to deliver on that promise,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group.", "To turn itself around, Twitter has bet on live streaming video. The company has struck agreements with the National Football League, Bloomberg and the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, among others, to live stream events.

Will they get their double IPAs and Russian imperial stouts to market if the new leviathan shuts them off to bolster flagging sales of its own Bud and Pilsner Urquell?", "The stakes are higher than whether you will be able to find your favorite Belgian-style lambic at the corner store. The new merger amounts to another step in the long decline of competition in many American industries.", "It is a decline that stunts entrepreneurship, hinders workers\u2019 mobility and slows productivity growth. Slowing this trend has emerged as a tempting new avenue to address the plight of a beleaguered working class. Reviving flagging American competition might even help stop America\u2019s ever-widening inequality.", "In April, President Obama issued an executive order calling on government agencies to look for ways to bolster competition in the industries they monitor.", "Hillary Clinton drew competition into the campaign trail, chastising dominant corporations for \u201cusing their power to raise prices, limit choices for consumers, lower wages for workers and hold back competition from start-ups and small businesses.\u201d", "And Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, made headlines last month when she called for antitrust agencies to crack down on Silicon Valley powers like Apple, Facebook and Google.", "Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, and Peter Orszag, former head of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, laid out some of the new thinking in a presentation last fall at Columbia University.", "Monopoly rents \u2014 the excess returns a company reaps when it does not have to deal with pesky competitors keeping prices down \u2014 could worsen inequality in a variety of ways. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate from Columbia University who served as top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, has asserted that exorbitant corporate profits are being run up through oligopolies and passed along to stockholders, raising the share of national income accruing to the rich.", "This may not fit snugly with the data, though. Notably, the rising share of income going to the top 1 percent is not driven mainly by overstuffed returns on investment but by the growing inequality in wages. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag suggest a different mechanism to fit this trend: Companies that reap monopoly rents are paying their workers more, sharing some of their rents with them. While that might sound a bit more egalitarian, it could be equally insidious.", "There is plenty of evidence that corporate concentration is on the rise. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag report that between 1997 and 2007 the market share of the 50 largest companies increased in three-fourths of the broad industry sectors followed by the census.", "In 1985 the top 10 banks had under 20 percent of banking assets. By 2010 they had more than half. Big Pharma too has become bigger, buying niche laboratories. So have hospitals: Between 2010 and 2014 there were 457 mergers in the hospital sector.", "Studies have found increased concentration in agricultural businesses and wireless communications as well. And as Senator Warren observed, critical technology markets are often controlled by a single player. Among airlines, there are only four major United States carriers left.", "Not everybody buys the new analysis linking market power and inequality. \u201cThis facile assumption that more antitrust means greater equality and wealth is just way overbroad,\u201d wrote Daniel Crane, an expert on antitrust law at the University of Michigan.", "Martin Gaynor, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former chief economist at the Federal Trade Commission, noted that competition policy was about increasing the economy\u2019s efficiency, not changing the distribution of the spoils. \u201cI don\u2019t think antitrust is a major tool for addressing inequality,\u201d he told me.", "Still, it would seem foolhardy to ignore the growing footprint of dominant companies, strutting their stuff across the broader economy.", "The best-understood downside comes from rising prices. John Kwoka, an antitrust expert at Northeastern University, made a study of dozens of mergers that were reviewed and ultimately approved by regulators. In 75 to 80 percent of the cases, they led to substantial price increases.", "There are more complex costs to consider. F. Michael Scherer, an antitrust economist at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, noted that as soon as the pharmaceutical giant Merck was cleared to take over Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a smaller lab that had developed a promising new antibiotic, it eliminated Cubist\u2019s research and development staff \u2014 curtailing research into several other promising drugs.", "The existence of Facebook might provide an incentive for some kid in a garage to design a cool new app for the social media giant. But Facebook might also have an interest in squelching innovations that do not fit its business model.", "Market power can throw sand in the economy\u2019s cogs in several ways. For one, it will make more sense for dominant companies to focus on protecting their rents than to risk money investing in new ventures. New entrepreneurs will think twice before trying to challenge a dominant firm.", "Anticompetitive behavior can weigh on wages too. A couple of years ago Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel were caught colluding not to poach each other\u2019s engineers. Similarly, seven hospitals in suburban Detroit were caught colluding to keep nurses\u2019 wages low.", "What about inequality? Workers who share in monopoly rents will always be better off than those who do not. This might explain the Communications Workers of America\u2019s support for AT&T\u2019s attempted acquisition of its wireless rival T-Mobile, which was struck down for being blatantly anticompetitive.", "How did the American economy get so concentrated? Technology surely helped. Tech giants like Google and Facebook benefit from economies of scale and network effects. It costs nothing to serve an additional search. Consumers will be drawn to the social media platforms that already have more users.", "Government watchdogs also messed up. Concerned only about local competition between bank branches, they allowed a huge nationwide concentration. \u201cAntitrusters stood by and sucked their thumbs while these mergers got through,\u201d Professor Scherer told me. Conditions imposed on troublesome mergers \u2014 like orders to sell assets or to refrain from certain behaviors \u2014 were mostly ineffective, Professor Kwoka said.", "How to fix it? Professor Kwoka suggests that when a given industry is already fairly concentrated, any future merger should be presumed to be anticompetitive, taking the burden of proof off the regulator\u2019s shoulders and putting the onus on the merging companies to prove it is not. Regulations also offer a promising tool: How about demanding that the Food and Drug Administration approve generic drugs more quickly?", "But what might help most is not some narrow change in the procedures to examine business combinations but a broadening of the objectives of competition policy. Antitrust economists might hate this idea, but perhaps it\u2019s time to broaden the discussion beyond how a decline in competition may hurt consumers, and to consider things other than narrow economic efficiency. That would include the way market concentration affects the distribution of the fruits of economic growth. It\u2019s not just about the price of beer."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/technology/yahoo-mail-verizon-sale-changes.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Verizon\u2019s announcement that it is acquiring Yahoo\u2019s operations is a turning point for an internet pioneer that claims a billion users visit its services each month.", "In addition to Yahoo\u2019s popular email service, Verizon is taking over content sites like Yahoo Sports and Yahoo News, as well as Yahoo-owned services that operate separately under their own brands, including the Tumblr social network and the Flickr photo-sharing service.", "Here are answers to some common questions about the impact of the deal.", "Q. What happens to my favorite Yahoo services now that Verizon is buying the company?", "A. Nothing for now. The deal is not expected to close until early next year, so for the moment, Yahoo is operating like it always has.", "After the deal closes, Verizon intends to keep Yahoo and its services as separate brands, according to Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of Verizon\u2019s AOL unit. \u201cYahoo is one of the most powerful brands in the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be investing in it.\u201d", "Wait, AOL? Verizon owns AOL? So will my Yahoo email become AOL email?", "No, Yahoo Mail is one of the company\u2019s most successful services and Verizon plans to keep it separate.", "What about other Yahoo services, like fantasy sports and Yahoo Finance?", "Mr. Armstrong said that the two companies have not yet sat down to work out all the transition plans, but the intention is to keep Yahoo\u2019s content sites and apps.", "Will Verizon keep Yahoo search? Will I still see the Yahoo search box in my Firefox browser?", "The future of search is fuzzier. Yahoo\u2019s current chief executive, Marissa Mayer, has invested heavily in search, but the company has continued to lose ground to Google.", "Mr. Armstrong was noncommittal on search, saying that would be a topic of discussion between the two companies. \u201cYahoo has products that have not launched yet on search,\u201d he said, and Verizon wants to evaluate those.", "Under Yahoo\u2019s search partnership with Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox web browser, anyone who buys Yahoo must offer a search product through the end of 2019 or pay a hefty breakup fee.", "What about my personal data? Will Verizon share data about my cellphone use to Yahoo\u2019s advertisers and will Yahoo use what it knows about my web surfing to sell ads on my phone?", "The Federal Communications Commission fined Verizon in March for tracking people\u2019s cellphone browsing habits without their consent.

Other images are atmospheric glimpses of an era that feels both bygone (horse-drawn wagons for delivering flowers) and ever-present (children on the stoops of Brooklyn\u2019s classic brownstones).", "The show \u201creally captures that time when Brooklyn Heights was not the wealthy place that it was in the mid-1800s, when it was the original suburbs, and certainly not the place it is now, but was a little marginal,\u201d said Marcia Ely, who organized the exhibition with the help of the Attie family.", "Eli Attie, David\u2019s son, was an adolescent when his father died in 1982. He knew of the work, which often took place in their home studio, but only recently did he realize the extent of the archive and the number of 20th-century luminaries his father photographed. Procrastination, he admits, led him to the discovery. While working on a script \u2014 he is a television writer whose credits include episodes of \u201cThe West Wing\u201d and \u201cHouse\u201d \u2014 he looked up his father on Google.

He actually left commercial illustration in the 1950s, as it began to fade, and became a fairly successful commercial photographer.\u201d", "A British photographer, Brian Homer, reached out to Eli on Twitter to say that he had been influenced by his father\u2019s 1977 photography book, \u201cRussian Self-Portraits,\u201d and asked if there were more images on hand that could be used to revive and exhibit David\u2019s work.", "They met at Eli\u2019s childhood home, a townhouse in Manhattan where his mother, the painter Dotty Attie, still lives.", "Mr. Attie used his iPhone to take some photos of framed prints around the house, and he sent them to some gallery curators. \u201cIf anyone responded,\u201d he said, \u201cit was with a brutal rejection.\u201d", "He was told that if he wanted his father\u2019s work to get any attention, he would need to gather any photos he could of famous people. In searching, he found surprising photographs and undeveloped outtakes. When Mr. Attie was younger, \u201cI didn\u2019t give his work much thought,\u201d he said. As an adult looking in earnest, he was impressed to find his father\u2019s photos of the Band, Leonard Bernstein and Bobby Fischer, among others.", "He also found an envelope that said \u201cHoliday, Capote, A3/58.\u201d", "\u201cFor me, it was just another celebrity,\u201d Mr. Attie said of the discovery.

The current poaching epidemic started in 2009, but so slowly that researchers in Samburu did not realize its severity. \u201cIn 2010, we started getting very concerned; 2011 was a disaster,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said.", "Social networks are just one area of research for Save the Elephants, in addition to how elephants are migrating and whether orphans show negative physical effects after their mothers are killed. And though these conservation biologists study animals, their work starkly reflects the effects humans have on the elephants\u2019 environment.", "To understand how social networks have been affected, researchers analyzed 16 years of data about Samburu\u2019s elephants and found surprising resilience. For example, the researchers recorded positive interactions between elephants like wrapping trunks, smelling one another\u2019s mouths and rubbing one another. The researchers also noted negative behavior, like how often elephants pushed orphans away versus nonorphans.", "Daughters not only emulated their mothers\u2019 social behavior, younger elephants even rebuilt networks through distant social connections to families whose most mature adults had been killed. Some new matriarchs took to caring for the young immediately, but the reactions among orphans are still being studied.", "\u201cThe story of the Samburu orphans is one of the most poignant examples of the importance of collaboration and friendship I have seen in a nonhuman system,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said. \u201cHere are wonderful examples of these orphans moving on with their lives and rebuilding their highly and critically important social world.\u201d", "In 2014, Kenya toughened penalties for poaching and wildlife trafficking with fines up to $200,000, or even life imprisonment. Previously, maximum fines were about $400.", "A couple of days later, Dr. Wittemyer strained to spot an elephant from the window of a six-seat Cessna that looped above Samburu. From that height, the landscape was reduced to splotches of green atop a palette of dusty brown. He and Frank Pope, Save the Elephant\u2019s chief operating officer and the plane\u2019s pilot, were looking for an elephant that had lost its radio collar.", "Finding the multiton creature proved harder than it sounded. The landscape\u2019s monotonous patchwork mimics an elephant\u2019s coloring, and the animals often seek shelter beneath trees during the heat of day. The plane circled and lurched through the hot afternoon air, but there was no sign of the errant animal.", "Save the Elephants is studying the migration of elephants by using GPS radio collars and satellite-generated maps. In the past year, conservationists have put collars on 40 Samburu elephants to expand research on their movements.", "Through this work, Save the Elephants knows that some elephants move nearly 40 miles a day, usually under cover of night. They cover so much ground to find the food and water that depends on Kenya\u2019s rains, as well as to mate and to find safe havens. \u201cWe collared Habiba\u2019s mother for several years,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said. \u201cWe knew her range. She went down south past the mountains to Il Ngwezi,\u201d he added, referring to a conservation area. \u201cUnfortunately, they all got killed.\u201d", "Because the radio collars show where elephants are almost in real time, wildlife rangers can be deployed to elephants\u2019 locations to safeguard them or help them if injured.", "As Kenya builds more highways, railways and infrastructure, and as towns expand, researchers are studying migratory patterns of elephants in land increasingly shared with more people. The country\u2019s growing population places higher demands on land, food, water, transportation and other resources.", "Indeed, Kenya plans to build a corridor that includes a railway, a highway and an oil pipeline, from the Kenyan coast cutting through the country\u2019s interior to Ethiopia and South Sudan.", "\u201cWith these developments comes the potential to sever migration routes,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said.", "A new railway between the capital, Nairobi, and Mombasa, the region\u2019s major port on the Kenyan coast, is on track to be completed next year. A collision between wildlife and people in the region has worsened this year with the elephants unable to move between the two halves of Tsavo, the country\u2019s largest national park, because of construction of a 380-mile elevated railway. The park is home to half of the country\u2019s 25,000 elephants. And in southern Kenya near Amboseli National Park, conservationists worry that new settlements have sprouted up dangerously close to wildlife crossings.", "With information about how elephants migrate, land use planners, developers and politicians can work around wildlife routes, regulate human expansion and modify infrastructure.", "For example, elephants and other wildlife are using underpasses built beneath highways connecting forests in central Kenya and northern rangelands. This planning also helps Kenya\u2019s seminomadic herders whose livestock must graze and drink.", "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get at an elephant\u2019s mind \u2014 why it uses space across the ecosystem the way it does,\u201d Dr. Wittemyer said. \u201cThis is fundamental for land use planning: what kinds of areas we need to conserve outright, what types we need to facilitate movement through, and what kinds of areas are not essential to elephants.\u201d", "Back on the ground at the research camp, Mr. Pope of Save the Elephants flipped open his computer to a Google Earth map of the area. Orange spots depicting the elephants with radio collars are closely tracked. The previous night, one elephant covered almost 25 miles, slowly at first along electric fences and past towns. Beyond the human settlements, he made a beeline to a conservation area where he stayed and hardly moved.", "Mr. Pope flipped to another screen with a wildlife news feed from Asia, where stories from India involved clashes between humans and elephants, some resulting in death on both sides. India\u2019s dense population contributes to the conflict.", "Across Africa, human populations are growing and pressures on land are increasing. Kenya\u2019s population of 43 million is expected to exceed 81 million by 2050. In 28 African countries, the population is projected to more than double by 2050.", "\u201cSome conflict arises when elephants are trying to move to another area and they\u2019re forced to go through places where people live,\u201d Mr. Pope said. \u201cIf we can define and protect wildlife corridors, we have a hope of preventing this type of conflict, which is the primary challenge facing elephants in India.\u201d", "On another afternoon, the Ph.D researcher Jenna Parker spent two hours watching a small group of orphans from the Spices family. They rested beneath an acacia as the noon sun burned overhead. A juvenile rested his trunk on a tree while a 4-year-old calf relaxed by lying down on his side. The bigger elephants became heavy lidded and stood resting their trunks, like canes, on the ground.", "Finally, the herd stirred, with elephants named Dill and Celery releasing a stream of droppings. When the elephants lumbered off, Ms. Parker jumped out of the car with plastic gloves and vials ready. She scooped up the warm, grass-green dung for her collection of more than 1,200 samples that she will test for parasites, the stress hormone cortisol and E. coli bacteria.", "Ms. Parker is studying whether orphans show physiological stress after mothers have been killed. The goal is to understand how humans, through poaching, \u201chave altered the well-being of another highly social, cognitively advanced species,\u201d she said.", "It will take several years for her research to yield results. \u201cScience is a slow process,\u201d Ms. Parker said.

It is not a sale of the publicly traded company. Instead, it is a sale of the Yahoo subsidiary and some related assets to Verizon.", "The sale is being done in two steps. The first step will be the transfer of any assets related to Yahoo business to a singular subsidiary. This includes the stock in the business subsidiaries that make up Yahoo that are not already in the single subsidiary, as well as the odd assets like benefit plan rights. This is what is being sold to Verizon. A license of Yahoo\u2019s oldest patents is being held back in the so-called Excalibur portfolio. This will stay with Yahoo, as will Yahoo\u2019s stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan.", "It is hard to overestimate how complex an asset sale like this is. Some of the assets are self-contained, but they must be gathered up and transferred. Employees need to be shuffled around and compensation arrangements redone. Many contracts, like the now-infamous one struck with the search engine Mozilla, which may result in a payment of up to a $1 billion, will contain change-of-control provisions that will be set off and have to be addressed. Tax issues always loom large.", "In the second step, at the closing, Yahoo will sell the stock in the single subsidiary to Verizon. At that point, Yahoo will change its name to something without \u201cYahoo\u201d in it. My favorite is simply Remain Co., the name Yahoo executives are using. Remain Co. will become a holding company for the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stock. Included will also be $10 billion in cash, plus the Excalibur patent portfolio and a number of minority investments including Snapchat. Ahh, if only Yahoo had bought Snapchat instead of Tumblr (indeed, if only Yahoo had bought Google or Facebook when it had the chance).", "Because it is a sale of a subsidiary, the $4.8 billion will be paid to Yahoo. Its shareholders will not receive any money unless Yahoo pays it out in a dividend (after paying taxes). Instead, Yahoo shareholders will be left holding shares in the renamed company.", "Verizon\u2019s Yahoo will then be run under the same umbrella as AOL. It is unclear whether there will be a further merger of the two businesses after the acquisition. Plans for Yahoo are still a bit in flux in part because of the abnormal sale process.", "As for Remain Co., it will become a so-called investment company. This is a special designation for a company that holds securities for investment but does not operate a working business. Investment companies are subject to special regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Remain Co. will probably just sit there, returning cash to shareholders and waiting for Alibaba to buy it in a tax-free transaction. (Alibaba says it has no plans to do this, but most people do not believe this).", "The rights of Yahoo shareholders in this sale will be different from those in an ordinary sale, when an entire company is bought.", "Ordinary sales are done in one of two ways: in a merger where the target is merged into a subsidiary of the buyer and the target shareholders receive the cash (or other consideration), or in a tender offer that gives the target shareholders a choice to tender into the offer or not. Then there will be a merger where the target is merged into the buyer\u2019s subsidiary and the target shareholders are forcibly squeezed out, receiving the merger consideration. (if you want to know why you would choose one structure over another, I wrote a good primer in 2009.)", "In either case, shareholders get a say. They either vote on the merger or decide whether to tender into the offer.", "In both cases, there would be appraisal rights if the buyer pays cash. This means that shareholders can object to the deal by not voting for it or not tendering into the offer and instead asking a court to value their shares \u2013 this is what happened in Dell\u2019s buyout in 2013.", "The Yahoo deal, however, is not a sale of the public company. It is an asset sale, in which there is only a shareholder vote if there is a sale of \u201call\u201d or \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the assets of the company. Yahoo is not all of the assets or even \u201csubstantially all\u201d \u2013 the Alibaba shares being left behind in Remain Co. are worth about $28 billion, or six times the value of the cash Verizon is paying for the Yahoo assets it is buying.", "The courts have held that the definition of \u201csubstantially all\u201d includes a change of business in a company because of an asset sale where the assets are \u201cqualitatively vital.\u201d And that certainly applies here. So there will be a vote \u2013 indeed, Yahoo has no problem with a vote \u2013 and shareholders are desperate to sell at this point.", "There will be no appraisal rights, however. Again, in an asset sale, there are no appraisal rights. So anyone who votes against the deal and thinks this is a bum price is out of luck.", "The different standards for voting and appraisal rights apply because the structure of the deal is a quirk of the law in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, that allows lawyers to sometimes work around these issues simply by changing the way a deal is done.", "In Yahoo\u2019s case, this is not deliberate, though. It is simply the most expedient way to get rid of the assets.", "Whether this is the most tax-efficient way is unclear to me as a nontax lawyer (email me if you know). Yahoo is likely to have a tax bill on the sale, possibly a substantial one. And I presume there were legal reasons for not using a Morris Trust structure, in which Yahoo would have been spun off and immediately sold to Verizon so that only Yahoo\u2019s shareholders paid tax on the deal. In truth, the Yahoo assets being sold are only about 10 percent of the value of the company, so the time and logistics for such a sale when Yahoo is a melting ice cube may not have been worth it.", "Finally, if another bidder still wants to acquire Yahoo, it has time. The agreement with Verizon allows Yahoo to terminate the deal and accept a superior offer by paying a $144 million breakup fee to Verizon. And if Yahoo shareholders change their minds and want to stick with Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, and vote down the deal, there is a so-called naked no-vote termination fee of $15 million payable to Verizon to reimburse expenses.", "All in all, this was as hairy a deal as they come. There was the procedural and logistical complications of selling a company when the chief executive wanted to stay. Then there was the fact that this was an asset sale, including all of the challenges that go with it. Throw in all of the tax issues and the fact that this is a public company, and it is likely that the lawyers involved will have nightmares for years to come."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/fashion/mens-style/anti-internet-porn-addict.html": ["Alexander Rhodes sat along a stretch of grass, looking out over the Allegheny River.

Apps enable restaurants to gather data and feedback, and allow consumers to order ahead and skip long lines.", "\u201cOne of the biggest complaints at Sweetgreen is the line, so by reducing cash we\u2019re able to serve customers a lot faster,\u201d Mr. Neman said. At the six Sweetgreen locations where cash is not accepted, employees can perform 5 to 15 percent more transactions an hour, he said.", "In a cash-free environment, employees are also safer, Mr. Neman said.

Many Americans still use cash by choice or because they have no alternative.

Those transactions tend to be small in value. Mobile payments are expected to continue growing as well. Forrester Research forecasts in-store mobile payments will grow to nearly $34 billion in 2019 from about $4 billion in 2014. Sweetgreen has its own app, which allows customers to order and pay. The company\u2019s in-app purchases make up one-third of the company\u2019s transactions, Mr. Neman said.", "Another drawback of cashless restaurants is the elimination of anonymity. Credit cards and apps leave a digital trail that can leave consumers vulnerable to security breaches, which worries consumer privacy advocates. A cashless environment also excludes the unbanked, nearly 8 percent of the population, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation survey.", "Paying with cash can also help customers spend less and assign more value to their purchases, recent studies suggest.", "The poor and unbanked are a concern for Sweetgreen, Mr. Neman said. Should the experiment move toward a companywide policy, Sweetgreen is considering solutions to make its products available to those without credit or debit cards. One potential answer is to install gift card machines in select stores where customers could pay cash for Sweetgreen cards, he said.", "Consideration for the unbanked was among the chief reasons Bozzelli\u2019s Deli & Pizza relaxed its policy after opening a cash-free location in Washington this year, said the owner, Mike Bozzelli.", "A small group of opinionated patrons led Split Bread, a sandwich chain with two locations in San Francisco, to change its cashless policy about two years after opening in 2012. \u201cWhen we would get negative reactions, they were very, very strong,\u201d said David Silverglide, co-founder and chief executive at Good Food Guys, the company that owns Split Bread. \u201cCustomer preferences are really hard to shift when it comes to something as ingrained as cash.\u201d", "\u201cI think they were ahead of the trend,\u201d Sam Oches, editor of the quick-service restaurant industry magazine QSR, said of Split Bread.

The show followed each girl, beginning in her pregnancy, then through the baby\u2019s birth and early infancy. And viewers have been able to stay with their lives on the spinoffs \u201cTeen Mom,\u201d \u201cTeen Mom 2\u201d and \u201cTeen Mom 3.\u201di", "Some people worried that these shows would normalize teenage pregnancy. Instead, the shows reveal how grueling it truly is \u2014 the sleep deprivation, the losing struggle to complete high school, constant unromantic bickering with a boy who\u2019s a kid and a father, the pull from friends who can still party with impunity.", "These shows don\u2019t persuade girls to abandon birth control. They are birth control. As one tweeter said:", "Today, America\u2019s birthrate for teenage mothers has hit a historic low \u2014 less than 40 percent of what it was at its modern peak in 1991, when it was 61.8 births per 1,000 girls 15 to 19 years old. In 2014, the rate was 24.2 per 1,000. (In the 1950s, when more women married in their teens, the rate was even higher than the 1991 figure.)", "This is excellent news. Girls who get pregnant are less likely to finish their education, and their babies are at high risk for health problems, incarceration, academic troubles and, yes, teenage pregnancy \u2014 even after controlling for other factors.", "No one really knows why these birthrates have dropped. It\u2019s not because teenagers are having more abortions; those have dropped even more precipitously than births. The most important reason appears to be increased contraceptive use, perhaps as a result of comprehensive sex education and fear of H.I.V.", "Part of the decline may also be credited to \u201c16 and Pregnant.\u201d Teen pregnancy was already dropping in 2009 when the show made its debut, but then it began to fall three times as fast. Two economists, Melissa Kearney and Phillip Levine, found that after \u201c16\u201d began, declines in teenage births were highest in areas where more teenagers and young adults watched MTV. Google searches for \u201chow get birth control,\u201d \u201chow get abortion\u201d and the like spiked on the days after the show aired. The economists concluded that \u201c16\u201d was responsible for a 5.7 percent reduction in teen births in the year after the show began. (Teen abortion rates continued to fall as well.)", "Still, however, the United States has a far higher rate of teenage pregnancies than most developed countries. Three-quarters of these pregnancies are unplanned, and 30 percent end in abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization committed to advancing reproductive rights.", "But this could change soon, if other states copy an idea that has had a smashing debut in Colorado.", "Over the past seven years, that state has cut the rate of babies born to girls ages 15 to 19 by nearly half. The teenage abortion rate is down by the same amount. Repeat teenage births have dropped by 58 percent. Colorado has accomplished this with no increase in teenage sexual activity or in sexually transmitted infections. And the state has saved tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars.", "A main reason for Colorado\u2019s success is a program to make long-acting reversible contraceptives (known as LARCs), such as hormonal implants or intrauterine devices, available cost-free to women and girls who want them.", "These protect from unwanted pregnancy for years \u2014 in the case of some IUDs, 10 years. Because these methods are \u201cset and forget,\u201d they are the most reliable forms of birth control. Each year 1 percent of women on LARCs get pregnant, compared with 9 percent of women on oral contraceptives and 18 percent of those who rely on condoms.", "When Colorado started the LARC program, only 2.5 percent of teenagers who came for family planning in clinics for low-income or uninsured people received LARCs. Last year that figure was 28.9 percent.", "The push for LARCs came from the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which offered Colorado a donation of $25 million to pay for a five-year program. Colorado accepted. When five years was up in 2015, Republicans in the State Legislature killed a bill that would have provided public funding for the program to continue. A coalition of private funders chipped in to keep it going at a low level.", "Now, the program is again on solid ground, because the legislature reversed itself this year. Colorado now spends at a rate only half of what the Buffett Foundation did, but it\u2019s enough, because Obamacare insurers and an expanded Medicaid program now pay for much of it. (These programs are supposed to cover birth control completely, but some women and components of the program, such as training for health care workers, aren\u2019t covered.)", "Since Medicaid would have paid for a vast majority of the unwanted births, reducing them provides immediate savings in tax revenues. Much larger are the long-term savings produced by a better life for both mother and child. One immediate benefit is that fewer children are born into poverty: Colorado has experienced a 25 percent drop in enrollment in the government\u2019s nutrition program for low-income women and children.", "The successes of the LARC program, now seven years old, have been widely reported. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends LARCs strongly, even for never-pregnant adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics calls them the \u201cfirst-line contraceptive choice\u201d for teenagers who don\u2019t choose abstinence. Yet other states are getting off to a slow start in replicating the program.", "The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials is trying to speed the process. The organization runs a working group that brings together officials from states seeking to provide LARCs to women who have just given birth. In 2014 the working group included officials from six states, and last year seven more states joined.", "The challenges illustrate how difficult it is to spread new medical practices. Larry Wolk, executive director and chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, has on occasion worn an IUD as a pin, so he can show people how small and light it is. Lots of people remember the Dalkon Shield of the 1970s and the injury and infertility it caused. The new IUDs are different. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your mother\u2019s IUD,\u201d Wolk likes to say.", "But just because something is safe doesn\u2019t mean people know it\u2019s safe. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing there\u2019s a lot of education needed,\u201d said Lisa Waddell, the community health and prevention chief program officer at the health officials\u2019 association. Many young women haven\u2019t heard of LARCs, and some who have believe they are not reversible (they are, usually instantly), or are painful to use (insertion of an IUD is painful, but it can\u2019t be felt afterward). Waddell says the best remedy is word of mouth from women who are happy with their birth control.", "Health workers must use care when talking about LARCs, as with other forms of birth control. America has a sorry history of coercing young minority women into sterilization or birth control. Some state legislators have talked about making birth control a requirement for welfare, for example. That comes from a thoughtful article in The Nation by Dani McClain; it discusses why past coercion has made some women wary of LARCs, and the importance of information without pressure.", "Any explanation, of course, requires a visit, and this can be a challenge. \u201cThe biggest barrier is access to care,\u201d said Amy Crockett, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Greenville Health System in South Carolina and clinical lead for the Birth Outcomes Initiative, a state government program. She said that LARCs could sometimes be a two-appointment procedure. \u201cWith a prescription for birth control pills, patients can go out and fill it. With a LARC, if we don\u2019t have one in the office that day, the patient has to come back.\u201d", "This is one reason many states focus on women who have just given birth \u2014 it can be the only time women see a health care provider when they aren\u2019t pregnant.

I\u2019m very excited because the 4th of July is my favorite holiday. It\u2019s summer, you\u2019re outside, you grill stuff \u2014 how can anything beat that? (Thanksgiving comes a close second, IMHO.) So, how are you celebrating America\u2019s birthday?", "Mike: Gas station burrito, sitting in my car.", "Farhad: Oh, so the same as every year. Anyway, speaking of fireworks, this was a surprisingly busy week in tech news. Let\u2019s start with Zenefits, the beleaguered human resources start-up, which did something almost unheard-of \u2014 it gave up more of its equity to existing investors as a way to compensate them for its recently terrible behavior.", "In 2015, several large investors poured $500 million into Zenefits, which was then growing faster than you at an all-you-can-eat buffet. But last year it emerged that Zenefits was actually a garbage fire of unruly and potentially illegal behavior. Its founder, Parker Conrad, was pushed out, and the new chief executive, David Sacks, has since been trying to save the sinking ship.", "Under the new deal, some of Zenefits\u2019 existing investors will get a much higher ownership stake, and the company\u2019s overall valuation will plummet from $4 billion to $2 billion. That sounds like bad news \u2014 and some of the company\u2019s biggest investors aren\u2019t really happy about it \u2014 but to me the deal seems better than a lot of other potential outcomes for the company, and could shore up its long-term future. Also, $2 billion is not nothing.", "Mike: It\u2019s probably a better deal than investors pulling their cash, or perhaps suing the company for investing under false pretenses. What a complete nightmare for employees \u2014 at least, the employees who didn\u2019t cheat to beat compliance exams.", "At the same time, maybe some employees respect the hustle it takes to grow at all costs? Or maybe they sympathize with Conrad, who was undoubtedly under pressure from the board to have his company live up to the incredible hype. Who knows?", "Farhad: There were some sparks between Spotify and Apple. According to the music streaming start-up, Apple recently rejected a Spotify update in the iOS App Store. Apple apparently didn\u2019t like that Spotify was giving users a discount if they signed up for Spotify\u2019s subscription outside of the app, on Spotify\u2019s own site \u2014 which allowed Spotify to avoid paying the 30 percent cut that Apple takes when an app uses Apple\u2019s in-store payment system.", "Now Spotify has written a legal letter to Apple decrying the \u201cgrave harm to Spotify and its customers,\u201d and it cleverly sent out copies of the letter to lawmakers in Washington \u2014 a suggestion that Apple might get in trouble with lawmakers over its rejection. Given that Apple has its own music streaming service that directly competes with Spotify, its tactics could raise antitrust issues.", "I can\u2019t speak to the legal nuances here \u2014 antitrust cases are difficult to mount, and Apple has defended its practices. But as a Spotify user, I\u2019m looking forward to the fight. I understand that Apple should take some cut for the infrastructure it maintains to support its app store, but 30 percent sounds way too high. Also, other Apple maneuvers \u2014 like not giving Siri the ability to control music apps other than Apple\u2019s own one \u2014 seem deliberately unfair.", "Mike: I\u2019ll stay out of legal commentary for now, but just as a regular consumer, Apple prohibiting me from an app update for a service I subscribe to rubs me the wrong way.", "Farhad: Spotify wasn\u2019t the only media company getting pushed around by giants this week. Lots of news companies got bad news from Facebook, which announced that it would lower the ranking of news stories in its News Feed, and instead boost posts from people\u2019s friends and family. As I argued in my column, the end game here won\u2019t be pretty \u2014 Facebook and news companies are now on a collision course, and I can\u2019t see how the news business emerges unscathed.", "Mike: Yeah, we\u2019re all freaking out. But we freak out over everything, and Facebook changing its algorithm is like saying the sun will rise in the east. We need to get used to it and adjust accordingly, every time.", "Farhad: Also, you know what these Apple-Spotify and Facebook stories really drove home to me? Independent media is just becoming an impossible business. If you\u2019re trying to run a content business and you\u2019re not named Apple, Google, Facebook or Amazon, good luck to you. You\u2019re going to need it.", "Mike: I still think Spotify will be O.K. in the long run. But maybe I\u2019m dumb.", "Farhad: But the big thing I wanted to talk about this week was whether we should be scared of our self-driving future.

The car was supposed to stop, but it didn\u2019t. The traffic safety administration is now investigating the crash.", "What do you think of this case? Does it give you pause about self-driving cars?", "Mike: So I was with a friend who owns a Tesla the other day \u2014 no, he was not a venture capitalist \u2014 and we were on a stretch of road in San Francisco in light traffic, when he decided to show me the feature. It worked fine, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel freaked out that something bad was going to happen.", "That\u2019s probably to be expected, because it\u2019s a new type of behavior that we\u2019re not used to. Time and conditioning normalizes things, like not steering my car when I\u2019m driving it. All of tech, and really much of the automotive industry, speaks of driverless cars with the gravitas of inevitability: In the future, driving yourself will be more foreign than you think.", "That\u2019s why something like this isn\u2019t just bad for Tesla, it\u2019s bad for everyone betting on this future. Go listen to the leaders at Lyft, Uber or General Motors talk about driverless. Things like this inhibit this vision.", "What I sort of question is the response from Tesla on this one. The company blog post started out sympathetic, but then flooded us with a bunch of numbers and statistics. I\u2019m not sure that strikes the right tone after a guy just died.", "Anyway, how does the industry recover from this? Just keep marching toward inevitability?", "Farhad: I actually appreciated the numbers in the piece. Tesla is right: Cars driven by humans kill lots of humans every year. Cars driven by computers tend to kill fewer \u2014 even at this point, when they\u2019re not even especially good \u2014 and the better they get the safer they\u2019ll become in comparison to the human drivers.", "Mike: Fair enough. Maybe the timing was off to me. Seemed a bit too defensive too quickly. Whatever, I don\u2019t do PR for a living.", "Farhad: Now, none of this means they\u2019ll be crashproof anytime soon, and we\u2019ll most likely see many more deaths in cars driven by computers. But am I crazy to think that people will respond to this mostly rationally? Today, death is a handmaiden to automobile travel. Every time you get in a car you\u2019re playing Russian roulette. The way we deal with it is the way humans tend to deal with everything \u2014 we just sort of forget about it and pretend everything is O.K.", "So I bet that\u2019s how we\u2019ll deal with these self-driving cars, too. They\u2019re still gonna kill us, but they\u2019ll kill us less often than the killing machines we use now, We\u2019ll mostly forget about all the death, and we\u2019ll live happily ever after.", "Anyway, happy 4th!", "Mike: I\u2019ll be spending it watching Bill Pullman give a motivational speech.

The leaders in this effort at the moment are Apple, with HomeKit, and Amazon Echo, with the Alexa assistant. Both use voice control, so you can tell your various lights and switches what you want them to do without having to open a separate app for each one. Apple and Amazon share software with other manufacturers, so many companies\u2019 products work reliably with their central controls.", "Other contenders include Google, which is working on its own home voice-control system; Samsung, which has a system called SmartThings that works with Alexa; and possibly Microsoft, which has hinted that its voice assistant, Cortana, might eventually be used for home control.", "The chief appeal of Apple\u2019s HomeKit is that it\u2019s comparatively easy to set up and use. Devices are paired with your phone or tablet, in much the same way you\u2019d connect a Bluetooth headset or speaker, only with more steps. And the company\u2019s next software update, due this fall, will group all the controls on one screen, so you can run your whole house from a single app. The downside: HomeKit doesn\u2019t have as many accessories as some other systems do.", "Amazon Echo\u2019s Alexa is more versatile.

But as usual, Siri occasionally misunderstood me, attempting a phone call when I was trying to adjust the thermostat.

Unlike past decades, when people of different socioeconomic backgrounds tended to move to similar areas, today, less-skilled workers often go where jobs are scarcer but housing is cheap, instead of heading to places with the most promising job opportunities, according to research by Daniel Shoag, a professor of public policy at Harvard, and Peter Ganong, also of Harvard.", "One reason they\u2019re not migrating to places with better job prospects is that rich cities like San Francisco and Seattle have gotten so expensive that working-class people cannot afford to move there. Even if they could, there would not be much point, since whatever they gained in pay would be swallowed up by rent.", "In Boulder, for instance, the median home price has risen 60 percent over the last five years, to $648,200.

Jerry Brown of California and President Obama, are joining with developers in trying to get cities to streamline many of the local zoning laws that, they say, make homes more expensive and hold too many newcomers at bay.", "To most people, zoning and land-use regulations might conjure up little more than images of late-night City Council meetings full of gadflies and minutiae. But these laws go a long way toward determining some fundamental aspects of life: what American neighborhoods look like, who gets to live where and what schools their children attend.", "And when zoning laws get out of hand, economists say, the damage to the American economy and society can be profound. Studies have shown that laws aimed at things like \u201cmaintaining neighborhood character\u201d or limiting how many unrelated people can live together in the same house contribute to racial segregation and deeper class disparities. They also exacerbate inequality by restricting the housing supply in places where demand is greatest.", "The lost opportunities for development may theoretically reduce the output of the United States economy by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, according to estimates in a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti. Regardless of the actual gains in dollars that could be achieved if zoning laws were significantly cut back, the research on land-use restrictions highlights some of the consequences of giving local communities too much control over who is allowed to live there.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t want rules made entirely for people that have something, at the expense of people who don\u2019t,\u201d said Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.", "So far, the biggest solution offered comes out of California, where Governor Brown has proposed a law to speed up housing development by making it harder for cities to saddle developers with open-ended design, permit and environmental reviews. The Massachusetts State Senate passed similar reforms. And President Obama has taken a more soft-touch approach, proposing $300 million in grants to prod local governments to simplify their building regulations.", "Mr. Brown\u2019s proposal has inflamed local politicians, environmentalists and community groups, who see it as state overreach into how they regulate development.

The local film festival was running concurrently, and one of its visiting masters was the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami. The organizer of our program persuaded him to chat with the group about his work, and persuaded me to moderate the encounter.", "The plan was that Mr. Kiarostami and I would converse with the aid of his translator, since the filmmaker\u2019s English was apparently only a little better than my Farsi. The unforeseen wrinkle was that the translator spoke only Farsi and Spanish, the first language of most of my students and, of course, the idiom of the country where we all happened to be.", "But we could hardly just stand around smiling and nodding. A game of multilingual telephone ensued. I would hand off an English question to one of the translators, who passed along a Spanish version that would reach Mr. Kiarostami in his native language, at which point the process reversed. The remarkable thing is not that we managed to keep this clumsy human version of Google Translate going for much longer than the allotted hour, as we ate pistachios and sipped limeade in a humid courtyard, but that after a while it seemed like an utterly natural form of communication.", "Viewers of foreign-language films sometimes forget that they are reading subtitles instead of understanding what the actors are saying. Something similar happened that evening, a hallucinatory melting of linguistic barriers. I remembered a few phrases of long-ago college Spanish, and so could now and then skip a step in the translators\u2019 bucket brigade. Mr. Kiarostami\u2019s translator was as quick and nimble as an Olympic athlete, and Mr. Kiarostami himself was as patient as a teacher in a roomful of earnest slow learners. But afterward many of us agreed that we had experienced something much stranger and more profound than a successful search for verbal equivalents. We swore that for a short but intense period, under the spell of the filmmaker\u2019s quiet charisma, we had all been thinking in Persian.", "But perhaps we had just been thinking in Kiarostami, albeit without the aid of the usual apparatus of moving pictures and recorded sounds. A poet and photographer as well as filmmaker, Mr. Kiarostami was as steeped in Persian literary traditions as he was devoted to the transparency of the photographic image. Watching his films, you are sometimes aware that specific cultural and historical nuances may be eluding you. At the same time, what you see is always absolutely clear, even if its meanings are sometimes enigmatic.", "Mr. Kiarostami started out making educational films, often featuring children and ostensibly meant for young viewers, and even as his work grew more abstract in its methods and more adult in its themes, a vital element of plainness \u2014 a preference for showing and pointing out and paying attention over lecturing or narrating \u2014 remained.", "Some of his movies turned on mysteries of motive and perception. Why does Mr. Badii, the motorist whose car is the principal set of \u201cA Taste of Cherry,\u201d want to commit suicide? What exactly is the nature of the relationship between the characters played by Juliette Binoche and William Shimell in \u201cCertified Copy\u201d? That movie\u2019s dialogue may be in English, French and Italian, but its language is pure Kiarostami.", "This is not to say that Mr. Kiarostami, who died on Monday at 76, was an artist without roots or local affiliations. He first came to prominence as the pre-eminent representative of a resurgent national cinema. In the 1990s, when the Koker Trilogy (\u201cWhere Is the Friend\u2019s Home,\u201d \u201cLife and Nothing More\u201d and \u201cThrough the Olive Trees\u201d) made its way to art houses around the world and \u201cA Taste of Cherry\u201d shared a Palme d\u2019Or, Mr. Kiarostami became the most celebrated member of a wave that included his longtime friend and sometime collaborator Mohsen Makhmalbaf as well as younger directors like Jafar Panahi (who started out as Mr. Kiarostami\u2019s assistant director) and Majid Majidi. Iranian movies were ubiquitous at major international festivals, and their success seemed to be a sign of the cultural and political opening associated with Mohammad Khatami, Iran\u2019s minister of culture and Islamic guidance in the \u201980s and early \u201990s and its president from 1997 until 2005.", "More recently, Iranian films have moved toward psychological drama and social criticism, neither of which figured among Mr. Kiarostami\u2019s major concerns. This is not to say that he was indifferent to the emotions of his characters or their circumstances, but rather that he viewed the world and its human inhabitants from a particular philosophical angle, a curiosity both about the texture of reality and about the camera\u2019s effect on it. His movies are at once highly self-conscious \u2014 the viewer is often intensely aware of the presence of the camera, and occasionally of the man behind it \u2014 and bluntly naturalistic.", "Mr. Kiarostami seemed sometimes to want to find the essence of cinema by subtracting as many of its effects as possible. \u201cTen\u201d is made up of 10 unedited shots, each one about 10 minutes long, taken of a Tehran driver and her passengers by a camera mounted on the dashboard of her car. A film without a filmmaker, in a sense. As is \u201cFive,\u201d a video piece dedicated to the Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu, which consists of five static shots of landscapes, including a moonlit pond whose serenity is disrupted by the croaking of unseen frogs.", "In Cartagena, Mr. Kiarostami invoked those frogs \u2014 for a minute I thought he was talking about the ducks that appear in another part of \u201cFive\u201d \u2014 as something of a metaphor, an example of the serendipitous irruption of reality into a carefully planned composition. Reality can intrude catastrophically, in the form of natural or political disasters. And the process is reversible: Film also changes reality, injecting new meanings and dimensions into its mute, mundane manifestations. It does this in small ways, as when a child looks directly into the camera or an actor decides to ignore its presence.", "In large ways, too. To an extent that we have only begun to grasp, movies invented a new way of thinking, and Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s movies are among the clearest and most challenging applications of cinematic thought. What happened in Cartagena that evening was what will always happen when someone watches a Kiarostami film with the right kind of attention, which is to say an openness to confusion and to the wonder of the ordinary.

That isn\u2019t actually a criticism, though it does suggest some of this movie\u2019s limitations. Documentaries that compress vast swaths of history into a few hours can be frustratingly shallow, of course, and also say less than those that bore into one subject, place or moment in time. \u201cHooligan Sparrow\u201d largely dispenses with the socio-historical picture. Instead it employs the familiar storytelling strategy of the charismatic personality whose struggles are meant to be representative of the greater political stakes.", "One of the strengths of \u201cHooligan Sparrow\u201d is that it makes those stakes real, visceral and urgent, partly by laying bare just how difficult it can be to make a documentary like this.

The scene, with its unease and suggestive violence, doesn\u2019t draw you in; it yanks you, a canny strategy that instantly puts the viewer on Ms. Wang\u2019s side and turns the presumably (or at least relatively) disinterested audience into a kind of collaborator.", "\u201cHooligan Sparrow,\u201d which Ms. Wang also shot and skillfully edited, has the pulse of a mainstream thriller but without the pacifying polish and tidiness. (One of its executive producers, Alison Klayman, directed \u201cAi Weiwei: Never Sorry.\u201d) It drops into Ms. Ye\u2019s life in 2013, around the time she and a small group of other, mostly female activists were protesting the light sentence given to some convicted male sex offenders for abusing six schoolgirls. It\u2019s a righteous, dangerous protest that becomes an emblem of conscience.

Will an audio processor recognize that the sound of an ambulance siren coming from a side street of the intersection we are about to cross means that we need to stop in spite of the fact that we have the green light?

There\u2019s a really nice demeanor to him, actually.\u201d", "Bill Toler, the chief executive of Hostess, told me that Mr. Metropoulos had worked in the family food businesses since he was a teenager. \u201cI was always impressed by the way Daren wanted to learn how to do things the right way,\u201d Mr. Toler said. \u201cHe would go spend a day working at retail. He would delve into marketing and then go learn how the sales department operated.\u201d", "Mr. Toler added: \u201cI assure you, his interest in the Playboy Mansion is very pure. He\u2019s not the new Hugh Hefner. That\u2019s just silly.\u201d", "But I still had unanswered questions. What are his interests? Sports? Art? Travel? Nobody seemed to know. A spokeswoman for the Metropoulos family did confirm that Mr. Metropoulos, who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., did not graduate from college, having dropped out after his sophomore year to work for his father. He had been studying business at the University of Connecticut.", "If Mr. Metropoulos, who has never married and has no children, is as ordinary as family friends insist, preferring a night at home to hanging at Chateau Marmont \u2014 and yet still has an unruly public image \u2014 he may be the perfect fit for the Playboy Mansion. Purchased by Mr. Hefner in 1971 for about $1 million, the 29-room, five-acre estate (replete with a zoo license and year-round fireworks permit) now bears little resemblance in reality to its mythic reputation.", "The stone house was built in 1927 for an heir to the Broadway and Bullock\u2019s department store fortune. Located a few hundred feet off Sunset Boulevard, the property is valuable because it abuts the Los Angeles Country Club. Neighbors include the music mogul Jimmy Iovine; the Google kingpin Eric Schmidt; and Alexandra von Furstenberg and her husband, Dax Miller, who has become a friend to Mr. Metropoulos. (Mr. Miller did not respond to an interview request.)", "The Playboy Mansion\u2019s history as a den of iniquity is true, but most of the more libidinous stories date from the distant past. These days, the parties are primarily of a corporate nature, and upkeep has been slight. A few years ago, for an article on Mr. Hefner, I was given a daytime tour of the house and grounds. It was gross. The famous grotto pools, linked in 2011 to an outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease, reminded me of one of those fetid animal enclosures at a low-rent marine exhibit. Don\u2019t get me started on the bathroom off the mansion\u2019s main hall. There is a separate house that contains arcade games and has bedrooms with carpeting I could only describe as crispy.", "Whether hipster doofus or titan of industry \u2014 or a bit of both \u2014 Mr. Metropoulos may have plans for the Playboy Mansion that go beyond what has been reported. The official line is that Mr. Metropoulos, with a passion for architecture and history, wants to restore the estate and connect it to his adjacent compound. Mr. Metropoulos bought his current home from Mr. Hefner for $18 million in 2009; the previous occupants were Mr. Hefner\u2019s former wife Kimberley Conrad and their two sons.", "\u201cThe heritage of this property transcends its celebrity, and to have the opportunity to serve as its steward would be a true privilege,\u201d Mr. Metropoulos said in a statement last month. (The deal had not closed escrow as of Friday.)", "But living quietly on Charing Cross Road may not be the intention. \u201cIf there is anybody who can make Playboy more interesting, more relevant, it\u2019s Daren,\u201d Mr. van der Vord said. \u201cIt will be fascinating to watch what he does with that brand.\u201d", "Wait a minute.", "Mr. Metropoulos did not buy Playboy Enterprises, which continues to run a licensing business and publish its flagship magazine. But the struggling company has been for sale. And it would seem like a perfect fit for the Metropouloses, who specialize in taking timeworn products \u2014 albeit mostly edible ones \u2014 and dusting them off. The young Mr. Metropoulos is skilled, according to his corporate biography, in developing marketing campaigns that \u201cconnect brands with contemporary audiences and regain relevance, both in the marketplace and pop culture.\u201d", "When the family owned Chef Boyardee, Mr. Metropoulos contributed to a successful ad campaign featuring pro wrestlers. At Pabst, he promoted the company\u2019s lesser-known brews with celebrity endorsements. (Hence the Snoop Dogg party.)", "Whatever his plans for the mansion, Mr. Metropoulos will have to contend with the Holmby Westwood Property Owners Association. \u201cOur antennae are up,\u201d said Sandy Brown, the group\u2019s president. \u201cAny new uses \u2014 a private club, some kind of hotel \u2014 will certainly get community pushback.\u201d", "One reason for the trepidation: Mr. Metropoulos has been a hotelier before.", "In 2003, Dean Metropoulos spent $10.9 million for the tattered Castle at Tarrytown in New York. Daren took a particular interest in the refurbishment, pouring himself into plans for a spa, the overhaul of a restaurant and minutiae like drapery selection, according to Gilbert Baeriswil, the hotel\u2019s former general manager. \u201cI remember him saying over and over, \u2018I want to see more carpet samples,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Baeriswil, who now runs the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vt.", "When he found out that Mr. Metropoulos was buying the Playboy Mansion, Mr. Baeriswil said he reached out to his former boss.", "\u201cI told him: \u2018Wow! What a purchase! With all of those rooms, you\u2019re going to need an innkeeper,\u2019\u201d Mr. Baeriswil recalled. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018Sounds like a great idea.

This gas would be just like the gas we fill our cars with today \u2014 except that unlike today\u2019s gas, it would not add to global warming because it would recycle carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere.", "If the project had been successful \u2014 and this was always a big if \u2014 it would have changed the definition of green energy and potentially undercut some of the most important industries in the world, not least the oil business.

Those efforts sit atop dozens of aborted projects \u2014 some just ideas, others that consumed years \u2014 like a never built jet pack and giant blimps that would haul cargo with the same efficiency as an ocean liner.", "What all these efforts have in common, besides imaginative power, is that they do not make any money. X\u2019s budget and head count are a secret, but shareholders\u2019 perceptions about the division were aptly summed up by a poster board in its Mountain View, Calif., offices. It had a picture of a burning $100 bill followed by, \u201cInvestors think we do this.\u201d", "That poster points to a central question for both X and Alphabet: What exactly is X\u2019s business? And how does a public company invest in such speculative ideas, most of which will never work, without irritating investors or wasting a ton of money?", "Building a research division is an old and often unsuccessful concept. For decades, corporate giants like AT&T, IBM, Microsoft and Xerox have tried, in varying ways, to organize research-oriented groups in hopes of finding ways to cash in on emerging technologies before their competitors.", "Those efforts played a role in creating some of the 20th century\u2019s most significant innovations. For instance, Bell Labs, then a division of AT&T, invented the transistor, the foundation of modern electronics. But in many cases these research arms did little for the companies that financed them.", "Xerox pioneered the graphical interface for computers \u2014 the idea that people could navigate with a mouse rather than typing obscure commands on a screen. But it was a young company named Apple that turned that idea into a giant business.", "\u201cIn general, the model of having a central research lab that the corporation funds for research into new technologies has not produced much for these companies,\u201d said G.

The assumption was that the other divisions would have to prove they could stand on their own financially \u2014 at least over time.", "The reimagining of Google is still very much a work in progress, and there have been setbacks. Nest, the Alphabet company that makes high-tech versions of devices like thermostats and smoke detectors, was thought to be a model for how other Alphabet companies would work, since many of its operations were already run independently. But it is in the middle of a management shake-up after a series of product delays, employee morale concerns and what some consider disappointing revenue growth.", "While investors still do not know X\u2019s budget, they at least have a sense of the limits. In the first quarter, Alphabet lost about $800 million on what it called \u201cother bets\u201d \u2014 everything outside Google\u2019s core search and advertising businesses \u2014 and it will update the figure when it reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday.", "At the same time, now that X is spinning off new companies that will either stand on their own or die, investors are getting something of a yardstick to judge the division\u2019s progress. If one of those new companies starts to rival search advertising as a revenue stream, X will be considered a success. If that never happens, it will be a failure (and not the good kind).", "For instance, X\u2019s self-driving car project, known internally as Chauffeur, recently hired a chief executive and is poised to become a stand-alone company. Another, called Verily, is a life sciences company that has developed, among other things, a glucose-sensing contact lens for people with diabetes, and has licensed that technology to Novartis.

While operations like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC worked on problems that were at least nominally related to their parent companies\u2019 core businesses, X employees can work on anything they like. In fact, they are discouraged from straying into Google\u2019s main business because Google has its own research group that focuses on machine learning and other computer science topics.", "And while Bell Labs and others made huge contributions to basic, university-style research, X projects are conceived as moneymaking enterprises, or things that at least seem as if they could make money sometime in the next few years. With Foghorn, the goal was to turn seawater into gasoline for no more than $5 a gallon \u2014 enough that it could conceivably find a market in some European nations where high taxes make gasoline more costly.", "Kathy Cooper, an engineer who led the project, said of the goal, \u201cI think we could meet it, but it would be more like 15 to 20 years.\u201d That was too far away, which was why she recommended killing it.", "X employees avoid talking about money, but it is not a subject they can ignore. They face financial barriers that can shut down a project if it does not pan out as quickly as planned. And they have to meet various milestones before they can hire more people for their teams.", "The point, several executives said, is to encourage employees to think big while staying away from creating technology for technology\u2019s sake.", "\u201cIf you actually want to make the world better, focus on what would actually make the world better, and the technology will take care of itself,\u201d Mr. Teller said. In other words, great ideas that solve real problems will bring in real money.", "One of the more public examples was a recent overhaul of a Google robotics effort whose best-known project is a robotic cheetah.

The group\u2019s leader, Obi Felten, said her job was to hone new technologies into a concrete product and to work with engineers like Ms. Cooper to help them write business plans.", "The idea is to create a conveyor-belt-like process that encourages employees to quickly jettison projects that seem unlikely to work and to avoid technologies that are neat ideas but would never make money.", "One of the best ways to save money, Mr. Teller said, is to encourage employees to kill projects before they become expensive \u2014 hence the bonus for the Foghorn team. X staff meetings begin with a \u201cpremortem\u201d process in which people predict how various technologies might fall short. Employees\u2019 laptops are decorated with stickers of crumpled-up paper that represent the end of past efforts.", "When Mr. Teller speaks at events like South by Southwest and TED, he ruminates so deeply on the word \u201cfail\u201d that successes are sometimes framed as \u201cfailing to fail.\u201d", "The idea of celebrating failure is a Silicon Valley clich\u00e9, but Mr. Teller talks about it in the practical terms of a management consultant. Say you have a team of 20 people working on a project that is not going anywhere, he said in a recent interview. In a year those 20 people will be 30 people. The company has to pay their salaries and health insurance, and the team will inevitably hire a few consultants. Worse, they will have wasted a year.", "How much money could the company save if you could get them to cut bait a year earlier?", "\u201cThat\u2019s the magic,\u201d Mr. Teller said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t do it. They will not raise their hands and say, \u2018This project is just not what we should be working on,\u2019 unless you start bonusing them, unless they can get a promotion for ending their project.\u201d", "Failure bonuses are also an example of how X, which was set up independent of Google from the outset, is a leading indicator of sorts for how the autonomous Alphabet could work. In Alphabet, employees who do not work for Mother Google are supposed to have their financial futures tied to their own company instead of Google\u2019s search ads. At X, that means killing things before they become too expensive.", "Mr. Teller\u2019s decision to start paying bonuses to employees who kill their own projects happened long before the Alphabet transition, and it was met with skepticism from Google\u2019s chief culture officer. Mr. Teller got what he wanted anyway.", "\u201cThey were just offended by the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we don\u2019t even talk about it anymore.\u201d", "X was founded in 2010, and it was originally in a brick building on the edge of Google\u2019s main campus. At the beginning, it felt like an extended 20 percent project \u2014 the extra projects Google employees are encouraged to work on outside of their main job \u2014 with little in the way of process.", "Former Google employees said this led to a temptation to overhype projects long before they were ready. The most notorious example of this was Google Glass, the much maligned computer glasses.", "The glasses were supposed to have a marketing scheme to match, and X employees hatched an idea for floating showrooms. Later, when mysterious barges showed up in Portland, Me., and San Francisco Bay, they kicked off months of speculation and conspiracy theories until finally they were towed away without a word from Google.", "Mr. Teller said he shut down the barges idea the first day it was his decision to make. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lot of agonizing about that,\u201d he said.", "Today, the company\u2019s offices are a few miles from Google\u2019s main campus.

Rich DeVaul, who heads a \u201crapid evaluation\u201d team whose job is to hatch and kill ideas in short order, guessed that fewer than half the employees have engineering degrees (he doesn\u2019t).", "\u201cI would argue that the great strength of X, in fact, is that basically we aren\u2019t just a bunch of techies,\u201d he said.", "The combination of big ideas, lofty rhetoric and a strict code of secrecy has made X a source of endless speculation and conspiracy theories. The one you hear most frequently, usually from competitors and venture capitalists, is that X is a giant public relations plan to distract regulators from Google\u2019s search business, which is under scrutiny around the world.", "Cynical though that sounds, it points to something that seems fundamentally true: Many of history\u2019s great corporate research efforts, like Bell Labs and Xerox PARC, have come from companies that were monopolies or close to it.", "Failure bonuses notwithstanding, no normal person would walk away from X thinking it looked frugal. There is a free cafeteria whose recent menu included sushi and pork tri-tip. The bathrooms have Japanese toilet seats with buttons for warmth and spritz. Listening to X executives talk about saving money is a bit like having billionaires tell you they built a $30 million house for $30 million and not a penny more.", "But X\u2019s success will be less about money saved than the creation of a new Google-size business whose profits wash away all the losses. And while the division has already had some successes, it has yet to produce the \u201cmoonshot\u201d Mr. Teller is hoping for.", "Arguably the biggest success, Google Brain, is the one people know the least about. It was an artificial intelligence effort that was spun back into core Google in 2012 and is now embedded in products like voice search and the Google Photos app, in which users can search their albums for images like \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201cmountains.\u201d", "Investors would prefer a shiny new business that does not rely on advertising. Mr. DeVaul hopes that if X can deliver a big hit, it will encourage other companies to copy the entire concept.

The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that controls impulse, finishes developing in the mid-20s. In other words, parents should not be surprised if younger children with smartphones lack impulse control.", "Smartphones undoubtedly bring benefits. With the devices, children gain access to powerful apps, including education tools for studying, chat apps for connecting with friends and the wealth of information on the web.", "But they also are one step closer to distracting games, sexting apps and social media apps where online bullies are on the prowl. Even older children are not immune: Last year, at least 100 students at a Colorado high school were embroiled in a scandal that involved trading naked pictures of themselves on their mobile devices.", "In the end, such cons may outweigh the pros, Ms. Weinberger said. If you hold off giving smartphones to children, many still have access to technology tools through devices like computers and tablets, she added. The main difference with a smartphone is that it is with a child everywhere, including outside of parental supervision.", "Ultimately, parents will determine when their child truly needs a smartphone. When that time comes, there are approaches for testing the waters before handing one to the child.", "One popular option is to start the child off with dumbed-down mobile devices, like feature phones that can only send text messages or place phone calls, and to assess whether they can use those devices responsibly.", "Lynn Muscat, a parent in San Francisco, said she had considered buying a \u201cdumb phone\u201d for her 10-year-old son to keep in touch while he was at summer camp. She ended up buying the LG GizmoGadget, a Verizon smartwatch that has calling and texting capabilities and a locked-down list of contacts so that her son could interact only with people she had approved.", "Ms. Muscat said she did not consider buying her child a smartphone partly because she felt the device would make him a target for muggers. She also was not appreciative of how smartphones had affected other children around him.", "\u201cIt drives me nuts when I see his friends on it all the time \u2014 it seems very antisocial,\u201d Ms. Muscat said. She said she planned to use the smartwatch to teach the responsibilities of using a mobile device safely before her son eventually earns the privilege of carrying a smartphone.", "When you decide that it\u2019s time to bestow a smartphone on your child, there are ways to set limits. To help parents enforce rules consistently, Ms. Weinberger has published a family contract listing the rules of smartphone use, which includes promises never to take nude selfies and never to try to meet strangers from the internet in real life. Parents state what the consequences are for breaking the rules, and the child must sign the contract before receiving a smartphone.", "Mr. Steyer of Common Sense Media said he set other limits, like no smartphones at the dinner table and no phones in the classroom. If his children break the rules, he takes their phones away.", "There are some phone settings that can help keep children safe when they do get smartphones.", "For iPhones, Apple offers a switchboard full of features that parents can enable or disable, including the ability to restrict the Safari browser from gaining access to adult content and the ability to prevent apps from using cellular data. The iPhone\u2019s parental controls live inside the Settings app in a menu labeled Restrictions.", "Android phones lack similar built-in parental control settings, though there are many apps in the Google Play app store that let parents add restrictions. Ms. Weinberger highlighted the app Qustodio, which lets parents monitor their children\u2019s text messages, disable apps at certain times of day or even shut off a smartphone remotely. While that can be an aggressive approach to restricting a child\u2019s smartphone, Ms. Weinberger said her job as a parent was not to make her children like her.", "\u201cMy only job as a parent is to prepare you for the day you leave,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I have to keep you safe, and you\u2019re not going to like some of the things I say \u2014 and that\u2019s O.K.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/jobs/climbing-down-the-corporate-ladder-without-alarming-your-boss.html": ["Send your workplace conundrums to workologist@nytimes.com, including your name and contact information (even if you want it withheld for publication).

Jane Horowitz, a career coach and founder of More Than a R\u00e9sum\u00e9, in Denver, says she tells her clients, often young people just entering the job market, that even when you submit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 online to a company you really want to work for, that\u2019s only the first step. The second is to find someone you know who can help get that r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in front of a human being. \u201cTry to find another way into the company,\u201d Ms. Horowitz says. \u201cYou have to.\u201d", "In other words: Network, person-to-person.

Stocks are even more susceptible than other markets to popular delusions and the madness of crowds, and stock prices generally have a lot less to do with the state of the economy or its future prospects than many people believe. As the economist Paul Samuelson put it, \u201cWall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions.\u201d", "Still, we shouldn\u2019t completely ignore stock prices.

What are those Wall Street indexes telling us?", "The answer, I\u2019d suggest, isn\u2019t entirely positive. In fact, in some ways the stock market\u2019s gains reflect economic weaknesses, not strengths. And understanding how that works may help us make sense of the troubling state our economy is in.", "O.K., let\u2019s start with the myth Samuelson was debunking, the claim that stock prices are the measure of the economy as a whole.

First, stock prices reflect profits, not overall incomes. Second, they also reflect the availability of other investment opportunities \u2014 or the lack thereof. Finally, the relationship between stock prices and real investment that expands the economy\u2019s capacity has gotten very tenuous.", "On the first point: We measure the economy\u2019s success by the extent to which it generates rising incomes for the population. But stocks don\u2019t reflect incomes in general; they only reflect the part of income that shows up as profits.", "This wouldn\u2019t matter if the share of profits in overall income were stable; but it isn\u2019t. The share of profits in national income fluctuates, but it has been a lot higher in recent years than it was during the great stock surge of the late 1990s \u2014 that is, we\u2019ve had a profits boom without a comparably large economic boom, making the relationship between profits and prosperity weak at best. We are not, in fact, partying like it\u2019s 1999.", "On the second point: When investors buy stocks, they\u2019re buying a share of future profits. What that\u2019s worth to them depends on what other options they have for converting money today into income tomorrow. And these days those options are pretty poor, with interest rates on long-term government bonds not only very low by historical standards but zero or negative once you adjust for inflation. So investors are willing to pay a lot for future income, hence high stock prices for any given level of profits.", "But why are long-term interest rates so low? As I argued in my last column, the answer is basically weakness in investment spending, despite low short-term interest rates, which suggests that those rates will have to stay low for a long time.", "This may seem, however, to present a paradox. If the private sector doesn\u2019t see itself as having a lot of good investment opportunities, how can profits be so high? The answer, I\u2019d suggest, is that these days profits often seem to bear little relationship to investment in new capacity. Instead, profits come from some kind of market power \u2014 brand position, the advantages of an established network, or good old-fashioned monopoly. And companies making profits from such power can simultaneously have high stock prices and little reason to spend.", "Consider the fact that the three most valuable companies in America are Apple, Google and Microsoft. None of the three spends large sums on bricks and mortar. In fact, all three are sitting on huge reserves of cash. When interest rates go down, they don\u2019t have much incentive to spend more on expanding their businesses; they just keep raking in earnings, and the public becomes willing to pay more for a piece of those earnings.", "In other words, while record stock prices do put the lie to claims that the Obama administration has been anti-business, they\u2019re not evidence of a healthy economy. If anything, they\u2019re a sign of an economy with too few opportunities for productive investment and too much monopoly power.", "So when you read headlines about stock prices, remember: What\u2019s good for the Dow isn\u2019t necessarily good for America, or vice versa."], "https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/10-childrens-apps-for-summer-road-trips/": ["The car is packed, the pets have sitters and the GPS is programmed.

Witness the popularity of Bernie Sanders, the socialist running neck and neck in the opinion polls with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Monday. To rehabilitate the system of free enterprise, it needs to be buttressed by a modern conception of fairness.", "Viewed from Mars, capitalism has been a huge success. Free enterprise has generated wealth and removed hundreds of millions of people from poverty. But viewed from Earth, what often stands out is how many have been left behind by the march of globalization and technology, while others have gotten ahead by methods more foul than fair.", "The classic left-wing response to the perceived unfairness of capitalism has been to tax and spend. That doesn\u2019t work well. High taxes can sap entrepreneurial spirit, while high welfare spending can leave poorer people dependent on handouts.", "Just because that response has been tried and failed doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be tried again. The success of left-wing populists like the Syriza party in Greece and the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party in Britain shows that such ideas still have appeal.", "This makes it important for centrists \u2014 whether they consider themselves left-wing progressives, radical centrists or liberal conservatives \u2014 to articulate a credible middle road. It should be based less on the view that fairness is the same as equality and more on the idea that people should get a fair crack at a good standard of life.", "There are two main aspects. First, it is important to tackle the foul methods by which people and companies get ahead and that make it tougher for hard-working, honest people to make progress.", "One example of this is evading or avoiding tax. This is rife in some countries, like Greece. But it is a global problem that makes people furious everywhere. Witness the anger in January in Britain over how Google, the Internet giant, was seemingly able to run rings around the authorities and pay what looks like a tiny amount of tax.", "Corruption, which is again widespread across the world, also creates indignation. Sweetheart deals between politicians and business line the pockets of the few to the detriment of the many.", "Another justified target of ire is the existence of markets that favor insiders at the expense of the general public. Finance is at the top of the list. The global financial crisis exposed how many bankers had a one-way bet: During the good times, they raked it in; during the bad, the state picked up the pieces. This was a mockery of how capitalism is supposed to work.", "Monopolies and vested interests are yet another source of resentment. Sometimes, the culprits are the oligarchs who pull the strings in government to get the rules written in their favor by giving bribes to politicians or senior officials.", "But often the beneficiaries of vested interests are not particularly rich or powerful as individuals. Greece is one of the best examples of this phenomenon. Over decades, it perfected the art of doling out special privileges to such an array of groups \u2014 farmers, notaries, pharmacists, civil servants, teachers and ordinary retirees as well as shipping magnates \u2014 that its economy gummed up.", "Such practices sap entrepreneurial spirit, but they do so by locking people out of opportunity rather than by using the methods of old-fashioned socialism. They also inflict bigger taxes on honest citizens and higher prices on consumers.", "A modern conception of fairness would put an assault of foul methods at its heart. But it would do more than that.", "Although successful societies need welfare states, most of Europe\u2019s welfare states need refocusing. Part of the problem is that too much government spending is directed to what Europeans call the middle class rather than the needy.", "The situation varies from country to country, but the main goodies are generous state pensions for middle-to-high earners and tax breaks that benefit relatively well-off people. To be fair, some countries are reining these in. For example, Britain no longer offers such attractive incentives for rich people to save for their retirement. But in many countries, there is a lot that could be done.", "The money saved from funding this middle-class welfare state could be redeployed where it is needed. The priority would often be to invest in schools, so children get a fair start in life, and in adult education, so that older people whose skills become obsolete as a result of technology can retrain.", "Such a conception of fairness is not really new. It has a lot in common with classic liberalism. Nor is it dead. Successful politicians around the world \u2014 like Narendra Modi of India with his fight against corruption or Matteo Renzi of Italy with his willingness to confront some vested interests \u2014 are deploying some strategies from this playbook.", "It is a rich source of ideas with which to tackle the unfairness of capitalism without falling for the inefficiency of socialism."], "https://paidpost.nytimes.com/tanium/vision-2020.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/business/media/paul-aiken-leader-of-authors-guild-dies-at-56.html": ["Paul Aiken, who as executive director of the Authors Guild began parrying digital-era challenges to copyrights and royalties nearly two decades ago, died on Jan. 29 at his home in Manhattan.

Because it would still win in the end. Facebook and its subsidiaries \u2014 WhatsApp, especially \u2014 are extremely popular in India, as in the rest of the world.

The ruling in India affected all \u201czero data\u201d plan providers, including those offered by mobile operators that aren\u2019t working with Facebook. Since Facebook has been in the spotlight for months on this, my guess is it will let the operators do the fighting.", "Farhad: Finally, and most important, offering a plan that doesn\u2019t restrict what people can do would be a hell of lot less condescending and paternalistic. In an excellent piece on Medium this week, Sumanth Raghavendra, an Indian tech entrepreneur, wrote \u201cthe explosion of mobile phone usage in India even among folks who could be regarded as \u2018poor\u2019 aptly demonstrates that contrary to what some people might believe, poor people are more than capable of demonstrating agency and adopting technology on their own \u2014 as long as they see a clear and visible path towards a better standard of living.\u201d", "Zuckerberg and other techies have long argued that the Internet will improve the lives of people in the developing world. Offering a low-cost plan that offers the full Internet would be a good way to prove that.", "Mike: What they should probably do is talk up all the other parts of Internet.org that aren\u2019t just the Free Basics India initiative.

After all, nobody ever elected Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to public office. The legal case seems clear enough: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a warrant, Mr. Farook is dead, and his iPhone, which he used for work, is the property of San Bernardino County, which consented to having it searched. The data on the phone could yield valuable intelligence, making its content a legitimate matter of national security.", "Apple had obeyed a demand to provide the government with the information in Mr. Farook\u2019s iCloud account. But then it was asked to undermine the phone\u2019s security system so the F.B.I. could try as many passcodes as possible to open the phone without erasing the stored data. Apple refused. On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion saying that Apple\u2019s objections had little to do with security but appeared \u201cto be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201d", "The government, not Apple, should guarantee our privacy rights. But this dispute has arisen precisely because the government hasn\u2019t done so. Instead, it squandered much of its legal and moral authority when the National Security Agency engaged in widespread surveillance of American citizens for so long. Some N.S.A. abuses targeted Silicon Valley directly.", "In one project, revealed in October 2013 by journalists tipped off by Edward Snowden, the N.S.A., along with its British counterpart, essentially hacked into fiber-optic cables that connected the data centers of Google and Yahoo outside the United States. Under American law, the agency already had access to some of the information, but it tapped the lines anyway.", "Silicon Valley companies love to celebrate the hacker spirit, but they don\u2019t like being on the receiving end. By November 2013, both Google and Yahoo announced that they were encrypting data traveling between its server centers. By the following September, Apple announced that its new phones would by default encrypt data stored on the device in such a way that even the company itself couldn\u2019t get at it.", "At the time, this seemed like a hopelessly geeky version of Mad magazine\u2019s \u201cSpy vs. Spy,\u201d with opponents one-upped with algorithms rather than cartoon bombs. But the fight led directly to Tuesday\u2019s ruling by a federal magistrate judge in California that Apple must help the F.B.I. unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. The laws governing online privacy are woefully out-of-date. To compel Apple to help execute a warrant, the judge cited the All Writs Act of 1789, enacted before there was electricity.", "In Apple\u2019s public response, the company said it was fighting the F.B.I.\u2019s demands not because it objected to the government unlocking Mr. Farook\u2019s phone but because the government could then ask Apple to undermine the security of other iPhones and because such software could potentially help criminals and repressive governments hack iPhones.", "By analogy, the company doesn\u2019t have a key to the phone so the government is asking it to make the lock weaker. Apple is being asked to undermine not only the security of its products but also potentially its corporate reputation and even its business. The company is especially concerned that a victory for the government would set an informal precedent for other countries to demand that Apple unlock encrypted data. It\u2019s hard to have any sympathy for Mr. Farook, but the line between terrorism and criticism of the government can be far fuzzier in other countries, like China, where Apple sold tens of millions of iPhones in the last quarter of 2015. Apple\u2019s phones are also sold in Pakistan, where homosexual acts can send people to prison, and in Saudi Arabia, where adultery is punishable by lashing or stoning and apostasy punishable by death.", "The United States government may have a reasonable case when it comes to Mr. Farook, but a victory here would open a Pandora\u2019s box that can\u2019t be closed in the United States or anywhere in the world. Cracking the phone open also may not help as much as we think: Would-be terrorists can use encrypted communication services that operate in other jurisdictions.", "What we really need is a robust public conversation around strong privacy laws that would apply to the government and private companies alike and clear limits on what should be done with data. Important choices about the future of technology and privacy should be made by the American people and their representatives, not by Silicon Valley, where even the noblest intentions are mixed with huge financial stakes. If the government wants the power to compel companies to undermine their own security systems, it should go to Congress and ask for it.", "Until then, we are left with Silicon Valley executives making engineering decisions that could determine what information the government can and can\u2019t have. That\u2019s both bad policy and fundamentally undemocratic.", "But the current choice is between a government that doesn\u2019t seem to recognize limits to its own power to access personal information and a technology company that does. It\u2019s a bad choice, but an obvious one.

The next thing you know, an ad for a flu remedy pops up on your web browser, or your video streaming service starts playing a commercial for Tylenol.", "The content of those ads is no coincidence. Digital ads are able to follow people around the Internet because advertisers often place invisible trackers on the websites you visit. Their goal is to collect details on everywhere you go on the Internet and use that data to serve targeted ads to your computer, smartphone and connected television.", "This global commercial surveillance of consumers is poised to become more extensive as tech companies expand into the Internet of Things, a category that includes wearable computers and connected home appliances like smart thermostats and refrigerators. Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google can already follow users from device to device because people log in to their services with the same IDs on various gadgets.", "For other marketing companies, tracking people on multiple Internet-connected devices has become a holy grail. The process is complex, because some lack the direct relationship with people that the giant tech companies already have. Only about 6 percent of marketers can reliably track a customer on all of that customer\u2019s devices, according to the research firm eMarketer.

Many companies offer tools to help obscure your digital footprints while you\u2019re browsing the web. We researched and tested four tracker blockers and found their results varied widely. In the end, the app Disconnect became our anti-tracking tool of choice.", "Here\u2019s how web tracking works: In general, targeting individuals with digital ads involves a sophisticated ecosystem of third parties \u2014 like online advertising networks, data brokers and analytics companies \u2014 that compile information on consumers.", "When you visit websites, these companies typically pick out your browser or phone using technologies like cookies, which contain unique alphanumeric identification tags that can enable trackers to identify your activities as you move from site to site. To sell ads delivered to certain categories of consumers, like suburban singles looking for romance, companies may sync these ID tags to pinpoint individuals.", "The downside is, your browsing history may contain sensitive information about your health concerns, political affiliations, family problems, religious beliefs or sexual habits.", "\u201cMore than just being creepy, it\u2019s a huge violation of privacy,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a privacy advocate for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit that also offers the anti-tracking tool Privacy Badger. \u201cPeople need to be able to read things and do things and talk about things without having to worry that they\u2019re being watched or recorded somewhere.\u201d", "We took a close look at four free privacy tools: Ghostery, Disconnect, RedMorph and Privacy Badger. We tested them with the Google Chrome browser on the top 20 news websites, including Yahoo News, CNN, The Huffington Post and The New York Times.", "The tracker busters generally work in similar ways. You download and install an add-on for a web browser like Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The anti-tracking companies each compile a list of known web domains that serve trackers or show patterns of tracking services. Then when someone connects to a website, the tools prevent the browser from loading any element that matches their blacklist.", "Ghostery, a popular tracker blocker, was the most difficult to set up. When you install it, it asks you to manually select the trackers you want to block. Our problem with that approach is that there are hundreds of trackers, and most consumers probably won\u2019t recognize most of them, putting the onus on users to research which specific services they might wish to block.", "Scott Meyer, the chief executive of Ghostery, said this had been a deliberate design choice. When trackers are blocked, parts of websites may not function, so it is less confusing to let users experiment and decide which ones to block on their own, he said.", "\u201cWe block nothing by default,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s in direct contrast to other companies who are saying, \u2018We\u2019re turning everything off and let you turn whatever you want back on.\u2019 That\u2019s way too complex for users.\u201d", "The tracker blocking tool RedMorph takes the opposite approach. It blocks every tracking signal it can detect and lets people decide which ones to allow. For parents concerned about their children\u2019s Internet use, RedMorph also offers a service to filter out certain sites or block certain swear words or other language they find inappropriate.", "\u201cWhen you go home, you lock the door and you may pull down the shades at night,\u201d said Abhay Edlabadkar, the chief executive of RedMorph. \u201cYou should have the same level of privacy control over your Internet activities.\u201d", "In our tests, RedMorph was the most thorough with blocking trackers. It blocked 22 of them on USAToday.com, whereas Privacy Badger blocked seven, Disconnect blocked eight and Ghostery detected eight.", "But in the process, RedMorph caused the most collateral damage. It blocked some videos on the websites for CNN, USA Today, Bleacher Report, The New York Times and The Daily News. It also broke the recommended reading list on Business Insider and a Twitter box on BuzzFeed. For people who run into issues loading websites, the company offers an \u201cEasy Fix\u201d button to stop blocking a website\u2019s trackers, but that\u2019s hardly an ideal solution when it causes so many websites to malfunction. Mr. Edlabadkar of RedMorph said the tool was blocking some videos or recommended reading lists because they were loading only after a tracker had been loaded first.", "That leaves Privacy Badger and Disconnect. Privacy Badger detects third-party domains that users are connecting with when they\u2019re loading a website and blocks those domains only if they are determined to be tracking you. Its widget shows sliding bars of trackers it has detected. The ones in red are blocked and the green ones are allowed.", "Disconnect takes a similarly nuanced approach. The company said some tracking was fair and necessary for a website to work properly \u2014 for example, if a site like The New York Times is using analytics to collect information about readers, as it describes in its privacy policy. However, Disconnect will block trackers from third parties that are collecting, retaining or sharing user data. On its website, it publishes lists of trackers it blocks and those it allows, along with explanations of its policy.", "\u201cWe really focus on privacy rather than blocking ads that are done in a respectful way,\u201d said Casey Oppenheim, the chief executive of Disconnect. \u201cIt\u2019s important we have the ability for publishers to survive and make money. I think there\u2019s a middle ground.\u201d", "In the end, we picked Disconnect as our favorite tool because it was the easiest to understand. It organizes the types of tracking requests it is blocking into different categories: advertising, analytics, social media and content.", "Mr. Grossman of WhiteHat Security also tested tracking blockers and chose Disconnect for similar reasons. He breaks his online activities into two separate web browsers to make himself more difficult to track: On one browser, he does everyday tasks like reading news articles; on the other browser he logs into accounts that are linked to his personal identity, like online banking sites and Amazon.", "But Mr. Grossman said that in the broad arms race between consumers and advertisers, the advertisers always find some way to outmaneuver us.", "\u201cWe\u2019re talking megabillion-dollar industries totally designed to track you online,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission in life.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/us/politics/how-to-watch-republican-debate.html": ["Join us for our coverage of the Republican debate.", "The remaining Republican presidential candidates, who have increased their attacks on one another since the New Hampshire primary, will meet again Saturday night in a debate in Greenville, S.C.

This blessed woman, whose name I never learned, brought back inamona, a paste made from the roasted, crushed hearts of kukui nuts, and poke mix: careful proportions of alaea salt (stained red by volcanic clay), dried limu (seaweed native to the islands) and chile.", "A tip of the ingredients over cubes of raw ahi, and time for the flavors to relax into each other: This was all that was required. The fishmonger offered the poke in plastic tubs, without ceremony, just as I had always known it in Honolulu, where I grew up and where some of the best poke is sold at a liquor store, Tamura\u2019s.", "Then, a few years back, poke started appearing on stray restaurant menus, sometimes identified as Hawaiian crudo or ceviche.

Or a chile aioli whose slow-burn heat hums in the mouth without igniting it.", "Elsewhere in town, poke is typically heaped on a stark bed of rice. Here, each bowl ($7.50 to $10.75) is a terrarium of mesclun greens and seaweed salad, offsetting the richness of the fish, with a humbler cushion of rice half-hidden below. Elsewhere, I also found the white rice too clumpy, the brown rice too dry; at Sons of Thunder, both are commendably fluffy. Extras like crispy shards of garlic or a tinsel of nori add textural interest, but you don\u2019t need them.", "There is tako (octopus) poke, too, tender with just a touch of chewiness, as well as versions made with tofu or golden beets, which I thought sacrilegious until I tasted them.

The company left no doubt that it would fight any effort to crack its new, encrypted phones. The only real question was what crime the government would use to press its case.", "Apple\u2019s stance that day in Brooklyn caught the Justice Department off guard.

Unlike the phone in the San Bernardino case, Mr. Feng\u2019s ran iOS 7, an older version of Apple\u2019s operating system that does not automatically encrypt its data.

The matter nearly escalated, but Apple eventually turned over some messages that had been backed up to the company\u2019s iCloud servers. It was not all that the government wanted, but authorities viewed it as a sign of cooperation.", "Such compromises forestalled a major court showdown, but increased the frustration at the Justice Department. Several current and former career prosecutors involved in the issue said they viewed it as hypocritical that Apple encouraged its customers to save its data to iCloud \u2014 which it would turn over to the government \u2014 but regarded the cellphone as sacrosanct.", "Then came the Feng case.

Staring at his laptop in a cramped ground-floor office, he drank from his sixth cup of coffee and typed another in a long series of emails: \u2018\u2018Try and cut them off rather than making for the last known position.\u2019\u2019 Nearly 9,000 miles away, the Remeliik, a police patrol ship from the tiny island nation Palau, was pursuing a 10-man Taiwanese pirate ship, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, through Palauan waters. Bergman, working for a nonprofit research organization called SkyTruth, had mastered the use of satellite data to chart a ship\u2019s most likely course. Instead of pointing the police to where the pirate ship was, he would tell them where it was about to be. He took another sip of coffee, studied his screen, then typed again: \u2018\u2018It may be advisable for the Remeliik to turn southeast.\u2019\u2019", "Caught fishing in a marine sanctuary, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 was fleeing to Indonesian waters, beyond Palau\u2019s jurisdiction. Once across the boundary, the crew could easily unload its catch at a local wharf and disappear among the thousands of small Filipino or Indonesian islands of the western Pacific. Determined not to let that happen, the Remeliik\u2019s skipper, running on Bergman\u2019s coordinates, was pushing 15 knots \u2014 a pace that worried its engineer. But the police were desperate to keep up. In the previous six months, they had spotted but failed to capture nearly a dozen other pirate fishing ships. If the Remeliik\u2019s officers miscalculated their heading by even a small fraction of a degree, they would miss their target.", "Bergman had been tracking the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 for weeks, and emailed an alert about possible illegal fishing two days earlier. Before moving to West Virginia to work for SkyTruth, he spent three years working as a marine ob\u00adserver on Alaskan fishing boats, logging the details of the daily catch, as required by federal and state fishery authorities. At SkyTruth, Bergman did his surveillance work from a far greater remove, monitoring ships by satellite. For months, he had been studying a satellite feed from above Palau. He knew its squiggles and slashes by memory. A passenger boat out of Pitcairn Island appeared every few weeks; a United States Navy ship from Diego Garcia conducted regular maneuvers; a Chinese research vessel was doing a survey of some sort in a grid pattern; a Taiwanese ship that never seemed to fish made repeated trips out to meet other long-line fishing vessels. The Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 stood out, however. Switching among registries of fishing permits, regional tuna licenses and blacklisted vessels, he could tell it had no license to fish in Palau\u2019s waters, even though its zigzag trajectory indicated it was doing just that.", "In response to Bergman\u2019s alert, an international team gathered into the cramped, second-floor police command center on Koror, Palau\u2019s most populous island. There were three local police officers, an adviser from the Pew Charitable Trusts and two Australian Navy officers, on loan to Palau to advise on everything from running the Remeliik (which the Australians had also donated) to using satellite-data analysis software. Working through the night and the following day, the team radioed the information they received from West Virginia to Allison Baiei, a Palauan marine police officer, aboard the Remeliik.", "Police efforts like these, coordinated and international in scope, are a rarity when it comes to enforcing the law at sea, but the alternative is usually no enforcement at all. More than two-thirds of the planet is covered by water, and much of that liquid expanse is ungoverned and potentially ungovernable. Criminal enterprise has flourished in the breach. The global black market for seafood is worth more than $20 billion, and approximately one in every five fish consumed globally is caught illegally.", "After a 51-hour push, much of it through heavy seas, the Remeliik\u2019s unrelenting pace finally paid off: It caught up with the Taiwanese ship just a few miles before the boundary with Indonesian waters. The officers escorted the ship back to port in Palau, and when they inspected the hold, Baiei told me, they found an especially grim haul. Inside, among the stacks of tuna, were hundreds of severed shark fins. The officers piled the contraband onto the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33\u2019s deck and, when they ran out of room there, piled the rest into a bloody heap on the dock. They counted, measured and photographed the fins to use for the eventual prosecution, then dumped them into the sea. \u2018\u2018Disgusting,\u2019\u2019 was all Baiei would say about the scene.", "Few places on the planet are as isolated as Palau, or as sprawling. Its 21,000 residents are scattered across a handful of its 250 islands, which take up just 177 square miles combined. Relatively poor, and with no military of its own, Palau employs a marine police division with just 18 members and one patrol ship. Yet it has authority over roughly 230,000 square miles of ocean. Under international law, a country\u2019s \u2018\u2018exclusive economic zone,\u2019\u2019 the waters where it maintains fishing and mineral rights, extends 200 nautical miles from its coasts. That means that a country roughly the size of Philadelphia is responsible for patrolling a swath of ocean about the size of France, in a region teeming with supertrawlers, state-subsidized poacher fleets, mile-long drift nets and the floating fish attracters known as FADs.", "In the face of this challenge, Palau has mounted an aggressive response. In 2006, it was among the first nations to ban bottom trawling \u2014 a practice not unlike strip mining in which fishing boats drag large weighted nets across the ocean floor to catch the fish in the waters just above, killing virtually everything else in their path. In 2009, it prohibited commercial shark fishing in its waters, creating the world\u2019s first shark sanctuary. In 2015, it announced plans to require observers aboard all its tuna longliners. (Elsewhere in the region, observers are aboard just one in 50 tuna longliners.) Palau has also teamed up with Greenpeace, which helped patrol its territorial waters, and it started a campaign on Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform, raising more than $50,000 to support its conservation work. Palau\u2019s most radical move, though, was creating a \u2018\u2018no take\u2019\u2019 reserve in 2015. Within this zone, which encompasses 193,000 square miles, all export fishing (along with any drilling or mining) will be strictly prohibited.", "From one perspective, Palau\u2019s work suggests a hopeful future. It offers a model for successful ad hoc collaboration among countries, companies and nongovernmental organizations. Palau has also emerged as a testing ground for some of the technology \u2014 including drones, satellite monitoring and military-grade radar \u2014 that might finally empower countries to spot and arrest the pirates, poachers, polluters, traffickers and other scofflaws who prowl the seas with impunity.", "But Palau\u2019s conservation efforts are really motivated by a more immediate sense of self-preservation. In September, I sat down with Palau\u2019s president, Tommy Remengesau Jr., in his cluttered, wood-paneled office in Koror. A sturdy man with an intense stare, Remengesau explained to me that more than half of Palau\u2019s gross domestic product comes from tourism, mostly people visiting to dive on Palau\u2019s reefs, which house more fish, coral and other invertebrates per square mile than virtually anywhere else on Earth. Remengesau boiled the problem down to simple economics, noting that sharks were an especially big draw for undersea sightseers. Alive, an individual shark is worth more than $170,000 annually in tourism dollars, he said, or nearly $2 million over its lifetime. Dead, each can go for a hundred dollars \u2014 and usually, he added, that money winds up in the pockets of a foreign poacher.", "The poachers calculate differently, of course. More than a dozen countries, including Palau and Taiwan, have banned shark-finning. But demand for the fins, especially in Asia, remains high. Shark-fin soup, which can cost more than $100 a bowl, has for centuries signified wealth and status, and it became especially popular in the late 1980s as a status item for China\u2019s rapidly expanding middle and upper classes. Ship captains often allow their crew members to supplement their income by keeping the fins for themselves to sell at port. Shark carcasses take up valuable hold space in smaller ships, and as they decompose, they produce ammonia that contaminates the other catch. Deckhands usually cut off the fins, which can sell for 100 times the cost of the rest of the meat. They then throw the rest of the shark back into the water. It\u2019s a slow death: The sharks sink to the sea floor, where they starve, drown or are eaten by other fish.", "In a given year, Palau faces 50 to 100 incursions by pirate vessels. Fish ignore borders \u2014 and, it turns out, so do many of the people pursuing them. While port inspections, wheel-room cameras, locational transponders and onboard observers are essential to better monitoring the oceans, policing is the only thing that will make Palau\u2019s new reserve, and others like it elsewhere in the world, more than just lines drawn on the water.", "Poachers are by no means Palau\u2019s only threat. Ocean acidi\u00adfication, warming marine temperatures, mega-cyclones and a Texas-size gyre of floating trash imperil the region\u2019s marine life. The islands themselves are threatened as well: As global warming raises sea levels, Palau\u2019s land, and the territory it protects, will diminish. One atoll on Palau\u2019s southernmost tip is sinking fast, and when it finally submerges completely, it will take roughly 54,000 square miles of territorial authority with it.", "The oceans belong to everyone and no one, and the general perception is that they are too big to need protection. We also tend to think of fish as an ever-regenerating crop, there forever for our taking. But roughly 90 percent of the world\u2019s ocean stocks are depleted or overexploited; one study predicts that by 2050, the sea could contain more plastic waste than fish. Though most governments have neither the inclination nor the resources to patrol the oceans, Palau is trying a different approach, and whether it succeeds or fails may have consequences for the entire planet.", "Early one calm morning shortly after I arrived in Palau, I met Baiei and several other police officers at their headquarters in Koror, where they had invited me to join them for some routine patrols. Though Koror is the nation\u2019s commercial center, it feels more like a remote resort \u2014 everywhere lushly green, its roads narrow and winding. The headquarters and dock sit in a more ramshackle part of town, tucked alongside a sewage-treatment plant and down the road from a brewery. Like a Humvee parked in front of a thatched hut, the 103-foot Remeliik stands out. Tall and steel-hulled, it is young in ship years, built in 1996.", "The plan was to patrol the waters near Kayangel, an atoll in the country\u2019s far north, an area popular for sea-cucumber and coral-fish poachers. A tiny, rugged fleck of land, roughly half a square mile, Kayangel has perhaps 60 year-round residents; there is no airstrip, and power and cell service are erratic. Local fishermen had spotted poachers near the atoll, and our patrol was meant to show a police presence in the area.", "For any given patrol, the chief of the marine police weighs a list of variables \u2014 credible threat, distance to target, available crew, sufficient fuel, weather \u2014 and decides if it\u2019s worth dispatching the Remeliik. Today, we would head out instead on one of the department\u2019s two much smaller fiberglass boats, which they use in shallow waters closer to shore. When we pulled out of port, the sea was glass-flat, but as the land behind us fell beneath the horizon, we began rolling in 10-foot swells \u2014 it was clear why this smaller boat was ill-suited to chasing poachers into deeper water.", "Policing the area around Kayangel has become more difficult as its population has dwindled. In December 2012, Typhoon Bopha leveled Kayangel, ravaging its nearby coral reefs. Eleven months later, Typhoon Haiyan did it again. With winds of more than 170 miles an hour, these were among the strongest tropical cyclones ever recorded on Earth. Many scientists agree that climate change is the reason for these increasingly intense storms. A 2014 study, which modeled the economic consequences of climate change on fisheries in the territorial waters of 62 countries, predicted that Palau would be hit harder than any other nation. \u2018\u2018I guess we can\u2019t arrest the climate,\u2019\u2019 Baiei later told me. \u2018\u2018We can just arrest people who come here to take our fish.\u2019\u2019 After a long silence, another officer muttered a retort \u2014 something in Palauan, which was later translated for me as \u2018\u2018easier said than done.\u2019\u2019", "Baiei said the turning point for Palau, the moment when the nation realized that it needed help, was March 29, 2012. The other officers shook their heads at the mere mention of the date. The agonizing story began earlier that month, when two Chinese poacher boats were spotted near the atoll for several days in a row. They kept escaping: Each was equipped with three 60-horsepower outboard motors, while the local wildlife rangers had only a Zodiac with one outboard motor.", "Around 7 a.m. on March 29, the Palauan rangers saw one of the Chinese boats again. This time they got close enough to try to shoot out its engines, Baiei said. They hit an engine, but they also hit a Chinese deckhand, Lu Yong. (Palauan rangers say they were not aiming for him; the bullets ricocheted off the engines.) The rangers called for help to rush Lu, 35, to a nearby island where a nurse lived, but he bled to death before they got there. He had a 9-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter in mainland China. But the day would only get more tragic from there.", "Boarding the Chinese boat and interrogating the rest of the crew, the Palauan rangers soon learned that there was a larger \u2018\u2018mother ship\u2019\u2019 farther at sea, orchestrating the poaching raids. This was too far for the small Zodiac to travel, so two Palauan policemen, Willie Mays Towai and Earlee Decherong, along with an American pilot, Frank Ohlinger, were dispatched in a rented single-engine Cessna to find the ship and call in its coordinates.", "As night fell, the pilot got lost, and the plane vanished. Meanwhile, about 35 miles from shore, another team, aboard the Remeliik, finally discovered the 80-foot mother ship, which immediately bolted, ignoring several warning shots fired across its bow. After several hours of running, though, the mother ship drifted to a halt. It was soon engulfed in flames, most likely from an intentional fire set to hide any evidence of poaching. The pirate crew scrambled into a lifeboat just before the ship sank, and they were arrested shortly thereafter.", "The Cessna pilot and the two policemen were still lost, wandering somewhere above the Pacific. The authorities on land came up with an idea: If they could illuminate the islands brightly enough, the pilot might see them and find his way back home. The public safety director ordered all emergency vehicles to drive to the highest points in Koror and turn on their flashing lights. \u2018\u2018Aim spotlights upward,\u2019\u2019 yachters were instructed. The stadium lights at Palau\u2019s Asahi baseball field were switched on. Residents were asked to turn on all household lights. Some stood in the streets waving flashlights. Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, who happened to be vacationing in Palau, provided the two helicopters on his 414-foot mega-yacht, the Octopus, for search and rescue. Allen\u2019s crew was instructed to fire 49 flares, one per minute, into the air. An official in Angaur, an island on the nation\u2019s southern tip, suggested setting some of the outer-atoll wooded areas on fire \u2014 a plan that was quickly dismissed.", "Back at the command center on Koror, several police officers were trying in vain to contact the plane. Its radio was malfunctioning. They could hear Ohlinger, but he could not hear them. For nearly five hours, culminating in a mayday call at 8:16 p.m., they listened to his growing panic, his rage at the plane\u2019s broken GPS unit and compass and, ultimately, his request that someone alert his next of kin. \u2018\u2018On a good glide slope, heading north,\u2019\u2019 Ohlinger said, as he explained that he and his two passengers planned to crash-land into the sea. \u2018\u2018We are at 6,000 feet, doing 65 knots, out of fuel,\u2019\u2019 were his last words. The wreckage was never found.", "The debacle was the subject of newspaper headlines internationally for weeks. The Chinese government sent a diplomatic envoy to Palau to discuss the shooting. Palau\u2019s president and attorney general opened an investigation. \u2018\u2018Palauans are a very proud people,\u2019\u2019 Baiei said. \u2018\u2018The whole thing was a tragedy and a really embarrassing one.\u2019\u2019 A little over a year later, Palau began working with SkyTruth and Pew to monitor its waters.", "In the span of one human lifetime, humankind has become brutally adept at plundering the seas. In the late 1940s, the annual global catch was roughly 16.5 million tons; now, after decades of innovation, this number is about 94 million tons. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s equivalent in weight of the entire human population at the turn of the 20th century, removed from the sea each and every year,\u2019\u2019 Paul Greenberg, an author of books about fish and seafood, told me.", "The major innovation, the one that in the 1930s helped transform fishing from hunting to something more akin to industrial mining, was the giant-scale purse seiner \u2014 a ship that surrounds an entire school of fish with a curtain of netting, sometimes nearly a mile around, then cinches it like a laundry bag. But more innovations followed. World War II gave incentive to the creation of lighter, faster, more durable ships that could travel farther on less fuel. Submarine combat drove improvements in sonar, which turned the ocean top into a glass table, making visible the unseen fathoms below. Subzero onboard freezers freed fishermen from their race against melting refrigerator ice. Innovations in plastics and monofilaments lengthened fishing lines from feet to miles. Lightweight polymer-based nets enabled supertrawlers to rake the ocean even more brutally.", "But, as the Palauans and their allies are discovering, technology can also be deployed for conservation. Just as authorities can use tracking devices and satellite data to monitor the activities of people on land, they are increasingly able to do so at sea. Since the 1990s, ships have deployed the Automatic Identification System, or A.I.S., a once-voluntary collision-avoidance system whereby onboard VHF transmitters convey their position, identity and speed continuously to other ships and to satellites. In 2002, the United Nations\u2019 maritime organization mandated A.I.S. for nearly all passenger ships regardless of size, and commercial ships, fishing vessels included, with a gross tonnage of more than 300 (typically, that\u2019s a 130-foot long vessel) in international waters.", "A.I.S. has its shortcomings. Captains are allowed to turn the transponders off when they perceive a credible danger of being tracked by pirates \u2014 a gaping loophole for poachers. The system can be hacked to give false locations. Many of the ships involved in the worst crimes, like the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, are smaller than 300 tonnes and thus exempt from the system entirely. Partly as a response to the deficiencies of A.I.S., many countries now also require fishing vessels to carry an additional device called a vessel-monitoring system, or V.M.S. Typically, this takes the form of a cone-shaped antenna on the roof of the wheelhouse, wired to a locked transceiver and the ship\u2019s control panel, that transmits their location and other data to local fishery authorities at all times.", "More sea-traffic data may become available soon as countries consider deploying devices in the water \u2014 sonar and camera buoys, as well as low-cost floating hydrophones \u2014 to catch ships approaching restricted areas. Even storm clouds, which long concealed many crimes at sea, no longer pose as much of an obstacle. Satellites armed with syn\u00adthetic-aperture radar can detect a vessel\u2019s position regardless of weather conditions. All this data becomes especially useful when coupled with sophisticated software whose algorithms can trigger alerts \u2014 if, for instance, a vessel goes \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019 by turning off its transponder, if it zigzags in certain formations that indicate that it\u2019s fishing or if it enters a forbidden area. Now, instead of blindly patrolling broad swaths of ocean, the police can target their efforts.", "Still, the most reliable form of ocean law enforcement continues to be real-time direct surveillance, which is neither easy nor cheap. Generating close-in imagery from the sky depends predominantly on military-grade drones. Ordering up high-resolution photographs from space is still extremely costly, sometimes more than $3,500 per picture, and the company or government that operates the satellite often requires the request for the image to be made days in advance, so operators can aim the lens at the right location on its next trip hurtling around the Earth. Palau experimented with smaller, commercially available drones in 2013, in a project funded by an Australian mining magnate, Andrew Forrest. But the drones proved to be too expensive and hard to fly, and the cameras mounted on the drones gave too tightly circumscribed a view of the waters below.", "The eventual dream is to create systems that pull all the antipoaching intelligence together in real time, giving the police and their helpers a God\u2019s-eye view of their adversaries. In 2014, SkyTruth joined with Google and the nonprofit group Oceana to build Global Fishing Watch, a website that will allow an army of would-be Bjorn Bergmans to track A.I.S. data on roughly 80,000 vessels worldwide. Last year, Pew teamed up with a British company called Satellite Applications Catapult to create a virtual \u2018\u2018watch room\u2019\u2019 program that, drawing on live satellite tracking data, displays a map of the world traversed by lighted dots, each one a fishing vessel. Even as the vastness of the oceans makes it easy for poachers to escape, technology is also making it harder for them to hide.", "For all the attention paid to hidden illegal fishing, the bigger problem is legal overfishing, which takes place in plain sight. Most of the fish that are consumed around the world \u2014 about four of every five served in the United States \u2014 is caught in full compliance with the law. In the Western Pacific Ocean, near Palau, much of that fishing occurs with help from specially designed buoys called fish aggregating devices, or FADs. In Palau, local fishermen can still use simple FADs. Often the devices consist of little more than plastic and bamboo flotsam strung together with old nets. But elsewhere they can also be impressively sophisticated.", "Many valuable fish species \u2014 including tuna, blue marlin and mahi-mahi \u2014 huddle near floating objects for protection and mating. FADs take advantage of this instinct, attracting fish in spectacularly dense schools that fishermen quickly scoop up. \u2018\u2018Drifting\u2019\u2019 FADs are unanchored: Fishermen track them by following the currents. \u2018\u2018Moored\u2019\u2019 FADs are tethered to the ocean floor, typically with concrete blocks. Increasingly, fishing companies are deploying \u2018\u2018smart\u2019\u2019 FADs equipped with sonar and GPS, enabling operators to sit back and wait for an alert when it\u2019s time to retrieve their haul.", "The global popularity of FADs is, at least in part, an unintended consequence of the movement to save dolphins. Commercial fishing fleets once found tuna by looking for dolphins, which follow tuna schools and swim near the surface above them. In the 1980s and 1990s, the push for \u2018\u2018dolphin free\u2019\u2019 tuna drove many of these fishermen from the Eastern Tropical Pacific, near Baja, to the Central and Western Pacific Ocean, near Palau, where the dolphins typically don\u2019t follow tuna. In making this move, many of these ships turned to FADs as their new tactic \u2014 even though the devices are widely criticized for further industrializing the harvest of fast-disappearing species like sharks, sea turtles and tuna.", "On one patrol with Baiei, we stopped at a FAD so that I could dive in for a closer look. Bathwater-warm, the ocean was translucent turquoise, the current as strong as a river. The FAD was low-tech and anchored, just a plastic buoy attached to a thick, mollusk-coated rope tethered to the ocean floor more than 500 feet below. Large bamboo leaves ran down the first 50 feet of the rope, flapping like fuzzy moth wings. Hundreds of tiny silver fish darted under the shade of the leaves. Not one fish was more than a foot long.", "We visited three more FADs during the patrol that day, traversing more than 100 miles. All were barren. The fish, Baiei explained, were all being taken before they could even come to the reserve. Tuna, like many large ocean fish, are migratory. Even if their natural path might take them to the safety of Palau\u2019s asylum, they can be picked off beforehand in any number of ways \u2014 including by being netted at one of the more than 50,000 floating FADs in the Western and Central Pacific, most of which are perfectly legal.", "In recent years, a handful of countries have tried to slow the ocean plunder. They have limited trawling, put caps on FAD numbers and imposed rules to limit \u2018\u2018bycatch,\u2019\u2019 the unwanted species caught in the hunt for prized fish. Perhaps the most promising tactic has been to create more no-take reserves like Palau\u2019s. In 2014, the Obama administration added 400,000 square miles of similarly protected territory to United States waters. In 2015, the British government announced its intent to establish the world\u2019s largest continuous marine reserve (322,000 square miles) around the Pitcairn Islands. But these reserves work only if they are well policed. Otherwise, they become magnets for poachers who see them as robust and competition-free zones. And, as we saw at our own little FAD, even a well-policed reserve is not enough to protect the fish who freely swim outside their safe zones. Presently such reserves cover around 2 percent of the world\u2019s seas, but many oceanographers say we need to cover at least 10 percent to make a substantial difference.", "As the sun set, one marine officer said he wanted to check a final FAD near an islet called Orak, this time in hopes of landing a few fish for dinner. After dragging their longline in circles around it for an hour, they gave up, empty-handed. Docking instead at a nearby island, the officers bought some chicken stew from the local market.", "On another patrol, this time aboard the Remeliik, about 80 miles from shore, we spotted a weather-beaten fishing ship, the Sheng Chi Huei 12. A tuna longliner from Taiwan, rusty and stacked with tackle, it could have been just passing through \u2014 or it could have been poaching. After radioing its captain, the Palauan police pulled up alongside for an inspection. Several officers boarded and quickly corralled the six-man Indonesian crew into the front of the ship.", "I wanted a better view, but as I started to climb onto an upper deck, one of the Indonesian crewmen lunged forward and grabbed my wrist. My hand was inches away from touching an electrified steel cable that the fishermen use to stun catch that flop wildly when first pulled on deck. The crewman pointed to a six-inch black burn mark on a shipmate\u2019s arm, warning me of what the cable could do.", "I watched the Palauan officers struggle to get basic answers, relying on one of the Indonesian crew who spoke a tiny bit of Chinese and English to translate: How old are the men in your crew? Spell their names. (The captain was illiterate.) Tell me the date when you entered our waters. The paperwork checked out, and the officers could find no illegal fish.", "As the officers questioned the ship\u2019s captain, I wandered to the back of the ship. A ladder down a hatch led to a four-foot high tunnel, where crawling on hands and knees was the only option. Running the length of the vessel, the tunnel was lined with a dozen six-foot-long cubbies, each with wadded-up clothing at one end serving as pillows. The trip from Taiwan to these waters (about 1,400 miles) takes a little over a week. In high seas and heavy weather, staying on deck is out of the question. The farther I crawled, the darker and muggier it got and the heavier the flow of fumes, heat and noise. A rat scurried ahead. A rancid-smelling liquid dripped from above. The captain later told me that this was runoff from the upper-deck cutting tables.", "At the deepest end of the tunnel, I came to the ship\u2019s huge diesel engine, churning furiously. I sat in that tight space for a couple of minutes to take in the scene. It dawned on me that the passageway I had just descended was not just the men\u2019s sleeping quarters. It was also the engine\u2019s main exhaust pipe.", "Back on the Remeliik, I passed the time reading a confidential investigation report about the 2012 Cessna incident, which had been leaked to me by a Palauan official. It in\u00ad\u00adcluded transcripts of interviews with the 25 fishermen from the illegal Chinese boats, who had been arrested and held in the Koror jail for 17 days. Most of the men had never been to sea before, nor did they know the name of their ship, the fishing company or even their captain. Most had handed their identity cards over to the fishing company, which had hired them only several months earlier. Many claimed that they fled that day because they thought the Palauans, who were not in uniform, were planning to rob them. \u2018\u2018He claims that he does not know about any fishing permits,\u2019\u2019 a police investigator said of one deckhand. \u2018\u2018They only follow what the captain tells them.\u2019\u2019", "The crew members pleaded guilty and were fined $1,000 each. Their small fast boat was destroyed, their gear confiscated. They were then flown home, with their slain colleague, Yong Lu, in a coffin, on a charter flight sent by the Chinese government. One line in the investigation report struck me. It said that in several days of poaching, the Chinese crew caught fewer than a dozen fish, primarily lapu lapu, and several large clams, most of which they later threw overboard as they fled the authorities. It seemed a tragically small yield.", "In the wheel room of the Remeliik that night, the officers did a post mortem about the day\u2019s boarding, and the discussion turned to the crews that work on these poacher ships. \u2018\u2018Aren\u2019t they the enemy?\u2019\u2019 I asked. Several officers shook their heads to say no. Once the authorities take the foreign crews to shore, there is no guarantee that Palau will have the translators to communicate with them, jail space to hold them or even the laws to effectively prosecute them. Many of the poachers they arrest are from family-owned businesses and are unable to pay the $500,000 fine Palau has the option to levy. The government can seize the ship, but the cost to feed, house and repatriate the crew is often more than its resale value.", "Near the end of our patrol, Baiei asked me if I had ever seen a diver with the bends. I said I hadn\u2019t. He explained that many of the poachers they chase are Vietnamese, young divers who target sea cucumbers, which live on the ocean floor and look like giant, leather-skinned slugs. The Vietnamese crewmen hold rubber hoses in their mouths attached to an onboard air compressor, strap lead weights around their waists, then dive, often deeper than a hundred feet. During an arrest last year, Baiei said, one of these divers shot to the surface too quickly, causing excruciating bubbles to form in his joints and elsewhere. They took him to a hospital to recover. \u2018\u2018He just kept moaning for days,\u2019\u2019 Baiei said.", "One of the other officers, who had been listening to the conversation quietly, looked up from his inspection logs. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re the real bycatch,\u2019\u2019 he said. For Palau\u2019s police, the catch \u2014 the far more elusive target \u2014 was the fishing companies who send these desperate men to sea to flout the law. But in a sense, even those bosses are bycatch, too, in a worldwide fishing economy where sanctioned corporations, far more than poachers, are stripping the oceans of life. To save Palau\u2019s fish, and the world\u2019s, the law and its enforcers need to bring an entire industrial system to heel: a mission that requires a level of international cooperation and political will that has yet to materialize."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/nyregion/a-new-charitable-project-the-projects.html": ["Late last fall, Rasmia Kirmani-Frye, a lapsed doctoral student in urban policy and an executive at the New York City Housing Authority, gave a talk in Chicago, floating the notion that public housing, as if it were a museum or a prep school, should present itself as a philanthropic cause.", "After the discussion, a political strategist who was in the audience suggested that any fund for public housing omit the phrase itself, because \u201cpeople hate public housing.\u201d", "Despite antipathy or ignorance about housing projects among the affluent, the de Blasio administration argues that the city\u2019s Housing Authority, with 328 developments containing more than 600,000 people \u2014 a population larger than Atlanta\u2019s \u2014 could become an attractive beneficiary of charitable money. To be overseen by Ms. Kirmani-Frye, a newly created nonprofit, the Fund for Public Housing, seeks to raise $200 million over the next three years. It received its first check, from Deutsche Bank for $100,000, in December.", "There are certainly precedents for private donations to public entities: The private, nonprofit Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980, when the city\u2019s maintenance budget fell woefully short, and now supplies some 75 percent of the park\u2019s annual budget. In more recent years, charter schools have turned to philanthropists to raise money for rent and teachers. Still, the Fund for Public Housing represents an unusual grasp for private donations from a troubled city agency, the largest housing authority in the country.", "Years of divestment by the federal government have left the Housing Authority with nearly $17 billion in unmet capital needs, and annual operating deficits of tens of millions of dollars. Last year, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the authority\u2019s chairwoman, Shola Olatoye, outlined a 10-year strategy for mitigating the agency\u2019s fiscal crisis, in part with plans to lease certain quadrants of ground-floor space to retailers; reduce staff size; offer parking spaces to nonresidents at market rates; and offer poorly used land for sale to developers. (This last proposal, known as infill, has been controversial since the Bloomberg era.)", "Ms. Olatoye and Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen had been talking about a charitable fund devoted to public housing for years, well before they held their current positions. One obstacle is that only a relatively small fraction of philanthropic dollars each year goes to poverty-related causes to begin with. Beyond that, in the absence of a personal connection to a particular mission, or the aura of social prestige, donors are often prompted to give when there is an emotional narrative to which they can respond, and drab, monolithic buildings don\u2019t easily move people.", "The initial goal, Ms. Olatoye says, is to tap, as a university would, into an alumni base. That base includes Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs; Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks; the former schools chancellor Joel I. Klein; the rap artist Jay Z; and the retired basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, all of whom grew up in New York City public housing.", "Part of the challenge to fund-raising is that not all graduates of public housing are necessarily proud to have come of age in the projects or consider it crucial to their success. In a documentary a few years ago, Ursula M. Burns, the chief executive of Xerox, who grew up in the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, said of moving there from the tenements: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know the show \u2018The Jeffersons,\u2019 moving on up? We were moving on up, from the really bad to the bad.\u201d", "Still, there are obvious appeals to be made. \u201cWe want New Yorkers who grew up in public housing or who value New York as a diverse place \u2014 and that diversity is largely because of Nycha \u2014 to step up,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said. \u201cThe sell isn\u2019t about fixing up our buildings; it\u2019s about the fact that one in 12 New Yorkers lives in Nycha housing.\u201d", "While the need for plumbing repairs in the Farragut Houses may not stir charitable impulses, the fact that the average household income of residents in New York City public housing is $23,000 a year, or that 40 percent of adults in the projects without disabilities are unemployed, could. The fund will be used, Ms. Kirmani-Frye said, to improve the lives of residents by updating buildings in chronic disrepair, advancing job and career opportunities and connecting housing developments, which can often be isolated either geographically or psychologically from the rest of the city. One hope, she said, is to bridge the informal economies that arise in public housing \u2014 a mother selling layer cakes she bakes in her apartment, for instance \u2014 to larger commercial enterprises outside the system.", "Scott Anderson, a technology executive who has joined the fund\u2019s nascent board of directors, said he was struck by the opportunity to expand digital access in public housing. A new partnership with Google Fiber in Kansas City, Mo., for example, is allowing more and more residents to have Internet access. \u201cThere\u2019s a great socioeconomic lift with providing connectivity to the web,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cThere are all sorts of opportunities for systems to be improved.\u201d", "The stark examples of inequality that have arisen in the city in recent years as a result of gentrification present themselves, ironically enough, as opportunity. That there are now wealthy neighborhoods abutting public housing complexes in Chelsea, for instance, or in Dumbo in Brooklyn means that well-off people at the very least now have a more intimate view of the projects. Gary Hattem, the president of the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, who made the first donation to the Fund for Public Housing, lives in brownstone Brooklyn two blocks from public housing in Fort Greene.", "\u201cPublic housing isn\u2019t an obvious recipient of philanthropy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you think about what makes New York City work, public housing is just so essential to the success of families and neighborhoods, and that has too long been unrecognized.\u201d", "Philanthropy often works bests when it appeals to human vanity.

Within two minutes, an automated Kensho analysis popped up on his screen: a brief overview, followed by 13 exhibits predicting the performance of investments based on their past response to similar employment reports.", "Nadler couldn\u2019t have double-checked all this analysis if he wanted to. It was based on thousands of numbers drawn from dozens of databases. He just wanted to make sure that Kensho had pulled the right number \u2014 the overall growth in American payrolls \u2014 from the employment report. It was the least he could do, given that within minutes, at 8:35 a.m., Kensho\u2019s analysis would be made available to employees at Goldman Sachs.", "In addition to being a customer, Goldman is also Kensho\u2019s largest investor. Nadler, who is 32, spent the rest of the morning checking in with some of the bank\u2019s most regular Kensho users \u2014 a top executive on the options-and-derivatives-trading desks, a fund manager \u2014 then took an Uber down for a lunch meeting at Goldman\u2019s glass tower just off the West Side Highway in Manhattan. While almost everyone in the building dresses in neatly pressed work attire, Nadler rarely deviates from his standard outfit: Louis Vuitton leather sandals and a casual but well-cut T-shirt and pants, both by the designer Alexander Wang. Nadler owns 10 sets of these. His austere aesthetic is informed by the summer vacations he spent in Japan while pursuing a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard, mostly visiting temples and meditating. (\u2018\u2018Kensho\u2019\u2019 is the Japanese term for one of the first states of awareness in the Zen Buddhist progression.) He also wrote a volume of poetry \u2014 imagined ancient love poems \u2014 that Farrar Straus & Giroux will publish later this year.", "I met with Nadler later that day in his own office, across the street from the Goldman building, on the 45th floor of 1 World Trade Center. His dozen or so employees shared a large room decked out in typical start-up style, including an aquarium and large speakers playing electronic music. Nadler has an office off to the side with little more than a large desk, made out of reclaimed telephone poles, and a large upholstered leather chair with matching ottoman. After closing the door, Nadler, who has curly dark hair and pale skin, sat on the ottoman, folded his bare feet under him and told me about the day\u2019s feedback from Goldman. This included some tips on what they wanted in the next report, and a good dose of amazement at Kensho\u2019s speed. \u2018\u2018People always tell me, \u2018I used to spend two out of five days a week doing this sort of thing,\u2019 or \u2018I used to have a guy whose job it was to do nothing other than this one thing,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Nadler said.", "This might sound like bragging. But Nadler was primarily recounting those reactions as a way of explaining his concern about the impact that start-ups like his are likely to have on the financial industry. Within a decade, he said, between a third and a half of the current employees in finance will lose their jobs to Kensho and other automation software. It began with the lower-paid clerks, many of whom became unnecessary when stock tickers and trading tickets went electronic. It has moved on to research and analysis, as software like Kensho has become capable of parsing enormous data sets far more quickly and reliably than humans ever could. The next \u2018\u2018tranche,\u2019\u2019 as Nadler puts it, will come from the employees who deal with clients: Soon, sophisticated interfaces will mean that clients no longer feel they need or even want to work through a human being.", "\u2018\u2018I\u2019m assuming that the majority of those people over a five-to-10-year horizon are not going to be replaced by other people,\u2019\u2019 he said, getting into the flow of his thoughts, which, for Nadler, meant closing his eyes and gesticulating as though he were preaching or playing the piano. \u2018\u2018In 10 years Goldman Sachs will be significantly smaller by head count than it is today.\u2019\u2019", "Goldman executives are reluctant to discuss the plight of their displaced financial analysts. Several managers I spoke to insisted that Kensho has not yet caused any layoffs, nor is it likely to soon. Nadler had warned me that I would hear something like that. \u2018\u2018When you start talking about automating jobs,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018everybody all of a sudden gets really quiet.\u2019\u2019", "Goldman employees who lose their jobs to machines are not likely to evoke much pity. But it is exactly Goldman\u2019s privileged status that makes the threat to its workers so interesting. If jobs can be displaced at Goldman, they can probably be displaced even more quickly at other, less sophisticated companies, within the financial industry as well as without.", "I\nn late 2013, two Oxford academics released a paper claiming that 47 percent of current American jobs are at \u2018\u2018high risk\u2019\u2019 of being automated within the next 20 years. The findings provoked lots of worried news reports about robots stealing jobs. The study looked at 702 occupations, using data from the Department of Labor, and assigned a probability of automation to each one, according to nine variables. The conclusions made it clear that this was no longer just the familiar (and ongoing) story of robots replacing factory and warehouse employees. Now software is increasingly doing the work that has been the province of educated people sitting in desk chairs. The vulnerability of these jobs is due, in large part, to the easy availability and rapidly declining price of computing power, as well as the rise of \u2018\u2018machine learning\u2019\u2019 software, like Kensho, that gathers and assimilates new information on its own.", "According to the Oxford paper and subsequent research, employment prospects vary significantly by industry. In health care, for example, where human interaction is vital, automation threatens fewer jobs than it does in the labor market as a whole. Taxi and truck drivers, though, face a bleak future given recent advances in self-driving cars. Among better-compensated professions, the Oxford researchers took into account software that can analyze and sort legal documents, doing the work that even well-paid lawyers often spend hours on. Journalists face start-ups like Automated Insights, which is already writing up summaries of basketball games. Finance stood out in particular: Because of the degree to which the industry is built on processing information \u2014 the stuff of digitization \u2014 the research suggested that it has more jobs at high risk of automation than any skilled industry, about 54 percent.", "The Oxford study received plenty of criticism \u2014 understandably, given the patina of exactness that it tried to apply to a speculative exercise. Nevertheless, the financial industry is taking automation very seriously, both as an opportunity and as a threat. It is one thing to make a few analysts redundant, but automation could put whole business models in peril. Investments in what is known as fintech, or financial technology, tripled between 2013 and 2014 to $12.2 billion, and start-ups are now taking aim at nearly every line of financial business. Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check. So-called robo-advisers create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers. Nearly every Wall Street firm has put out research reports on the tens of billions of dollars of revenue that might be lost to these upstarts in the coming years. Banks are trying to fend off the newcomers by making their own investments in start-ups like Kensho, which has raised more than $25 million so far.", "The skilled industries that form the bedrock of New York City\u2019s economy have so far largely avoided this sort of transformation, because the work of financial analysts, publishers and designers hasn\u2019t been easy to automate. But to look at a company like Kensho, and the sort of conversation it generates across the financial industry, is to see the degree to which these trends are now confronting industries that used to be thought exempt from this sort of disruption. Last fall, Antony Jenkins, who was dismissed a few months earlier as chief executive of Barclays, the giant British bank, gave a speech in which he said a coming series of \u2018\u2018Uber moments\u2019\u2019 would hit the financial industry.", "\u2018\u2018I predict that the number of branches and people employed in the financial-services sector may decline by as much as 50 percent,\u2019\u2019 Jenkins told the audience. \u2018\u2018Even in a less-harsh scenario, I expect a decline of at least 20 percent.\u2019\u2019 This process could, in at least some cases, help do away with some of the expensive bloat in the financial system, providing more transparent services with fewer hidden fees. It could also be seen as a satisfying blow against the titans of an industry that only recently almost crashed the world economy. But so far the burden of job losses is stopping just short of the executive suites, even as the gains in efficiency are worsening already troubling levels of income inequality.", "Some of the venture capitalists backing Kensho have told Nadler that he would be wise to stop talking about the potential job losses at the same banks he is trying to secure as customers. Nadler has told them that he needs to carry on, partly to maintain his intellectual integrity. He often connects his discussion of jobs to his political fund-raising on behalf of candidates who call for a more robust social-safety net. But he also says that his awareness of what his business is both creating and taking away sets him apart as an entrepreneur: It\u2019s his \u2018\u2018edge\u2019\u2019 in a business that is all about competing to predict the future more accurately.", "K\nensho\u2019s main customers at Goldman so far have been the salespeople who work on the bank\u2019s high-ceiling trading floors. In recent months, they have used the software to respond to incoming phone calls from investors who buy and sell energy stocks and commodities, wondering how they should position their portfolios in response to, for instance, flare-ups in the Syrian civil war. In the old days, the salespeople could draw on their own knowledge of recent events and how markets responded, with all the limitations of human memory. For a particularly valuable client, the sales representative might have called a research analyst within Goldman to run a more complete study, digging up old news events and looking at how markets responded in each case. The problem with this approach was that by the time the results came back, the original trading opportunity was often gone.", "Now a sales representative can simply click an icon and access the Kensho interface, which consists of a simple black search bar. Nadler walked me through the process on his own laptop. Type in the word \u2018\u2018Syria,\u2019\u2019 and several groups of events related to Syria\u2019s civil war appear, in much the same way that Google recommends queries based on past searches. Here, among the top event groups, are \u2018\u2018Advances Against ISIS,\u2019\u2019 which includes 25 past events, and \u2018\u2018Major ISIS Advances and Brutal Atrocities,\u2019\u2019 with 105 events.", "Kensho\u2019s software is constantly tweaking and broadening these suggested search terms, all with little human intervention. In some ways, this is the most sophisticated part of the program. In the past, a trader or analyst would have to search Wikipedia or a news database using whatever keywords came to mind. Kensho\u2019s search engine automatically categorizes events according to abstract features. It has figured out, for instance, that ISIS\u2019s seizure of Palmyra and France\u2019s first airstrike in Syria were both escalations in the civil war there but also that in one of those cases, ISIS was the aggressor while in the other case, it was on the defense. The software also looks for new and unexpected relationships between events and asset prices, allowing it to recommend searches that a user might not have considered. For this feature, Nadler said, he hired one of the machine-learning whizzes who worked on Google\u2019s megacatalog of the world\u2019s libraries.", "Back on the trading desk, after picking out one group of events \u2014 the 27 incidents of \u2018\u2018Escalations in the Syrian civil war,\u2019\u2019 say \u2014 a sales trader can pick from a series of drop-down menus that narrow the search to a specific time period and a specific set of investments. The broadest set includes the world\u2019s 40 or so major assets, including German stocks, the Australian dollar and a few varieties of crude oil. They can then click on the green Generate Study button, and a few minutes later they\u2019ll have a new page full of charts. Nadler clicked to demonstrate. The top chart showed that the prices of natural gas and crude oil have underperformed in the weeks after past escalations in the war, while Asian stocks and the United States and Canadian dollar pair has outperformed. Scrolling down, we could also see how each event in Syria played out and begin to structure an optimal set of trades based on that history.", "Nadler closed his laptop. The whole process had taken just a few minutes. Generating a similar query without automation, he said, \u2018\u2018would have taken days, probably 40 man-hours, from people who were making an average of $350,000 to $500,000 a year.\u2019\u2019", "T\nhis is all quite something for a company that was first dreamed up less than three years ago. In 2013, while in graduate school, Nadler was working as a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston. At the time, the Greek elections and instability across Europe were buffeting the financial markets. When Nadler asked how he could find out what impact similar events had on financial markets, he learned that neither the regulators nor the bankers had any good method for doing so beyond digging up old news clips. In his free time, Nadler began talking with a former Google programmer he befriended at a student club for Japan enthusiasts. Nadler was supposed to be finishing up his doctoral dissertation on the influence of politics on the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, within weeks, he had put together a small team and received early funding for his idea from Google\u2019s venture-capital arm. They later received investments from many other sources, including the C.I.A.\u2019s venture-capital arm, according to Forbes.", "Kensho\u2019s main office is still in Cambridge, Mass., two floors above an old barbershop, with windows looking out onto Harvard Yard. The 30 or so employees in the large main room look like the kind of bright-eyed kids who in years past might have gone to work for Goldman Sachs. Here, though, they work at standup desks, wear jeans and enjoy the benefits of a Zen room, with pillows and tatami mats for meditation, as well as a game room with chessboards and a poker table.", "I visited the Cambridge office in December, shortly before Christmas. When I arrived, most of the employees were doing their Secret Santa gift exchange; their laughter frequently trickled back to the conference room where I sat with Nadler and a few of his top deputies. Curious to know how much they all talked about the larger implications of their work, I asked the deputies how quickly the topic of automation and job loss had come up in their relationship with Nadler.", "\u2018\u2018Pretty much the second sentence,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Taylor, the chief technology officer, who, at 38, is one of the senior citizens of the company.", "\u2018\u2018This was Day 1,\u2019\u2019 said Martin Camacho, Kensho\u2019s 20-year-old chief architect, who entered Harvard as a freshman when he was 15.", "Camacho remembered going home one night to Nadler\u2019s apartment during their first summer working on Kensho. They watched the science-fiction film \u2018\u2018Oblivion,\u2019\u2019 about a world populated by alien-generated human clones, and stayed up talking about the socioeconomic implications of the story. More recently, Nadler invited his engineering team to a dinner at one of Cambridge\u2019s nicest restaurants, Henrietta\u2019s Table, for a group conversation about the more distant implications of automation. Nadler said he anticipated some form of strong artificial intelligence, whereby computers in the far future would be smart enough to anticipate our needs and usher in an era of abundance. For the next few decades, though, he predicted a more complicated time \u2014 an interregnum in which the computers are not as smart as people but smart enough to do many of the tasks that make us money.", "Camacho was less pessimistic than his boss. When computer-assisted math proofs were invented a few years back, he said, it didn\u2019t lead to any decline in the number of math-research jobs. \u2018\u2018I think there will be plenty for everyone to do,\u2019\u2019 Taylor said, agreeing.", "When I raised the topic of automation with executives at Goldman and beyond, I often heard a similarly optimistic belief that all the new software will free up employees in the financial industry to do other, more valuable things; that it would also create new types of jobs that don\u2019t exist right now. Several executives I spoke with argued that when A.T.M.s were widely deployed, you didn\u2019t suddenly see bank branches disappearing.", "This is a common criticism of the Oxford report on automation: Even if 47 percent of all current jobs end up being automated, that does not mean that 47 percent of the working population will not have jobs, as many newspaper articles on the report concluded. Cars once displaced lots of coachmen and stable boys but created many more new jobs laying out highways and attending service stations. Nowadays, software that provides financial advice has automated the work of some stockbrokers, but it is also expanding the number of people getting financial advice and the demand for cheap investment products.", "The lead author on the Oxford paper, Carl Benedikt Frey, told me that he was aware that new technologies created jobs even as they destroyed them. But, Frey was quick to add, just because the total number of jobs stays the same doesn\u2019t mean there are no disruptions along the way. The automation of textile work may not have driven up the national unemployment rate, but vast swathes of the American South suffered all the same. When it comes to those A.T.M.s, there has, in fact, been a recent steady decline in both the number of bank branches and the number of bank tellers, even as the number of low-paid workers in remote call centers has grown.", "This points to a disconcerting possibility: Perhaps this time the machines really are reducing overall employment levels. In a recent survey of futurists and technologists, the Pew Research Institute found that about half foresee a future in which jobs continue to disappear at a faster rate than they are created.", "M\nartin Chavez, a boisterous, bearded man who runs all of Goldman\u2019s technological operations, is unrestrained in his enthusiasm for Kensho. \u2018\u2018This thing that we would have done in a very bespoke, almost artisanal way is now something that Kensho has industrialized,\u2019\u2019 he told me.", "Chavez said Kensho itself was unlikely to displace many employees. The software, he said, was doing something that was previously so time-consuming that it was seldom attempted. (Some users also told me that there were still significant limitations on the sort of events the software could search.) But whatever the impact of Kensho, Chavez\u2019s larger efforts to digitize more of Goldman\u2019s operations are already changing the number and the type of employees at the firm. Over the last few years, the number of campus recruits coming to Goldman from science-and-technology majors has gone up 5 percent each year, while the total head count has barely budged. (Goldman is one of the few companies on Wall Street at which the total number of employees hasn\u2019t dropped significantly.) \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure there are going to be new jobs 10 or 20 years from now that none of us could even imagine today,\u2019\u2019 Chavez said.", "Stock trading, one of the earliest areas to go electronic, provides an interesting precedent for how automation can play out in an institution like Goldman. On the company\u2019s trading desks, stocks are now bought and sold by computers instead of people. Chavez says that the advent of computerized trading over the last two decades has reduced the number of Goldman employees who buy and sell American stocks the old-fashioned way \u2014 over the phone \u2014 to four from around 600, but the change in the number of traders tells only part of the story. Some of the traditional traders were replaced by programmers who design and monitor the new trading algorithms. Beyond that, there are now new jobs in the data centers where the high-speed trading takes place.", "Goldman doesn\u2019t provide numbers on any of this. But Paul Chou, who worked on Goldman\u2019s electronic-trading desks from 2006 to 2010, told me that he would guess that the company probably needed one programmer for every 10 of the old-school traders who lost their jobs. In one sign of the shrinking work force, Goldman moved the last trader out of one of its four Manhattan trading floors last year.", "The progression of Goldman\u2019s stock-trading operations also illustrates that automation is not an on-off switch. When Chou first joined Goldman, after graduating from M.I.T., part of his job involved logging onto dozens of trading systems and checking on what the algorithms were spitting out to make sure they weren\u2019t making any mistakes before the trades were executed. Chou sat near a woman who had been doing phone-based trading for years. She helped Chou and his young colleagues learn what to look for in a good trade. Over time, though, the programs proved themselves more error-proof than the humans. The woman left Goldman. And then Chou himself created a new program that logged into all the trading systems and pulled everything into a single screen. When he first got it going, he remembers his boss, a programmer himself, turning to Chou and saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even know why I show up to work anymore.\u2019\u2019", "The software Chou designed made it possible for him to dedicate himself to higher-level work, researching new trading strategies for the computers. This was more satisfying than all the monitoring he had been doing, but eventually it became too repetitive as well. Chou left Goldman in 2010 for Silicon Valley and now runs LedgerX, an options exchange that he founded with his wife and two others. The team he left at Goldman was smaller than it was when he arrived.", "Over the course of my conversations with Nadler, he backed away from the notion that Kensho will destroy jobs at Goldman itself. But he said he had no doubt that Kensho and other financial start-ups would eliminate jobs as they expanded across the industry and that the pace of the losses would be much faster outside Goldman than inside. After the end of Goldman\u2019s period of exclusivity with Kensho last summer, Nadler signed contracts to roll out the software at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.", "The number of jobs that these banks will support in the future will be influenced by much more than just software. Banks are currently cutting back in response to slower-than-expected economic growth and new regulations since the financial crisis. But these factors are also encouraging all the banks to look for any place where they can find a cheaper and more transparent way to do jobs that are currently being done by expensive and unreliable humans.", "When I asked Chavez whether the job losses were likely to continue to outpace the gains, he reacted with what seemed like genuine uncertainty. \u2018\u2018That is one of the most interesting questions of our time,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "C\narl Benedikt Frey, the lead author of the 2013 study on automation, has done more recent research indicating that innovations are no longer providing as big a boost to the economy and the labor force as they did in the past. In a paper he published last year with Thor Berger, a Swedish academic, he found that in the 1980s, a large portion of the American work force was going into job categories that did not exist a decade before; IBM, in other words, was hiring. That movement, though, slowed down in the \u201990s and went practically to zero between 2000 and 2010. To the degree that there are new jobs, Frey\u2019s data suggests that they are often lower-paying ones that serve the wealthy elite, in roles like personal trainer or barista.", "\u2018\u2018Technology is becoming more labor-saving and less job-creating,\u2019\u2019 Frey said.", "One theory for why this might be happening is that many of the recent technological advances have been in software rather than hardware. While a company like IBM or Dell needed employees to build each new computer for every new customer, software like Facebook and Kensho can be replicated endlessly, at near-zero marginal cost. When Chou came up with the software that automatically logged onto dozens of trading systems, it could essentially have been rolled out across all of Goldman\u2019s trading desks around the world the next day. This is very different from the 1970s, when Detroit would need to retrofit its car-manufacturing plants one at a time, after the robots themselves were actually built. The difference is what convinced Chou, after his time at Goldman Sachs and in Silicon Valley, that this phase of automation would play out differently from past ones.", "\u2018\u2018We are not coming up with new jobs as fast as we are replacing them,\u2019\u2019 Chou told me.", "This observation appears to be borne out by Kensho. In less than three years, Nadler\u2019s company has expanded to serve three of the world\u2019s largest banks and has needed only around 50 employees to do so, just enough to fill two relatively small offices. Recently, Nadler\u2019s New York staff moved to a bigger office in 1 World Trade Center. It has more room for desks so that Kensho can expand. But most of the additional space is taken up by a kitchen, a pool table and a putting green.", "The growth has made Kensho worth hundreds of millions of dollars and turned Nadler into a millionaire many times over, at least when his stake in the company is taken into account. But it\u2019s not clear how beneficial his company will be to the American labor market as a whole. Back when I first met Nadler, for a lunch last summer, he wasn\u2019t too proud to admit this. \u2018\u2018The cynical answer that another tech entrepreneur would give you is that we\u2019re creating new jobs, we\u2019re creating technology jobs,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve created, on paper at least, more than a dozen millionaires.", "\u2018\u2018That might help people sleep better at night,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u2018\u2018but we are creating a very small number of high-paying jobs in return for destroying a very large number of fairly high-paying jobs, and the net-net to society, absent some sort of policy intervention or new industry that no one\u2019s thought of yet to employ all those people, is a net loss.\u2019\u2019"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/opinion/livin-bernie-sanderss-danish-dream.html": ["American capitalism has always been distinct from continental European capitalism. We\u2019ve had more entrepreneurial creativity but less security. Our system has favored higher living standards for consumers while theirs has favored stability for employees and producers.", "For the past several decades, the United States has had a bipartisan consensus that we should stick to our style of capitalism and our style of welfare state. There has always been a broad consensus that a continent-size nation like ours had to be diverse and decentralized, with a vibrant charitable sector and a great variety of spending patterns and lifestyles.", "American values have always been biased toward individualism, achievement and flexibility \u2014 nurturing disruptive dynamos like Bell Labs, Walmart, Whole Foods, Google and Apple \u2014 and less toward dirigisme, order and economic equality.", "It\u2019s amazing that a large part of the millennial generation has rejected this consensus. In supporting Bernie Sanders they are not just supporting a guy who is mad at Wall Street. They are supporting a guy who fundamentally wants to reshape the American economic system, and thus reshape American culture and values. As he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, he wants to make us more like northern Europe.", "According to The Wall Street Journal, Sanders would add $18 trillion to the federal budget over the next 10 years. Currently, total government spending is about 36 percent of G.D.P. Under Sanders it would rise to about 47.5 percent of G.D.P., putting us comfortably in the European range.", "First, Sanders would centralize power in Washington. If you radically increase the amount of money going to the Washington establishment, as Sanders would, you\u2019re giving that establishment greater resources to control American life.", "Second, Sanders would weaken the ability of members of the middle class to make choices about their own lives. He would raise taxes on the rich, but there is only so much money you can squeeze out of such a small group of people. European welfare states generally rely on a highly regressive value-added/sales tax \u2014 usually around 20 to 25 percent.", "Middle classes across Europe bear a much higher tax load than the American middle class. As Austan Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to President Obama, has noted, you really can\u2019t have a Swedish-style welfare state without a broad high tax burden. That means less spending power for most Americans, and fewer resources to choose one\u2019s own lifestyle.", "Third, Sanders would change the incentive structure for the country\u2019s most successful people. He proposes raising the top tax rate to 52 percent. As Josh Barro noted in The Times, when you add in state, local and other taxes, top earners would be paying a combined tax rate over 73 percent. In high-tax locales like New York City and California, it would be even more.", "It\u2019s possible that entrepreneurs, company founders and others would pay these rates without changing their behavior, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it. When you make risk-taking less rewarding, you get fewer risk-takers, which is exactly what you see across the Atlantic. When you raise taxes that high, the Elon Musks of the world find other places to build their companies.", "Fourth, Sanders would Europeanize American public universities. It sounds great to make college free. In fact, it\u2019s a hugely expensive program that would mostly benefit the already affluent.", "It would create, as in Germany, a legion of eternal students who have little incentive to leave school because the costs are so low. It would give Washington officials greater control over state universities, determining what sort of faculty they could hire and what sort of programs they could run. It would threaten hundreds of private colleges, which could no longer compete against the completely subsidized state system. It would reduce the pressures universities now feel to reform themselves because it would cushion them with federal largess. Slowly, American universities would look more like their European counterparts. They\u2019d be less good.", "The changes in the health care system would be along the same lines. Sanders would create a centralized and streamlined system. His approach would also, as in Europe, reduce the rate of medical progress, increase the rationing of care, increase the wait times for patients, induce many doctors to retire and centralize decision-making. He might reduce health care costs by $6 trillion over the next decade, but his proposal to do this gives new meaning to the word vagueness.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with living in northern Europe. I\u2019ve lived there myself. It\u2019s just not the homeland we\u2019ve always known. Bernie Sanders\u2019s America is starkly different from Alexander Hamilton\u2019s or Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s America or even Bill Clinton\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s America.", "It\u2019s amazing that so many young people want to mimic a continent that has been sluggish for decades.

Overhead, a screen announced the imminent arrival of the thrash-metal band Anthrax.", "By any measure, it was an odd cross section of pop culture. Surveying the scene, Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM\u2019s chief content officer, smiled and declared, \u201cThis is how I like it \u2014 just this diverse.\u201d", "At SiriusXM, the satellite-radio network, executives use terms like \u201cmosaic,\u201d \u201cbundle\u201d and, inevitably, \u201ccurated\u201d to describe the company\u2019s mix of programming. With more than 175 channels, SiriusXM has much more variety than typical AM/FM radio but a small fraction of the ads. It has channels dedicated to the Grateful Dead and the Metropolitan Opera; five feeds of thumping electronic dance music; every pro baseball, football and basketball game; and, of course, Mr. Stern\u2019s blend of raunchy humor and celebrity interviews. Around the Super Bowl, it had 162 hours of live programming related to the game that ran across 22 shows on 10 channels.", "Once flirting with bankruptcy, SiriusXM has quietly become a financial powerhouse at a time when other radio and digital music outlets are struggling to make a profit, and also as the behavior of so-called cord cutters \u2014 who cancel their cable TV subscriptions to pick and choose their entertainment online (and to save money) \u2014 has made Wall Street nervous about the future of bundled media. SiriusXM last year earned $510 million on $4.6 billion in revenue, and renewed major deals with Mr. Stern and the National Football League.", "\u201cThis has been a remarkable success story against huge odds,\u201d said Barton Crockett, a media analyst with FBR Capital Markets. \u201cMost of the investing public thought there was no way this would work, spending huge amounts of capital to launch satellites and put equipment in cars. But they were right. This is a great business.\u201d", "SiriusXM has hit on the formula for getting people \u2014 nearly 30 million of them \u2014 to pay for radio, a form of media that has always been free. But while the company likes to emphasize the awesomeness of its audio \u201cmosaics,\u201d there is another, more mundane, explanation for its success: cars.", "SiriusXM pays about $1 billion a year in subsidies and revenue splits to automakers, and according to the company, 75 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States come with satellite radio installed. (It works with every major carmaker.) Of the 29.6 million subscribers to SiriusXM at the end of last year, 24.2 million paid the $11 to $20 monthly fee themselves, with the rest covered through promotions by car companies.", "\u201cIf I ask myself two questions every day,\u201d James E. Meyer, SiriusXM\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview, \u201cthe first one is, \u2018What do I got to do to make sure people pay us $15?\u2019 The second one: \u2018What do I need to do to make sure that my position with the auto companies remains strong?\u2019\u201d", "Yet cars are changing in ways that could threaten SiriusXM\u2019s position. New technologies, loosely referred to as the connected car, are bringing the Internet to the dashboard. For drivers, that means that various new audio apps \u2014 many of them free \u2014 will soon be available at a touch. For SiriusXM, that means a lot of new competition in the car, the place where consumers listen to radio the most. This process has already begun, with Apple and Google pushing for their own car media platforms, and Mr. Meyer said that he expected the technology to be in most new cars by the end of this decade. Will listeners still fork over $15 for SiriusXM if they can just as easily tune in to Spotify, Pandora or Beats 1 from Apple?", "\u201cThe major enemy of SiriusXM these days is Internet radio,\u201d said Jack Nerad, executive editorial director of Kelley Blue Book. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Sirius to be in automobiles, but I think that for the car companies, it\u2019s going to be just another programming source.\u201d", "Mr. Meyer, who spent years managing the company\u2019s relationships with Detroit before he became chief executive in 2012, has been hearing this refrain for a long time. But he said that SiriusXM was well positioned for the change, with plans for a new, more interactive version of its radio system, code-named SXM17, and the advantage of knowing that car companies make changes to their machines very slowly. \u201cEven when you\u2019re Apple,\u201d Mr. Meyer said, \u201cthey will still live with the speed carmakers want to go.\u201d", "Phil Abram, the chief infotainment officer of General Motors, said that Pandora, as well as platforms like Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto, have had no significant effect on how many of its customers subscribe to SiriusXM.", "\u201cPeople like to have a plethora of content,\u201d Mr. Abram said. \u201cOne day you might want to listen to music on your iPhone, the next day talk radio, and the next day you want a curated set of music from a company like SiriusXM. We want to try to make it as easy as possible for our customers to enjoy whichever they want.\u201d", "Satellite radio\u2019s fortunes have not always been so rosy. After years of planning and investment in the 1990s, the new medium began broadcasting in the early 2000s from two companies, Sirius and XM. For years both lost money as they competed to build their programming slates and sign multimillion-dollar deals with celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Martha Stewart.", "The biggest catch, by far, was Mr. Stern, who signed a five-year, $500 million deal with Sirius to begin broadcasting at the start of 2006. His arrival instantly put satellite radio on the map. Sirius and XM merged in 2008 \u2014 during the recession, when car sales were plummeting. After nearly going bankrupt under the weight of its debt, the combined SiriusXM was saved by a last-minute infusion of capital from Liberty Media, the cable and entertainment empire controlled by John C. Malone, which in early 2009 lent $530 million in exchange for preferred shares convertible into 40 percent of the common stock of the company.", "Gregory B. Maffei, Liberty\u2019s chief executive and the chairman of SiriusXM, recalled that at the time of the deal, a colleague told him, \u201cEither the world ends, or we\u2019re going to make a lot of money.\u201d They made a lot of money. SiriusXM repaid the loans in five months, and the roughly 62 percent stake that Liberty now has in the company \u2014 which is formally known as Sirius XM Holdings \u2014 is worth about $11 billion.", "SiriusXM\u2019s strategy for competing with free radio has been to give people a lot of the radio they like \u2014 music, sports, talk, news \u2014 and minimize what they do not, namely commercials. That means the station\u2019s programmers do not feel the ratings pressures that bedevil terrestrial radio.", "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have ratings,\u201d Mr. Greenstein said, \u201cyou can be very open-minded about your belief in what might be a hit.\u201d", "That has freed the network to indulge a deep degree of niche programming, much of it seemingly reflecting an older male demographic, with channels devoted to Billy Joel, Elvis Presley, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen. But the network also aggressively goes after young ears, with dance, alternative and pop stations, and relishes its role as the early champion of hot new acts that later go big, like Halsey, Elle King and Chris Stapleton, who just won two Grammys. (Not that things between SiriusXM and the music industry are completely peachy: In 2015 the company also agreed to pay $210 million to settle a lawsuit over royalties for recordings made before 1972, an obscure copyright issue that became a rallying point for older artists.)", "Another success story is \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good,\u201d an ode to monogamy by the clean-cut singer Andy Grammer that came out in late 2014. Steve Greenberg, the president of Mr. Grammer\u2019s label, S-Curve, believed the song had hit potential but was too quirky for terrestrial radio. So he pitched it to Kid Kelly, a SiriusXM programmer, who put the song into heavy rotation on Hits 1, the network\u2019s pop station.", "The song caught on and was soon selling 30,000 copies a week, almost entirely because of SiriusXM\u2019s exposure. But in the music business nothing happens in a vacuum, and after a few months, AM/FM stations began playing it, too. The song eventually sold about 2.5 million copies, making it one of the biggest hits of 2015.", "The success of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good\u201d underscores a fact that is often forgotten in the age of Spotify and YouTube: Radio remains popular and influential \u2014 according to Nielsen, 93 percent of adults tune in at least once a week \u2014 and music executives say that blanketing stations everywhere is still the most effective way to secure a hit.", "\u201cThere is absolutely no chance in the world that this record could have launched without the backing of Hits 1,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good.\u201d \u201cAnd there is no way it could have gone Top 10 without the backing of terrestrial radio.\u201d", "If the connected car is a challenge looming in SiriusXM\u2019s future, the biggest threat in its recent past was the potential loss of Mr. Stern, perhaps the network\u2019s only indispensable star \u2014 \u201cthe heart and soul of SiriusXM,\u201d as Mr. Greenstein put it.", "Mr. Stern\u2019s contract was expiring at the end of last year, and speculation began to spread that he might abandon satellite radio for yet another media frontier. Don Buchwald, Mr. Stern\u2019s agent for more than 30 years, said that he met with dozens of companies, all promising to be an exciting new home for the show.

Longtime fans have heard this one before, but Mr. Buchwald said it was genuine.", "\u201cPeople think it\u2019s a negotiating ploy, but I can tell you there is reality to it,\u201d said Mr. Buchwald, whose Manhattan office contains decades\u2019 worth of Howard Stern memorabilia, including an enormous cardboard theater stand for the 1997 movie \u201cPrivate Parts,\u201d released not long after Mr. Stern started calling himself \u201cking of all media.\u201d", "\u201cHe loved when he did the movie, he loved when he published the books, he loved the TV shows,\u201d Mr. Buchwald continued, \u201cand he\u2019s thinking, \u2018Why am I getting up at four o\u2019clock in the morning and doing the same drivel?\u2019\u201d", "Adding to the uncertainty about the negotiations was the fact that Mr. Buchwald was unfamiliar with Mr. Meyer, who commutes to New York each week from Indianapolis and has spent his entire career in operations \u2014 \u201cAll I ever wanted to be was a plant manager,\u201d he said \u2014 far away from the world of show business. (He took over from Mel Karmazin, who had a decades-long relationship with Mr. Stern but left SiriusXM in 2012 after battling publicly with Liberty over its plans to take over majority control.)", "But Mr. Buchwald said that he and Mr. Stern were charmed by Mr. Meyer\u2019s earnestness, and by SiriusXM\u2019s willingness to experiment with new technology. The deal they agreed to at the end of 2015 would keep Mr. Stern doing his radio show for five more years, and also lock in 12 years of access to Mr. Stern\u2019s audio and video archives, along with new video plans that are still under development.", "Neither SiriusXM nor Mr. Buchwald would comment on the specific terms of the deal, but analysts say it could be worth $90 million a year, including salaries and production expenses for Mr. Stern\u2019s team.", "Mr. Meyer, whose New York office is mostly bare except for some landscape photos and jerseys of Indianapolis sports teams, was obviously pleased to have renewed Mr. Stern\u2019s contract, which both he and Mr. Buchwald called a particularly complex deal to negotiate.", "But Mr. Meyer was also proud of the broader programming surrounding Mr. Stern.

This represents an existential threat to the $50 billion online advertising industry and has ignited a bitter feud between advertisers and developers of ad-blocking apps. On the sidelines, privacy advocates are pumping their fists for consumer choice while web publishers wring their hands over lost revenue.", "The fight became public last month when Randall Rothenberg, the president and chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, lobbed several verbal grenades at developers of ad blockers during his keynote address to his group\u2019s annual leadership meeting.

Carriers like AT&T, telecommunications manufacturers like Nokia and tech giants like Google are all battling to define global standards that will be needed before this technology becomes mainstream. These negotiations are expected to persist until at least 2019, so 5G cellphone networks will not become widespread in the United States or elsewhere until well into the next decade \u2014 despite recent claims by AT&T to roll out part of its 5G network by 2021.", "That isn\u2019t stopping operators like Verizon Wireless and telecom equipment makers like Ericsson from pushing ahead with 5G trials.", "A takeaway from these demo projects may be how companies are increasingly focused on three main areas that they think will underpin 5G networks whenever global standards are completed. Here\u2019s a primer on what those areas are and what 5G could mean for you.", "Most mobile networks are already pretty fast, often reaching download speeds of more than 15 megabits per second. That lets smartphone users stream songs from Spotify, watch videos on YouTube or quickly check Facebook messages. Under plans for 5G, carriers will most likely offer mobile Internet speeds of more than 10 gigabits per second, or roughly 100 times faster than current networks (and significantly quicker than existing broadband).

Carriers and telecom equipment makers will have to install new hardware like cellphone towers in rural areas and tiny mobile hot spots in dense urban areas to reach the 10 gigabits per second target. They will also have to increasingly rely on sophisticated software to manage the expected exponential jump in mobile data traffic. So just as most people\u2019s cellphone bills have risen as they watch more videos and access other entertainment on their mobile devices, expect operators to charge a hefty premium for these new ultrafast services.", "5G is not just about speed. Companies are also preparing for millions of new wireless devices \u2014 such as smartwatches and other wearable items, as well as sensors embedded in industrial products \u2014 to be connected to the next generation of cellphone networks.", "These devices will not use a lot of data (a sensor built into a highway, for instance, will need to send only small amounts of digital information across the network every couple of hours). But when combined, these hundreds of millions \u2014 potentially billions \u2014 of new sensors will require almost universal connectivity, or the ability to go online no matter where they are, forcing operators to extend their networks to practically every corner of a country.", "These devices will potentially be an important new revenue stream for carriers worldwide. Many operators, particularly in Europe, are finding it tough to charge customers more for their increased use of mobile data. But if carriers can persuade businesses in industries like health care as well as industrial conglomerates like General Electric to sign up for new mobile Internet services that connect tiny sensors to the Internet, then operators may have stumbled onto a new way of making money.", "If 5G can offer ultrafast mobile Internet speeds, then why should you care about how quickly one device can communicate with another? In short, you shouldn\u2019t. And as current mobile networks offer so-called latency, or digital response times, of around 50 to 80 milliseconds (the time it takes for a web page to load on your smartphone), reducing that speed to a mere millisecond \u2014 the goal under most companies\u2019 5G plans \u2014 might not add much to users\u2019 mobile experiences.", "Yet that extremely fast response time will be essential for many of the new services that will most likely be offered on 5G networks.

Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has proposed raising the age of the state\u2019s Family Court jurisdiction to 18 from 16. If that legislation fails again this year, it will leave New York and North Carolina as the only states where people age 16 and older can be tried as an adult and, if incarcerated, locked up in adult prisons and jails. (In New York, children as young as 13 must be tried in adult court for certain charges, like murder.)", "Not only are these states trailing most of the country in this area, but they are also in danger of falling even further behind. Connecticut and Illinois \u2014 both of which recently raised the age of juvenile court jurisdiction to 18 (in 2012 and 2014, respectively) \u2014 are now considering raising the age to 21. In the 116-year history of the juvenile court, no United States system has ever gone above age 18, so two states considering it simultaneously is remarkable.", "Why are they doing this?", "Lawmakers are confronting questions over the effects and safety of the two systems. Would crime increase if more people were treated in juvenile court, where sentences are lighter? And, more parochially, would the courts and the juvenile facilities be overwhelmed? The answers from Illinois and Connecticut proved surprising.", "Early in the 20th century, most states established juvenile courts, virtually every one restricting the new court\u2019s age to youths under 16. A separate juvenile-justice system, which sought to rehabilitate and not just punish youthful offenders, was part of a movement by progressives to create a legally defined adolescence through the passage of child-labor and compulsory education laws and the creation of parks and open spaces. During the decades that followed, an overwhelming majority of states increased the court\u2019s jurisdictional age, arguing that 16 was too young a demarcation point.", "There has been a renewed effort recently to raise the age of family-court jurisdiction even further. In addition to the horrors of putting teenagers in adult prisons (where they are more prone to suicide, more likely to be sexually assaulted and less likely to succeed once they leave), a wave of new research has shown that young people are developmentally different from adults in impulsivity, future orientation, susceptibility to peer pressure and risk-taking, especially if they had suffered a traumatic brain injury, which kids in the juvenile justice system disproportionately do.", "Initially, these campaigns were considered liberal, but now they\u2019re increasingly bipartisan. When Connecticut raised its family court\u2019s age limit, research found that 16-year-olds tried in family court were being rearrested at a rate almost 39 percent lower than youths their same age who had been previously tried as adults.", "Connecticut now has its lowest number of juveniles in pretrial detention, its lowest population in juvenile correctional institutions, and the lowest number of young adult prisoners ages 18 to 21 in its adult prisons in a quarter-century \u2014 down 51 percent over the last six years.", "Illinois has enjoyed similar successes. The Illinois Juvenile Justice Commission concluded that its reforms enhanced public safety because adult convictions put youths at greater risk of re-offense by inhibiting education and employability. The commission also found that the juvenile justice system had gotten smaller now than it was before it included 17-year-olds. The population of Illinois\u2019 juvenile institutions has declined by 43 percent since the reforms began.", "Both systems built on the traditional strengths of the juvenile system, such as individualized sentences, programs to keep youths from being detained or incarcerated, and greater access to rehabilitation and counseling.", "There is another compelling reason both to raise the age of juvenile court jurisdiction and to rethink how readily we try juveniles as adults: the protection of the innocent. In early January, five boys, ages 14 through 18, were arrested in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and quickly charged with the rape of a girl on a playground, an incident that understandably caused outrage throughout the city. After more investigation, however, the prosecutor concluded that no sexual assault had taken place, and on Wednesday he dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning that charges cannot be reinstated.", "But because the boys were charged as adults, their names were made public. This incident will be the first item that appears when future employers, classmates and schools do a Google search. A family court hearing, where names of the accused are rarely released, would have at least prevented their reputations from being smeared forever.", "In the face of growing evidence about the benefits of juvenile courts, research into the neurological and psychological development of teenagers and the move by other jurisdictions to raise the juvenile court age, New York and North Carolina persist in trying and convicting 16-year-olds as adults.

The Graham educator Oliver Tobin, who curates the collection, drew our attention to a few of those: a video of Helen Keller visiting the Graham studio; an image of Martha Graham with members of Denishawn, the company and school where she trained.", "For dance history teachers and students, the digital collection, though clearly a work in progress, should prove invaluable. While many items may be familiar to Graham aficionados, others will be entirely new. Thursday\u2019s program offered a sneak peek at recently discovered images from a 1937 Graham concert, which will join the online collection on April 18, the company\u2019s 90th birthday.", "And what of the live solos? Ms. Chien-Pott and Ms. White-McGuire gave brazen, glamorous performances \u2014 the norm for them. Yet having seen those works before, I learned more about Graham, and felt a stronger connection between present and past, browsing photos on my phone after the show."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/upshot/john-kasich-republican-nomination.html": ["The Republican establishment has a problem. It is headed for a car crash.", "With Jeb Bush out of the Republican presidential race, the two remaining mainstream candidates \u2014 Marco Rubio and John Kasich \u2014 are living out an issue studied for decades in game theory. Game theorists might call the G.O.P. predicament an anti-coordination game or even a volunteer\u2019s dilemma. But most of us might call it by a more familiar name: chicken.", "Although Mr. Rubio is the obvious establishment favorite, leading Mr. Kasich in national polls, prediction markets and delegate math, the two are splitting some votes. To have his best chance against Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Mr. Rubio needs Mr. Kasich to drop out. The longer both candidates remain in the race, the worse it is for both of them. It\u2019s safe to assume neither would like to see Mr. Trump get the nomination.", "In \u201cAn Essay on Bargaining,\u201d a classic paper from 1956, Thomas Schelling lays out several strategies that may be useful for both Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio. Here, we focus on three: commitment, promises and threats. As Richard Thaler, the behavioral economist at the University of Chicago, explained, the strategies can be applied to anything: health care, nuclear deterrence, the last piece of pizza.", "Mr. Kasich\u2019s first option, of course, is to stay in the race. But he could go further, by committing to stay in no matter what. In a classic game of chicken between two drivers rushing headlong toward each other, this strategy is like removing your steering wheel, leaving you no choice but to drive straight toward your opponent.", "Mr. Kasich could defend this choice by pointing to his obstacle-strewn but possible path to the nomination. He might point out that only a tiny fraction of Republican delegates have been allocated; he might note that he could pick up many of Mr. Bush\u2019s voters; he could hope for another robotic debate performance from Mr. Rubio or even an implosion from the Trump or Cruz campaigns.", "This series of events is unlikely, of course. It doesn\u2019t matter how long Mr. Kasich actually intends to stay in the race. All that matters is whether Mr. Rubio believes he will do so. (If you\u2019re going to remove your steering wheel, make sure the other driver sees you do it!) The more believable the commitment, the stronger his negotiating position for the far more effective strategy in brinkmanship games: cutting a deal.", "Side deals, bargains or promises are the way negotiations actually get done. In a 1984 paper on the private supply of a public good, the economists Christopher Bliss and Barry Nalebuff wrote that \u201cbinding agreements combined with side payments can always produce a superior outcome\u201d to brinkmanship.", "Some deals are obvious; the best such deal would be a spot on the presidential ticket, which Mr. Rubio could offer Mr. Kasich in exchange for dropping out \u2014 provided he becomes the nominee, of course. (A simple Google search of \u201cRubio Kasich side deals\u201d produces no shortage of opinions on the matter.)", "There are other potential promises. It might take the form of a concession on another matter \u2014 Mr. Rubio could promise to adopt or address some of Mr. Kasich\u2019s issues, which would allow Mr. Kasich to end his campaign and claim a small victory. In the book \u201cPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d William Poundstone suggests that the best solution to a game of chicken is one that allows the losing party to give in while still \u201csaving face.\u201d He noted its role in bringing a peaceful end to the Cuban missile crisis.", "Regardless of the details, the quality of the deal depends on how much a Kasich exit matters to Mr. Rubio. The more crucial his exit, the stronger any promise is sure to be.", "There is a third strategy available to Mr. Kasich, which takes the form of threats. Here, Mr. Kasich might insist on a promise or concession from Mr. Rubio; if he doesn\u2019t get it, he could threaten to support a different candidate, like Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz. That move wouldn\u2019t serve shared establishment interests, but if the threat had the potential to damage Mr. Rubio enough, it could be a useful bargaining chip. \u201cBeing crazy is a strategy, but only if your opponent actually believes it,\u201d Mr. Thaler said. Of the three strategies described here, this seems least likely.", "Two external factors complicate this matter further.", "Part of the reason this dilemma exists in the first place is that mainstream Republicans lack the unity or influence to compel any cooperation. After the New Hampshire primary, one Republican likened the battle among mainstream candidates to a hockey fight: \u201cThe gloves are off and the refs can\u2019t get in the middle of it.\u201d That\u2019s exactly right.", "If establishment Republicans had a clear, unimpeachable leader who was not a participant in the race, that person might be able to compel a candidate to drop out and support whomever the party determined to be strongest, allowing candidates who quit to save face by saying they did it for \u201cthe good of the party.\u201d At the moment, no such leader exists for mainstream Republicans, resulting in a tragedy of the commons-like failure of collective action.", "Second, this is a game that\u2019s played just once. The chance to be your party\u2019s nominee for president comes along only every four or eight years, even for the very luckiest candidates. If the candidates lived in a universe in which they could run for president hundreds of times, they might agree that, on average, their shared interests were better served by cooperating. Once in a while, Mr. Kasich might try to win the contest outright against long odds, but, on average, he would probably agree that cooperating, including alternating victories, was the best way to serve his and Mr. Rubio\u2019s shared interests. Game theory shows that in iterated dilemmas, played many hundreds or thousands of times, cooperation is a very stable strategy \u2014 one reason it is so common in nature.", "But this is not an iterated dilemma. It\u2019s a one-time-only dilemma with a tremendous payoff for the winner. As much as Mr. Kasich might think about his legacy, the good of the party or even his own chances in 2020 or 2024, the future is very far away.", "Ultimately, they risk an outcome neither he nor Mr. Rubio wants. As Daniel Diermeier, the dean of the public policy school at the University of Chicago, notes, \u201cA very important lesson of game theory is that sometimes the world is a grim place.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/fashion/public-school-dao-yi-chow-celebrates-chinese-new-year.html": ["Monkey masks are an unusual New York Fashion Week accessory.

Two years ago, the company raised a round of financing that valued it at $10 billion, making it one of the most highly prized start-ups of the tech boom. Now it faces a stock market that has turned unfriendly to initial public offerings of tech companies, not to mention stiff competition from publicly traded companies like Microsoft, Google and Box, the similarly named firm in a similar line of business.", "As a result, Dropbox\u2019s valuation has been battered by a series of \u201cmarkdowns\u201d from large investors who appear to have turned skeptical about its future.

Dropbox\u2019s problems have less to do with the strength of its current business than with a delay, so far, in realizing the towering expectations that once surrounded the company. The start-up is like the college basketball star who manages to turn pro but is still regarded with doubt because everyone has now realized he might never be the next LeBron James. What happens to a company once thought to be worth $10 billion when it turns out to be worth only $5 billion, or $2 billion?", "According to Dropbox\u2019s executives, nothing too terrible \u2014 it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron.", "\u201cSentiment about companies goes in cycles,\u201d Drew Houston, Dropbox\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, told me in an email. \u201cGoogle, Apple, Facebook all went through multiple rounds of this. First, you can do no wrong, then you can do no right. Then people are like, \u2018Actually this is a pretty good company,\u2019 and around it goes. So you have to ignore the noise and stay focused on building great products and making customers happy.

Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market \u2014 the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online.", "Adding to this is the complication that Box, which has had to spend hundreds of millions of dollars building out a sales team to go after large companies, has been pummeled by investors for its persistent losses. The stock market now values Box at about $1.3 billion, about half of its value when it went public in January 2015.", "This sets up an unfavorable comparison for Dropbox: If Dropbox trails Box in the meatiest part of the market, and if Box is itself losing money, how can Dropbox possibly be worth 10 times as much as Box?", "Dropbox argues that the comparison with Box doesn\u2019t take into account the differences in the two companies\u2019 business models. Sure, Dropbox is developing its sales team and expanding its product offerings for businesses. But Dennis Woodside, Dropbox\u2019s chief operating officer, said that its broad brand recognition makes the sales process more efficient \u2014 and thus cheaper \u2014 than Box\u2019s.

A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr. Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox,\u201d he said.", "Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox \u2014 not to mention Google or Microsoft \u2014 will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business. Analysts say that at the moment, the market is big enough, and wide open enough, for all of these companies to thrive.", "The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as.

Price depends on a variety of factors, including the route; the level of competition on the route; surrounding holidays and events (like a convention or the Super Bowl); and the days of the week you plan to fly. During a single week in March, for example, a recent search for a round-trip flight between New York and Miami turned up ticket prices as low as $174 and as high as $314. Besides, nowadays we have fare calendars at our fingertips and websites such as Kayak and Travelzoo that alert us to low fares and sales \u2014 and those sales don\u2019t always take place on the same day of the week.", "Mr. Hobica pointed out, for instance, that on a recent Thursday, Virgin Atlantic lowered nonstop winter flights to Heathrow Airport in London from John F.

Economy fares had been running $900, Mr. Hobica said, then $800, then they went back up, and after that they dipped to around $680.", "Airlines (and the above example is but one of many) are perpetually tweaking prices, making predictions difficult. Expedia said as much in its report. Even though its latest research asserts that weekends have the best fares, consumers who spot a good deal on Thursday shouldn\u2019t wait until Saturday to buy it with the hope that the price will tumble even further. \u201cIf you find a fare that looks like a good deal, grab it,\u201d the report said, \u201cregardless of the day of week.\u201d", "In addition to recommending the best times of the week to book, Expedia and other sites such as FareCompare publish suggestions about how far in advance of a trip to book to score the lowest fare.

Recommended lead times for travel to international destinations, including Europe and Asia-Pacific, were even longer.", "Travelers shouldn\u2019t think of predictions as rules, though. There are flights to Asia, for example, that are $500 cheaper when booked at the last minute as opposed to months in advance, Mr. Hobica said.", "And talking about the \u201caverage fare\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily helpful because that doesn\u2019t take into account the quality of a flight.

Is it an 18-hour layover in Dallas that will require you to spend an additional $300 in hotel bills and meals? Are you flying in an aisle seat in a Dreamliner or in the middle seat in a MD-80? And if that cheap ticket you found is on a discount airline like Spirit or Frontier, chances are you\u2019ll have to budget another $30 to $100 to check a bag.

Our discussion will be moderated by Brilliant\u2019s Zandra Vinegar.", "But before we begin \u2014 what did this computer program (called AlphaGo) actually accomplish, and what is the significance of this breakthrough? For perspectives on this I reached out to several people familiar with artificial intelligence and its quest to conquer Go: Rodrigo Alvarez, who helped design a breakthrough cognitive computing chip as part of IBM\u2019s TrueNorth. (In case you missed it, \u201cIBM Develops a New Chip That Functions Like a Brain.\u201d) Bob Hearn, who studied AI at MIT and is a 2-dan Go player and longtime follower \u2014 and organizer \u2014 of human vs. machine Go contests. And Alan Levinovitz, who wrote \u201cThe Mystery of Go, the Ancient Game That Computers Still Can\u2019t Win,\u201d which appeared in Wired magazine in 2014.", "Gary Antonick: Machine learning has recently enabled computers to recognize faces and understand spoken language. Why is the ability to win Go such big news?", "Alan Levinovitz: Contests, especially contests modeled on war, feel like objective, decisive assessments of ability. Chess and Go have long enjoyed pride of place as contests that decide which human has a more powerful mind \u2014 pure skill, no luck. When computers beat us, it seems as if the quest to make a humanlike mind must be close to over.", "Bob Hearn: Go was the last bastion of human superiority at what\u2019s historically been viewed as quintessentially intellectual. This is it. We\u2019re out of games now. This is seen by some as a harbinger of the approaching singularity.", "Alan: But of course these games are far from being measures of who is the most human human (whatever that means). Single-player, deterministic perfect information games like chess and Go are actually well-suited to computers \u2014 there\u2019s not much psychology (like poker), no teamwork (like bridge). And rule-bound games are themselves better arenas for computers than the un-rule-governed games of life like figuring out whether someone is speaking in earnest, or really loves you, whether they\u2019re looking off into the distance or avoiding your gaze. There\u2019s no doubt that, a few singularity-worshipping cheerleaders aside, we are very, very far from creating anything that resembles a human mind.", "", "Bob: The other factor at play here is the space race to conquer Go, due to the history and symbolism of the task, with Google and Facebook at the forefront. This is huge PR for Google. They have somewhat jumped the gun saying they have \u201cmastered\u201d Go, just to make sure Facebook doesn\u2019t do the same thing to them first. It\u2019s worth remembering that Deep Blue started beating chess grandmasters eight years before it was able to beat Kasparov. In principle the same thing could happen here, though I very much doubt it would take another eight years. Maybe two or three at the outside.", "Gary: How does AI work for games like chess, and what was the innovation behind AlphaGo?", "Rodrigo Alvarez: The way AI works for chess and similar board games is called tree search. It creates a tree of potential paths that the game could evolve into, and then selects the best candidate move looking as far ahead as possible. The best chess playing games could quickly search up to about 14 moves ahead, and at this point they start beating grand masters. The problem is that for chess the tree grows very quickly, and for Go it goes even quicker because there are less constrains on each move and the board is larger.", "Bob: My prediction during this era was that to get a human pro-level Go program, you would first have to \u201csolve\u201d AI.", "But about 10 years ago, everything changed. Go software started incorporating Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The idea here is to play out hundreds of thousands of random games from the current position all the way to the end, and accumulate statistics on wins and losses. It sounds crazy, but if you put the statistics together the right way, this actually works.", "I was at the first match where a computer beat a pro, in 2008. It was a 9-stone handicap game, against an 8-dan pro (much stronger than Fan Hui). Nine stones is typically the largest handicap given between human players. Still, this was seen as a shocking, amazing development. And honestly, the leap from the pre-MCTS Go programs to MCTS was greater than from MCTS to AlphaGo.", "That began the modern era of computer Go. (I guess with deep learning we are now in postmodern era?) As the MCTS was refined beyond the basic algorithm, and specialized for Go, and as computers got faster, the programs continued to improve.", "Here\u2019s an example of the coverage following a match I arranged at the 2009 AAAS meeting. Note that the headlines don\u2019t sound that different from today\u2019s: \u201cHumans No Match for Go Bot Overlords,\u201d \u201cComputers conquer the final frontier in board games.\u201d", "Since then computer Go has been kind of waiting for the next big breakthrough \u2014 and deep learning is it.", "Gary: What was the big insight behind AlphaGo?", "Bob: What they did was apply deep learning separately to the two problems with tree search: the branching factor, and the position evaluator. MCTS had already solved position evaluation, but the insight here was to not play games out to the end, but cut them off at 20 moves or so, then use a deep-learning based evaluator (the \u201cvalue network\u201d in the AlphaGo paper). So they don\u2019t have to play out as many games as traditional MCTS. To address the branching factor, they have an independent deep-learning network suggesting the best moves to search from each position (the \u201cpolicy network\u201d).", "Both deep-learning networks seem to capture some subtle aspects of Go knowledge and understanding that MCTS can\u2019t. They work more like brains do. But not exactly like brains do \u2014 human Go knowledge is more than just a learned ability to see the best moves, and see at a glance who is ahead or behind. It\u2019s also a learned ability of how to use this knowledge to explore alternatives and pick the best move, and there is a complex interplay there between perception and planning that does not exist yet in deep-learning systems. That\u2019s where the raw computing power of MCTS fills the gap. It\u2019s a very interesting question whether, as with the plain MCTS systems, there may still be essential aspects of the game that the best humans are able to conceptualize, and deep learning plus MCTS is not.", "In recent months alone I\u2019ve been shocked at the progress of deep learning in many areas. If I were not an idiot I would now be spending all my time catching up in this field, because it\u2019s going to be huge. AlphaGo is just the beginning. In another year or two, things we can\u2019t even imagine will change enormously due to deep learning.", "Gary: This recent news was about AlphaGo beating the European champion, Fan Hui. In March, AlphaGo will be facing the world\u2019s top player, Lee Sedol. Will AlphaGo win?", "Bob: There are at least hundreds of stronger players than Fan Hui, and the gap between him and Lee Sedol is actually enormous. But Google has a lot at stake in this match, and you\u2019d better believe they\u2019ll throw everything they have at Lee Sedol.", "Alan: It\u2019s hard to imagine DeepMind challenging Sedol to a March match unless they were very, very confident in AlphaGo\u2019s abilities. Nevertheless, my money is on Sedol, in part because there are very few people who can genuinely understand what distinguishes someone like Sedol from Fan Hui, and whether AlphaGo is playing at that level. Without playing Sedol or another 9-dan player, I can\u2019t imagine how AlphaGo could be so confident.", "But I wouldn\u2019t bet too much!", "Bob: It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess what will happen in March. However, even if AlphaGo loses, it seems clear that the writing is on the wall, and it won\u2019t be long.", "Rodrigo Alvarez, Bob Hearn and Alan Levinovitz \u2014 thank you all very much.

If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.", "Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that\u2019s the way I define it, is you\u2019re going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.", "As far as the people that I\u2019ve hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It\u2019s the up season. People didn\u2019t want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn\u2019t get.", "Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn\u2019t get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.", "RUBIO: That \u2014 my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.", "And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.", "TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That\u2019s what I criticize Mitt Romney \u2014 I mean, ran...", "RUBIO: No, he...", "TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That\u2019s an election that should have been won.", "(APPLAUSE)", "RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term \u201cself-deportation.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s on the record and people can look it up right now online.", "But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it\u2019s really important, this point. I think it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.", "But I also think that if you\u2019re going to claim that you\u2019re the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you\u2019re only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.", "You hired some workers from Poland...", "TRUMP: No, no, I\u2019m the only one on the stage that\u2019s hired people. You haven\u2019t hired anybody.", "(APPLAUSE)", "RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: And by the way, I\u2019ve hired \u2014 and by the way, I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You\u2019ve hired nobody.", "RUBIO: Yes, you\u2019ve hired a thousand from another country...", "TRUMP: You\u2019ve had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don\u2019t tell me about that.", "RUBIO: Let me just say \u2014 let me finish the statement. This is important.", "TRUMP: You haven\u2019t hired one person, you liar.", "RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...", "TRUMP: That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s wrong. Totally wrong.", "RUBIO: That\u2019s a fact. People can look it up. I\u2019m sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. \u201cTrump Polish workers,\u201d you\u2019ll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects.

Tens of thousands...", "RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.", "TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.", "(APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: Let me talk. I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.", "RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.", "TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.", "BLITZER: Thank you.", "TRUMP: But I\u2019ve hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?", "CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That\u2019s existing law.", "But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the \u201cgang of eight\u201d amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d", "(LAUGHTER)", "CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the \u201cgang of eight,\u201d one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you\u2019re funding open border politicians, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they fight for open borders.", "And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Mr. Trump?", "TRUMP: I can only say this, and I\u2019ve said it loud and clear and I\u2019ve said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now \u2014 your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they\u2019re packed with you.", "I\u2019ve had an amazing relationship with politicians \u2014 with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he\u2019s a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.", "You get along with nobody. You don\u2019t have one Republican \u2014 you don\u2019t have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don\u2019t have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don\u2019t have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Senator Cruz?", "CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he\u2019s elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he\u2019s right. He has supported \u2014 he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn\u2019t be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let\u2019s actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn\u2019t like it.", "And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that\u2019s not a good attribute for a president.", "(APPLAUSE)", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: Here\u2019s a man \u2014 Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn\u2019t even put that he\u2019s borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didn\u2019t talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he\u2019s going to protect the people from the big bad banks.", "Give me a break.", "BLITZER: All right. We\u2019re going to move on to Governor Kasich.", "Governor Kasich...", "(CROSSTALK)", "CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?", "BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. He\u2019s been waiting patiently.", "Governor Kasich, the idea \u2014 you\u2019ve said this, and I want to quote you now: \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it.\u201d Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it\u2019s not feasible to stop them?", "KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem \u2014 a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.", "Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it\u2019s done, you don\u2019t have a right to come in. If you come in, we don\u2019t want any excuse. You\u2019re going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it\u2019s practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans \u2014 the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, I\u2019d make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I\u2019d give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to tear families apart. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to ride around in people\u2019s neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don\u2019t think \u2014 first of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical and I don\u2019t think it reflects America.", "You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn\u2019t get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, let\u2019s be practical. Let\u2019s start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Dr. Carson, you\u2019ve been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don\u2019t think Mr. Trump\u2019s plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I\u2019ve already described \u2014 you know, how we can secure the border.", "We need to secure all the borders, because it\u2019s not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.", "But in terms of the people who are here already, after we \u2014 after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.", "They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don\u2019t have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.", "If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that\u2019s the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.", "And we have other ways of \u2014 of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don\u2019t feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.", "BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.", "TRUMP: (inaudible).", "BLITZER: It\u2019s about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You\u2019ve said the Mexican government will pay for it.", "TRUMP: Correct.", "BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox \u2014 he said today, and I\u2019m quoting him \u2014 he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for that,\u201d quote, \u201ceffing wall.\u201d", "(LAUGHTER)", "So if you don\u2019t get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?", "TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.", "(APPLAUSE)", "It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that \u2014 I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.", "This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn\u2019t include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.", "We\u2019re going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it\u2019ll end up costing $200 billion.", "(APPLAUSE)", "But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 \u2014 you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago \u2014 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.", "We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it\u2019s a real wall. This is a wall that\u2019s a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you\u2019re looking at. This is a wall that\u2019s going to work.", "Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors.

If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he\u2019ll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second...", "(APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.", "RUBIO: But it \u2014 no, it\u2019s not a sound bite. It\u2019s a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. You\u2019ll see it.", "The second thing, about the trade war \u2014 I don\u2019t understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you\u2019re gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.", "TRUMP: All right, you know what?", "RUBIO: Why don\u2019t you make them in America?", "TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency \u2014 they devalue their currencies...", "RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.", "TRUMP: ... that makes it \u2014 well, you don\u2019t know a thing about business. You lose on everything...", "RUBIO: Well, make them in America. TRUMP: Let me just tell you \u2014 they de-value their currency.

Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?", "CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama\u2019s executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.", "RUBIO: Correct.", "ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I\u2019m going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to cancel it immediately.", "So Senator Rubio, what changed?", "RUBIO: It didn\u2019t change.", "ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?", "RUBIO: No, it\u2019s the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will \u2014 we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not compassionate to the plight of a 2 \u2014 someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.", "The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn\u2019t have the power to do that.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And he himself admitted that.", "ARRASAS: Senator, Senator...", "RUBIO: I\u2019m sorry, but let me finish my...", "ARRASAS: ... but you went \u2014 you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.", "RUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.", "Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can\u2019t solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.", "(APPLAUSE)", "ARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie?", "RUBIO: Because it is not true that I\u2019m not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don\u2019t even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.", "That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take \u2014 as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.", "TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.", "RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.", "TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.", "RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.", "ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.", "RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there\u2019s a statute of limitation on lies.", "(LAUGHTER)", "(APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you\u2019re right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. CRUZ: You know, we\u2019ve both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, it\u2019ll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.", "That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn\u2019t plan to end it at all.", "You know, I\u2019m reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.", "Marco\u2019s position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.", "RUBIO: That\u2019s not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I don\u2019t agree with the mandate and the program that\u2019s in place, but I think it\u2019s unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we\u2019re just going to yank it away from them.", "And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is \u2014 at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.", "I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.", "(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)", "ARRASAS: Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.", "So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?", "CRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.", "You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you\u2019re liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.", "At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.", "You know, we\u2019ve got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father\u2019s story.", "Telling my Dad\u2019s story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream.

I was mentioned \u2014 just because of the hispanic \u2014 and I\u2019ll be brief.", "A couple points, number one, I do think it\u2019s amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.", "(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)", "And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.", "Yes, it\u2019s an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I\u2019m going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...", "(BELL RINGING)", "RUBIO: ... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That\u2019s what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.", "(APPLAUSE)", "ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos.

I mean, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don\u2019t like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother\u2019s thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.", "I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I\u2019m going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven\u2019t changed anything with it.", "And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.", "That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.", "But here\u2019s the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.", "Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.", "It\u2019s what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me.

You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are \u2014 that give liberty and justice to all people.", "And that\u2019s the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think that\u2019s the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don\u2019t pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.", "But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America.

I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.", "They get it. They\u2019re incredible people. They\u2019re incredible workers. They get it. And I\u2019ve won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn\u2019t maybe win the Telemundo poll.", "But one thing I\u2019m also going to do, I\u2019m going to be getting \u2014 bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you\u2019re seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.", "And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.TRUMP: We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers.

Why did they...", "(CROSSTALK)", "ARRASAS: I am making reference \u2014 I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.", "TRUMP: I\u2019m just telling you, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics.

I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.", "Hugh?", "HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.", "To me, it\u2019s the most important issue. I\u2019ll start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?", "CRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it \u2014 Justice Scalia\u2019s passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.", "Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this \u2014 this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I\u2019m certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.", "But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.", "I\u2019ve spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they\u2019re asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies \u2014 all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it\u2019s repealed, it was a five-four decision, they\u2019re going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.", "Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?", "TRUMP: Yes, I would. And I\u2019ve been there. And I\u2019ve been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it\u2019s not anybody\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not Ted\u2019s fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.", "That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way \u2014 no way that he should have approved Obamacare.", "Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don\u2019t want.", "HEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz\u2019s criticism?CRUZ: Well, listen \u2014 Donald knows that it was George W.

Look, I watched Ted \u2014 and I respected it, but he gets nowhere \u2014 stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.", "I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that\u2019s going to make deals.", "It\u2019s wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted\u2019s been very critical \u2014 I have a sister who\u2019s a brilliant...", "HEWITT: Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?", "TRUMP: ... excuse me. She\u2019s a brilliant judge. He\u2019s been criticizing \u2014 he\u2019s been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill?

What do you think?", "HEWITT: Let me \u2014 Senator.", "CRUZ: Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can\u2019t have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You\u2019ve got to be willing to cut a deal.", "And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald \u2014 Donald Trump.", "Why?

I don\u2019t want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.", "(APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot \u2014 give me a break.", "HEWITT: Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?", "RUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here \u2014 the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.", "Justice Scalia \u2014 in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document \u2014 it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.", "And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia \u2014 plus there may be at least two other vacancies.", "So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.", "Now, if he\u2019s changed, we\u2019re always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don\u2019t have a record there to look at and say, \u201cI feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he\u2019s going to be firmly on our side on these issues.\u201d", "In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he\u2019s not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.", "And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.", "HEWITT: Mr. Trump?", "(APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: Well, let \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative \u2014 more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.", "As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I\u2019m pro-life. I\u2019m totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women \u2014 cervical cancer, breast cancer \u2014 are helped by Planned Parenthood.", "So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn\u2019t fund it.", "I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don\u2019t know what percentage it is. They say it\u2019s 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I\u2019m pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HEWITT: Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty. You\u2019ve been a little bit less emphatic. You\u2019ve said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people? KASICH: Well, you know, , of course. I mean, if \u2014 look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.", "Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don\u2019t favor it. I\u2019ve always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I\u2019ve moved on. And what I\u2019ve said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?", "If you\u2019re in the business of selling things, if you\u2019re not going to sell to somebody you don\u2019t agree with, OK, today I\u2019m not going to sell to somebody who\u2019s gay, and tomorrow maybe I won\u2019t sell to somebody who\u2019s divorced.", "I mean, if you\u2019re in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That\u2019s my view. And if you don\u2019t agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.", "But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, I\u2019ve appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.", "And you know what they are? They\u2019re conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don\u2019t make the law. They interpret the law. That\u2019s all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.", "But let\u2019s just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.", "HEWITT: Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear?", "(APPLAUSE)", "HEWITT: Are the positions you\u2019ve heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?", "CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.", "As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.", "But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That\u2019s unfair.", "And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That\u2019s why we have divided government. And we\u2019re going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.", "And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person\u2019s life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.", "The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.", "BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let\u2019s talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.", "BASH: Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you\u2019re worried he won\u2019t?", "RUBIO: The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don\u2019t believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here\u2019s what we need to replace it with.", "We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.", "Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.", "And if you don\u2019t have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn\u2019t just bad for health care, it\u2019s bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people\u2019s hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond?", "TRUMP: I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I\u2019m referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.", "I think we need it. I think it\u2019s a modern age. And I think we have to have it.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BASH: OK, so let\u2019s talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong?", "TRUMP: I think they\u2019re wrong 100 percent. What we need \u2014 look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. TRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.", "The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got \u2014 I\u2019m not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they\u2019re part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.", "And, actually, the Governor too, let\u2019s just talk about these too, OK?", "(LAUGHTER)", "TRUMP: Because I don\u2019t think the Governor had too much to do with this.", "But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there\u2019s great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.", "I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there\u2019s serious, serious competition.", "BASH But, Mr. Trump...", "TRUMP: ... And, you\u2019re going to see \u2014 excuse me. You\u2019re going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they\u2019re making a fortune.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BASH: But, just to be specific here, what you\u2019re saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...", "TRUMP: That\u2019s going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren\u2019t going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say \u2014 they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they\u2019re friends of mine. The top guys, they\u2019re friends of mine. I shouldn\u2019t tell you guys, you\u2019ll say it\u2019s terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They\u2019re friends of mine, there\u2019s some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He\u2019s not laughing so much anymore.", "Hi.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we\u2019ll come up with new plans.

Go ahead.", "RUBIO: You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don\u2019t follow this stuff very closely, but here\u2019s what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.", "And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. They\u2019re suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.", "Here\u2019s what you didn\u2019t hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps...", "TRUMP: ... And, you don\u2019t know what it means...", "RUBIO: ... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?", "(APPLAUSE)", "RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?", "TRUMP: You don\u2019t know.", "BASH: (inaudible)", "TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...", "(CROSSTALK)", "RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan...", "TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, I\u2019ll have you know...", "RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan... TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he\u2019s got is he really doesn\u2019t know about the lines. The biggest thing we\u2019ve got, and the reason we\u2019ve got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....", "RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...", "TRUMP: ... You don\u2019t know much...", "RUBIO: ... So, you\u2019re only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan...", "TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...", "RUBIO: ... That\u2019s your only plan...", "TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done \u2014 not now...", "RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...", "TRUMP: ... Excuse me. Excuse me.", "RUBIO: ... His plan. That was the plan...", "TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you\u2019ll have many. They\u2019ll compete, and it\u2019ll be a beautiful thing.", "RUBIO: Alright...", "(APPLAUSE)", "RUBIO: So, that\u2019s the only part of the plan? Just the lines?", "BASH: (inaudible)", "TRUMP: The nice part of the plan \u2014 you\u2019ll have many different plans. You\u2019ll have competition, you\u2019ll have so many different plans.", "RUBIO: Now he\u2019s repeating himself.", "TRUMP: No, no, no.", "(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)", "TRUMP: (inaudible)", "RUBIO: (inaudible)", "(CHEERING)", "TRUMP: (inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago...

Yeah, he\u2019s going to give us his plan now, right? OK...", "BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more about your plan. I know you talked about...", "TRUMP: ... We\u2019re going to have many different plans because...", "BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...", "TRUMP: ... competition...", "RUBIO: ... He\u2019s done it again.", "(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies.

Thank you both.", "RUBIO: Alright.", "BASH: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said it is, quote, \u201cUn American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition.\u201dBASH: Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?", "KASICH: No, I wouldn\u2019t. And \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You don\u2019t want any American to lose their house, everything they\u2019ve saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what we\u2019ve heard here tonight. We\u2019re actually running significant health reform in my state.", "I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don\u2019t want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.", "And then we\u2019re driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it\u2019s easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.", "And I\u2019ll tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.", "BASH: Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate. In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?", "KASICH: Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tenable. And we don\u2019t need to do that. Again, I\u2019m telling you that we are going to \u2014 we have a proposal, a plan that we\u2019re enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you\u2019re providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint \u2014 some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.", "That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they\u2019re going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can\u2019t afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We\u2019re actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go \u2014 this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what\u2019s going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.", "We don\u2019t want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.", "Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. We\u2019re losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.", "BASH: Governor Kasich, thank you.", "KASICH: Thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?", "CARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.", "I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad\u2019s $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.", "And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody\u2019s going to hide his cigarettes because they\u2019re all interested in what\u2019s going on there.", "Also, the \u2014 your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, it\u2019s like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What\u2019s the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.CARSON: But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all \u2014 they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.", "BLITZER: Thank you.", "CARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don\u2019t get to talk that much. And, you know, let\u2019s...", "(APPLAUSE)", "... you can have the money that\u2019s left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.", "It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that\u2019s probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.", "BLITZER: Thank you.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let\u2019s talk about the economy. Let\u2019s talk about...", "CRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?", "BLITZER: I want to move on, but there\u2019ll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...", "CRUZ: It\u2019s kind of an issue I have a long history with.", "BLITZER: I know you do. And \u2014 all right, go ahead.", "(LAUGHTER)", "CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.", "KASICH: How do you \u2014 how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You\u2019re very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.", "(APPLAUSE)", "On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, it\u2019s killed millions of jobs, and it\u2019s hurting people\u2019s health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.", "What he\u2019s said is government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you\u2019re a small business owner, Donald Trump\u2019s socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you\u2019re elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it\u2019s been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don\u2019t get that hip replacement, you don\u2019t get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.", "I\u2019ll tell you this. As president...", "BLITZER: Senator...", "CRUZ: ... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?", "TRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it\u2019s going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.", "In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn\u2019t work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.", "CRUZ: Donald, true or false, you\u2019ve said the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care.", "TRUMP: That\u2019s false.", "CRUZ: You\u2019ve never said that?", "TRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...", "CRUZ: But you\u2019ve never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.", "TRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.", "CRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you have no heart.", "TRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I\u2019m president.", "CRUZ: Have you said you\u2019re a liberal on health care?", "TRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...", "CRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.", "TRUMP: If people \u2014 my plan is very simple. I will not \u2014 we\u2019re going to have private \u2014 we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I\u2019m president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...", "CRUZ: So does the government pay for everyone\u2019s health care?", "TRUMP: ... I\u2019m not fine with it. We are going to take those people...", "CRUZ: Yes or no. Just answer the question.", "TRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We\u2019re going to make great deals on it, but we\u2019re not going to let them die in the streets.", "CRUZ: Who pays for it?", "RUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?", "BLITZER: Gentleman, please.", "RUBIO: Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.", "BLITZER: Gentlemen please. I want to move on.", "RUBIO: This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...", "BLITZER: I want to talk about the economy.", "(CROSSTALK)", "BLITZER: Gentleman, gentleman. All of you have agreed \u2014 Senator Cruz...", "TRUMP: You know what? Call it what you want.", "CRUZ: It\u2019s a yes or no.", "TRUMP: Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.", "BLITZER: All of you have agreed \u2014 all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. We\u2019re talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.", "How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn\u2019t saddled with even more debt? TRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We\u2019ll be dynamic again. If you look at what\u2019s going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.", "It\u2019s shutting off our economy. It\u2019s shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can\u2019t get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.", "BLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?", "TRUMP: We\u2019re going to make many cuts in business. We\u2019re getting rid of \u2014 we\u2019re going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education \u2014 Common Core is out. We\u2019re going local. Have to go local.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Environmental protection \u2014 we waste all of this money. We\u2019re going to bring that back to the states.

If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that\u2019s about $68 billion. If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that\u2019s about $8 billion. That\u2019s about $76 billion for those two agencies.", "The current deficit this year is $544 billion. Where are you going to come up with the money?", "TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse.", "(APPLAUSE)", "You look at what\u2019s happening with Social Security, you look \u2014 look at what\u2019s happening with every agency \u2014 waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.", "BLITZER: Governor Kasich.", "(APPLAUSE)", "When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had. Can Mr. Trump\u2019s plan work?", "KASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I\u2019ve done it. I mean, I \u2014 we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.", "And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington \u2014 every single one of them \u2014 and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.", "And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you don\u2019t have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won\u2019t get there. You will never be able to do it.", "Now, I \u2014 I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts \u2014 the biggest of any governor in the country \u2014 and we have a fiscal plan.", "And it\u2019s not all \u2014 it\u2019s not always cutting. It\u2019s innovating \u2014 it\u2019s producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.", "And, look \u2014 I\u2019ve got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.", "I\u2019ve done it \u2014 I did it in Washington \u2014 four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened.", "(BELL RINGS)", "I\u2019ve done it in Ohio, we\u2019re growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity.

I promise you that.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.", "BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, governor.", "(APPLAUSE)", "Speaking of taxes...", "TRUMP: I just want to say \u2014 and I\u2019m a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.", "KASICH: OK, let me \u2014 let me \u2014 let me just talk about that, because I know that \u2014 that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we\u2019ve created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it\u2019s early-stage.", "See, what we\u2019ve done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that\u2019s jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.", "We \u2014 we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon \u2014 their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why it\u2019s happening?", "(BELL RINGS)", "Because we\u2019re balanced budgets, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re job-friendly, we don\u2019t raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I\u2019m quoting him now, \u201cthere is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them.\u201d", "Romney said either you\u2019re not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven\u2019t paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven\u2019t been giving the money to veterans or disabled people. Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?", "TRUMP: All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form \u2014 almost 100 pages. You don\u2019t learn anything about somebody\u2019s wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements. TRUMP: I filed \u2014 which shows that I\u2019m worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn\u2019t ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.", "So as far as that\u2019s concerned, I filed it. And that\u2019s where you find out what kind of a company. You don\u2019t learn anything from a tax return.", "I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn\u2019t file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.", "As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I\u2019ve been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.", "Nobody gets audited \u2014 I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I\u2019m being audited now for two or three years, so I can\u2019t do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.", "BLITZER: Hugh, go ahead.", "HEWITT: Mr. Trump. You told me...", "TRUMP: Are you going to ask anybody else that question?", "CARSON: Yes, amen, amen.", "(LAUGHTER)", "TRUMP: Every single question comes to me?", "HEWITT: Mr. Trump...", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: I know I\u2019m here for the ratings, but it\u2019s a little bit ridiculous.", "(LAUGHTER) HEWITT: Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.", "TRUMP: True.", "HEWITT: Are you going back on your commitment?", "TRUMP: No, I\u2019m not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That\u2019s the good news.", "(LAUGHTER)", "TRUMP: Let me just tell you, let me just \u2014 which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.", "Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can\u2019t release it while I\u2019m under an audit. We\u2019re under a routine audit. I\u2019ve had it for years, I get audited.", "And obviously if I\u2019m being audited, I\u2019m not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.", "HEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns. Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released. And you said, coming out any day momentarily. When are we going to see your returns?", "RUBIO: Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And there\u2019s nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily I\u2019m not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.", "(CROSSTALK)", "RUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It\u2019s a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.", "That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.", "You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I\u2019ve been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.", "And I think if we \u2014 the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is \u2014 the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.", "It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis.

Why haven\u2019t voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?", "CRUZ: So, I\u2019ve released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes \u2014 you know, Donald says he\u2019s being audited.", "Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.", "And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.", "Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...", "TRUMP: Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.", "CRUZ: ... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.", "You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. They\u2019re going to pick apart his taxes. They\u2019re going to pick apart his business deals.", "And let\u2019s take, for example, one of Hillary\u2019s great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.CRUZ: The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, \u201cbut gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding.\u201d", "He can\u2019t prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can\u2019t risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.", "(APPLAUSE)", "(CROSSTALK)", "TRUMP: So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I\u2019m a businessman. I have, over the years.", "And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he\u2019s doing well in the polls.

How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East?", "TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think they do under President Obama because I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly. (APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel.

If I\u2019m president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media.

And I will not pretend that they are.", "Just today, Iran announced they\u2019re going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald\u2019s answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel.

It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.", "BLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.", "KASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I\u2019ve been a supporter of Israel \u2014 a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn\u2019t give as much money as Donald gave, but I\u2019ve been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.", "And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one \u2014 are moving because they\u2019re not sure what we will do.", "It\u2019s a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.", "When we stand firm and we let the world know who we\u2019re with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.", "(CROSSTALK)", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: We\u2019re going to get to North Korea in a moment.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not his intent perhaps. But the position you\u2019ve taken is an anti-Israel position. And here\u2019s why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here\u2019s what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here\u2019s what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.", "And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going to sit here and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not on either side.\u201d I will be on a side.

I\u2019ve done very well over the years through negotiation. It\u2019s very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator.

He\u2019s not going down \u2014 excuse me...", "RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.", "TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie.

I learned a long time ago.", "RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you\u2019re dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?", "TRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. (APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...", "RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it\u2019s not a real estate deal...", "TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...", "BLITZER: ... Senator.", "TRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.", "BLITZER: Let\u2019s move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.", "Let\u2019s be clear. Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?", "KASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That\u2019s what it means. Even though there\u2019s so much chaos in North Korea right now, there\u2019s a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.", "But, look, here\u2019s what I think we ought to do \u2014 like, immediately. And, we\u2019ve been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don\u2019t know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they\u2019re not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.", "Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.", "Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don\u2019t have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we\u2019re now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.", "But, when I say regime change, I don\u2019t have to talk exactly what that means. Look, I\u2019ve been involved in national security for a long time. You don\u2019t have to spell everything out, but what I\u2019m telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we\u2019re doing is beginning to work against them.", "They are the key to being able to settle this situation.", "BLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...", "KASICH: ... I\u2019m very well aware of that.", "BLITZER: A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?", "KASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I\u2019ll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we\u2019re going to face this sooner or later.", "But, in the meantime, I\u2019m also aware of the fact that there\u2019s 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don\u2019t just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.", "Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we\u2019ve got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...", "(BELL RINGING)", "KASICH: ... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.", "BLITZER: Mr. Trump.", "TRUMP: One thing I\u2019d like to add to what the Governor\u2019s saying, I think that we are now in a position \u2014 are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it\u2019s going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.", "You order televisions, you order almost anything, you\u2019re getting it from these countries. Whether it\u2019s a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it\u2019s an air conditioning unit. They\u2019re coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they\u2019re making less, but they\u2019re making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day.", "(BELL RINGING)", "We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.", "(APPLAUSE)", "KASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...", "BLITZER: Dr. Carson.", "KASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we\u2019re all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We\u2019re all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.", "But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,", "But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.", "(BELL RINGING)", "We can\u2019t have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...", "BLITZER: ... Thank you...", "KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?", "CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don\u2019t get time. I\u2019m going to whine because I didn\u2019t get asked about taxes, I didn\u2019t get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you\u2019re going to be fair to everybody, you didn\u2019t ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.", "Now...", "BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.", "(APPLAUSE)", "CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the whole year. And they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the next year and the next year. They didn\u2019t find anything and they won\u2019t find anything because I\u2019m a very honest person.", "But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.", "(APPLAUSE)", "And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn\u2019t find a single one who didn\u2019t think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it\u2019s like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.", "And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.", "And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. We\u2019re going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.", "HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?", "TRUMP: I really don\u2019t because it not working and the countries aren\u2019t agreeing to it and the rebels aren\u2019t agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It\u2019s a meaningless ceasefire.", "I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of \u2014 with a total cessation. But it\u2019s not working, as you know very well. It\u2019s not working. If \u2014 we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.", "So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.", "HEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.", "CRUZ: Well look. We\u2019re certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there\u2019s reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama\u2019s weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as we\u2019re headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.", "One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.", "Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry \u2014 Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we\u2019re not in a strong position to win the general election.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.", "TRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...", "CRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.", "TRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that\u2019s concerned. You know it and so do I.", "CRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.", "TRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. TRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, he\u2019s saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.", "If these politicians went to the beach and didn\u2019t do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we\u2019d be \u2014 at least they killed terrorists, all right?", "And I\u2019m not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it\u2019s a total mess.", "We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.", "(APPLAUSE)", "HEWITT: Senator Rubio.", "RUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn\u2019t topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?", "And I argued if it takes a long time, you\u2019re going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s where the term \u201clead from behind\u201d came. And that\u2019s the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.", "On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn\u2019t appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.", "I couldn\u2019t imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.", "(LAUGHTER)", "(APPLAUSE)", "RUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we\u2019re asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he\u2019s saying these guys need to do more.", "South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And here\u2019s why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.", "They can do that very quickly. And that\u2019s what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can\u2019t walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.", "HEWITT: Mr. Trump.", "TRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...", "RUBIO: How much?", "TRUMP: A lot. I\u2019ll negotiate a lot more money than you\u2019ll ever get.", "As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.", "It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it\u2019s a disaster for Israel. I\u2019m no fan of John Kerry.", "(CROSSTALK)", "BLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.", "Senator Cruz.", "CRUZ: You know, it\u2019s interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya. Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.", "You can see and hear the exact words from Donald\u2019s mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.", "With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry\u2019s foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That\u2019s why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.", "And I\u2019ll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?", "The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.", "During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?", "If you care about Israel, you don\u2019t write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.", "(CROSSTALK)", "KASICH: There\u2019s a critical point that needs to be made here.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.", "Mr. Trump has a right to respond.", "TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you\u2019re politicians, all talk, no action.", "(APPLAUSE)", "TRUMP: I\u2019ve been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.", "CRUZ: Then name one specific thing you\u2019ve done.", "TRUMP: What I\u2019ve seen up here \u2014 I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...", "RUBIO: This guy always goes for...", "TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He can\u2019t do it...", "RUBIO: This is so typical.", "TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he can\u2019t do it because he doesn\u2019t know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.", "(CROSSTALK)", "BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen.", "Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor...", "(CROSSTALK)", "BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.", "CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please? (LAUGHTER)", "(APPLAUSE)", "KASICH: There\u2019s something \u2014 I want to \u2014 I want to point out something here today that is \u2014 it\u2019s so critically important \u2014 about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.", "First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they\u2019re sitting in the catbird seat.", "We should have been helping them. I\u2019m thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.", "Now, let\u2019s talk about Libya. Libya didn\u2019t go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.", "And let me just say to you \u2014 we have ISIS beginning get \u2014 get a foothold in Libya. We\u2019re gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. They\u2019re on the coast, which \u2014 mostly, it\u2019s desert, but it\u2019s a problem.", "Then we have ISIS in \u2014 in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq.

The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks.

And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge\u2019s order.", "Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.", "BASH: Senator Rubio, you say it\u2019s complicated, and that, quote, \u201cApple isn\u2019t necessarily wrong to refuse the court order.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t investigators have everything at their disposal?", "RUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing \u2014 the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago \u2014 the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, \u201cWe\u2019re being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.\u201d That is not accurate.", "The only thing they\u2019re being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that\u2019s in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.", "And I think they should comply with that. If that\u2019s all they\u2019re asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.", "BASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.", "RUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.", "BASH: But just to be clear \u2014 just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?", "RUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?", "BASH: Correct.", "RUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didn\u2019t even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer\u2019s employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all they\u2019re asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn\u2019t want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.", "Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?", "CRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. He\u2019s now agreeing with me. And so I\u2019m glad.", "What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone\u2019s cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.", "I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn\u2019t have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.", "(APPLAUSE)", "BASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?", "CARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.", "(APPLAUSE)", "You know, we have the \u2014 we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And that\u2019s why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.", "So absolutely, I would \u2014 I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don\u2019t comply with that, you\u2019re encouraging chaos in our system.", "BASH: Mr. Trump...", "(APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where\u2019s the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don\u2019t litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.", "The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you\u2019re the president? You lock the door and you say you\u2019re not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.", "And I\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s why you want a governor. I do this all the time.

You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn\u2019t? Isn\u2019t that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?", "TRUMP: First of all, you\u2019re talking about a border that\u2019s many, many times longer. You\u2019re talking about a massive border.", "We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts \u2014 you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.", "You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in.

It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.", "They\u2019re coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it\u2019s too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.", "This year alone, with all the problems they\u2019re having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they\u2019ve made to future generations to make payments.", "So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they\u2019re asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you\u2019re going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.", "They\u2019re United States citizens, they\u2019re obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust.

So far, this base has been covered first by his wife, Lori, who shacked up with his best friend and was also one of the series\u2019s most loathed characters, and then by Jessie, the courting of whom involved killing her husband (#baggage).

Jobs as Apple\u2019s chief executive, he has visited the White House at least a half-dozen times.", "In the summer of 2013, soon after Edward J. Snowden revealed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs, Mr. Cook joined 16 other technology executives and privacy advocates for a grievance session with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room.

The following year, in December 2014, White House visitor logs show that Mr. Cook spent two days in the West Wing, where he met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office and shared a meal in the White House mess with John D. Podesta, who was then counselor to Mr. Obama as well as the president\u2019s environmental czar.", "In September 2015, Mr. Cook was again at the White House, where he had a prime seat at the state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China.", "Current and former White House officials say Mr. Obama appreciated the attention that Mr. Cook brought to issues like immigration, gay marriage and climate change. When Mr. Obama solicited Apple and other companies to support his ConnectED program for technology in schools, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to pledge $100 million worth of iPads and MacBooks, calling it \u201can enormous commitment.\u201d", "There were also tensions. White House officials were not happy about Apple\u2019s decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and have repeatedly pressed Mr. Cook to explain the company\u2019s need to build its blockbuster products in China rather than in the United States.", "But the encryption debate, and the government\u2019s legal action against Apple last week, are testing the relationship with the company more than any other.", "\u201cA company thinks very hard before it defies the government,\u201d said Nicole Wong, who was Google\u2019s lead lawyer when Google resisted a Justice Department request for user data.

Newton\u2019s teammate Josh Norman scored a touchdown versus the Buccaneers and was penalized for celebrating. Versus Boise State, Virginia scored a touchdown and was penalized for an end-zone dance. In November an Arizona high school player was flagged for celebration, then ejected, when he briefly pointed to the sky after a touchdown.", "Because the celebration penalty is in the rulebook, officials have no choice but to enforce it. So get the penalty out of the rulebook. Overwrought Talmudic distinctions are invoked. Go to the eight-minute mark of this N.F.L. officiating video and learn Norman was flagged because he pretended the football was a horse. If he\u2019d dropped the football, then mimicked an invisible horse, why of course that would have been fine. Who needs such rules? Taunting must be a penalty; celebrating is part of the fun.", "Football\u2019s puritanical opposition to the touchdown celebration seems rooted in the illusion that it actually matters who wins the game, thus the contest should be conducted in a somber manner.

It\u2019s that Denver, 2-5 in the ultimate contest, has the most Super Bowl defeats. Should the Broncos pull up short again Sunday, they will have blown the Super Bowl twice in three years, while falling to 2-6 in the finale game.", "The Super Bowl pressure differential seems to reflect in the faces of the quarterbacks. Cam Newton is exuberant, joyful; he\u2019s not just a fabulous athlete but a fabulous entertainer, projecting happiness to the crowd. Manning is dour, seeming to wince more often than he smiles. Manning has endured so many bummer postseason postgame news conferences that he must dread the next one. Often, he wears the expression of a child who just broke something valuable but hasn\u2019t told the grown-ups yet.", "Thirteen years younger than Manning, Newton is a product of the 7-on-7 generation: In the N.F.L., he\u2019s taken 80 percent of his snaps in shotgun formation. Newton\u2019s effectiveness improved in 2015 as he learned to make most of his throws from the pocket; previously, he scrambled too much.", "When Newton does scramble, his Greek-god physique comes into play.

She had worked at a consulting firm, but it wasn\u2019t a good match. Then she became a researcher for two professors at Harvard, which was interesting but lonely. Maybe a big corporation would be a better fit. Or perhaps a fast-growing start-up. All she knew for certain was that she wanted to find a job that was more social. \u2018\u2018I wanted to be part of a community, part of something people were building together,\u2019\u2019 she told me. She thought about various opportunities \u2014 Internet companies, a Ph.D. program \u2014 but nothing seemed exactly right. So in 2009, she chose the path that allowed her to put off making a decision: She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.", "When Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics. A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.", "Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. But it didn\u2019t turn out that way. \u2018\u2018There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t like that for me.\u2019\u2019", "Instead, Rozovsky\u2019s study group was a source of stress. \u2018\u2018I always felt like I had to prove myself,\u2019\u2019 she said. The team\u2019s dynamics could put her on edge. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another\u2019s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. \u2018\u2018People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.\u2019\u2019", "So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together teams for \u2018\u2018case competitions,\u2019\u2019 contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasn\u2019t all that different from what Rozovsky did with her study group: conducting lots of research and financial analyses, writing reports and giving presentations. The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences: Army officer, researcher at a think tank, director of a health-education nonprofit organization and consultant to a refugee program. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, \u2018\u2018we had lots of crazy ideas,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said.", "One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale\u2019s campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but \u2018\u2018we all felt like we could say anything to each other,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.\u2019\u2019 Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a micro\u00adgym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. They won the competition. (The micro\u00adgym \u2014 with two stationary bicycles and three treadmills \u2014 still exists.)", "Rozovsky\u2019s study group dissolved in her second semester (it was up to the students whether they wanted to continue). Her case team, however, stuck together for the two years she was at Yale.", "It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the team\u2019s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.", "\u2018\u2018I couldn\u2019t figure out why things had turned out so different,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018It didn\u2019t seem like it had to happen that way.\u2019\u2019", "O\nur data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re living through a golden age of understanding personal productivity,\u2019\u2019 says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information. \u2018\u2018All of a sudden, we can pick apart the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us don\u2019t even notice, and figure out why some people are so much more effective than everyone else.\u2019\u2019", "Yet many of today\u2019s most valuable firms have come to realize that analyzing and improving individual workers \u00ad\u2014 a practice known as \u2018\u2018employee performance optimization\u2019\u2019 \u2014 isn\u2019t enough. As commerce becomes increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based. One study, published in The Harvard Business Review last month, found that \u2018\u2018the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more\u2019\u2019 over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee\u2019s day is spent communicating with colleagues.", "In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more. Within companies and conglomerates, as well as in government agencies and schools, teams are now the fundamental unit of organization. If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.", "Five years ago, Google \u2014 one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity \u2014 became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees\u2019 lives. Google\u2019s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).", "The company\u2019s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like \u2018\u2018It\u2019s better to put introverts together,\u2019\u2019 said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google\u2019s People Analytics division, or \u2018\u2018Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.\u2019\u2019 But, Dubey went on, \u2018\u2018it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.\u2019\u2019", "In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative \u2014 code-named Project Aristotle \u2014 to study hundreds of Google\u2019s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. Dubey, a leader of the project, gathered some of the company\u2019s best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers. He also needed researchers. Rozovsky, by then, had decided that what she wanted to do with her life was study people\u2019s habits and tendencies. After graduating from Yale, she was hired by Google and was soon assigned to Project Aristotle.", "P\nroject Aristotle\u2019s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments\u2019 goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team\u2019s success.", "No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns \u2014 or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. \u2018\u2018We looked at 180 teams from all over the company,\u2019\u2019 Dubey said. \u2018\u2018We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The \u2018who\u2019 part of the equation didn\u2019t seem to matter.\u2019\u2019", "Some groups that were ranked among Google\u2019s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. \u2018\u2018At Google, we\u2019re good at finding patterns,\u2019\u2019 Dubey said. \u2018\u2018There weren\u2019t strong patterns here.\u2019\u2019", "As they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as \u2018\u2018group norms.\u2019\u2019 Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals \u2014 they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently \u2014 but when they gather, the group\u2019s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.", "Project Aristotle\u2019s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an \u2018\u2018unwritten rule\u2019\u2019 or when they explained certain things as part of the \u2018\u2018team\u2019s culture.\u2019\u2019 Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group\u2019s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.", "After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google\u2019s teams. But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Google\u2019s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates? Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? The data didn\u2019t offer clear verdicts. In fact, the data sometimes pointed in opposite directions. The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them. Which norms, Rozovsky and her colleagues wondered, were the ones that successful teams shared?", "I\nmagine you have been invited to join one of two groups.", "Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.", "Team B is different. It\u2019s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one another\u2019s thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn\u2019t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.", "Which group would you rather join?", "In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Union College began to try to answer a question very much like this one. \u2018\u2018Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically measuring intelligence in individuals,\u2019\u2019 the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010. \u2018\u2018We have used the statistical approach they developed for individual intelligence to systematically measure the intelligence of groups.\u2019\u2019 Put differently, the researchers wanted to know if there is a collective I.\u2009Q. that emerges within a team that is distinct from the smarts of any single member.", "To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses; others kept describing the same ideas in different words. Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the group\u2019s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. Some groups easily divvied up the buying; others couldn\u2019t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.", "What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group\u2019s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.", "But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. \u2018\u2018Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,\u2019\u2019 said Anita Woolley, the study\u2019s lead author. \u2018\u2018Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone\u2019s relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.\u2019\u2019", "As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as \u2018\u2018equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.\u2019\u2019 On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. \u2018\u2018As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,\u2019\u2019 Woolley said. \u2018\u2018But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.\u2019\u2019", "Second, the good teams all had high \u2018\u2018average social sensitivity\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people\u2019s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling \u2014 an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley\u2019s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.", "In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group\u2019s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There\u2019s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there\u2019s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.", "In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another\u2019s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.", "Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like \u2018\u2018conversational turn-taking\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018average social sensitivity\u2019\u2019 as aspects of what\u2019s known as psychological safety \u2014 a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a \u2018\u2018shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.\u2019\u2019 Psychological safety is \u2018\u2018a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,\u2019\u2019 Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. \u2018\u2018It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.\u2019\u2019", "When Rozovsky and her Google colleagues encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. One engineer, for instance, had told researchers that his team leader was \u2018\u2018direct and straightforward, which creates a safe space for you to take risks.\u2019\u2019 That team, researchers estimated, was among Google\u2019s accomplished groups. By contrast, another engineer had told the researchers that his \u2018\u2018team leader has poor emotional control.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u2018\u2018He panics over small issues and keeps trying to grab control. I would hate to be driving with him being in the passenger seat, because he would keep trying to grab the steering wheel and crash the car.\u2019\u2019 That team, researchers presumed, did not perform well.", "Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. \u2018\u2018And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group.\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky\u2019s study group at Yale was draining because the norms \u2014 the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique \u2014 put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team \u2014 enthusiasm for one another\u2019s ideas, joking around and having fun \u2014 allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.", "For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well \u2014 like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google\u2019s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.", "\u2018\u2018We had to get people to establish psychologically safe environments,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. But it wasn\u2019t clear how to do that. \u2018\u2018People here are really busy,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018We needed clear guidelines.\u2019\u2019", "However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement. You can tell people to take turns during a conversation and to listen to one another more. You can instruct employees to be sensitive to how their colleagues feel and to notice when someone seems upset. But the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.", "Rozovsky and her colleagues had figured out which norms were most critical. Now they had to find a way to make communication and empathy \u2014 the building blocks of forging real connections \u2014 into an algorithm they could easily scale.", "I\nn late 2014, Rozovsky and her fellow Project Aristotle number-crunchers began sharing their findings with select groups of Google\u2019s 51,000 employees. By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years. They hadn\u2019t yet figured out how to make psychological safety easy, but they hoped that publicizing their research within Google would prompt employees to come up with some ideas of their own.", "After Rozovsky gave one presentation, a trim, athletic man named Matt Sakaguchi approached the Project Aristotle researchers. Sakaguchi had an unusual background for a Google employee. Twenty years earlier, he was a member of a SWAT team in Walnut Creek, Calif., but left to become an electronics salesman and eventually landed at Google as a midlevel manager, where he has overseen teams of engineers who respond when the company\u2019s websites or servers go down.", "\u2018\u2018I might be the luckiest individual on earth,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi told me. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not really an engineer. I didn\u2019t study computers in college. Everyone who works for me is much smarter than I am.\u2019\u2019 But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result, Sakaguchi has thrived at Google. He and his wife, a teacher, have a home in San Francisco and a weekend house in the Sonoma Valley wine country. \u2018\u2018Most days, I feel like I\u2019ve won the lottery,\u2019\u2019 he said.", "Sakaguchi was particularly interested in Project Aristotle because the team he previously oversaw at Google hadn\u2019t jelled particularly well. \u2018\u2018There was one senior engineer who would just talk and talk, and everyone was scared to disagree with him,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi said. \u2018\u2018The hardest part was that everyone liked this guy outside the group setting, but whenever they got together as a team, something happened that made the culture go wrong.\u2019\u2019", "Sakaguchi had recently become the manager of a new team, and he wanted to make sure things went better this time. So he asked researchers at Project Aristotle if they could help. They provided him with a survey to gauge the group\u2019s norms.", "When Sakaguchi asked his new team to participate, he was greeted with skepticism. \u2018\u2018It seemed like a total waste of time,\u2019\u2019 said Sean Laurent, an engineer. \u2018\u2018But Matt was our new boss, and he was really into this questionnaire, and so we said, Sure, we\u2019ll do it, whatever.\u2019\u2019", "The team completed the survey, and a few weeks later, Sakaguchi received the results. He was surprised by what they revealed. He thought of the team as a strong unit. But the results indicated there were weaknesses: When asked to rate whether the role of the team was clearly understood and whether their work had impact, members of the team gave middling to poor scores. These responses troubled Sakaguchi, because he hadn\u2019t picked up on this discontent. He wanted everyone to feel fulfilled by their work. He asked the team to gather, off site, to discuss the survey\u2019s results. He began by asking everyone to share something personal about themselves. He went first.", "\u2018\u2018I think one of the things most people don\u2019t know about me,\u2019\u2019 he told the group, \u2018\u2018is that I have Stage 4 cancer.\u2019\u2019 In 2001, he said, a doctor discovered a tumor in his kidney. By the time the cancer was detected, it had spread to his spine. For nearly half a decade, it had grown slowly as he underwent treatment while working at Google. Recently, however, doctors had found a new, worrisome spot on a scan of his liver. That was far more serious, he explained.", "No one knew what to say. The team had been working with Sakaguchi for 10 months. They all liked him, just as they all liked one another. No one suspected that he was dealing with anything like this.", "\u2018\u2018To have Matt stand there and tell us that he\u2019s sick and he\u2019s not going to get better and, you know, what that means,\u2019\u2019 Laurent said. \u2018\u2018It was a really hard, really special moment.\u2019\u2019", "After Sakaguchi spoke, another teammate stood and described some health issues of her own. Then another discussed a difficult breakup. Eventually, the team shifted its focus to the survey. They found it easier to speak honestly about the things that had been bothering them, their small frictions and everyday annoyances. They agreed to adopt some new norms: From now on, Sakaguchi would make an extra effort to let the team members know how their work fit into Google\u2019s larger mission; they agreed to try harder to notice when someone on the team was feeling excluded or down.", "There was nothing in the survey that instructed Sakaguchi to share his illness with the group. There was nothing in Project Aristotle\u2019s research that said that getting people to open up about their struggles was critical to discussing a group\u2019s norms. But to Sakaguchi, it made sense that psychological safety and emotional conversations were related.

"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/business/media/us-soccers-rebranding-gets-an-assist-from-virtual-reality.html": ["F\nor almost two years, the United States Soccer Federation fiddled with the redesign of its most conspicuous symbol: the red, white and blue crest adorning the jerseys of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams.", "But when it finally came time to unveil the new crest, the federation, the national governing body for soccer, elected to largely bypass the traditional news media. Its announcement on Monday will instead be delivered directly to fans via a more immersive experience \u2014 one that involves Google Cardboard, a virtual reality promotional video and a United States Soccer Federation scarf.", "The federation is hoping that this unorthodox approach will help draw more attention to its first major rebranding since 1995. It could also become a case study of sorts on the effectiveness of virtual reality as an advertising and marketing tool, particularly for sports leagues that are experimenting with different avenues to connect with fans.", "\u201cThis is an area that I think is still in a really unique phase,\u201d said Jay Berhalter, U.S. Soccer\u2019s chief commercial officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not really sure what it will end up being. But when we looked at it to launch the new crest, we thought it would be a really good fit for this type of dynamic.\u201d", "U.S. Soccer planned to surreptitiously deliver packages containing the gifts Monday morning to the doorsteps of about 8,000 registered club supporters as well as an additional 2,000 development academy players and other soccer fans across the country. The official unveiling will be later in the day.", "Shel Holtz, a public relations consultant and principal of the firm Holtz Communication & Technology, said that by doing something unusual, U.S. Soccer might be able to get away with bypassing the normal P.R. route. He likened it to Ford\u2019s effective use of Facebook to unveil its new Explorer model in 2011.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of content these days, a lot of noise,\u201d Mr. Holtz said. \u201cBut as long as you can be early with some of the new technology people are talking about, then you have an edge.\u201d", "The approach also echoes what rugby did in the days leading to its World Cup in September, when New Zealand\u2019s national team, in collaboration with American International Group, created a virtual reality experience that it gave away to 1,000 fans. Joe Favorito, an instructor in strategic communications at Columbia University who consulted on the project, said that effort significantly helped raise awareness of the event.", "\u201cYou want people to get genuinely excited about something, and you want to do it in an atmosphere that they can embrace,\u201d Mr. Favorito said. \u201cSometimes the best way to do it is literally to drop it on their doorstep.\u201d", "He says sports entities have used guerrilla marketing tactics in the past \u2014 the Los Angeles Galaxy, for instance, mailed packages with branded goods such as sunscreen to fans \u2014 but virtual reality adds another layer.", "And the experimentation is not limited to sports. The North Face recently gave visitors to its store in a South Korean mall a virtual dogsled ride through the South Pole using Oculus Rift headsets, followed by an actual ride through the mall, pulled by real huskies. The Savannah College of Art and Design mailed cardboard headsets to 5,000 prospective students to help them envision life on campus. When Volvo tried virtual reality for the debut of its redesigned XC90 S.U.V. last winter, however, it made a splash, but left some viewers unpersuaded.", "Mike Gressle, U.S. Soccer\u2019s director of marketing, said that the organization considered the demographics of its fan base before choosing virtual reality.", "\u201cOur fans are pretty early adopters to technology,\u201d Mr. Gressle said. \u201cGiven that this is the next new thing, we think they\u2019ll be pretty interested in it.\u201d", "The rebranding effort is centered on the crest. Crests are like logos for soccer federations, and they are treated reverentially by soccer enthusiasts.

The weather was pleasant, and Mr. Roberts led the team to a nearby dock for Divvy, the city\u2019s bike sharing program. But Divvy charges first-time users $10 for a day pass \u2014 too expensive for the group of three. Checking Uber, Mr. Roberts reported that the trip would cost about $12 and take about 20 minutes. It was the fastest option, but still over budget. The subway was just $2.25 per person. If all went well, they could get to the restaurant in 44 minutes, on time and under budget.", "After a short walk to a nearby subway stop, tickets were procured. After that, nothing went well. They had just missed a train. There were no screens showing when the next train would arrive. At one point, two maintenance workers ominously strolled down the middle of the tracks.", "Ten minutes later, a train arrived, hot and rank with body odor.

On the platform, a police unit patrolled with a bomb-sniffing German shepherd.", "The train began moving again, and after 40 minutes Mr. Roberts and his team emerged from a station less than a mile from Knife & Tine. The journey had frayed nerves, and rather than take the bus or walk to the restaurant, they decided to hop in a cab for a quick five-minute ride. The extra $10 blew the budget, but the team was only 10 minutes late.", "To the Ideo designers, the arduousness of their simple crosstown journey illustrated just how fraught the \u201cmultimodal\u201d terrain was.

Ford had already dabbled in this area, experimenting with electric bike shares and car-pooling services. In April, the company will introduce FordPass, an app that offers a suite of services including car sharing and electronic payments for parking.", "Starting in September, a Ford team led by Mr. Farrelly began working with Mr. Roberts and a handful of Ideo designers, with the loose goal of bringing a new product to market in 2016.

In Chicago, along with Mr. Roberts, there was an artist, a data scientist and an interaction designer. These cross-disciplinary teams are a hallmark of Ideo, which takes a liberal arts approach to commercial product design.", "The Ideo team connected with a half-dozen Chicagoans from diverse backgrounds. Among them was a 38-year-old whose short commute to her title insurance job involved a mix of driving, public transportation, walking and cabs. There was a 36-year-old doorman who relied on public transportation and walking for his 45-minute commute. And there was a 55-year-old who got to his job in the airline industry using public transit, cabs and his car.", "For weeks, the Ideo team followed these people as they went about their lives, visiting their homes, taking pictures of what they carried in their pockets, tagging along during their commutes, and pestering them with questions like why they decided to take the bus rather than the subway. Similar work was being done in London and Shanghai, all with the aim of better understanding people\u2019s behaviors and devising ways to improve their commutes.", "When the Ideo team wasn\u2019t following commuters, it was interviewing city planners and academics steeped in traffic data. And for good measure, the designers tried every conceivable mode of transportation in Chicago, even when going to lunch.", "After strawberry salads and sweet potato gnocchi at Knife & Tine, the Ideo team set off to do some sightseeing. Its destination: \u201cCloud Gate,\u201d the mirrored bean-shaped sculpture in Millennium Park, about five miles away on the lakefront.", "For this leg of the journey, the goal was speed, with no financial constraints. Lazy after a heavy lunch, the team chose to take an Uber.", "Two minutes after Mr. Roberts pulled out his phone, a black Lincoln MKC pulled up. It was a car Mr. Roberts knew well \u2014 Lincoln is owned by Ford, and Ideo had helped design the car\u2019s touch-screen software. Admiring Chicago\u2019s majestic lakeside architecture from the comfort of the S.U.V.\u2019s black leather seats, Mr. Roberts was far more contented than he had been on the subway. But the fare was a steep $32.", "Between excursions and visits with the local residents, the Ideo team reconvened at the office and tried to make sense of its data. Snapshots of the locals\u2019 lives were taped to the walls of a dedicated project room. During brainstorming sessions, the designers wrote key words and phrases on color-coded neon Post-it notes with black Sharpie pens, a signature aesthetic component of the Ideo design process.", "On the morning before it went to Knife & Tine, the team reviewed what it had heard from the subjects. The airline industry worker had told the Ideo team how much he hated being stuck on a bus. If a bus hit traffic within striking distance of his destination, he would often persuade the driver to open the door, and he would walk. It might take longer, but he hated feeling stuck.", "\u201cWaiting time is wasting life,\u201d said Enrica Masi, an interaction designer.", "Arianna McClain, a design researcher, riffed on this. \u201cMost commutes take the same amount of time, but some people just want to be moving,\u201d she said.", "Finally, Mr. Roberts tried to sum it all up.", "\u201cThere is a difference between the most direct journey, and the journey that meets my needs,\u201d he said.", "Over weeks of these sorts of conversations, the Ideo team developed a working theory that there were three archetypal commuters: Time Trumpers, for whom the only thing that mattered was the speed of the journey, regardless of comfort; Everyday Improvers, who looked for little ways to make a familiar commute more efficient or enjoyable; and Experience Seekers, adventurous spirits who might decide to try a new route and explore a new neighborhood, or walk if the weather was nice.", "With these archetypes in mind, the Ideo team came up with a handful of conceptual services and presented them to the research subjects. What if a there were one pass that paid for all modes of transportation? What if trains and buses could text you when they were running late, and you could reply? What if an app gave you instant alternatives when your usual method of commuting was delayed?", "The designs weren\u2019t meant to represent actual products that Ford would develop. Rather, Ideo was looking for clues in the Chicagoans\u2019 reactions that might inform more sketches, more concepts and perhaps, eventually, a prototype. \u201cThey\u2019re intended to be almost sacrificial,\u201d Mr. Roberts said of these early ideas.", "By the end of October, it still wasn\u2019t clear what Ideo would have to show for its months of intensive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 work. But some ideas were ruled out. It was clear that another route-planning app wouldn\u2019t suffice. In fact, the answer might not be one product, but three different ones.", "After they had snapped a few selfies under the warped mirror of Cloud Gate, it was time for the Ideo team to return to the office, about a mile and a half away. This time, the mandate was to do whatever was most enjoyable. The weather was still nice, so they decided to use Divvy, the bike-share service.", "The user interface on the Divvy docking station was confusing and slow. For a quick one-way ride, the $10 fee felt steep, and the bikes were dirty and hard to maneuver. But riding across the bridges of downtown Chicago in the afternoon light was the most exhilarating part of the day.", "The Ideo team\u2019s trips that day seemed to confirm some of their hunches. The subway might have worked for Everyday Improvers, if only the trains had been on time. Uber was clearly best for Time Trumpers. Riding a bike was great for Experience Seekers.", "In the months that followed, the firm developed three illustrative applications, one for each personality archetype. They weren\u2019t functional, but they suggested what might be possible.", "The app for Time Trumpers gave alternate routes if a user was stuck. A text-message-based app for Everyday Improvers informed users how the weather might affect their commute. And the Experience Seeker app allowed users to choose routes based on factors like \u201cconnect with nature,\u201d \u201cwindow shopping,\u201d and \u201cget your 10K steps.\u201d", "Some 800 test subjects around the world noodled with these ideas, playing with the dummy apps and providing Ideo with feedback. Like the earlier concepts, these were most likely \u201csacrificial.\u201d But they were closer to something that Ford might one day bring to market.", "In mid-January, Mr. Roberts and the team traveled to Dearborn, Mich., to present its findings at Ford headquarters. Both Ideo and its client were tight-lipped about what exactly happened during the workshop, but evidently the higher-ups at Ford were intrigued enough to push ahead: Ideo has developed more polished versions of some of its concepts, and is testing them with transportation authorities in London and Chicago. When functional versions are ready, the goal is to integrate them into FordPass.", "Ford is working hard to avoid being undone by new technologies. Besides its existing experiments with ride sharing and FordPass, there are reports that Ford is working with Google on self-driving cars. Most other big carmakers are experimenting in similar ways.", "Whatever Ideo cooks up for Ford will be a tiny part of the carmaker\u2019s broader strategy. It almost certainly won\u2019t generate the billions of dollars Ford will need to replace lost revenues whenever car sales do decline. But by trying to understand the hearts and minds of commuters who rely on buses, subways and their own feet, Ford hopes to at least be relevant in a more complex future, perhaps one with fewer cars.", "\u201cWith the original Model T, we opened up the highways to all mankind,\u201d Mr. Farrelly said. \u201cWe are at the same point again, about to reach a new audience.

If Apple is forced to write code that lets the F.B.I. get into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?", "Apple\u2019s stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption to limit access to people\u2019s data. More than that, Apple \u2014 and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft \u2014 have made their opposition to the government\u2019s claims a point of corporate pride.", "Apple\u2019s emerging global brand is privacy; it has staked its corporate reputation, not to mention invested its considerable technical and financial resources, on limiting the sort of mass surveillance that was uncovered by Mr. Snowden.

As Apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the F.B.I. access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.", "Once armed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively, before a suspected terrorist attack \u2014 leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare.", "\u201cThis is a brand new salvo in the war against encryption,\u201d Mr. Opsahl said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run around that \u2014 here they come with an order to create that backdoor.\u201d", "Yet it\u2019s worth noting that even if Apple ultimately loses this case, it has plenty of technical means to close a backdoor over time. \u201cIf they\u2019re anywhere near worth their salt as engineers, I bet they\u2019re rethinking their threat model as we speak,\u201d said Jonathan Zdziarski, a digital forensic expert who studies the iPhone and its vulnerabilities.", "One relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the F.B.I. wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone \u2014 a user would have to consent to it.", "\u201cNothing is 100 percent hacker-proof,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge\u2019s order in this case required Apple to provide \u201creasonable security assistance\u201d to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone.

Apple used this \u201cmaster key\u201d to comply with court orders in drug, kidnapping, murder and terrorism cases.

So what was the problem Apple was trying to fix when it abruptly announced, in September 2014, that with its new iOS 8, \u201cApple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants\u201d?", "Some believe that allegations by Edward J. Snowden of mass surveillance of phone and Internet communications by the National Security Agency stoked fears among Apple\u2019s customers that the government was spying on them. Perhaps an iPhone that even Apple couldn\u2019t unlock might allay such fears, while also helping sales by offering more privacy and security.", "But Mr. Snowden claimed that the N.S.A. was capturing some Americans\u2019 Internet traffic from overseas, not that the agency was hacking into smartphones. Moreover, Apple\u2019s position on privacy seems at odds with its own strategy of encouraging customers to pay to store personal data on iCloud, which is also vulnerable to hackers.", "Apple partisans also argue that the company is trying to protect privacy in places like China, where governments could demand access to phones belonging to dissidents. But Apple could refuse those requests, or have China make them through the State Department, a means of insulating itself from unreasonable demands. That is often how the United States asks for assistance from overseas corporations in investigations.", "Apple and privacy advocates have framed this debate as the government wanting to \u201ccreate a back door\u201d into people\u2019s devices. But the Constitution protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. And for more than 200 years, the standard has been for law enforcement to obtain a warrant signed by a judge, based on probable cause.", "What the government is actually requesting here is that Apple restore a key that was available until late 2014.

The NBC television network, which had been in fourth place for so long (seven years) that many doubted it could be resurrected, is the leading network for the coveted 18-to-49 age group, powered by high ratings for \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Strong franchises \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d and \u201cToday\u201d have recouped the top spots in the ratings that had been threatened by scandal (Brian Williams at \u201cNightly News\u201d) and a tearful on-air departure (Ann Curry at \u201cToday\u201d).", "Universal Studios, ranked fifth out of six Hollywood studios when Comcast bought it, was the top studio last year with record-breaking revenue and three blockbusters \u2014 \u201cJurassic World,\u201d \u201cFurious 7\u201d and \u201cMinions\u201d \u2014 that topped $1 billion at the box office. The Universal theme parks, long overshadowed by Disney\u2019s, introduced the hugely popular Harry Potter attraction and have doubled revenue since 2010.", "I sat down this week with Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, in his spacious, light-filled office at NBCUniversal\u2019s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Despite the pressures of running a media giant with $28.5 billion in revenue, he looks younger than his age of 57 years. In our conversation, one thing stood out about NBCUniversal, which is true of all old-media companies: It\u2019s all about the people. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s about talent. If you get that wrong, the whole enterprise goes bad very quickly.\u201d", "Mr. Burke grew up in broadcast television \u2014 his father, Dan Burke, was a former president of CapCities ABC, and Steve Burke worked at Disney under the former chief executive Michael Eisner and then at Comcast, where he was president of the cable division, under the chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts.", "Today much of Mr. Burke\u2019s time seems to be spent courting, coaxing, stroking, cajoling \u2014 and in some cases ejecting \u2014 high-paid, high-profile stars and executives, many with outsize egos. In 2011, Mr. Burke had to replace the prominent NBC Sports head, Dick Ebersol, just four weeks before the rights to the Sochi Olympics were auctioned.", "Last year, when the NBC Nightly news anchor, Brian Williams, acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in Iraq, Mr. Burke had to put their close friendship aside and deliver an in-person ultimatum to take a six-month leave without pay. (\u201cAgonizing,\u201d Mr. Burke told me.)", "He flew to California and spent a weekend with Jay Leno to negotiate the delicate transition to Jimmy Fallon as host of the \u201cTonight\u201d show a year before Mr. Leno\u2019s contract was set to expire.", "Still, dealing with stars like Mr. Leno and Mr. Fallon can\u2019t be delegated. It was Mr. Burke who coaxed Steven Spielberg back to his production roots at Universal Studios. And some deals \u2014 NBC\u2019s multibillion-dollar, nine-year extension of \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d for example \u2014 are so big they require the presence of Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burke\u2019s boss.", "While Mr. Burke comes across as genial and low-key, he\u2019s a demanding boss. Of the 16 NBCUniversal executives Mr. Burke inherited from G.E., only four remain.", "Early in his tenure, he summoned the top 200 managers to Orlando and told them they had to do better. \u201cI had to be stern,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cPeople thought everything was fine. It wasn\u2019t. I had to paint reality. I ranked our top 10 businesses based on operating cash flow. Eight of the 10 were in the third quartile,\u201d meaning they woefully lagged their competitors. He charged them to act like owners, not renters \u2014 which means to invest for the long term, to take responsibility and to fix problems themselves \u2014 a mantra now printed on the back of every NBCUniversal business card. It\u2019s also one emphasized by Warren E. Buffett to the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr. Burke serves on the board. (Disclosure: I\u2019m a weekly contributor to CNBC, the NBCUniversal-owned business channel.)", "Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks & Resorts, has been at Universal for 46 years. \u201cThe previous mentality was, How can we take cash out of the business?\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cComcast encouraged, even mandated, reinvestment. We\u2019ve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers. Steve and Brian have said, \u2018Keep reinvesting.\u2019 The returns are stellar.\u201d", "Universal recently acquired 51 percent ownership of Universal Studios Japan, is opening another Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood and is building a new park in Beijing.", "With NBCUniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders, Mr. Burke has been able to turn his attention to the digital revolution. He said he was looking to hire digital talent, had personally interviewed 25 people in the last month and would probably establish an NBCUniversal digital headquarters in Santa Monica, also known as Silicon Beach. The company has taken $200 million stakes in the digital media companies BuzzFeed and Vox Media, and has started Seeso, a digital comedy channel.", "\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cBig media made the transition from broadcast to cable. But we were still dealing with channels. Now we have to move to digital. Digital is different. The DNA doesn\u2019t already reside in the company.\u201d", "At the same time, new media is moving onto NBCUniversal\u2019s turf. Netflix and Amazon have made big splashes with original programming, and the two emerged this year as the biggest buyers at the Sundance Film Festival.

Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Bezos and Larry Page, their respective chief executives, aren\u2019t primarily known for their people skills, let alone the ability to cultivate Hollywood celebrities and TV stars.", "Mr. Burke typically shuns the spotlight, and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains NBCUniversal\u2019s recent success and momentum. He said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclical.", "Still, it\u2019s obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal. \u201cI\u2019m a product of my dad\u2019s influence at CapCities ABC, my time at Disney, and then at Comcast,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cI developed all these theories about how to run a big media company and I finally got an opportunity to try them.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/nytnow/your-monday-briefing-academy-awards-chris-rock-donald-trump.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

The originating florist transmitted the order through the florists\u2019 wire service and received a commission for the effort; the rest of the money was passed on to the fulfilling merchant.", "Two changes upended that genteel arrangement. First, technology made it easier for customers to shop with national retailers offering a standardized product catalog, a trend that the Internet rapidly accelerated. And around the same time, the wire services began competing more directly with their merchants to capture incoming sales. In 1994, the members of FTD, which had by then been renamed Florists\u2019 Transworld Delivery, privatized their co-op and sold it to an investment fund for $150 million.", "In a typical wire service transaction today, the originating merchant receives 20 percent of the sale price, and the wire service \u2014 FTD, 1-800-Flowers and Teleflora are the industry\u2019s big three \u2014 keeps 7 percent.

You\u2019re always sort of moving toward the most challenging path, and not one that has been charted by us. We are not able to help you.\u201d But it felt like a natural path to me.", "I became an entrepreneur probably by accident.

There\u2019s an innate desire in me to pursue what I feel is right for me at the time.

So the better you are at multitasking, the more comfortable you\u2019re going to be. As I was growing up, I was involved in so many different extracurricular activities, including music and fine arts.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for example, added close to $10 billion to its $73 billion cash reserve over the last year.", "But since these companies\u2019 shares are priced high relative to their profits \u2014 that is, because investors are willing to pay more now in hopes of getting in on future growth \u2014 they become more vulnerable when there is a broader market downturn.", "\u201cThe market is doing a general sell-off, everybody is looking at things,\u201d said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund. \u201cTech stocks are pretty expensive, so they are more prone to correction.\u201d", "Take, for instance, the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon and Facebook.

For several months, I\u2019d been working as a consultant to the company, and, though this was my last day, it was the first time I\u2019d heard Costache address the team. I was excited. Costache, a 34-year-old Romanian with a dimpled, affable face, previously worked at Google, where he helped build Gmail\u2019s multiple-inbox capability and various features of Google Maps. He commands rapt attention at Spring. But on this morning, Costache didn\u2019t want to talk about software. He wanted to talk about meetings.", "Specifically, he wanted to talk about meetings as thieves: of joy, of productivity, of mental freedom. Citing a distinction first made by Paul Graham, the prominent venture capitalist, Costache told the room that some people thrive on meetings. These he called Managers, people who require a weekly calendar splotched to saturation with hourly changes of venue and cohort. But there are Makers, too \u2014 poetic souls whose well-being can be shattered by an ill-timed \u2018\u2018sync,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018brand lab\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018share-out\u2019\u2019 in a conference room. Makers can\u2019t live like Managers. They require \u2018\u2018Maker hours\u2019\u2019 \u2014 long, unspoiled afternoons to muse, contemplate the verities, build digital things and play stress-relieving games of Carcassonne. They need rich, solitary, germinative time. In Graham\u2019s formula, Makers flourish in four-hour stretches, which absolutely must \u2014 on pain of inhibiting a company\u2019s growth \u2014 be kept unblemished by meetings.", "To illustrate Graham\u2019s idea of \u2018\u2018Manager\u2019s schedule,\u2019\u2019 Costache put a riotously mosaicked Google Calendar week on the monitor. Then, as he described the needs of Makers, he summoned to his screen a stunning new Google Calendar week, awash in puffy clouds of white space. It looked like heaven.", "The room was enthusiastic. Maker hours blend childhood summer-day vagueness with a thick coat of artistic entitlement. But by the time the team dispersed, we\u2019d faced facts: We were Managers or Managers\u2019 minions, most of us, ineligible for stretches of solitude, destined for lives of video conferences and call-in codes. And indeed, only the product, design and engineering teams at Spring \u2014 today\u2019s nobility \u2014 were now slated to enjoy one full day a week of Maker time. The Maker\u2019s schedule was the privilege of the elite builders of code and apps, and the scope of makable things was not going to include casseroles, movies and corn-husk dolls anytime soon. We were to return to days chopped, like hot dogs for toddlers, into meetings.", "\u2018\u2018Meetings\u2019\u2019: The very word is enervating. With the freedom to peaceably assemble so high up on America\u2019s founding priority list, you\u2019d think that the workers of the free world would gather with more patriotic vigor, just as we speak, bear arms and pursue trials by jury. Instead, the spirit in which we come together, almost hourly in some professions, is something closer to despondency. Fifteen percent of an organization\u2019s time is spent in meetings, and every day, the transcontinental conference room known as the white-collar United States plays host to 11 million meetings, according to research collated by Fuze, the telecommunications company (which might have a stake in publicizing research designed to stoke meeting fatigue). One study mysteriously calculates that the nation wastes more than $37 billion in \u2018\u2018unproductive meetings.\u2019\u2019 The statistics seemed borne out by the several meeting-besotted companies I\u2019ve advised, and I began to wonder if the Manager\u2019s schedule suited anyone but tireless extroverts and PowerPoint connoisseurs.", "And yet we persist. Meetings must be scratching some kind of itch, if only for fellowship and a reprieve from deskbound loneliness. And what an itch: Meetings are not just considered indispensable to many professions; they are almost coextensive with them. You can make a whole career of planning, holding and attending meetings and never dare contemplate the possibility of your being exempt. They can\u2019t be avoided, but maybe they can be made bearable. I set out to see if anyone had a bright idea.", "N\naturally, the sneakered overclass \u2014 whose signature sport is to disrupt everything, from Ikea furniture to courtship \u2014 has tried its hand at hacking meetings. One such meeting hacker is Costache\u2019s inspiration, Paul Graham, a British essayist and programmer and a founder of Y Combinator, the storied Mountain View, Calif., firm that invests in and counsels start-ups.", "\u2018\u2018Don\u2019t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all?\u2019\u2019 Graham asks in his influential 2009 essay, \u2018\u2018Maker\u2019s Schedule, Manager\u2019s Schedule.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don\u2019t.\u2019\u2019 Correspondingly depressed: an apt description of most faces in the meetings I\u2019ve been to lately.", "I asked Graham, by email, if he still believed in the split between Managers and Makers that he outlined seven years ago. \u2018\u2018Of course I stand behind it,\u2019\u2019 he wrote back, in brisk, English-accented prose. \u2018\u2018I wrote that essay.\u2019\u2019 Graham then described his ideal meeting, conjuring a congenial fantasy. \u2018\u2018There are no more than four or five participants, and they know and trust one another. They go rapidly through a list of open questions while doing something else, like eating lunch. There are no presentations. No one is trying to impress anyone. They are all eager to leave and get back to work.\u2019\u2019", "Graham\u2019s minimalist approach to meetings stands in stark contrast to the one taken by Brian Robertson, the author of the notorious management method known as Holacracy, which convenes intense, expressive meetings that encourage every manner of human interaction except maybe professional ones. Robertson, who calls himself a \u2018\u2018recovering C.E.O.,\u2019\u2019 created \u2018\u2018the Holacracy Constitution\u2019\u2019 in 2009, just as skepticism about corporate structures, like the ones at the failed big banks, had turned to fever.", "Robertson\u2019s book, \u2018\u2018Holacracy: The New Management System for a Rapidly Changing World,\u2019\u2019 presents an engaging theory: minority voices need a forum to register problems others don\u2019t see, and a company should function like an \u2018\u2018evolutionary organism,\u2019\u2019 which sounds both gentle and scientific. And the argument that inflexible, hierarchical regimes are a thing of the past, poised to fall any day now to nimble teams of disruptive kids, is of course the fairy tale of the start-up economy that keeps on giving. Holacracy has been embraced by Tony Hsieh, the C.E.O. of Zappos, and Evan Williams, who helped found Twitter and then started Medium.com, the publishing platform.", "The Holacratic system is grounded in small cells of people called Circles. Each Circle holds a weekly or biweekly \u2018\u2018tactical meeting\u2019\u2019 for progress updates and a biweekly or monthly \u2018\u2018governance meeting.\u2019\u2019 A governance meeting starts with a Check-In, or rather (according to Holacracy literature) \u2018\u2018a space for every participant to call out any distraction and get present for the meeting.\u2019\u2019 Everyone speaks, round-robin style.", "Now presumably present, people \u2018\u2018triage any administrative and logistical issues,\u2019\u2019 or yell out arbitrary personal concerns. Holacracy gives this example: \u2018\u2018Joe needs to leave early.\u2019\u2019 (Abstractions are common in meeting-reform discourse, so Joe\u2019s scheduling constraints are a usefully concrete example of the actual content of modern meetings.)", "Next, anyone can propose a Tension, which is anything that concerns her. Participants are then free to ask Clarifying Questions, but these in no way can cross into Reactions (because they\u2019re next). A Facilitator has the unenviable job of policing the fine line between pure-hearted questions and bloviation disguised as interrogatives.", "At last everyone in a Holacratic meeting can yammer freely, without a referee, on their sundry reactions. \u2018\u2018Any type of reaction is welcome, from intellectual critiques to emotional outbursts.\u2019\u2019 Then comes an Amend and Clarify round, and, lest any clarification stand unmuddied for even a heartbeat, a rousing Objection round follows hard upon it. An Integration round comes next, and yet another Objection round, to address any new objections to the Clarification of the Tension and the Reactions to it that have surfaced during the Integration. Finally comes the Closing round, during which each and every person present is invited to share a closing reflection about how to improve the next meeting. After this, there is, explicitly, \u2018\u2018no discussion.\u2019\u2019 Presumably, those with still more to say should be tested for Adderall poisoning.", "From the outside, Holacratic meetings sound like cacophonous encounter groups. But putting unlikely and uninhibited interlocutors to\u00ad\u00adgether sometimes generates original ideas. It\u2019s also possible that these meetings, to which everyone raucously contributes, promote a bond of common purpose. Ancient human habits aren\u2019t hacked easily, however. As Roger Hodge re\u00adported in The New Republic last fall, em\u00adployees at Zappos, which started to go Holacratic in 2013, have balked at the changes, and some have cowered at Circle meetings. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m afraid to speak up in my Circle because I\u2019m afraid my lead link might retaliate,\u2019\u2019 as one anonymous employee complained on a message board.", "Is it possible that power structures \u2014 or intractable human dynamics \u2014 pervade even groovy egalitarian be-ins? This would seem to be the lesson of the commune movement of the 1960s, or the French Revolution. A so-called Zappos exodus started with the company\u2019s adoption of Holacracy, and 18 percent of Zappos employees have taken buyouts in the last year. (Hsieh said last month that departing employees were not so much put off by Holacracy as enticed by generous buyout packages.)", "Paul Graham\u2019s idea of tracking workers into separate spheres (vocational and liberal arts?) would seem the precise opposite of Holacracy, which purports to raze hierarchies. But in giving the right of way to special employees \u2014 either those who assert themselves as Makers, or those who feel entitled to florid self-expression in the workplace \u2014 the two approaches have something in common. Both favor artistic and even capricious temperaments. These artist-first systems end up building a new form of social stratification that is every bit as forbidding as the old one.", "M\nore recently, an even newer meeting reformer has arrived, claiming that his system preserves the camaraderie and usefulness of meetings while ditching the drudgery. This is Stewart Butterfield, a founder and the C.E.O. of Slack, the popular workplace communication tool known for its speedy circulation of gifs and other digital office diversions. On Slack, which was developed in 2013 so its founders could discuss a game they were building, participants sign into \u2018\u2018channels,\u2019\u2019 and threads unspool with surprising fluency and delight. A Slack conversation proceeds like a group text. If you like to type, riff and find links, it\u2019s stimulating, with the energy of a chat room from the Internet\u2019s early days. But Butterfield believes that Slack will also revolutionize meetings.", "As Butterfield told me through a company representative, \u2018\u2018Slack allows teams to have both asynchronous and synchronous communication across physical locations, allowing more time for thoughtful communication than a typical meeting scenario.\u2019\u2019 With \u2018\u2018asynchronous and synchronous,\u2019\u2019 Butterfield tacitly aimed to correct the widespread impression that Slack replaces email (asynchronous communication) rather than meetings (which are synchronous \u2014 participants respond to one another in real time). The full archiving of meetings on Slack, which requires a fee for some companies, also means that everyone (even Joe, leaving early) can bear witness to a meeting, as questions and decisions are recorded for all to see. Slack\u2019s tagline is \u2018\u2018Be less busy.\u2019\u2019", "With the firm support of Slack, Under Armour, the athletic apparel company, has opted to turn to the software for meetings, abolishing virtu\u00adally all in-person gatherings. This appeals to Vijay Raghunathan, vice president for engineering at Under Armour, who says that for companies with small offices and spread-out work forces, Slack is a godsend, an elastic virtual room. At the same time, when team members go too far astray into gags or wordplay during a meeting, they\u2019re directed to recreational channels. Sending people to other channels when they go off-topic is called \u2018\u2018raccooning,\u2019\u2019 and being raccooned is like being sent to supremely cool detention: Dedicated channels exist for puns, parenting, puppies and dozens more special interests.", "\u2018\u2018The company feels a lot more connected,\u2019\u2019 Raghunathan says, and this connection \u2014 rather than efficient decision-making \u2014 seems to be the primary reason for his enthusiasm about Slack. According to a survey by Slack, companies that use the tool have cut their traditional meetings by 25 percent. This sounds intrinsically good, except maybe for those who prefer to find connection in shaking hands, breaking bread or hugging in the California style \u2014 rather than standing at inattention, face in an app, to trade gifs with colleagues who might be one desk over.", "\u2018S\nlack doesn\u2019t replace meetings,\u2019\u2019 Costache objected, when I asked him, on the phone. \u2018\u2018It replaces the water cooler.\u2019\u2019 I remembered the cold-brew coffee keg in Spring\u2019s office that, judging by the voluble group often around it, seemed to have replaced the water cooler already. \u2018\u2018When saddle-makers wanted to sell saddles, they promoted riding horses. Slack sells the idea of a new kind of meeting and a new kind of workplace in order to sell Slack.\u2019\u2019", "So, I asked, what do we do about meetings? Just ban them?", "Costache thought for a minute. He aspires to turn Spring, with his partners David and Alan Tisch, into a billion-dollar business \u2014 and then return to Romania as a \u2018\u2018benevolent dictator.\u2019\u2019 You can see him pulling it off.", "\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not that radical,\u2019\u2019 he said, at last. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s too much value to an in-person meeting. When my engineering team has to decide what they want to build in the next two weeks, this is hard to do without meetings.

We start to discuss what that looked like, and give one person feedback. .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s so much volume of information \u2014 it\u2019s like a river of information.

Arid conference rooms started to fade from memory, as I pictured the Hudson, the Ganges.", "Aiming for Costache\u2019s idiom, I asked: Is it like high-bandwidth information versus a file that\u2019s compressed and thinned out?", "\u2018\u2018No. You\u2019re trying to be digital. I\u2019m going the other way. The rivers. The trickle of water. I like analog analogies. Maybe Slack is like Morse code versus in-person meetings, which are like written words. They say much more.\u2019\u2019", "M\neeting-reform crusaders rarely talk about morally urgent meetings, where the \u2018\u2018tension\u2019\u2019 is not over ergonomic desks, selling athleisure wear to seniors or even the architecture of a Python base, but over whether to shelter asylum-seekers, concede a close election or go to war.", "Such consequential meetings were nonetheless the preoccupation of Henry Martyn Robert. Robert, the original meeting hacker, was prompted to renovate meetings in the 1860s, when a discussion of abolitionist politics at a Baptist church in New Bedford, Mass., devolved into chaos. Robert, an Army engineer, was supposed to be in charge. In his private, handwritten business blog, Robert wrote: \u2018\u2018One can scarcely have had much experience in deliberative meetings of Christians without realizing that the best of men, having wills of their own, are liable to attempt to carry out their own views without paying sufficient respect to the rights of their opponents.\u2019\u2019", "Determined to rule with more authority, Robert researched and wrote the \u2018\u2018Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies,\u2019\u2019 loosely based on the practices of the United States House of Representatives. A speaker takes the Floor; an all-powerful Chairman or Chairwoman recognizes him or her; Motions are made, and then denied or sustained; Resolutions are voted on, or tabled. Hierarchies don\u2019t just creep back in, as in Holacracy. Instead, they\u2019re explicitly enforced. The 11th edition of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, as it\u2019s now called, appeared in 2011.", "A meeting run by Robert\u2019s Rules can be a joy to behold \u2014 though it\u2019s clotted by as much jargon as a Holacratic meeting. That Robert\u2019s Rules crystallized in wartime may explain their frank hostility to the chaos of human emotions \u2014 the very emotions that, at tech companies, enjoy full flower. Each participant in Robert\u2019s Rules becomes a binary element: a switch, only ever on or off, pro or con. All the minds in the room, having accepted their role as machine code, come together to approximate an algorithmic organism. No Makers, no rock stars, no special snowflakes of any kind are allowed creative expression, any more than they\u2019d be allowed creativity on an election ballot. Robert\u2019s Rules \u2014 still in use in volunteer firehouses, City Councils, school boards and elsewhere \u2014 win strong partisans for the way participants fall in line, don\u2019t filibuster and work single-mindedly and democratically toward a common goal.", "Order is a noble aspiration, but I still wanted permission to be alone. I went back to Paul Graham\u2019s email, still seeking a guru who, under any pretext at all, would abolish from the workweek all but friendly gatherings and urgent meetings (to be run by Robert\u2019s Rules) in favor of long, fertile hours of solitude. Though it seemed unlikely that I\u2019d be one of the lucky few who could test out of Manager time, I was just trying to merit a spare four hours to make some brownies. \u2018\u2018For the purposes of the essay,\u2019\u2019 Graham had clarified, \u2018\u2018Makers are people who need big chunks of time to do their work, and Managers are everyone else.\u2019\u2019", "The French Revolutionary in me balked. I wanted to snap back: It sounds as if Managers are people who aren\u2019t allowed big chunks of time to do their work \u2014 whose work isn\u2019t considered important and manly enough to be given room to breathe. And then maybe it\u2019s the Makers who are everyone else. In a thoroughly wired universe, the coveted commodity is freedom from the nets upon nets that catch, connect and entangle us. So no wonder it\u2019s only the privileged few who get that freedom.", "Of course, liberation from \u2018\u2018connection\u2019\u2019 is a fantasy that predates Wi-Fi. What\u2019s so bad about meetings, after all? At bottom, they are nothing but time with your fellows.

By all reports Cedr\u00f3n was an excellent place to blow some cash.", "That turned out to be half right. I ordered the meal-course-size version of locro, an Ecuadorean potato soup presented with avocado, fried corn, cheese, pork cracklings and six house-made salsas, all on the side. Swirling it all together, the soup was a circus of flavors and textures \u2014 a simple classic raised several levels. The service was perfect, if annoyingly deferential.", "Just one problem: It was a total bargain. The soup was $10, which included not just an amuse-bouche, bread and sparkling water, but also (gasp) tax and service. Just to run up the bill, I ordered a $9.50 dessert trio of alfajores, coconut panna cotta and a dollop of spiced ganache, then added an extra 10 percent to the service.", "The next afternoon, I met Juan Carlos Guerra, my $40-an-hour tour guide.

At the old-fashioned Santa Clara Market, he plucked a yellowish ovoid fruit called a taxo off a fruit stand and cracked it open to reveal countless seeds enveloped in bright orange globules, like alien eggs. A relative of the passion fruit, but sweet rather than sour, it is my new favorite tropical treat.", "And he pointed out a lot that I would have missed on my own \u2014 candles made of animal fat that he used on his children as a treatment for raw noses, and boroj\u00f3, a fruit added to drinks as an aphrodisiac (\u201cIt\u2019s why there are so many children in Ecuador\u201d). As he took me by the stands selling medicinal herbs, he mentioned that the women working there perform \u201ccleansings\u201d for $5.", "My frugal instinct took over, though I knew a fancier $49 version could be arranged through my hotel. I was taken by a young woman named Laura to a rundown back area of the market, led into a narrow tile stall decorated with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe and told to strip to my underwear. Then she had at me, slapping my entire body, front and back, with a loose bouquet of herbs and plants, most notably stinging nettles.

Tired of being shuttled around, I decided to take a 25-cent Trolebus to a $60 seven-course tasting menu. The trolley ran efficiently, though it was packed and I didn\u2019t get a seat.

But the service was, again, annoyingly deferential, and when you\u2019ve been made to wait alone at the bar for almost an hour, nothing tastes as good as it might otherwise.", "Hoping to explore the Avenue of the Volcanoes between Quito and Cuenca, I went with the ultimate luxury: hiring someone to take care of literally all my plans and be with me every step of the way.", "That someone was Antonio Jaramillo, assigned to me by the high-end tour operator Tropic, whose slogan, \u201cCreating high-end personalized and sustainable experiences for the discerning traveler,\u201d is so good it deserves a slogan of its own. (\u201cMore buzzwords than your average catchphrase\u201d?) I had negotiated a three-day, two-night tour from Quito to Cuenca, for $1,335. That would include transport in a spiffy S.U.V., lodging, all activities and most meals.", "To avoid being further spoon-fed, I decided to seize control of Antonio\u2019s tour, telling him I\u2019d be willing to stop anywhere, endure discomfort, eat by the side of the road \u2014 and that we would be doing this all in Spanish. He acquiesced. (Of course, it was his job to acquiesce.)", "We were to get as close as we could to Cotopaxi, Ecuador\u2019s most famous volcano. The Cotopaxi National Park was closed because of the volcano\u2019s recent activity, which meant a jaunt on horseback from the Hacienda el Porvenir ranch into the p\u00e1ramo, a treeless alpine tundra with yellowish-green grasses that my horse, Carb\u00f3n, found irresistible.", "Alas, an overcast day partly obscured what looked on their website like a gorgeous view.

We stopped at a town called Latacunga and ducked into a hole-in-the-wall restaurant for chugchucaras, a local dish of deep-fried pork served with a number of side dishes \u2014 more culturally charming than culinarily compelling. Then we veered away from our route along the Pan-American Highway into Salcedo, famous for its ice-cream-on-a-stick, specifically a version in which four layers of ice cream form the shape of a volcano. The town\u2019s many ice cream shops were empty; Antonio explained that the new highway had decimated a longstanding pit stop tradition. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the traffic jams that formed, especially on weekends,\u201d he said.", "It had been a packed day, but by the time we pulled into our hotel, I was, curiously, not exhausted. I had sat in an air-conditioned S.U.V. all day and been driven around, told what to do. I had probably learned more about Ecuadorean ecosystems, volcanoes and flower production than I ever would have on my own, but the convenience had been isolating.", "The next day\u2019s highlight was the ultra-touristy but very impressive switchback train ride down near-vertical Nariz del Diablo mountain, the trickiest point in a route that in 1908 finally connected Quito with the Ecuadorean coast. The stop included an indigenous dance performance, narrated in English by a group member named Jos\u00e9, who told me afterward that he had toiled for nine years in London restaurants before returning to his village.", "Antonio was great, but the following day I was greatly relieved to board a rattling public bus and head (I hoped) to Cuenca\u2019s long-distance bus station for some real adventure. Relieved to be uncomfortable, relieved to be nervous I might be on the wrong bus.", "I took a bus to Saraguro, home to the indigenous people of the same name \u2014 which I had read was known for its community tourism efforts. Its square was out of a tourist brochure, full of flowers and well-tended bushes, with elegant U-shaped benches and a church on one end that filled for Mass with men and women in traditional black clothing \u2014 a contrast to more brightly colored shawls and skirts on women of other groups I had seen from Antonio\u2019s S.U.V.", "I had called in advance to arrange a village homestay through Saraurku, a local organization that said I might have to stay in the affiliated hostel, Hostal Achik Wasi, the first night (for $20) but would place me elsewhere the next morning.", "I had to bug the hostel staff several times about the homestay \u2014 they said the Saraur-ku director was away \u2014 but the next morning they finally collected $35 from me and sent me in a pickup truck (for $2 extra) to the village of \u00d1amar\u00edn and the Spanish-speaking home of Mar\u00eda Delfina Cartuche and Marcelo Cirilo Nastacuaz. On a slope in full view of Mount Puglia, their solid if haphazardly designed house of tile, brick and concrete block was set amid a little rural paradise. Trees bore oranges, peaches, tree tomatoes, greengage plums, avocados and figs; countless flowers bloomed and one purple-flowered quinoa plant shot straight up from the soil. Squawking hens wore peculiar outfits: white and blue plastic bags that, the family told me, prevented eagles from swooping down and carrying them away.", "A whole room of the house \u2014 really kind of a separate wing \u2014 had been set aside for visitors, furnished with rustic beds made by Marcelo and covered in thick, coffee-colored blankets made by Mar\u00eda with wool from sheep they kept up the hill behind the house. (Mar\u00eda also sells $10 wool hats and scarves, all colored with natural dyes.)", "A bit later, the family\u2019s youngest member, 6-year-old Genesis, handed me a leaf to sniff from plants she had picked from the garden. \u201cCedr\u00f3n,\u201d she said \u2014 lemon verbena, and, I recalled, the name of the restaurant at Casa Gangotena. \u201cIt\u2019s for my mother\u2019s horchata.\u201d I sampled the bright red herbal brew later that afternoon; it was warm and welcoming \u2014 and a more pleasant presentation than the agua de frescos I had shoved in my face at the Quito hotel.", "A smart, delightful couple, Mar\u00eda and Marcelo had met in Quito and moved back to \u00d1amar\u00edn to raise their four children. Their lifestyle was a curious kosher-Mormon-hipster amalgam: They do not drink alcohol or coffee, avoid dairy, don\u2019t touch pork or shellfish, refuse to buy commercial eggs and build their own furniture.", "But they lived in a truly traditional world. On a tour of the village, Mar\u00eda explained to me how the indigenous justice system \u2014 enshrined in the Ecuadorean constitution \u2014 worked. When issues came up, long meetings were held in the community center that could last into the early hours, as women hand-spun wool into yarn.", "She recounted how they had even brought down a cattle-rustling ring in the region, eventually punishing the accused with \u201ccleansings\u201d much harsher than the one I had had in Quito \u2014 \u201cwith a much stronger kind of nettle\u201d she said, and drenched in the freezing water from a large waterfall. \u201cIt\u2019s not torture,\u201d she responded, when I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the police that torture people, that hit people. We gave them a cleansing, a purification.\u201d", "Shortly before I left, when I told her I was a writer and might write about them, she rushed to get a business card.

Its odd name caught my eye, as did the way it seemed to be floating in the middle of nowhere, no roads marked anywhere around it. A place that Google Maps could not find its way to was a place for me. (I then found a 2008 article from Ecuador\u2019s El Tiempo newspaper that sealed the deal. Its headline: \u201cQuingeo, a Solitary, Astonishing Place.\u201d)", "The one bus from the terminal to Quingeo that day had already left, I was told, but I could take a taxi to the bus stop \u201cacross from Colegio Garaicoa,\u201d and wait there.

She showed me to a room in one of the square\u2019s more beautiful homes, painted a mustardy yellow with a second-story balcony held up with chocolate brown wooden beams.

Her son, Patricio \u2014 a schoolteacher in Cuenca during the week, owner of a small market on the square on weekends and a big Beatles fan \u2014 later invited me to sit outside with him to drink Zhumir, an Ecuadorean sugar cane spirit, and listen to Paul McCartney. Soon after, we adjourned to a wooden shack labeled BAR, run by his son, Lennon.", "The next morning, vendors set up a modest market around one half of the plaza; I stopped at one stall run by Pap\u00e1 Morales restaurant (which remained closed) and enjoyed a $2 bowl of encebollado, the restorative Ecuadorean fish soup.

To me, it does. But perhaps I simply never learned to travel luxuriously.

Instead of riding roller coasters, she wandered around searching for the group \u2014 eventually locating them four hours later watching fireworks.", "\u201cI wanted to throw my phone on the ground by the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Teme\u00f1a said.", "Many consumers can relate. Despite the leaps forward in mobile phone technology with crisp, clear screens and faster chips, batteries have made only sluggish progress. That has propelled a desire for longer battery life to the top of the list of factors considered by consumers when they purchase smartphones, according to a 2014 survey by the research firm IDC.", "So why is battery technology still underwhelming? Plenty of companies have been developing smarter battery technology for years, including methods to increase battery capacity tenfold or charge devices by pulling energy from the air. But lithium ion, the technology that most mainstream batteries are based on, is low cost and easily reproducible while being safe \u2014 so we\u2019ll be stuck with it for the foreseeable future, said Charlie Quong, an executive at Mophie, a battery accessory maker, in an interview.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of investments on all fronts for improving the technology above and beyond that, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that hitting any kind of mass market for several years out,\u201d Mr. Quong said. In general, lithium ion improves about 10 percent a year in terms of the amount of energy that can be stored in a given space, which is partly why consumers perceive batteries as being far behind other technologies.", "With that backdrop in mind, we teamed up with the Wirecutter, a product recommendations website, to run an array of tests to determine best and worst practices for preserving battery life on smartphones. For those who still need extra juice, the Wirecutter also picked some external battery products.", "The results showed that some conventional beliefs about extending battery life \u2014 like turning off Wi-Fi or shutting down all your phone\u2019s apps \u2014 produced negligible or even harmful results. The Wirecutter also found plenty of helpful practices to get more use out of your battery, like playing music stored directly on the device (instead of streaming it) or tweaking email configurations.", "The Wirecutter tested a range of recent Apple and Android smartphones with the latest operating systems in tightly controlled environments. Your phone\u2019s results will vary depending on the phone model, cellular carrier, location and other factors, but the general results should hold. Here are eight tips and seven myths busted by our findings:", "A smartphone\u2019s screen consumes more energy than any other component, so the easiest way to cut down battery drain is to reduce your screen brightness. In an hourlong test, an iPhone 6s used 54 percent less battery power with the screen brightness at minimum as compared with maximum brightness. An Android test phone used 30 percent less.", "But it\u2019s tough to use a dim screen in bright environments, so most phones offer an auto-brightness mode that automatically adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness based on ambient light. The Wirecutter found that enabling auto-brightness saved a good amount of battery life.", "When browsing the web, your smartphone also burns through power when it downloads mobile ads on websites. Installing an ad blocker will greatly extend battery life.", "The Wirecutter ran a test that cycled through a list of websites for two hours over a Wi-Fi connection. Safari on an iPhone 6s used 18 percent of a full battery; Chrome on a Moto X Pure Android phone used 22 percent. Installing the 1Blocker ad blocker on the iPhone reduced battery usage for the same test to only 9 percent of a full battery; on an Android phone, using the Ghostery Privacy Browser, which blocks ads, used only 8 percent of the battery.", "Email can have a major impact on battery life if you have multiple email accounts and receive lots of email. Your smartphone can update your email automatically using a technology called push, which brings new messages to your phone the instant they are transmitted. Push can be a power hog because it requires your phone to constantly listen for new messages, so if you get a lot of email, there\u2019s a good chance your phone is using lots of energy.", "The Wirecutter tested an iPhone 6s Plus configured with three email accounts, receiving a total of 20 to 30 messages an hour. In these tests, having push active over the course of a day caused Mail to account for 5 to 10 percent of the phone\u2019s overall battery use.", "To save energy, most phones can be configured to instead check for (or \u201cfetch\u201d) emails on a schedule \u2014 say, every 30 minutes \u2014 or only when you manually tell your email app to refresh.", "The next tip may come as unwelcome news. Nowadays, online streaming is the most popular way to listen to music, with services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music \u2014 but this method guzzles lots of battery power. In the Wirecutter\u2019s tests, streaming music over a Wi-Fi connection for two hours used 10 percent of an iPhone\u2019s battery reserves; streaming the same music stored directly on a device over two hours consumed only 5 percent.", "Fortunately, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music still let you listen to songs the old-school way: by storing the music right on your device.", "You may have noticed that when you\u2019re in a place without good Wi-Fi or cellular coverage, your phone\u2019s battery seems to drain much more quickly. That\u2019s because the phone uses energy searching for a good signal and, if the signal is very weak, trying to get a better connection.", "To conserve battery life, disable the phone\u2019s wireless circuitry. Airplane Mode, an option that will turn off all wireless features, is a quick and easy solution in areas with poor reception.", "Alternatively, you can disable (in your phone\u2019s settings) a single wireless feature. For example, if you have terrible wireless carrier coverage in your office, but Wi-Fi is great, disabling cellular connectivity while there will keep the phone from wasting energy trying to get a cellular connection while still letting you connect to the Internet over Wi-Fi.", "Consumers can get even better results with a bit of sleuthing. Both the iPhone and Android systems provide a simple way to see which apps are using a lot of battery power. For iPhones and Android phones, open the Settings app and in the Battery menu, there are sorted lists of apps that are using the most energy.", "On the iPhone\u2019s battery usage screen, tap the clock button to reveal information about how much of your battery life each app is consuming when you\u2019re actively using the app (\u201cscreen\u201d) compared with when you\u2019re not (\u201cbackgd\u201d). On Android, the most useful information are the timers for \u201cCPU total\u201d and \u201cCPU foreground.\u201d Foreground is how much time you had the app open; subtract \u201cforeground\u201d from \u201ctotal,\u201d and you\u2019ll know how much time the app has been busy in the background.", "Be on the lookout for apps that are active for extended periods in the background and are using a lot of battery power. Examples include an email app that spends lots of time checking for new messages even when your phone is asleep, a news reader that updates articles in the background or a fitness app that constantly monitors your location.", "If you find apps using up lots of energy in the background, disable their background activities. On an iPhone, go to the Settings app, tap General and then Background App Refresh and disable the background activities for any apps. On Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Data Usage, choose an app, then select \u201cRestrict Background Data\u201d for background data usage.", "Watch out for apps that track your location. Your phone\u2019s GPS circuitry, which determines your geographic location for mapping and fitness features, consumes a lot of battery power. A run-tracking program that monitors your precise location for the duration of an hourlong run will lower your battery level.", "If a location-based app is using a lot of power, especially in the background, there\u2019s a good chance the app is using GPS, Wi-Fi and the phone\u2019s sensors frequently. You can decide whether to disable location features for it (either via your phone\u2019s Location Services settings, or by changing settings in the app itself). On an iPhone, you can disable the app\u2019s ability to track your location by going to Privacy menu and Location Services.", "To disable location tracking on Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Apps, choose an app and select \u201cPermissions,\u201d then tap to disable Location permission.", "Both Apple and Google recommend disabling push notifications, which are essentially app alerts, to conserve battery life. Notifications require regular communication with notification servers, and each notification causes your phone to wake up for a few seconds, including turning on the screen, to show you a message and give you a chance to act on it.", "In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing, receiving a few dozen notifications over the course of an hour didn\u2019t noticeably affect battery usage. But if you get a lot of notifications each day, that energy use can add up. If a particular app or service (say, Twitter or your email client) is constantly producing notifications, consider disabling notifications for that app.", "On an iPhone, open the Settings app, tap Notifications, tap the app name and disable Allow Notifications. On Android, disable notification in an app\u2019s settings menu, or long-press the notification itself and select the \u201ci\u201d icon. This will send you to that app\u2019s App Notifications settings, where you can block all notifications.", "There is plenty of inaccurate conventional wisdom about methods to prolong battery life. Let\u2019s start with one of the worst \u201ctips\u201d: Closing (or force-quitting, as it\u2019s commonly called) apps you are not currently using. The theory is that apps running in the background are using your phone\u2019s components, so quitting them will save energy.", "While that may be true on a computer, smartphones are designed differently: Once an app is no longer in the foreground \u2014 meaning you are not actively using it \u2014 most or all of its processes are frozen. In other words, while an app may still be loaded in a phone\u2019s memory, it probably is not doing much in the background to drain your battery.", "Finally, quitting apps actually has drawbacks: When you force-quit an app, all of its code can be purged from your phone\u2019s RAM, which means that the next time you open the app, the phone has to reload all of that code. That, of course, requires energy.", "A common suggestion for extending battery life is to disable Wi-Fi. However, if you\u2019re in range of a strong Wi-Fi signal, your phone uses less energy to connect to the Internet with a Wi-Fi connection than a cellular one. If you regularly use apps that rely on your location, having Wi-Fi enabled helps your phone determine its location without having to rely solely on power-hungry GPS features, so it actually helps a battery last longer.", "An exception is when you\u2019re at the edges of a Wi-Fi network, where your phone is struggling to get a good connection, and you have a good cellular data connection. But in most cases, you\u2019re usually better off keeping Wi-Fi enabled.", "Many apps that use your location do so only intermittently. Even using the Maps app for short navigation sessions doesn\u2019t use more than a few percent of your battery\u2019s capacity \u2014 and having the phone\u2019s screen continually on is a big part of why navigation uses a lot of power.", "In other words, don\u2019t disable all of your phone\u2019s location-based features just to extend your battery life. You won\u2019t see a big jump in use time, but you may end up disabling \u2014 and subsequently missing \u2014 useful features. Instead, check (using the tips above) to see if any of apps consuming the most battery life also track your location. If so, and if you don\u2019t need that location tracking, consider disabling it for those apps.", "Many people, and even smartphone vendors such as Apple, claim that using Wi-Fi for wireless data consumes less power than using a cellular signal, so you should use Wi-Fi whenever you can. However, the Wirecutter\u2019s testing found this isn\u2019t always the case.", "In testing in a location where both Wi-Fi and cellular LTE signals were strong, an hour of browsing over Wi-Fi used roughly the same amount of battery power as an hour using LTE on an iPhone. On a Motorola Android phone, LTE used only 2 to 3 percent more power than Wi-Fi.", "In other words, as long as you have a good signal, you probably won\u2019t see a huge difference between Wi-Fi and cellular data, and it\u2019s probably not worth the hassle of switching between the two.", "Both iPhones and Android phones include a hands-free feature for summoning their virtual assistants by speaking voice commands. You can just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to the iPhone or \u201cO.K. Google\u201d and then speak your request or command. While convenient, this feature requires your phone to constantly listen for that special phrase, which uses some power.", "Yet if you have one of the phones that supports this feature, disabling it won\u2019t conserve much battery life. In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing with an iPhone 6s Plus and a Nexus 6P, there was a negligible difference in battery usage between having the always-on virtual assistant enabled or disabled over a two-hour period.", "Using Siri or O.K. Google uses some energy, so if your phone\u2019s battery is getting low, you should probably stop asking the phone question after question during your commute. But just having the feature enabled isn\u2019t worth worrying about \u2014 and it can be quite convenient.", "A common warning around the Internet is that you should use only the charger that came with your phone, otherwise you could damage your phone\u2019s battery. In reality, the phone itself contains all the circuitry responsible for charging its battery. The AC adapter (as it\u2019s more accurately known) simply converts the AC current from a wall outlet into low-voltage, low-amperage DC current that it provides via a USB port. This is why you can also charge your phone using the USB port on a computer, a USB battery pack or a charger in your car \u2014 the phone is designed to allow it to charge from a variety of power sources that can produce a wide range of current.", "Finally, you may see warnings that a cheap third-party charger could damage your phone. There\u2019s some truth here: Many chargers \u2014 especially budget models sold online, or even at your local shopping mall kiosk \u2014 are poorly made, or use low-quality components. A poorly made charger can not only damage your phone, but could also hurt you by exposing you to dangerous currents. So if you\u2019re replacing your phone\u2019s AC adapter, or buying an extra, stick with a reputable vendor.", "For many years, devices that used rechargeable batteries required \u201cconditioning\u201d or \u201ccalibrating,\u201d a procedure that prevented the battery from forgetting how much capacity it actually had. Today\u2019s smartphone batteries no longer suffer from this issue.", "What can happen, however, is that the phone itself loses track of how much capacity its battery has: Every battery gradually loses capacity over time as you use and recharge it, and the phone\u2019s software isn\u2019t always good at accounting for this capacity change. By periodically (once every couple of months) fully charging the phone and then using it until it dies, your phone\u2019s software will determine the battery\u2019s current capacity and thus let the phone better estimate how long it will last on a charge. In other words, the battery won\u2019t last any longer, but the phone\u2019s battery meter will be more accurate. If you find that your phone claims you have 80 percent of a charge left, but it dies a few hours later, you should try this procedure.", "If you have tried all the above and still struggle to get through the day with your battery, consider buying an external battery. These accessories \u2014 which can take the form of a bulky case with a built-in battery that you wear on the phone, or a separate battery pack that connects to your phone with a cable \u2014 can provide power to last an additional few hours at the end of the day, or even to fully charge your phone\u2019s battery.", "The Wirecutter tested more than 100 external batteries for dozens of hours to pick a few favorites. Its favorite battery case for the iPhone 6 and 6s is Anker\u2019s Ultra Slim Extended Battery Case, which has enough power to fully charge a dead iPhone and then some, more than doubling the phone\u2019s battery life. For larger iPhones \u2014 the 6 Plus and 6s Plus \u2014 the Wirecutter prefers Tylt\u2019s Energi Sliding Power Case because the case\u2019s two-piece design makes it appealing.", "For Android phones, an external battery pack is a good option. The AmazonBasics Portable Power Bank with Micro USB Cable 2,000 mAh is the best pack the Wirecutter tested that will fit in your pocket with your phone, and it\u2019s less than $10. A great battery pack for the iPhone is the $29 TravelCard, which is almost thin enough to fit in a wallet \u2014 with a built-in Lightning-connector cable to charge your phone.", "For days of smartphone power, the Anker PowerCore 15600 is the Wirecutter\u2019s pick if you need to charge a phone repeatedly or keep a full-size tablet and phone topped up through a busy week. It has enough available power to charge a typical smartphone five times or to fill a large tablet such as an iPad Air almost twice \u2014 for under $40.", "After her stressful day at Disneyland, Ms. Teme\u00f1a bought an external Amazon battery pack. She said the pack could fully charge her phone six times, but it wasn\u2019t ideal because of its bulk. Ultimately, she wishes her iPhone had a better battery.", "\u201cI don\u2019t understand why a battery wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with all the other advances they\u2019re putting into phones now,\u201d she said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/technology/gearing-up-for-the-cloud-att-tells-its-workers-adapt-or-else.html": ["DALLAS \u2014 Thirty-four years ago, Kevin Stephenson got his younger brother, Randall, a job with the telephone company.", "Kevin, then 23, and Randall, 22, had tried selling cattle feed with their father near their home in Moore, Okla., but that didn\u2019t pan out. Kevin was hired to do accounting at a local Southwestern Bell office. Randall, who was in college, needed a bit more help. \u201cHe had trouble getting hired,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI talked to someone I knew in personnel.\u201d", "The brothers had different tastes. Kevin liked to be outside, and now, at 57 years old, he works in Norman, Okla., fixing the decades-old copper lines that still connect to landline telephones in most homes as well as to modern Internet conduits like high-speed fiber optics. Randall liked numbers and stayed indoors, rising through the management ranks.", "Southwestern Bell became SBC Communications and took on the old AT&T name through an acquisition in 2005. By 2007, Randall was running the place.", "Today, Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is trying to reinvent the company so it can compete more deftly. Not that long ago it had to fight for business with other phone companies and cellular carriers. Then the Internet and cloud computing came along, and AT&T found itself in a tussle with a whole bunch of companies.", "AT&T\u2019s competitors are not just Verizon and Sprint, but also tech giants like Amazon and Google. For the company to survive in this environment, Mr. Stephenson needs to retrain its 280,000 employees so they can improve their coding skills, or learn them, and make quick business decisions based on a fire hose of data coming into the company.", "In an ambitious corporate education program that started about two years ago, he is offering to pay for classes (at least some of them) to help employees modernize their skills. But there\u2019s a catch: They have to take these classes on their own time and sometimes pay for them with their own money.", "To Mr. Stephenson, it should be an easy choice for most workers: Learn new skills or find your career choices are very limited.", "\u201cThere is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop,\u201d he said in a recent interview at AT&T\u2019s Dallas headquarters. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning, he added, \u201cwill obsolete themselves with the technology.\u201d", "Kevin? He admires his younger brother, but he is among the many AT&T lifers who are not that keen to participate in this reinvention of old Ma Bell. \u201cI\u2019m riding the copper train all the way down,\u201d he said.", "He talks about the changes with obvious affection for both his brother and his longtime employer. In interviews, many veteran AT&T employees around the country showed a surprising amount of emotion toward a company that has been broken up, rebuilt and reinvented several times.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is particularly eager to rebuild and reinvent themselves for a new AT&T. Even if it means, as Randall put it, obsolescence.", "Companies\u2019 reinventing themselves to compete with more nimble competitors is hardly a new story. Many have tried, and a handful have even succeeded. Mr. Stephenson wants AT&T to be among those few.", "In the last three years, he has spent more than $20 billion annually, primarily on building the digital business. DirecTV was acquired in a $63 billion deal last year, and several billion more was spent to buy wireless businesses in Mexico and the United States. Even for a company with $147 billion in 2015 revenue and over $400 billion in assets built up over more than a century, it\u2019s a lot.", "By 2020, Mr. Stephenson hopes AT&T will be well into its transformation into a computing company that manages all sorts of digital things: phones, satellite television and huge volumes of data, all sorted through software managed in the cloud.", "That can\u2019t happen unless at least some of his work force is retrained to deal with the technology. It\u2019s not a young group: The average tenure at AT&T is 12 years, or 22 years if you don\u2019t count the people working in call centers. And many employees don\u2019t have experience writing open-source software or casually analyzing terabytes of customer data.", "If you don\u2019t develop the new skills, you won\u2019t be fired \u2014 at least AT&T won\u2019t say as much \u2014 but you won\u2019t have much of a future. The company isn\u2019t too worried about people leaving, since executives estimate that eventually AT&T could get by with one-third fewer workers.", "Mr. Stephenson declined to project how many workers he might have by 2020, when the cloud-based system is supposed to be fully in place. One thing about cutting people in an aging work force, he noted, is that \u201cdemography is on our side.\u201d Other senior executives say shrinking the work force by 30 percent is not out of the question.", "Maybe so, but count Kevin among the skeptics of how fast AT&T\u2019s transformation will happen.", "\u201cI\u2019m proud of my brother,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not going to get rid of this stuff as fast as he thinks.\u201d", "Long ago, a phone system created wire lines between callers, and operators moved plugs in their switchboards to connect people.

Hiring managers, he thought, were too often swayed by the name of a fancy college on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. To try to address the problem, he created a software company called GapJumpers, working with employers to create challenges for applicants that mimicked what people would do on the job. Companies using GapJumpers wouldn\u2019t see candidates\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, just their names, photographs and test results. In theory, this process would shift employers\u2019 focus from r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to skills. Then, two years ago, he came across an idea that caused him to rethink his business.", "In the 1970s, symphony orchestras were still made up almost exclusively of white men \u2014 directors claimed they were the only ones qualified. Around that time, many began to use a new method of hiring musicians: blind auditions. Musicians auditioned behind screens so the judges couldn\u2019t see what they looked like, and walked on carpeted floors so the judges couldn\u2019t determine if they were women or men \u2014 the women often wore heels. The Boston Symphony Orchestra pioneered the practice in 1952, and more orchestras began using it after a high-profile racial discrimination case was brought by two black musicians against the New York Philharmonic in 1969. Researchers from Harvard and Prince\u00adton took notice and studied the results; they found that blind auditions increased the likelihood that a woman would be hired by between 25 and 46 percent. In fact, with blind auditions, women became slightly more likely to be hired than men. Confident that they would be treated fairly, female musicians started applying in greater numbers.", "GapJumpers was already working from the insight that, like musicians, coders created something that could easily be evaluated by their peers. But Iyer realized from the study that employers didn\u2019t need to see prospective employees\u2019 faces, or even learn their names. Eventually, they would have to meet, but by keeping the process blind for as long as possible, Iyer figured he could help reduce bias. And, besides, he was already working with the best tool for masking identity in the history of humankind: software.", "For anyone, finding a job in Silicon Valley can be a mysterious and befuddling process. Google used to routinely conduct 25 interviews over the course of six months before settling on a candidate. They also asked all applicants, no matter their age, for their SAT scores. And the questions they posed to interviewees were strange enough to warrant pop-culture parody. In \u2018\u2018The Internship,\u2019\u2019 Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson\u2019s characters are asked during a Google interview: \u2018\u2018You\u2019re shrunken down to the size of nickels and dropped to the bottom of a blender. What do you do?\u2019\u2019", "Google likes to hire people who possess something it calls Googleyness, an amorphous measure of how well they will fit in. It\u2019s not easily defined, but it includes things like enjoying fun and \u2014 appropriately \u2014 coping well with ambiguity. This emphasis on \u2018\u2018culture fit\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t unique to Google; it seems to have spread across industries as work hours have lengthened and eaten into our leisure time, and as offices, especially in the valley, have further blurred the distinction between work and leisure. What a candidate might be like in a conference room at 10 a.m. has become almost as important as what he\u2019d be like playing Ping-Pong after a few beers from the office kegerator.", "It should come as no surprise that hiring for culture fit can be self-reinforcing. In 2014, Google for the first time released data on the makeup of its employees, revealing the sort of work force its recruitment strategy yields. Only 2 percent of its employees were black, and 3 percent were Latino. Seventy percent were men. And, as at most tech companies, Asian-Americans made up a disproportionately large share of employees. Google has claimed, like many companies across all industries, that the problem is not entirely of its own making, but far upstream: There simply aren\u2019t enough qualified women and minority candidates applying.", "There is some truth to this. The \u2018\u2018pipeline\u2019\u2019 of qualified applicants is not representative of society as a whole \u2014 in many fields, there are disproportionately more white and Asian people graduating with elite degrees. But that still does not account for the sizable gap between the number of minor\u00adity students graduating with the qualifications to work in highly skilled jobs and the number who are hired. Nearly 9 percent of graduates from the top 25 undergraduate computer science programs come from underrepresented minorities (black, Latino and Native American), according to Education Department data analyzed by Maya A. Beasley, associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut. But those groups make up less than 5 percent of the work forces at Google and other prominent tech companies. Underrepresented minorities account for 16 percent of law-school graduates, Beasley found; but, according to the National Association for Law Placement, they make up just 8 percent of newly hired associates and 4 percent of partners.", "\u2018\u2018The pipeline argument can be wiped out with basic statistics,\u2019\u2019 Beasley says. \u2018\u2018The number of people graduating from top schools is just enormous, so you have to think, What could these companies do wrong to not get them?\u2019\u2019", "One answer is that companies rely too much on flawed human judgment when they recruit. Despite the digitization of job listings, human-resources departments have not changed much from the analog days. And, according to decades of research on the topic, humans just aren\u2019t that good at hiring. A study of top banking, law and consulting firms found that similarities in things like leisure activities and personality were the most important factor in their evaluation of candidates. Hiring now resembles choosing a romantic partner more than an employee, says Lauren Rivera, an associate professor of management and sociology at Northwestern and the author of the study.", "This tendency can be particularly pernicious when it comes to race, as a landmark 2003 study showed. Researchers from the University of Chi\u00adcago and M.I.T. created phony r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with the same qualifications, giving half of them black-sounding names (Lakisha Washington and Jamal Jones) and the other half white-sounding names (Emily Walsh and Greg Baker). Those with \u2018\u2018white\u2019\u2019 names received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than those with \u2018\u2018black\u2019\u2019 names. A 2015 study followed up on this, and found that candidates with black-sounding names from elite universities did only as well as those with white-sounding names from less-selective schools. Other recent studies have found that applicants who are Muslims, ex-offenders, mothers, disabled or gay are also less likely to be called back, even if the employers swear they want a diverse work force and believe they\u2019re doing everything in their power to create one.", "To try to combat these biases, Iyer and his co-founder Petar Vujosevic devised a way to screen job applicants without showing employers any biographical information. GapJumpers and its client create a list of skills required for the job, then design a relevant test that the applicant completes online. The first piece of information the hiring company sees is applicants\u2019 scores, and, based on those, it selects candidates to interview. Only then does it see their names and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.", "GapJumpers has conducted more than 1,400 auditions for companies like Bloomberg and Dolby Laboratories. According to the company\u2019s numbers, using conventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening, about a fifth of applicants who were not white, male, able-bodied people from elite schools made it to a first-round interview. Using blind auditions, 60 percent did. \u2018\u2018Employers say, \u2018If you can show me your skills in this role, I am willing to interview you, regardless of where you come from, what you look like or who you are,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Iyer says. A new study from Harvard Business School backs up this line of reasoning. It found that when service-sector employers used a job test, they hired workers who tended to stay at the job longer \u2014 indicating that they were a better match. When employers overruled the test results to hire someone for more subjective reasons, the employees were significantly more likely to quit or be fired.", "GapJumpers is just one of a handful of Silicon Valley start-ups peddling technological fixes for hiring practices. Gild, for example, has proprietary software that finds candidates based on code they have published online and strips out biographical information before recommending them to employers. Textio, a start-up with clients that include Starbucks and Microsoft, scans job listings and highlights language that data have shown to turn off certain candidates. For example, saying a job requires a \u2018\u2018rock star\u2019\u2019 will draw more men than women; saying it requires a \u2018\u2018passion for learning\u2019\u2019 attracts more women than men.

Between the show and its audience, however, The Talk was the acknowledgment that \u201cblack-ish\u201d is about a family in which that conversation was eventually going to happen.", "Wednesday\u2019s remarkable episode, \u201cHope,\u201d pulled off both about as well as you could imagine: It was funny but heartbreaking, nuanced but not mealy-mouthed, blunt but not despairing. It firmly established \u201cblack-ish,\u201d if there was any doubt, as a sitcom that\u2019s not just timely but up to the challenge of its times.", "The action in \u201cHope\u201d started as a lot of topical sitcom episodes do, with a family watching the news on TV. The story was about a young black man brutalized by the police on video, with an indictment decision pending \u2014 but which one? The episode made the confusion part of the joke: Was it Chicago? Cincinnati? Charleston? Who can keep track? (Watching the episode, I had to Google whether the case \u2014 with familiar scenes of protest and coverage from CNN\u2019s Don Lemon \u2014 was fictional.)", "We\u2019ve lived this scene many times, after all, since \u201cblack-ish\u201d began in September 2014, a month after unrest broke out over the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. On the one hand, its timing was perfect: Here was a sitcom that was not only about a black family but asked what it means to be black today.", "On the other hand, the premise of the pilot \u2014 Andre Johnson (Anthony Anderson) wrestles with how to instill racial consciousness in his kids, who he worries are growing up with an attitude that is too-postracial \u2014 already seemed almost quaint. The story lines in the first season of this ABC sitcom were smart about the particular dynamics of an upscale black family\u2019s experience, but relatively small-scale.", "The second season upped the ante, right from the premiere, \u201cThe Word,\u201d a blistering and hilarious breakdown of a racial epithet and the customs around it. Even before this week, it had referenced police issues, as when Ruby (Jenifer Lewis), in a recent episode, urged Andre to call the cops, \u201cbut before you do, make sure they know a black man owns this house.\u201d", "I\u2019m not sure if this is a matter of \u201cblack-ish\u201d getting braver so much as the show realizing it was ready. Having fleshed out and added characters (Ruby, for instance, who can bring down the house with a line reading of \u201ccilantro\u201d), it built a multigenerational clan that could believably pin down a touchy subject from every angle.", "The show now has history, it has our investment, and that lets an episode like \u201cHope\u201d land hard. Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross) could take the semi-thankless position of arguing for the legal system (and wanting to keep her younger kids innocent) without seeming simply na\u00efve. Pops (Laurence Fishburne) could both bluntly argue that \u201cthe police are damn thugs\u201d and reveal himself as a former member of the less-than-militant Bobcats (\u201cWe were Panther-adjacent!\u201d).", "Most movingly, \u201cHope\u201d subtly circled back to that 2014 pilot, in which Andre worried that Junior (Marcus Scribner) was forgetting his blackness; when Junior resolves to join the protest, Andre suddenly worries that his son has become black-aware enough to get himself killed.", "That, and Andre\u2019s reminding Rainbow how exciting it was to see President Obama inaugurated, and how terrifying to see him leave the protection of his limo \u2014 and how the two feelings are inextricable \u2014 gave the show a new and well-earned depth.", "But beyond the character moments, \u201cHope\u201d managed to work in a stunning amount of American racial history (and current events) into a single episode without coming off like a sitcom Wikipedia page.", "In a single half-hour, it connected Ta-Nehisi Coates with James Baldwin; offered a primer on Freddie Gray and Sandra Bland; contrasted Andre\u2019s Gen-X-Malcolm-X black nationalism with the generation before and after him; and swiftly laid out O.J. Simpson as an \u201cidiot\u201d whose acquittal was nonetheless a moral victory. It was broadly relevant and brilliantly specific (see the final tag, in which Ruby spray-painted \u201cBLACK-OWNED\u201d on the garage, a visual reference to the Los Angeles riots).", "A sitcom can\u2019t erase differences. (I can come to \u201cblack-ish\u201d only as a white guy who watches it every week with two sons who love it; that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019ll never need the same version of The Talk that the Johnson kids get.) But \u201cHope\u201d proved how sitcoms can still matter; even in a time of fragmented audiences, they can connect. No talk is going to work miracles, but it beats saying nothing."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/nytnow/your-monday-evening-briefing-iowa-zika-black-history-month.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

Ted Cruz took the Republican race, beating Donald J. Trump despite strong turnout that was expected to help the businessman and outsider candidate. Marco Rubio also had a strong showing, trailing very close behind Mr. Trump when the race was called.", "_____", "2. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is virtually tied with Bernie Sanders, who was also predicted to benefit from high turnout. There\u2019s a peculiarly topsy-turvy quality to this political season. So as we await the final results from Iowa, check out our overview of how zany the presidential race has been so far.", "_____", "3. It\u2019s official: The Zika virus, which has exploded across South and Central America, is an international public health emergency.

More success for Google and more trouble for Yahoo. Alphabet, the holding company formerly known as Google, reported solid revenue growth, and its stock went up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. That means it will probably surpass Apple as the world\u2019s richest company when markets open Tuesday. But a struggling Yahoo was sued by a fired manager for job cuts based on quarterly reviews that he says were discriminatory.", "_____", "5. One of our best-read articles today looks at the reticence of Clarence Thomas. He is about to log a full decade on the Supreme Court without having asked a single question from the bench.

If you\u2019re a football fan, you don\u2019t need a reminder that Super Bowl 50 is coming Sunday.

This one, made in the end zone by Calvin Johnson back in 2010, was ruled incomplete after he released the ball to celebrate.", "_____", "7. Researchers around the world are voluntarily forgoing using a genome-editing technique that can make inheritable changes to human DNA. But British regulators approved an experiment that brings the prospect closer, allowing its use by a developmental biologist who promises to let the embryos she uses expire after seven days.", "_____", "8. The Syrian government and members of the opposition are finally sitting down to talk. Just not to each other. The U.N.\u2019s special envoy met with opposition members in Geneva and said he would meet with government officials on Tuesday.

Then, the board had decided that a spinoff of Alibaba stock was too risky. The issue was tax \u2014 the I.R.S. had stopped approving these transactions \u2014 and although its law firm was willing to bless the transaction, the Yahoo board decided not to go forward.", "Instead, the company said that \u201cmarket perceptions\u201d dictated that it do another transaction. The board would spin off Yahoo itself and, for good measure, said it would consider \u201calternatives.\u201d", "At the time, the announcement of this \u201creverse spin\u201d was seen as a sop to the market and a way to buy time, perhaps up to a year, for Ms. Mayer to enact yet another turnaround plan. One hedge fund, SpringOwl Asset Management, argued in a 99-slide deck that to sell Yahoo now would be to do so on the cheap before the full value of a platform that has almost a billion users could be exploited.", "But only a few months later, the board has again shifted course, this time initiating a full-fledged process to sell the company. An independent committee of the board has been formed, and lawyers and three investment banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and PJT Partners \u2014 have been hired. Even the hiring of three banks shows the bloat at Yahoo as it searches for someone to lead it somewhere.", "The company says that this is only one option, but independent committees have a life of their own. The train has started and it will probably stop at a sale.", "Moreover, it is nearly impossible to run a turnaround plan when you are actively exploring a sale and are contacting bidders. The board knows this, and so the talk of a sale being \u201conly an alternative\u201d is cheap.", "It\u2019s exactly what a weak board would do at this time \u2014 throw its hands up, despite the possible value of waiting.", "This is a result in part of the failures of Ms. Mayer. A rock star hire, one of her ideas was that Yahoo could be a top-tier player again if it acted like her old employer, Google. That meant spending billions of dollars on acquisitions, giving employees free food and free iPhones, sponsoring the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and throwing multimillion-dollar holiday parties.", "All of this would be fine if you are Google or Facebook and are minting cash. But it seemed wrong for Yahoo to again sponsor the World Economic Forum this year. You may suspect that many at the forum were looking at the Yahoo executives and thinking that this would be their last year there. What a waste of money, and what bad public relations.", "Instead, what Yahoo is left with is a new strategy, one that is focused on \u201cMavens\u201d (Silicon Valley shorthand for mobile, video, native and social platforms), while struggling with cost-cutting and an employee morale situation that Ms. Mayer describes as \u201ccomplicated.\u201d The sale announcement is only going to make the situation worse as more employees head for the doors. All that free food buys loyalty only as long as you are a winner, and Yahoo is now in triage mode.", "All this would make it hard for any board to maintain control. The default, of course, is to pull the ripcord. I had thought that the Yahoo board was taking a stronger stance by trying to buy a year with the Yahoo spinoff, but the board has buckled under pressure, with a potential proxy contest from the hedge fund Starboard Value looming.", "And indeed, watching videos of Ms. Mayer and the chairman, Maynard Webb, talking about the company\u2019s future gives you more a sense that they are more at odds than working together. (Watch the video and make your own conclusions.)", "Yahoo\u2019s bankers will now call the usual subjects and run an auction. This typically takes about one to two months, although given the fact that everyone knows the situation here, it may go more quickly.", "During that time, indications of interest will be received and the field will be narrowed to a few bidders. Private equity players will undoubtedly bid, but so will strategic ones like Verizon, which bought AOL.", "The irony is that in the glory days of the 1990s, Yahoo bought GeoCities for $3.57 billion and broadcast.com for $5.7 billion. Ms. Mayer herself has spent more than $3 billion on acquisitions and, according to SpringOwl, has wasted another $6.5 billion in stock buybacks and failed research and development.", "Yahoo is likely to sell for less than all of the money Ms. Mayer spent. If she had sought to liquidate Yahoo as soon as she took over and distributed the proceeds, Yahoo shareholders would have fared much better than they will now.", "Whatever the outcome, Ms. Mayer will be able to parachute out of Yahoo with a big paycheck \u2014 more than $28 million, according to company\u2019s last proxy statement, although a decline in the stock price will make this less. And that is on top of the more than $100 million she has already earned at Yahoo for her years there. The notion of pay for performance loses out once again.", "This does not mean that an agreement of the Yahoo board to sell the company is the end of the Yahoo story. Some hedge funds like SpringOwl are likely to oppose a sale as insufficient. Other funds like Starboard are salivating for a sale. Indeed, Starboard is likely to try to unseat the Yahoo board in a proxy contest, if only to make sure the board does not again change its mind and decide not to sell.", "So the next fight to come at Yahoo will be whether the company is selling too cheaply.", "It all brings to mind a truism on Wall Street, that once you are at the mercy of financial engineers and schemes, it is over. Say good night, Yahoo."]}

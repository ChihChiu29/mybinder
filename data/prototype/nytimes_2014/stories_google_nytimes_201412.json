She had been in an accident: The Greyhound bus that was taking her from New York to Chicago to curate a show had smashed into a garbage rig, killing one passenger and wounding dozens of others. She needed surgery. She also needed a lawyer. Ulman knew that her parents, who lived in northern Spain, would be of no help. \u201cWho do I know in the States who\u2019s not a kid on heroin?\u201d she asked herself. After a moment\u2019s thought, Ulman instructed her nurses to contact a man she had met only once: Stefan Simchowitz, the controversial 44-year-old movie producer, Internet entrepreneur and industrial scion who over the last seven years has pursued a manic quest to assemble the world\u2019s most lucrative collection of emerging contemporary art.", "When Ulman\u2019s bus crashed, she was traveling alone and without insurance, which might explain why, following surgery, the hospital talked about moving her to a hotel. But Simchowitz enlisted a Texas lawyer specializing in bus crashes, who insisted that Ulman undergo a second operation at the hospital and then arranged that she be transferred by ambulance to a recovery facility in New York City. He later filed suit against Greyhound for all of Ulman\u2019s medical bills, which, after a month in the hospital and an additional month in rehab, totaled nearly half a million dollars. \u201cStefan was very supportive,\u201d Ulman recalled. \u201cHe put all those \u2018adult things\u2019 together.\u201d", "More than supportive, Simchowitz had stepped out of a fairy tale \u2014 a godfather whose emissary swooped down from the heavens to rescue Ulman from catastrophe. Ulman had not yet heard all the stories about Simchowitz\u2019s generosity and its fatal attraction for young, penniless artists whom he lured into Faustian bargains. He would provide them with \u201call those adult things\u201d they needed and so often lacked: room, board, materials. In exchange for extraordinary support, Simchowitz asked not for his artists\u2019 souls but for their art, a deal that many of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s lived to regret. In any event, lying alone in a hospital bed, broken and delirious, Ulman did not have the luxury of worrying about a far-off day of reckoning.", "Ulman met Simchowitz earlier that year after an email introduction from the editor of Sex Magazine, an online arts publication, and was unaware of his reputation for aggressive accumulation. She agreed to sell him two giant paintings covered in blue eyes, but she was surprised by his brutal plans for them. Like a land developer subdividing a great estate, Simchowitz planned to chop up Ulman\u2019s paintings into roughly a dozen smaller units. \u201cHe wanted me to cut the eyes into pieces so he could sell more paintings!\u201d she said. Ulman, who put herself through art school by working as a librarian, was taken aback by the proposed dismemberment, but she wasn\u2019t in a strong position to negotiate. \u201cI was very desperate,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to eat.\u201d She ended up selling Simchowitz the smaller units for less than $150 apiece, adding that he could \u201cwipe his ass with them\u201d if he really wanted to.", "\u201cHe paid me nothing, basically, but at the moment it seemed like a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was great. It allowed me to go to Berlin. I think I lived three months out of that.\u201d", "Since 2007, Simchowitz has sponsored and promoted roughly two dozen young artists. In addition to arranging sales for their work, Simchowitz often provides them with a studio, purchases their materials, covers their rent and subsidizes their living expenses. Perhaps most consequentially, he also posts photos of them and their work on his influential Instagram account, thereby creating what he calls \u201cheat\u201d and \u201cvelocity\u201d for the artists he supports, who have included market darlings like the Colombian Oscar Murillo, the Japanese-American Parker Ito and the Brazilian Christian Rosa, all under the age of 35. But Simchowitz\u2019s methods call down the opprobrium of art-world stalwarts, who are contemptuous of his taste, suspicious of his motives and fearful of his network\u2019s potential to subvert the intricate hierarchies that have regulated art for centuries.", "Reputations in the art world are forged over many years across countless fairs, openings, reviews and dinners. Although laypeople may look at a $30 million Richter and compare it to splatters from a second grader, Richter\u2019s prices are determined not by chance but by the elaborate academic, journalistic and institutional infrastructure the art world has built to mete out prizes and anoint the next generation of cultural torchbearers. The collector class has traditionally come from the very top of the wealth spectrum and has included people looking to trade money for social prestige by participating in the art world\u2019s stately rituals. Over the last few years, though, a new class of speculators has emerged with crasser objectives: They are less interested in flying to Basel to attend a dinner than in riding the economic wave that has caused the market for emerging contemporary art to surge in the past decade.", "Critics charge that Simchowitz often preys on vulnerable young artists without gallery representation \u2014 some say without talent \u2014 and buys up huge quantities of their work, then flips the pieces back and forth at escalating prices among a cultivated group of buyers: a network of movie stars, professional poker players, orthodontists, nightclub promoters, financiers, football players and corned-beef magnates, many of whom hold Simchowitz in such high esteem that they\u2019re willing to purchase the pieces he acquires for them sight unseen, artist unnamed. In March, in an online screed for New York magazine, the art critic Jerry Saltz tore into Simchowitz with unusual ferocity, dubbing him a \u201cSith Lord\u201d and the Pied Piper of the \u201cNew Cynicism.\u201d Simchowitz\u2019s artists may enjoy a temporary surge in prices, his critics argue, but they typically see little of the upside; in any case, or so the story goes, once their bubbles pop, they\u2019re left for dead.", "Many important galleries have blacklisted Simchowitz as a buyer, forcing him to take extreme measures to secure desired work, including using consultants as undercover mules. Simchowitz told me about a recent scheme in which he had a consultant buy three pieces from Essex Street, a Lower East Side gallery. The purchase was nominally on behalf of another client, but the ultimate recipient was Simchowitz; by the time the gallery suspected the ruse, money had already changed hands, but the pieces had not been delivered. The gallery requested that Simchowitz not only cancel the purchase but also return another piece by the same artist that was already in his possession, which he did. Moreover, the gallerist, furious over what happened, called the other client to inform him that he was colluding in fraud, an accusation that heartily amused Simchowitz. (Asked for comment, the gallery responded, \u201cEssex Street has never done business with Stefan Simchowitz.\u201d)", "To his detractors, Simchowitz is the Michael Milken of the art world \u2014 someone who has created, through his extensive network and force of personality, a market for high-risk, high-yield investments that have little to do with the fundamentals of talent and critical acclaim. By contrast, Simchowitz sees himself as something akin to the art world\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, a 21st-century player using technology to disrupt the institutional establishment. Despite his reputation for transaction-driven opportunism, Simchowitz insists he is playing the long game. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the big fish,\u201d he told me, predicting that in 30 years his investments in the next generation of art stars could yield him a fortune worth a hundred million dollars. \u201cThe downside is that it\u2019s worth only $50 million,\u201d he allowed. \u201cBut I want the big kahuna.\u201d", "Simchowitz is in no immediate danger of amassing such a fortune. He lives in a modest one-story home on the southeastern precipice of Beverly Hills, a region that real estate agents optimistically call \u201cBeverly Hills adjacent.\u201d When accused of greed, he\u2019s fond of reciting the value of his home \u2014 $1.2 million \u2014 as proof of frugality, though he also rents an additional house across the street, co-owns two homes in Australia and until recently maintained a residence in SoHo before deciding that it was \u201ccheaper to stay in hotels.\u201d", "The son of the South African industrialist and Clint Eastwood look-alike Manfred Simchowitz \u2014 \u201ca gangster,\u201d as his son admiringly describes him \u2014 Simchowitz was born in Johannesburg but sent away to a boarding school in England at 6. He came back to South Africa for middle school, only to endure severe bullying at his Jewish day school, where a group of boys twisted his ankle so severely that it fractured in four places; after the incident, he left South Africa to study karate in Japan. He finished his secondary education at boarding school in the United States and ultimately graduated from Stanford in 1992. After college, Simchowitz tried his hand at the movie business, unprofitably producing 13 independent films between 1996 and 2006 (his best-known film, \u201cRequiem for a Dream,\u201d netted him only $12,000). From Hollywood, he branched into the tech sector, co-founding a celebrity photo and video service that eventually sold to Getty Images in 2007 for $200 million (Simchowitz says that his cut, diluted following the dot-com crash, was only 2 percent).", "It was only then that Simchowitz shifted into contemporary art. Having an art collection, he reasoned, was a bit like owning land: Art not only appreciated in value, it also afforded cultural cachet, something he learned by watching his father, who had built a renowned collection of modernist paintings. Instead of using his limited funds to acquire third-tier works from established stars \u2014 Simchowitz had no interest in buying a \u201cminor Warhol\u201d or a \u201csecond-rate Kusama,\u201d as he put it \u2014 he decided to focus on emerging artists. He started out buying and selling works in the $10,000 range, acquiring about three dozen pieces by artists like Sterling Ruby, Joe Bradley, Tauba Auerbach and Cory Arcangel, all of which have appreciated considerably over the last six years (today a Sterling Ruby can fetch a million dollars or more in the secondary market). He estimates that since 2007 his collection has grown to some 1,500 pieces worth as much as $30 million, with about 5 percent of the works accounting for 50 percent of the value.", "Simchowitz describes his house as a kibbutz, as it often swarms with visitors \u2014 young artists, old dealers, models, ex-models, his ex-model ex-wife, members of his ex-wife\u2019s extended family, his ex-stepmother, clients, employees, members of the press, a variety of dogs, his 6-year-old child, his 6-year-old child\u2019s 6-year-old friends. Less typical of a kibbutz, Simchowitz\u2019s house also serves as the global headquarters of Simcor, the umbrella organization for Simchowitz\u2019s art-world empire. In late July, when I met Simchowitz at his house for lunch, I found the space inviting but glutted with inventory. Comic details abounded, including an artwork in the bathroom that said \u201cbuy stuff\u201d (Simchowitz\u2019s unofficial mantra) and a doormat that read \u201cthe neighbors have better stuff\u201d \u2014 almost certainly a lie. In any event, I learned that the house was rarely empty, making it an unlikely target for burglars, and there was even talk of renting the house next door for extra space, which would make Simchowitz his own neighbor.", "On arrival, I was greeted by Simchowitz\u2019s partner in both life and business, Rosi Riedl, a tall, silver-haired former model \u2014 one prominent curator dismissed her as \u201ca Bond girl\u201d \u2014 with a strong will and a buoyant disposition. Riedl was born in Austria but moved at age 12 to Australia, where her family lived on a sheep farm. (\u201cHer family has no money,\u201d Simchowitz later confided. \u201cThey had to eat their own sheep.\u201d) When she was 21, she moved to Los Angeles, where she met Simchowitz on a beach. They married within two years and divorced within seven, but following the divorce they continued to live together and eventually had a child. \u201cIt was all Stefan-style, so nothing happened very politely,\u201d Riedl said as she escorted me into a garage that had been converted into an art-market command center manned by additional beautiful women.", "Over a lunch of salad and steamed vegetables \u2014 Simchowitz was trying to lose 15 pounds and had instructed his staff to snatch away pastries and schedule sessions at SoulCycle to help him tone his physique \u2014 I asked Simchowitz why he was so unpopular among his art-world peers. \u201cI\u2019m the poster child of evil speculation,\u201d Simchowitz acknowledged, munching his veggies, \u201cbut it\u2019s totally incorrect.\u201d Every dollar he made, he claimed, went directly back to feeding emerging artists. \u201cI am 100 percent invested in art. I have no working capital. I make $100,000, I pay my taxes and overhead, $50,000 goes back to supporting some young artist\u2019s career. It\u2019s a very efficient system.\u201d Galleries and museums, he pointed out, effectively forced artists to subsidize sky-high rents and unwieldy bureaucracies. It was true that he traded pieces with speculators, but as a necessary evil to fund his artists in advance of their eventual payday.", "Art speculators caused trouble, argued Simchowitz, not when they flipped their works but when they cashed out. \u201cThe problem is when the parasites come and extract dollars to buy a Ferrari or go to St. Bart\u2019s for the weekend. You have a lot of people coming in \u2014 literally stockbrokers, bankers, speculators \u2014 who have no interest in art, who are just trying to gain. I am not one of these people. You can spend five minutes here and see I invest in cultural production.\u201d Indeed, the fruits of Simchowitz\u2019s cultural investments lined the walls. Over the sofa in the living room hung three large Parker Itos from the series \u201cThe Agony and the Ecstasy\u201d; Sterling Ruby adorned his bedroom and kitchen.", "He went on to claim, though, that many of the worst offenders were not the speculator-barbarians at the gate but high-profile collectors \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t name them on the record \u2014 revered within the community. \u201cThe vampires of the business are in the system! The problem is that these people are at St. Bart\u2019s. They\u2019ve got names. The galleries like names.\u201d Museums liked names, too, and would often blindly award board seats to regal-sounding donors with deep pockets. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand it\u2019s actually a divorced drug addict or a rich socialite who basically wants to be on a board as a trophy.\u201d Simchowitz suggested that galleries and museums preferred \u201csocial investors\u201d to \u201ccapital investors\u201d because wealthy divorc\u00e9s were easier to control than market sharks. \u201cMy ex-stepmother was on the board of MoCA. I know what these women are like. My father has collected my whole life. I know what they\u2019re like. The galleries want a very specific song. They want Beethoven\u2019s Fifth.\u201d Simchowitz, on the other hand, was serving Iggy Azalea, bringing \u201crealness\u201d \u2014 or his idea of realness \u2014 to an art culture plagued by hypocrisy and prevarication.", "Three days later, Simchowitz took me to meet some artists. The first stop was Morgan Richard Murphey, a transient 24-year-old abstract painter with a bushy brown beard and a show coming up in Brussels. Murphey was both homeless and studioless, so Simchowitz had arranged a live-work residency for him at the studio of Danny First, an Angeleno collector (major) and sculptor (minor). When we arrived, the studio \u2014 a warehouselike space on an alley off La Brea \u2014 was littered with beer cans and whiskey bottles. Murphey greeted us wearing a black leather jacket.", "\u201cHe decides to show up, huh?\u201d he said, smiling at his patron.", "\u201cI had to see what\u2019s cooking,\u201d Simchowitz replied.", "Among art-world rituals, the studio visit is one of the holiest. Whereas film directors do their scouting like cattle drivers, corralling actors through humiliating casting calls, gallerists and curators cultivate relationships with artists by trekking to far-flung neighborhoods (Bushwick, Highland Park) and indulging long, wandering discussions about theory and practice, inflected by deadly, half-read undergrad syllabuses. Dealers make these journeys because they bolster the important art-world conceit that gallerists and artists meet as equals. For artists, studio visits provide the opportunity to explain how individual pieces fit within their broader practice, thereby giving contextual heft to work that might otherwise appear flimsy or mysterious. Simchowitz, however, mostly shuns this convention. If he\u2019s interested in an artist\u2019s work, he asks the artist to forward images via email or text message. His decision to drop by and check on Morgan Richard Murphey was partly for my benefit but also motivated by practicality: Murphey, who didn\u2019t own a cellphone, seemed ill prepared for his impending show. It was face to face or not at all.", "On the walls of the studio were a series of canvases smeared with black paint that feebly gestured at Abstract Expressionism. Bewilderingly, one was inscribed with a global-warming slogan. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be three subcategories in the series, and then they all start cross-contaminating each other,\u201d Murphey haltingly explained. As Simchowitz perused the works in progress, he began to look worried. \u201cJust try to work out some of the ideas,\u201d he said, looking straight at Murphey. \u201cKeep the show focused. I need you to work. You\u2019re very distracted.\u201d", "Murphey smiled nervously. \u201cFocus?\u201d he asked, chuckling.", "\u201cYou either want this or you don\u2019t want this,\u201d Simchowitz said sternly. He was clearly referring not just to Murphey\u2019s show but to his career as a whole. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, do something else. Focus. There\u2019s no alternative.\u201d", "\u201cUh, absolutely,\u201d Murphey responded, mumbling.", "As we got back into the car, Simchowitz expressed disappointment. \u201cIt\u2019s very weak. I probably spent $20,000 on that guy. That\u2019s gone \u2014 whoosh. I won\u2019t get behind it if I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good.\u201d The work wasn\u2019t ugly, but like Murphey himself, it seemed arbitrary and out of time. In addition, the artist seemed bent on endowing the work with an inner logic that would be impossible to convey on social media, clearly a red flag for Simchowitz. Murphey\u2019s career was still germinating, though, and Simchowitz wasn\u2019t prepared to write him off yet. \u201cHe could be good; it\u2019s early. This happens a lot.\u201d", "Simchowitz considered further. \u201cI don\u2019t think he took it seriously.\u201d He said that scaring artists sometimes served to quickly \u201csnap them into place\u201d; other times, he said, it would take them five years to figure it out, if they ever did.", "Despite his dim opinion of what he had seen, and his pledge that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cget behind it,\u201d he nonetheless instructed his assistant, who had accompanied us, to make sure they purchased all the work that was there. \u201cI want the whole studio \u2014 and do it fast \u2014 paintings signed on the back, photography, the whole nine yards.\u201d He didn\u2019t say how much he would pay.", "After leaving Murphey, we went to see Petra Cortright, one of Simchowitz\u2019s most promising investments and a leading figure in what\u2019s called post-Internet art. Simchowitz has collected works by many of the artists most closely associated with the term, including Amalia Ulman, whom Simchowitz refers to as \u201cthe Marina Abramovic of social media,\u201d and rising talents like Artie Vierkant and Jon Rafman.", "Simchowitz uses the term as a generational marker to describe how art history has been \u201cflattened\u201d for artists of a certain age. \u201cWhen they typed in \u2018tree'\u2009\u201d in a search engine, Simchowitz explained, \u201cthey got a thousand pictures of a tree: a picture of a tree made in the 18th century, a tree made last year, a cartoon of a tree. You have this flattening of time.\u201d To the extent that \u201cpost-Internet\u201d sometimes defines a sensibility, you could say that it\u2019s characterized by positivity, the melding of satire and admiration, an emphasis on popularity over exclusivity and an uncomplicated reverence for fame and success.", "Cortright\u2019s studio was a former punk-music club at the easternmost point of Los Angeles, on the edge of Alhambra, far from Simchowitz\u2019s collector base in the Hollywood Hills. The artist and her fianc\u00e9 had recently installed an archery range in the basement; we arrived to find her holding an arrow and wearing a white baggy blouse, white high-waisted jeans and white Comme des Gar\u00e7ons shoes. She looked like a movie star but exuded the aura of a cult member from the \u201970s.", "Cortright\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Marc Horowitz, a lapsed painter whom Simchowitz had recently encouraged to wield the brush again (\u201cjust wait two years,\u201d Simchowitz told me, \u201che\u2019s going to be massive\u201d), explained that they installed the archery range as a way of coping with creative mistakes. \u201cIt\u2019s where all the bad work goes to die,\u201d he said. I looked up and saw that instead of the customary bull\u2019s-eye targets, the couple had mounted old paintings.", "Cortright led us on a tour of the studio, passing through the two-story atrium, the showroom, the library, the kitchen and an expansive roof outfitted with chaise longues for tanning and a mist-sprayer to prevent overheating. Cortright\u2019s actual work space was on the second floor and featured a pineapple plant and a collection of chakra-balancing sunglasses in multiple colors. \u201cI always wear the pink ones,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to make you happy and playful.\u201d", "On the walls hung digital paintings, printed on silk and depicting tropical landscapes. Recently, though, Cortright has enjoyed particular success with a more abstract series on aluminum. Simchowitz likened her digital paintings to Monets, because of her elaborate layering process, and explained that he had been encouraging Cortright to employ what he called \u201cproprietary production techniques\u201d to make her work more popular with collectors. He had taken steps to prevent the fabricators she used from offering these techniques to other artists (\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ethical,\u201d he explained) and he had bought up as much as he could of the available 60-by-80-inch die bond sheets Cortright used for her aluminum work.", "Art pricing is a pure confidence game \u2014 there are no fundamentals to anchor the price of a painting, because a painting doesn\u2019t produce a stream of revenue. Emerging artists can be likened to start-ups, in that most eventually go to zero but one could become the next Jeff Koons. When an artist\u2019s prices overheat, though, it can instigate a panic and cause his or her market to implode. Young artists momentarily heralded as the next big thing can just as quickly be tossed in the trash. As Riedl explained it, the trouble with speculators is that they \u201cflip, flip, flip,\u201d and the piece \u201cbecomes like a musical chair. When it tops out and they can\u2019t get any more, they throw it away, and then it\u2019s done, and the artist is over. You don\u2019t go back to a reasonable price \u2014 you\u2019re cooked, you\u2019re finished.\u201d", "In November, a pair of Cortright\u2019s digital paintings on aluminum sold at auctions put on by Phillips and Sotheby\u2019s for $40,000 and $43,750, up from less than $13,000 at an auction in July. Simchowitz says he has no doubt that her paintings will eventually breach the $1 million mark (an achievement that would put her in the company of perhaps 2,000 other artists in the history of the world). An alternate trajectory for Cortright would be that of her studiomate and longtime friend Parker Ito, another Simchowitz investment, who had a painting sold at auction for more than $80,000 in July but who in his subsequent 13 auction results averaged just $30,000 per piece (in three other auctions during that period, his work failed to sell at all). Like many of Simchowitz\u2019s more successful wards, Ito has now distanced himself from Simchowitz; Cortright told me that whenever he came to visit the studio, she informed Ito in advance so he could avoid an accidental encounter. Despite repeated hectoring voice-mail messages and emails from Simchowitz, Ito \u2014 who painted tanks for an oil company before Simchowitz met him \u2014 has barely spoken or written to Simchowitz in months.", "Back in his BMW, Simchowitz took calls as we crawled toward the west side in rush-hour traffic. Some of Simchowitz\u2019s most esteemed clients, like Anna Getty (heiress to the Getty oil fortune) and Nicolas Berggruen (the \u201chomeless billionaire\u201d financier famous for living in hotels) are friends who come from clans with a long history of collecting. Others, like Orlando Bloom, Harvey Weinstein and Steve Tisch, are Hollywood connections. Then there are the tech entrepreneurs, including Sean Parker (Napster/Facebook) and Bradley Jabour (medical imaging), as well as an array of lower-profile market sharks. Simchowitz\u2019s method for managing relationships with these clients (some of whom are more active than others) isn\u2019t very different from his method for dealing with adversaries: He screams at them, tells them they\u2019re idiots, brags about his triumphs and assures them he has the inside track.", "With each call, Simchowitz turned on the speakerphone and theatrically announced that he was sitting with a reporter and that everything uttered would be \u2014 and here he bellowed \u2014 \u201cON THE RECORD.\u201d The first call came from Guy Starkman, a restaurateur and nightclub owner, who explained that he was thankful to Simchowitz for introducing him to the emerging art market. It felt, he said, like a game where a guy like him could actually get an edge.", "\u201cI\u2019m not a big fan in investing in other people\u2019s businesses,\u201d he said in a raspy, aggressive voice suggestive of a minor character on HBO\u2019s \u201cEntourage.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re not an insider, you\u2019re just some idiot throwing darts at a board. I don\u2019t have a lot of input into what Tim Cook and Apple are doing with their next iPhone, but Stefan is finding these young artists that he\u2019s trying to nurture. He shows me images, and I give him input, and I feel like I\u2019m part of the process.\u201d Starkman seemed to get a contact high from being, as he put it, \u201cpresent at the creation.\u201d The feeling was apparently infectious. \u201cI can tell you 20 guys that I know that five years ago didn\u2019t know anything about art and now they\u2019re all over art.\u201d", "Starkman was referring to people like the professional poker player Justin Smith and the Buffalo Bills linebacker Keith Rivers. \u201cThey just want to go to Stefan\u2019s house,\u201d Starkman said. \u201cThey want to talk about who\u2019s next and what he\u2019s working on. He\u2019s created a culture.\u201d Starkman acknowledged that Simchowitz\u2019s crew was different from the collecting circles typically found in Europe or New York. \u201cIn New York it\u2019s all hobnob and high society, very aristocratic, all these old-school guys. Who says that art is only for Eli Broad and the Rockefellers?\u201d", "Most of Simchowitz\u2019s clients weren\u2019t rich enough to buy a Gerhard Richter, but they were rich enough to not have to think twice about dropping 20 grand on a couch. Why not spend that money on emerging art? Nobody cares about your couch, Starkman observed. \u201cBut if you have a great Oscar Murillo hanging in your house, and you can tell the story about how you found this guy three years ago and you loved his work, and you can chart it, it\u2019s a much more interesting thing to do.\u201d", "After getting off the phone with Starkman, Simchowitz singled him out as exactly the kind of upstanding American that the traditional art world refused to countenance. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to deal with Guy Starkman because Guy has three kids and he hasn\u2019t missed a soccer match in three years.\u201d Starkman couldn\u2019t go to Art Basel if it meant missing five of his kids\u2019 games. Other clients of Simchowitz\u2019s were simply too busy. \u201cSean Parker does not have time to be at Art Basel at 12 o\u2019clock \u2014 generally he wakes up at 3.\u201d", "Our last stop was the studio of the artist Simchowitz had repeatedly insisted would turn out to be the biggest fish of them all: the 27-year-old Iranian-English painter Kour Pour, who despite recent solo shows in New York and Dublin was still barely known to many in the art world. But Simchowitz had his collector network lining up to buy his paintings \u2014 intricate tapestry imitations verging on trompe l\u2019oeil \u2014 for as much as $100,000 apiece. At first glance the paintings looked like faithful reproductions of actual Persian rugs, but upon closer inspection they turned out to be historical mash-ups. Pour is fond of nonsense juxtapositions, like picturing a Roman centurion next to a 15th-century samurai.", "Simchowitz described the paintings as \u201cneo-romantic\u201d \u2014 though it wasn\u2019t clear what he meant by that \u2014 and noted that the image of the carpet, and its inclusion of Egyptian, Chinese and Japanese figures, conjured global trade. He told me that he considered Pour, like Cortright, to be a post-Internet artist because his techniques, though analog, make use of images found on Google and connected by way of a hacker\u2019s arbitrary logic; the overall effect was Silk Road meets digital superhighway.", "Pour has long straight black hair and a quiet, diligent demeanor. He wore a ponytail holder around his wrist. \u201cHis story is great,\u201d Simchowitz declared. \u201cHis mother passed away from brain cancer when he was 16. His father had a carpet shop, he was an immigrant. And the dedication \u2014 I have never called him once and had him not pick up the phone.\u201d While Simchowitz liked to be involved in the careers of many of the artists he supported, he acknowledged that his degree of involvement with Pour was greatest \u201cin that every aspect of the practice\u201d was managed.", "It was a demeaning thing to say in front of Pour, but it didn\u2019t seem to bother him. Indeed, during our visit, Simchowitz answered most of the questions I posed to Pour, which suited Pour just fine. This struck me as unusual until I recalled that even on Pour\u2019s website, when you clicked \u201ccontact,\u201d Simchowitz\u2019s email appeared alongside Pour\u2019s. Mainly for this reason, several artists I spoke with had initially assumed that Pour did not in fact exist \u2014 that he was a computer-generated figment of Simchowitz\u2019s prodigious imagination.", "I asked Pour about his initial impressions of Simchowitz. He affectionately recalled that during their first studio visit, Simchowitz had spent most of the time yelling, declaring which pieces he considered good and which were garbage. \u201cPeople are usually more polite,\u201d Pour noted. Far from being offended, Pour was impressed with Simchowitz\u2019s honesty. Simchowitz, for his part, was impressed with Pour\u2019s biography and work ethic and offered to rent him a studio and provide him with a stipend if he agreed to quit his day job and work full time on his own art.", "One key to Pour\u2019s mystique, it seemed, was his meager, tightly controlled output. The supply was virtually nonexistent \u2014 it took Pour up to a year to finish a painting \u2014 and the demand was staggering. Simchowitz mentioned that the first time he posted an image of a Kour Pour painting on Instagram, he got a furious 2 a.m. phone call from a billionaire collector who demanded to know why he had never been told about this painter or given an opportunity to buy. Simchowitz had done little to hype the painting; all he did was post it.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a massive, massive collector base,\u201d he told me. \u201cI have standing instructions by multiple people who are worth over $1 billion to buy everything.\u201d Pour\u2019s work, for obvious reasons, seemed to be particularly appealing to collectors from Iran. The very next day, Simchowitz was scheduled to attend a lunch with Kamiar Maleki, a London-based Iranian collector who was planning on giving a dinner for 150 people in Pour\u2019s honor.", "As we walked around the studio, Simchowitz calculated that he had already invested at least $100,000 in Pour\u2019s career. \u201cIt\u2019s a partnership,\u201d Simchowitz said, \u201cone that will hopefully last a very long time and be a big story \u2014 a big story like Damien is a big story.\u201d That would be Damien Hirst, the British mega-artist; but unlike Hirst, whose work uses kitsch \u2014 a diamond skull, a dead shark \u2014 to pose questions about the status of the art object as an engine of the sublime, Kour Pour\u2019s work, to my eye, had kitsch as its endpoint. It played with anachronism but toward no purpose. Its alleged uncanniness felt like a red herring, a thin intellectual raiment for what was, in essence, an excuse to put an expensive tapestry on the wall.", "But that, I suppose, was a pre-Internet way of thinking. Pour worked terrifically on social media, where the undeniable pleasingness of his images could be spotlighted. It occurred to me, as I processed Pour\u2019s work, that the real post-Internet artist was Simchowitz himself. Although he didn\u2019t grow up with the Internet, Simchowitz was entirely its creature. His nose-dive into the serene waters of the art world revealed a talent for collage and a carelessness about tradition that reminded me of his imaginary teenage artists, using their web browsers to search for pictures of trees. Kitsch meant something different in the age of Tumblr.", "After leaving Pour\u2019s studio, we got back in the BMW and drove to Simchowitz\u2019s house so we could rest. He was taking me to his 8:30 p.m. SoulCycle class in West Hollywood, and there were more calls and email to handle after the pedaling was done. In the months ahead, there would be pounds to shed, clients to cajole, works to flip and fish to bait and possibly devour. A hundred million dollars seemed a long way off, but I considered that it would be a mistake to doubt his determination."], "https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/today-in-small-business-the-mistletoe-drone/": ["What\u2019s affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners today.", "The Economy", "Retail", "Small-Business Law", "Entrepreneurship", "Management", "Employees", "Health Care", "Finance", "Around the Country", "Around the World", "Marketing", "Social Media", "Technology", "Obituary", "Gene Marks owns the Marks Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm that helps clients with customer relationship management.

Major cable players made it clear that they were unwilling to step in with a video-on-demand alternative, so short of hanging a bedsheet and screening the movie at its Culver City headquarters, Sony was cornered.", "Once the film was successfully censored, you could count the days until other films were affected.

A sudden burst of sunlight over the waterfront affected me like a melody direct from \u00adMozart.\u201d And Tim Cahill, with typically poignant humor, conjures \u2014 or, rather, fails to conjure \u2014 the location of a transcendent moment from his youth: \u201cthe mountain or the deep valley or whatever it was\u201d that \u201cshimmered in my vision,\u201d in a story called \u201cThe Place I\u2019ll Never Forget.\u201d", "Dave Eggers offers an intimate snippet about a whorehouse in Thailand: \u201cHe drew her a few pictures in his notebook. . . . Frustrated by their inability to say anything to each other, they lay side by side for the remainder of their time.\u201d And Richard Ford writes a wistful, hilarious and slightly disturbing tale of an ill-conceived road trip into the Atlas Mountains of Morocco that features entrepreneuring locals, large bricks of hash and a very na\u00efve American couple.", "The stories here can read like snapshots, isolated moments illuminated, yet there\u2019s a cumulative effect at work, reminding the reader that it\u2019s often the seemingly trivial, the fleeting instance, that lodges in our psyches and most reveals us to ourselves. Seen through the patina cast by the recollection of vanished youth, many stories reflect a pre-9/11 world, when we were all so much more innocent abroad, and happily so. Yet other tales have a more immediate resonance. Jim Benning\u2019s moving story about \u00addriving through Belgium with his father, a veteran of World War II, has an almost confessional intimacy. And Cheryl Strayed recalls a recent, unplanned trip to the mountains of Andorra the day after her 45th birthday, the age her mother was when she died. Innocence is something we yearn to be rid of, until we\u2019ve lost it. One of travel\u2019s greatest virtues, its ability to make us wide-eyed again when we least expect it, is captured in this volume.", "But when the road eventually grows tiresome, as the road invariably must, the ever probing Pico Iyer sets out to explore what, on first glance, might seem far more familiar terrain. In THE ART OF STILLNESS: Adventures in Going Nowhere (TED Books/Simon & Schuster, $14.99), this global citizen \u2014 Iyer is of Indian descent, was raised in California, educated in England and America and now lives in Japan \u2014 looks at the value of simply staying put. In lesser hands this tiny volume might be a throwaway of glib, \u201cnew age\u201d comfort-speak, but like Henry David Thoreau\u2019s equally brief classic on another seemingly mundane exercise \u2014 walking \u2014 Iyer\u2019s thoughtful nature leads him to peel back layer upon layer, nodding toward the infinite.

Sony is Sony.\u201d", "Practicing journalists see it differently. Dean Baquet, executive editor of The Times, has said that while this is no Pentagon Papers, some of the material may be valid for Times stories.

There\u2019s a strange middle ground here. True, it\u2019s not information vital to citizens about government actions, like some of WikiLeaks. But it\u2019s also not chitchat from personal accounts between friends. It is communication among powerful industry figures, sent on corporate email accounts. Writing in Slate, Justin Peters argued against Mr. Sorkin: \u201cThe Sony leaks shed light on an industry that affects millions of people worldwide.\u201d", "For me, the sordid nature of the source requires meeting a higher standard for newsworthiness.

Free speech cuts both ways. They have the right to say it, and maybe the public ought to know they did. Mr. Sorkin\u2019s much-discussed swipe at female actors\u2019 talent as opposed to their male counterparts? Well, it does speak to \u201ceveryday sexism,\u201d as the celebrated hashtag has it, but it\u2019s not the National Security Agency\u2019s misdeeds either. So, probably not.

Back in the late 1970s, as the chief executive and a co-founder of Apple, Mr. Jobs had presided over the birth of the PC industry, but then, after blockbuster sales of the iPhone and the iPad, he had taken to describing the tech business as entering the \u201cpost-PC\u201d era. Did he really believe that desktop and laptop computers were going extinct?", "He reached for an analogy. \u201cWhen we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks, because that\u2019s what you needed on the farm,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. But as farming died off and people in urban areas began to buy automobiles, the auto market split into distinct categories. There were easy to use, relatively maintenance-free cars for everyday drivers, and powerful, specialty vehicles like trucks for people who needed to get stuff done. Laptops and desktops \u201care going to be like trucks,\u201d Mr. Jobs predicted. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to be around. They\u2019re still going to have a lot of value.

Benedict Evans, an analyst at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, estimates that the number of smartphones and tablets in use around the world surpassed two billion in 2014, eclipsing the number of laptops and desktops in use. But just as Mr. Jobs argued, the rise of mobile devices has not led to the death of desktops and laptops. In 2014 the once-sharp decline in PC sales began to level off. In some ways this year was a renaissance for the personal computer as our laptops and desktops acquired fantastic new powers that made them better than ever.", "We saw the rise of Chromebooks, the Google-powered laptops that run an operating system based on the Chrome web browser, which often sell for around $200.

When it was time to return the review model that Apple sent me, I hated to part with it. So I did something crazy: I bought a Retina 5K iMac of my own.", "These machines aren\u2019t cheap. The Retina 5K iMac starts at $2,500, which is $700 more than the non-Retina 27-inch iMac, and thousands more than you\u2019d pay for a run-of-the-mill desktop computer.

Last year Dell introduced a stand-alone 5K monitor that it planned to sell for $2,500 \u2014 the same price as Apple\u2019s entire computer, for just the screen. Shortly after the iMac was announced, Dell reduced the price of its display to $2,000. But when you pair that display with a computer powerful enough to handle it, you\u2019re bound to spend more than what you\u2019ll pay for Apple\u2019s all-in-one machine. If you\u2019re looking for a desktop with a screen this good, Apple\u2019s desktop is the way to go.", "Apple is unlikely to sell the new iMac in high volumes. It\u2019s a computer intended specifically for a small niche audience of photographers, video editors, animators, digital producers and Web-addled writers like me \u2014 people who spend a lot of time on their machines and are willing to pay for high-end tools.", "Still, even if Apple doesn\u2019t sell millions, the new iMac is an object lesson. If you\u2019re a casual computer user \u2014 looking only to surf the web, check email and do other light tasks \u2014 you don\u2019t need much more than a Chromebook or a tablet these days. You could probably get by with just a phone.", "But as the low end of the PC business is swallowed by cheap devices, the only people left in the market for traditional PCs will be professionals.

Though the C.D.C. now recommends vaccination for everyone older than 6 months, vaccinations remain at less than 50 percent of the population. With so few people protected, it\u2019s still relatively easy for the virus to spread each year; there are lots of susceptible people, and the airborne virus moves around quickly.", "This year, that problem may be worse than usual. Though the vaccine includes an H3N2 flu, the strain it targets isn\u2019t a perfect match for the one that\u2019s going around. That means that the vaccine is less effective than normal. Ideally, with a weaker vaccine, you\u2019d want more people to be inoculated. But some people, hearing the message about the vaccine\u2019s limited effectiveness, may have skipped it this year. There are other flu strains circulating, too, and people who don\u2019t get a shot may be at risk of catching another variety as well.", "Flu seasons wax and wane, Dr. Jhung said, but the intensity of a flu season typically depends more on the particular bug in a given year than anything else. Two years ago, another H3N2 virus was prevalent, and the flu season was also quite severe.

There\u2019s little consensus on the value of a digital ad impression, for example. So it\u2019s difficult to say just how much influence the ads had. Were the people who gave to a candidate after being served a Facebook ad about the campaign likely to give anyway? Or was the change in behavior that they donated online rather than by mailing a check? Were there other, offline factors at work? Because the experiments were conducted by Facebook, specific details about the audiences were not shared with the campaigns to preserve user privacy.", "One of the goals of the experiments is to see whether ads on Facebook could drive donations incrementally over several days rather than all at once. Because Facebook conducted the analysis for the experiment, it\u2019s not clear exactly how they weighed the different factors involved, but the company said that it was able to both add to the number of people who donated and increase the size of the donations over time.", "Digital spending still occupies something of a niche in many campaigns, but online fund-raising is one thing that nearly every campaign agrees is useful. Demonstrating that advertisements on one platform could improve donations on another could help strengthen the case that digital consultants have been making to put online spending at the center of campaign strategy. Still, this is a relatively new area of digital campaigning. Uncertainty over the effectiveness of the tactic led the Nunn campaign to negotiate that it could pull the plug on the experiment, although it wound up being successful, partly because of the timing, said Ms. Algeri.", "Facebook users should expect to encounter more political advertisements and more fund-raising emails in their inbox.

It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

The evidence is there in this magnificently complex show of art from parts of the Middle East, or as the Met prefers to call it, the Near East, that now include Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. The exchange of materials, ideas and beliefs traced in shipwreck-salvaged objects here speak of a world as globally networked as our own.

Working in Prague for the Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II, Bartholomeus Spranger (1546-1611) painted and drew Mannerist-style allegories involving nude and nearly nude gods and goddesses athletically entwined in anatomically improbable positions.

They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art.

The 40-minute movie is an instance of institutional critique, an art genre that tries to expose and subvert the workings of the capitalist art market. Specifically, it\u2019s about the scandalous trade in furniture produced for Chandigarh, the utopian city in northern India designed by Le Corbusier and his team and built between 1951 and 1965.

But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

It includes her underappreciated works on paper alongside sculptural tableaus that combine woodcarving and assemblage (for instance, \u201cThe Family,\u201d a funky nativity scene from 1969 that is dominated by a neon-haloed, heavily bedazzled Virgin).

But in the years around 1940, he must have felt he was living a nightmare. He and his wife of more than four decades separated. He underwent debilitating surgery for cancer.

In each case, however, the pieces are by Ms. Sturtevant herself, who spent much of a long career adopting and adapting the art and styles of others to create a body of work entirely her own, one which raises questions about the value of art, about the hows and whys of producing it, and about the degrees to which quasi-replication can be an exercise in flattery, parody, objectivity, originality and love. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

Philip Johnson and John Burgee were proposing a suave 4.2 million-square-foot ensemble of four skyscrapers that would help \u201cclean up\u201d the surrounding urban squalor, and they favored an open square at the center of their project. The Municipal Art Society protested the proposal by asking for alternatives to replace the Times Tower.

Not only was their architecture imaginative, so were the ideas behind it: that design could shape civic life; that art and architecture were inseparable; that while Europe and the United States were the cultural powers of the day, South America had a shot at tomorrow. The momentum broke down when a rash of right-wing military coups swept the continent. But the link between art and architecture remained firm and continues to.

Historic house and modern museum have always made an awkward fit, a standoff between preservation and innovation, and the problem remains, but the renovation has brought a wide-open new gallery space, a cafe and a raft of be-your-own-designer digital enhancements. Best of all, more of the museum\u2019s vast permanent collection is now on view, including an Op Art weaving, miniature spiral staircases, ballistic face masks and a dainty enameled 18th-century version of a Swiss knife.

While the work\u2019s pursuit of newness \u2014 moving parts, mirrored surfaces and glowing lights \u2014 wears thin, the seamless pairing of exhibition and architecture is perfect.

It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

The evidence is there in this magnificently complex show of art from parts of the Middle East, or as the Met prefers to call it, the Near East, that now include Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. The exchange of materials, ideas and beliefs traced in shipwreck-salvaged objects here speak of a world as globally networked as our own. The wars depicted in Assyrian relief panels are as horrific as those being fought on the same turf today.

Working in Prague for the Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II, Bartholomeus Spranger (1546-1611) painted and drew Mannerist-style allegories involving nude and nearly nude gods and goddesses athletically entwined in anatomically improbable positions.

They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art.

The 40-minute movie is an instance of institutional critique, an art genre that tries to expose and subvert the workings of the capitalist art market. Specifically, it\u2019s about the scandalous trade in furniture produced for Chandigarh, the utopian city in northern India designed by Le Corbusier and his team and built between 1951 and 1965.

But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

It includes her underappreciated works on paper alongside sculptural tableaus that combine woodcarving and assemblage (for instance, \u201cThe Family,\u201d a funky nativity scene from 1969 that is dominated by a neon-haloed, heavily bedazzled Virgin).

But in the years around 1940, he must have felt he was living a nightmare. He and his wife of more than four decades separated. He underwent debilitating surgery for cancer.

In each case, however, the pieces are by Ms. Sturtevant herself, who spent much of a long career adopting and adapting the art and styles of others to create a body of work entirely her own, one which raises questions about the value of art, about the hows and whys of producing it, and about the degrees to which quasi-replication can be an exercise in flattery, parody, objectivity, originality and love. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

In the spring of 2009, Ms. Leibovitz set out on a two-year journey that took her to about two dozen historic sites in the United States and Britain.

At just 20 works or so, it\u2019s not exactly comprehensive. It is, however, thoroughly immersive. The installation, in the Rubin\u2019s skylit top-floor galleries, evokes the structure of an Indian temple with a combination of large and small spaces; it has an open central area of paintings, intimate nooks for sculpture and a \u201csanctum\u201d of watercolors.

Philip Johnson and John Burgee were proposing a suave 4.2 million-square-foot ensemble of four skyscrapers that would help \u201cclean up\u201d the surrounding urban squalor, and they favored an open square at the center of their project.

Carl Andre was one of Minimalism\u2019s founders. This career survey of his low-to-the-ground modular sculptures looks terrific in Dia\u2019s sonorous, sunlight-washed spaces.

This spicy, tightly edited midcareer survey starts with her sardonically funny, Ashcan-style pictures of Amazons in revolt from that time.

But it also represents a potential new source of revenue for YouTube. Plans for Music Key were already underway when Ms. Wojcicki arrived at YouTube, but she describes them as a \u201cfirst step\u201d toward more subscription services without ads.", "The subscription model, like everything YouTube does, is an experiment. Despite its size and dominance, YouTube remains a work in progress. For all of the countless hours of programming created for the site, YouTube has yet to produce a truly premium show. It may be hard to imagine something like Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent\u201d on YouTube, but if the company wants to generate more revenue, it\u2019s going to need more professional content.", "Toward that end, Ms. Wojcicki is awarding development deals to creators. YouTube has been down this road before. A couple of years ago, it invested more than $200 million in 100 new channels; a number featured mainstream celebrities like Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Ashton Kutcher. YouTube calls the effort a success, though the consensus in the entertainment industry is that it failed to create any real breakout channels.", "Either way, the conclusion was that YouTube is its own entertainment universe with a unique breed of programming and talent. This time, the company will invest only in native YouTubers, spending an undisclosed amount to help cover the production and marketing costs for a number of new shows. \u201cWe want to invest in people who understand the environment,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said.", "These investments are part of a broader effort to quell the long-simmering revolt among YouTube creators. \u201cThey have the recognition so they\u2019re kind of halfway there,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said, \u201cbut how do we give them the same options or the same economics that they would be able to get in other places?\u201d", "The goal is to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley and Hollywood, to turn YouTube stars into just plain stars. To help get them there, Ms. Wojcicki has led a major marketing push \u2014 YouTube\u2019s first \u2014 with billboards, magazine ads and even traditional TV commercials for some of its most popular celebrities. She has also been wooing potential advertisers. During her first few months on the job, she met with representatives of a variety of major companies, including PepsiCo, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Unilever.", "In the past, when advertisers bought packages on YouTube, they never knew quite where their ads would appear \u2014 a big problem, given the wide range of material on the site. Ms. Wojcicki is trying to solve that in part with a new product called Google Preferred, which allows companies to target the site\u2019s best-performing content across a variety of categories. Early signs have been encouraging: YouTube\u2019s anticipated advertising revenue for 2014 is up 40 percent from last year\u2019s, according to eMarketer. The net effect of these initiatives is that YouTube is doubling down on its biggest stars. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my struggle with them,\u201d said Brian Robbins, the founder of AwesomenessTV. \u201cLook, if you guys want to get into this business, you have to make bets and you have to market those bets and you have to get lucky. That\u2019s show business, and it\u2019s exactly the opposite of their business: \u2018We don\u2019t promote anything; we let the community decide.\u2019 \u201d", "It\u2019s a logical move for the company, but not without risk. The power of YouTube is bound up in its grass-roots, democratic identity \u2014 in the possibility that a group of college students in China can upload a goofy video in their dorm room that will be seen by millions of people all over the world. YouTube\u2019s multitude of smaller creators and hobbyists may not be attracting advertising dollars to the site, but, taken together, they give the site its defining feature: its towering scale. Without them, YouTube would no longer be YouTube.", "While I was in San Bruno, I sat in on a meeting in a small conference room about the beta version of Music Key. A group of marketing executives and engineers \u2014 a few with \u201cplay\u201d button stickers on their laptops \u2014 were gathered around a table, listening to a run-through of the early numbers: how many sign-up requests, how many mentions on social media, how much news coverage. Ms. Wojcicki was seated at the head of the table, not so much directing the conversation as guiding it with questions and suggestions.", "Most of the talk revolved around the feedback YouTube had received from its partners and users and the changes the company might make to the service in response. It struck me as unusual that a company would introduce such a major product with so much fanfare, then immediately begin discussing how to tinker with it.", "I asked Ms. Wojcicki about it later, after a party honoring YouTube employees who were promoted in recent months. \u201cWhenever we launch a product, there\u2019s always something we didn\u2019t expect,\u201d she said. \u201cThings are always changing.

The trend spreads far beyond the names you know, like Uber and Snapchat.", "It is not just about apocalyptic valuations. Companies are going from zero to billion-dollar valuations faster than ever before, despite a lack of revenue and, perhaps, even a market plan. In the frenzy, ideas that once were discarded as failures are being recycled into billion-dollar start-ups. Remember, same-day grocery delivery is nothing new.

Uber is also being banned in some countries, like Spain, has a bad public relations problem of late, and the business is at heart a commodity that anyone can mimic. Not only that, but taxis are fighting back by starting their own app services and there are significant competitors like Lyft.", "With all of these issues, the only way that the Uber valuation works is as a bet that Uber will be able to induce more people to take taxis, expand to ride-sharing and even replace cars. Still, this bet supposes that Uber is a category killer and that only the biggest, fastest-growing company will survive. Bill Gurley, a partner at Benchmark Capital, which is an Uber investor, used this argument to justify the fat valuation.

This is all driving aggressive assumptions in the valuation of start-ups that are deemed to have a good idea. That may be a small number of firms. But they are setting off a valuation feeding frenzy.", "Still, the spree of billion-dollar valuations in the past few weeks shows us that something more is going on.

That includes Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners. But even the storied Kleiner Perkins is struggling to keep up.", "Yet every venture capital firm is trying to stay alive and in the game. And the only way to do so is to ride the herd and hope that you have the next Facebook.

Venture capitalists are rushing to get in on the new, new thing, which just happens to be mostly apps and Uber knockoffs.", "In this market, the crazy valuations are just the price of survival for venture capital firms. That\u2019s how an online grocer like Instacart or WeWork can have billion-dollar valuations. These companies may have ideas that work, and if they do, the payoff is perhaps another Facebook. But more likely, everyone is overestimating market share and pushing assumptions to even get the privilege of investing.", "So where does that leave us? It means that Uber may end up justifying its huge valuation. Certainly, a lucky few in Silicon Valley will make billions of dollars. But the same Ubernomics is being applied across the board.

Wire transfers move faster, with some being settled in hours, but they cost significantly more, and are still not instant.", "Last year, big banks helped scuttle a plan that would have expedited the A.C.H. system, in part because it would have jeopardized the fees they earn from wire transfers. Large banks are experimenting with faster transfer systems, like QuickPay from JPMorgan Chase, but these are generally instant only between customers of certain banks.", "CBW went to work on the problem by using the debit card networks that power A.T.M. cash dispensers. People use debit cards to make payments or withdraw cash from their accounts, but Mr. Ramamurthi\u2019s team engineered a system so that a business could collect a customer\u2019s debit card number and use it to make an instant payment directly into the customer\u2019s account \u2014 or into the account of a customer of almost any other bank in the country. This costs the customer a few dollars, but is still significantly cheaper than a wire transfer, which generally costs $10 to $40.", "A few other companies offer a similar service, but they are not banks, and most have less reach than CBW\u2019s program. Some health insurance companies already use CBW\u2019s instant payments to disburse claims payments.", "The process of sending money internationally is even more cumbersome. Most American banks use a few so-called correspondent banks to wire money overseas, requiring multiple steps, each one adding fees and eating up time. To avoid this gantlet, Mr. Ramamurthi flew to India and Mexico and struck deals with banks to accept transfers directly from CBW and deliver the money the same day.

In the last quarter, the bank earned $60,000 from its loans, and $720,000 from the rest of its business, up from around $57,000 in the years before the new owners took over.", "Executives at big banks grumble that the sorts of innovations that CBW is trying are possible only because regulators don\u2019t watch smaller banks closely, and that regulators would never let larger banks try such untested methods. In the past, a number of banks that have worked with start-ups were slapped by regulators for allowing problematic transactions. So far, at least, CBW has not been on the receiving end of any such regulatory action, according to government records.", "Early on, Mr. Ramamurthi said, he realized that he had to dedicate much of his programming muscle to finding new ways to spot questionable transactions. He has hired a dozen engineers, who mostly work out of Topeka. They have developed a back-end system that can almost instantly rate the risk of any transaction by looking at 20 to 40 factors, including a customers\u2019 transaction history and I.P., address where the transaction originated. It was this system that Ms. McQuerry, the former Fed official, praised as the \u201cbiggest idea\u201d at the recent bank conference.", "Much of the initial work on these projects has been done by a technology company called Yantra, which Mr. Ramamurthi founded in 2012 to build software that could be introduced through CBW. This year, he opened a Yantra office in Lawrence, Kan., the home of the University of Kansas. The office occupies a storefront that had housed a hookah bar.", "Yantra and CBW have tried many of their new systems with other tech start-ups. The instant money transfers are used by Omney, a Silicon Valley payments firm, and Moven, which allows customers to sort transactions and spend money with a wave of a smartphone.", "But Mr. Ramamurthi and Ms. Padmanabhan are eager to do the biggest work through CBW. Within the bank, one of the most significant projects is creating \u201ccontextual\u201d debit and credit cards, which can be set for particular purchases, such as those at specific stores, or at specific times.

Much is tepid and didactic, but some things are amusing. Nobutaka Aozaki makes portraits of people using a black marker to add their distinctive features to the yellow smiley face on plastic shopping bags. In a triptych of video self-portraits that she made in an airplane lavatory, Nina Katchadourian lip-syncs to a Bee Gees song. A video by William Lamson in which at certain points he appears to be standing on the calm surface of the Delaware River has a transcendentalist vibe. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

It examines its subject from several fruitful angles, including unflattering ones, interspersed with excellent labels, relevant objects of art and especially design, clips from famous films and videos both didactic and artistic. Its main flaw: dim lighting dictated by fragile materials means that some shoes are most visible in the catalog. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

It\u2019s a quieter sort of exhibition, exemplified by the under-the-radar entrance of Sargent\u2019s \u201cLady Agnew of Lochnaw.\u201d It\u2019s also a rangier show, one that isn\u2019t as identifiably Scottish as the Mauritshuis works were Dutch \u2014 even considering the commanding Sir Henry Raeburn portrait of a kilted Macdonell clan chief. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, 212-288-0700, frick.org.

While the work\u2019s pursuit of newness \u2014 moving parts, mirrored surfaces and glowing lights \u2014 wears thin, the seamless pairing of exhibition and architecture is perfect. Both seem alternately radical and quaint. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org.

It also suggests that both artists have long been hidden in plain sight: Krasner as the spouse of an art celebrity, Lewis as a black artist whose paintings were more formal than political. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)", "\u2605 Jewish Museum: \u2018Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power\u2019 (through March 22) The first museum show devoted to the life and art collection of the cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein is a master class in modernism-as-marketing \u2014 one that comes with a strong female perspective on 20th-century visual culture. It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

The evidence is there in this magnificently complex show of art from parts of the Middle East, or as the Met prefers to call it, the Near East, that now include Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. The exchange of materials, ideas and beliefs traced in shipwreck-salvaged objects here speak of a world as globally networked as our own. The wars depicted in Assyrian relief panels are as horrific as those being fought on the same turf today. Look at any precious thing in the show \u2014 a Babylonian gold pendant, a Phoenician ivory carving \u2014 and know that their equivalents are being looted and sent to destinations unknown today. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)", "Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Bartholomeus Spranger: Splendor and Eroticism in Imperial Prague\u2019 (through Feb. 1) This show is intriguing as much for the story it tells of an eventful and extraordinarily fortunate career as for the works on view, which range from pictures of standard Christian subjects to extravagantly theatrical images of pagan sex and revelry. Working in Prague for the Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II, Bartholomeus Spranger (1546-1611) painted and drew Mannerist-style allegories involving nude and nearly nude gods and goddesses athletically entwined in anatomically improbable positions. His images were copied by expert engravers and disseminated in immense quantities throughout Europe. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)", "\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection\u2019 (through Feb. 16) This no-strings-attached gift of 81 Cubist works more than lives up to expectations. Concentrating on the four horsemen of the Cubist apocalypse (Braque, Gris, L\u00e9ger and Picasso), it outlines the style\u2019s heady transformation of art while giving the museum a foundation in modernism commensurate with its holdings in other eras. It\u2019s a stunning show and thrilling event. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)", "\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Grand Design: Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Renaissance Tapestry\u2019 (through Jan. 11) The Met presents its third spectacular show of European tapestries in a dozen years and its first to concentrate on a single artist, the polymath Pieter Coecke van Aelst. It may repeatedly make you gasp, whether at the size or realness of the images, their human dramas and sumptuous surfaces, or simply the immense open space that forms the exhibition\u2019s spine. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)", "Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Making Pottery Art: The Robert A. Ellison Jr. Collection of French Ceramics (ca. 1880-1910)\u2019 (through March 15) Nearly all the 40 works in this show \u2014 from a collection recently donated to the museum \u2014 are in a traditional form of vases, bowls and platters. They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art. What they share is a love for processes and materials and a candid way with the human touch. Most intriguing of all is a curiously clunky small vase by Paul Gauguin, who might have been the George Ohr of European ceramics if he\u2019d stuck with it. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

The 40-minute movie is an instance of institutional critique, an art genre that tries to expose and subvert the workings of the capitalist art market. Specifically, it\u2019s about the scandalous trade in furniture produced for Chandigarh, the utopian city in northern India designed by Le Corbusier and his team and built between 1951 and 1965. Although visually and emotionally captivating, it leaves obscure details that a more conventional documentary would bring to light. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)", "\u2605 Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Thomas Hart Benton\u2019s \u201cAmerica Today\u201d Mural Rediscovered\u2019 (through April 19) The prickly American Regionalist Thomas Hart Benton had his share of detractors. But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

The ostensible idea of this show is to give people an opportunity to officially retire from making art and to ceremonially discard works of art they own but no longer want. Unloaded works are displayed along with jazzy signs painted by Mr. Smith on all kinds of surfaces. One proclaims, \u201cJoseph Beuys conclusive proof not everyone is an artist.\u201d 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 718-784-2084, ps1.org.

The show features only drawings and oil studies, but it provides a lucid and revelatory summary of his sensibility and achievement. Rousseau loved nature and drawing with equal passion, and this exhibition is suffused with a determination to explore all that is both ardent and brilliant. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org.

It includes her underappreciated works on paper alongside sculptural tableaus that combine woodcarving and assemblage (for instance, \u201cThe Family,\u201d a funky nativity scene from 1969 that is dominated by a neon-haloed, heavily bedazzled Virgin). It could have done more, however, to explore her Latin American folk-art influences and Venezuelan roots, which deserve at least as much scrutiny as her ties to American Pop art. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, 212-831-7272, elmuseo.org.

A Founder\u2019s Vision\u2019 (through Feb. 8) Paying tribute to museum founder Aileen Osborn Webb (1892-1979), a well-connected philanthropist, patron of the arts and, in the museum\u2019s new parlance, a \u201cmaker,\u201d this collection show rich in midcentury objects also brings to life Mrs. Webb\u2019s craft-related activities and organizations beyond the museum. (She had founded the American Craft Council in 1939 and, before that, organized cooperatives of craftspeople up the Hudson in Putnam County during the Depression.) With her vision of a museum connected to various networks and marketplaces, Mrs. Webb affirmed craft \u2014 or \u201cmaking,\u201d or whatever you call it \u2014 as a deeply social activity and a source of economic self-empowerment. 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org.

But in the years around 1940, he must have felt he was living a nightmare. He and his wife of more than four decades separated. He underwent debilitating surgery for cancer. During World War II, he fled south to Nice, only to have that city threatened with bombardment. Through everything, he worked on. It is this Matisse \u2014 the invalid, insomniac, night-worker and waking dreamer \u2014 we meet in the marvelous, victory-lap show that has arrived in New York from London, trailing light, praise and lines around the block. 212-708-9400, moma.org; admission is by timed tickets.

Their familiar yet startlingly altered forms \u2014 including playpens, sinks and easy chairs \u2014 and truncated human limbs and bodies, have a sharpness that continually bring us up short, conjuring memories both private and shared, including the attacks of Sept. 11. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

In each case, however, the pieces are by Ms. Sturtevant herself, who spent much of a long career adopting and adapting the art and styles of others to create a body of work entirely her own, one which raises questions about the value of art, about the hows and whys of producing it, and about the degrees to which quasi-replication can be an exercise in flattery, parody, objectivity, originality and love. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

This entertaining show includes 136 original drawings and paintings and has 23 video versions of films directed by Mr. Jones showing in whole or in parts in a screening room and on monitors throughout. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us.

Except for a large picture of his wife, Edith, in a colorful striped dress, Schiele\u2019s works on canvas are dark and turgid. But his drawings are nimble and nuanced. Working on paper with pencil, charcoal, ink, gouache, watercolor and crayons, he portrayed himself and others with infectious avidity.

At just 20 works or so, it\u2019s not exactly comprehensive. It is, however, thoroughly immersive. The installation, in the Rubin\u2019s skylit top-floor galleries, evokes the structure of an Indian temple with a combination of large and small spaces; it has an open central area of paintings, intimate nooks for sculpture and a \u201csanctum\u201d of watercolors.

It\u2019s generally more droll than laugh-out-loud funny.

Philip Johnson and John Burgee were proposing a suave 4.2 million-square-foot ensemble of four skyscrapers that would help \u201cclean up\u201d the surrounding urban squalor, and they favored an open square at the center of their project. The Municipal Art Society protested the proposal by asking for alternatives to replace the Times Tower. The dispute proved a turning point in New York\u2019s urban history and, more broadly, in American architectural history, as the postmodernism of the Johnson towers gave way to a highly eclectic, free-for-all postmodernism devoid of his mansards or triumphal arches. 39 Battery Place, Lower Manhattan, 212-968-1961, skyscraper.org.

The tensions and collusions between the brightly striped or floral fabrics and the darker, quasi-expressionistic paint handling are elegant, dynamic and wry.

In paintings from the mid-1950s, she is a odalisque in Turkish costume, in tribute to Picasso\u2019s great rival Matisse (who died in 1954) and to Delacroix, whose harem fantasy \u201cWomen of Algiers in Their Apartment\u201d inspired a substantial and varied group of Picasso paintings and etchings.

Carl Andre was one of Minimalism\u2019s founders. This career survey of his low-to-the-ground modular sculptures looks terrific in Dia\u2019s sonorous, sunlight-washed spaces.

This spicy, tightly edited midcareer survey starts with her sardonically funny, Ashcan-style pictures of Amazons in revolt from that time. It then moves through the continuously experimental painting and sculpture she has done since, work in which the very definition of portraiture and history painting are exploded.

It depicts Strand as a modernist turned humanist, and a photographer who was just as much a cinephile. Drawing from the Philadelphia museum\u2019s sizable Paul Strand Collection (most of it acquired since 2010), this show of some 250 prints takes in the full sweep of his career and some three-quarters of the 20th century.

Besides the obvious toll this takes on your personal well-being, it can also have an impact on the health of your business. Overextended teams often spend too much time on triage, which steals time from innovation and out-of-the-box thinking.", "We faced this problem at RJMetrics about two years ago during a period of rapid customer growth. We had lots of upgrades and new releases in the works (we help online companies use their data to make better decisions), but they consisted almost entirely of incremental improvements to what we were already offering. We could feel ourselves shifting from a proactive innovation engine to a reactive feature mill. We struggled with how to play the short game of pleasing our customers without sacrificing the long game of building innovative products.", "This struggle is certainly not a new one. Business best-sellers like \u201cThe Innovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d have been dissecting it for decades. Some companies have found creative ways to keep their teams innovating, such as Google\u2019s early policy encouraging employees to \u201cspend 20 percent of their time working on what they think will most benefit Google.\u201d We experimented with a similar 20 percent time policy, but everyone was just too busy \u2014 most of us opted to spend our 20 percent time on the same things we would have been working on anyway!", "Then, inspired by our friends at tech innovator Shutterstock, we decided to try a different approach: dedicating a 24-hour period every quarter to working on experimental projects. This \u201chackathon\u201d introduced new ideas that have reshaped our product plans, our market strategy and, most importantly, our sense of what is possible.", "The quarterly hackathons have become a cornerstone of our culture and the single largest disruptor of our \u201cproduct road map.\u201d Now, at any given time, it\u2019s not uncommon for more than half of the work being done by our product and engineering teams to have been inspired by hackathon projects.", "These hackathons are internal events that are open only to team members at RJMetrics. They run from noon on a Thursday to noon the next day, and during that time, all normal work \u2014 other than time-sensitive customer support \u2014 is expected to stop for participants.", "At the conclusion, each team provides a five-minute presentation of its project. Everyone who views these presentations, including team members who did not participate, can cast votes in the style of instant runoff voting. Teams can be any size and any mix of roles, but members can\u2019t vote for their own teams.", "The point is to change the way we think about how we invest our time. This can manifest itself in a number of ways. To some, the most impact can be made by building a small feature that helps our clients right away. This may not seem disruptive, but if it changes our understanding of how useful these changes can be and how quickly they can be implemented, it can cause us to prioritize more like them.", "Others choose to focus on new ways our product can be used. In an early hackathon, Matt Monihan built a prototype of our \u201cnew chrome\u201d \u2014 a major upgrade to how dashboards are organized and presented in our product. This started a chain reaction that ultimately led to a complete overhaul of our dashboard system and the user interface we use in our product.", "Although the word \u201chackathon\u201d conjures up visions of programmers writing code until the wee hours of the morning, the reality is that opportunities for innovation exist far outside of our engineering team.

It\u2019s another to produce tangible evidence. Our hackathons are a big piece of evidence, and when we choose to hold them \u2014 on days when our team members would otherwise be doing their normal jobs \u2014 says a lot.

Our first-place prize was inspired by the film Brewster\u2019s Millions. The winning team is given a cash prize of a few hundred dollars, with the only stipulation being that they must spend it all in a 24-hour period and report back on what they did. This leads to stories that get people excited about the next hackathon.

Lashkar conducted a proxy war for Pakistan in return for arms, funds, intelligence, and training in combat tactics and communications technology. Initially, Lashkar\u2019s focus was India and Kashmir, the mountainous region claimed by both India and Pakistan.", "But Lashkar became increasingly interested in the West. A Qaeda figure involved in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center was arrested in a Lashkar safe house in 2002. Investigators dismantled a Lashkar network as it plotted a bombing in Australia in 2003 while recruiting, buying equipment and raising funds in North America and Europe. In 2007, a French court convicted in absentia the ringleader, Mr. Mir. He remained at large in Pakistan under ISI protection, investigators say.", "Lashkar\u2019s alliance with the ISI came under strain as some of the militants pushed for a Qaeda-style war on the West.", "As a result, some ISI officers and terror chiefs decided that a spectacular strike was needed to restore Lashkar\u2019s cohesion and burnish its image, according to interviews and court files. The plan called for a commando-style assault in India that could also hit Americans, Britons and Jews there.", "The target was the centerpiece of Indian prosperity: Mumbai.", "Lashkar\u2019s chiefs developed a plot that would dwarf previous operations.", "The lead conspirators were alleged to be Mr. Mir and Mr. Lakhvi, according to interviews and Indian court files, with Mr. Shah acting as a technical wingman, running the communications and setting up the hardware.", "In early 2008, Indian and Western counterterrorism agencies began to pick up chatter about a potential attack on Mumbai. Indian spy agencies and police forces gathered periodic leads from their own sources about a Lashkar threat to the city.", "Starting in the spring, C.I.A. warnings singled out the iconic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and other sites frequented by Westerners, according to American and Indian officials.

There usually is.\u201d", "Not long after the British gained access to his communications, Mr. Shah contacted a New Jersey company, posing online as an Indian reseller of telephone services named Kharak Singh, purporting to be based in Mumbai. His Indian persona started haggling over the price of a voice-over-Internet phone service \u2014 also known as VoIP \u2014 that had been chosen because it would make calls between Pakistan and the terrorists in Mumbai appear as if they were originating in Austria and New Jersey.", "\u201cits not first time in my life i am perchasing in this VOIP business,\u201d Mr. Shah wrote in shaky English, to an official with the New Jersey-based company when he thought the asking price was too high, the GCHQ documents show. \u201ci am using these services from 2 years.\u201d", "Mr. Shah had begun researching the VoIP systems, online security, and ways to hide his communications as early as mid-September, according to the documents. As he made his plan, he searched on his laptop for weak communication security in Europe, spent time on a site designed to conceal browsing history, and searched Google News for \u201cindian american naval exercises\u201d \u2014 presumably so the seagoing attackers would not blunder into an overwhelming force.", "Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist who would survive the Mumbai attacks, watched Mr. Shah display some of his technical prowess. In mid-September, Mr. Shah and fellow plotters used Google Earth and other material to show Mr. Kasab and nine other young Pakistani terrorists their targets in Mumbai, according to court testimony.", "The session, which took place in a huge \u201cmedia room\u201d in a remote camp on the border with Kashmir, was part of an effort to chart the terrorists\u2019 route across the Arabian Sea, to a water landing on the edge of Mumbai, then through the chaotic streets. Videos, maps and reconnaissance reports had been supplied to Mr. Mir by Mr. Headley, the Pakistani-American who scouted targets. \u201cThe gunmen were shown all this data from the reconnaissance,\u201d said Deven Bharti, a top Mumbai police official who investigated the attacks, adding that the terrorists were trained to use Google Earth and global positioning equipment on their own. \u201cKasab was trained to locate everything in Mumbai before he went.\u201d", "If Mr. Shah made any attempt to hide his malevolent intentions, he did not have much success at it. Although his frenetic computer activity was often sprawling, he repeatedly displayed some key interests: small-scale warfare, secret communications, tourist and military locations in India, extremist ideology and Mumbai.", "He searched for Sun Tzu\u2019s \u201cArt of War,\u201d previous terror strikes in India and weather forecasts in the Arabian Sea, typed \u201c4 star hotel in delhi\u201d and \u201ctaj hotel,\u201d and visited mapsofindia.com to pore over sites in and around Mumbai, the documents show.", "Still, the sheer scale of his ambition might have served as a smokescreen for his focus on the city. For example, he also showed interest in Kashmir, the Indian Punjab, New Delhi, Afghanistan and the United States Army in Germany and Canada. He constantly flipped back and forth among Internet porn and entertainment sites while he was carrying out his work. He appeared to be fascinated with the actor Robert De Niro, called up at least one article on the singer Taylor Swift, and looked at funny cat videos. He visited unexplainable.net, a conspiracy theory website, and conducted a search on \u201cbarak obama family + muslim.\u201d", "In late September and again in October, Lashkar botched attempts to send the attackers to Mumbai by sea. During that period, at least two of the C.I.A. warnings were delivered, according to American and Indian officials. An alert in mid-September mentioned the Taj hotel among a half-dozen potential targets, causing the facility to temporarily beef up security. Another on Nov. 18 reported the location of a Pakistani vessel linked to a Lashkar threat against the southern coastal area of Mumbai, where the attack would occur.", "Eventually Mr. Shah did set up the VoIP service through the New Jersey company, ensuring that many of his calls to the terrorists would bear the area code 201, concealing their actual origin. But in November, the company\u2019s owner wrote to the fictitious Indian reseller, Mr. Singh, complaining that no traffic was running on the digital phone network. Mr. Shah\u2019s reply was ominous, according to Indian law enforcement officials, who obtained evidence from the company\u2019s communications records with F.B.I. assistance after the attack.\"Dear Sir,\u201d Mr. Shah replied, \u201ci will send trafic by the end of this month.\u201d", "By Nov. 24, Mr. Shah had moved to the Karachi suburbs, where he set up an electronic \u201ccontrol room\u201d with the help of an Indian militant named Abu Jundal, according to his later confession to the Indian authorities. It was from this room that Mr. Mir, Mr. Shah and others would issue minute-by-minute instructions to the assault team once the attacks began. On Nov. 25, Abu Jundal tested the VoIP software on four laptops spread out on four small tables facing a pair of televisions as the plotters, including Mr. Mir, Mr. Shah and Mr. Lakhvi, waited for the killings to begin.", "In a plan to pin the blame on Indians, Mr. Shah typed a statement of responsibility for the attack from the Hyderabad Deccan Mujahadeen \u2014 a fake Indian organization. Early on Nov. 26, Mr. Shah showed more of his hand: he emailed a draft of the phony claim to an underling with orders to send it to the news media later, according to American and Indian counterterrorism officials.", "Before the attacks started that evening, the documents show, Mr. Shah pulled up Google images of the Oberoi Hotel and conducted Wikimapia searches for the Taj and the Chabad House, the Jewish hostel run by an American rabbi from Brooklyn who would die in the strike along with his pregnant wife. Mr. Shah opened the hostel\u2019s website. He began Googling news coverage of Mumbai just before the attacks began.", "An intercept shows what Mr. Shah was reading, on the news website NDTV, as the killings proceeded.", "\u201cMumbai, the city which never sleeps, was brought to its knees on Wednesday night as it came under an unprecedented multiple terror attack,\u201d the article said. \u201cEven as heavily armed police stormed into Taj Hotel, just opposite the Gateway of India where suspected terrorists were still holed up, blood-soaked guests could be seen carried out into the waiting ambulances.\u201d", "In the United States, Nov. 26 was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. A long presidential election fight was over, and many officials in Washington had already drifted away for their long weekend. Anish Goel, director for South Asia at the National Security Council in the White House, left around 6 a.m. for the eight-hour drive to his parents\u2019 house in Ohio. By the time he arrived, his BlackBerry was filled with emails about the attacks.", "The Pakistani terrorists had come ashore in an inflatable speedboat in a fishermen\u2019s slum in south Mumbai about 9 p.m. local time. They fanned out in pairs and struck five targets with bombs and AK-47s: the Taj, the Oberoi Hotel, the Leopold Cafe, Chabad House, and the city\u2019s largest train station.", "The killing was indiscriminate, merciless, and seemingly unstoppable over three horrific days. In raw, contemporaneous notes by analysts, the eavesdroppers seem to be making a hasty effort to understand the clues from the days and weeks before.", "\u201cAnalysis of Zarrar Shah\u2019s viewing habits\u201d and other data \u201cyielded several locations in Mumbai well before the attacks occurred and showed operations planning for initial entry points into the Taj Hotel,\u201d the N.S.A. document said.", "That viewing history also revealed a longer list of what might have been future targets. M.K. Narayanan, India\u2019s national security adviser at the time, appeared to be concerned about that data from Mr. Shah in discussions with American officials shortly after the attacks, according to the WikiLeaks archive of American diplomatic cables.", "A top secret GCHQ document described the capture of information on targets that Mr. Shah had identified using Google Earth. The analysts seemed impressed by the intelligence haul \u2014 \u201cunprecedented real-time active access in place!\u201d \u2014 one GCHQ document noted. Another agency document said the work to piece the data together was \u201cbriefed at highest levels nationally and internationally, including the US National Security Adviser.\u201d", "As early reports of many casualties came in, Mr. Goel said the focus in Washington shifted to a question already preoccupying the White House: \u201cIs this going to lead to a war between Pakistan and India?\u201d American officials who conducted periodic simulations of how a nuclear conflict could be triggered often began with a terror attack like this one.", "On Nov. 30, Mr. Goel was back at his office, reading a stack of intelligence reports that had accumulated on his desk and reviewing classified electronic messages on a secure terminal.", "Amid the crisis, Mr. Goel, now a senior South Asia Fellow at the New America Foundation, paid little attention to the sources of the intelligence and said that he still knew little about specific operations. But two things stood out, he said: The main conspirators in Pakistan had already been identified. And the quality and rapid pacing of the intelligence reports made it clear that electronic espionage was primarily responsible for the information. \u201cDuring the attacks, it was extraordinarily helpful,\u201d Mr. Goel said of the surveillance.", "But until then, the United States did not know of the British and Indian spying on Mr. Shah\u2019s communications. \u201cWhile I cannot comment on the authenticity of any alleged classified documents, N.S.A. had no knowledge of any access to a lead plotter\u2019s computer before the attacks in Mumbai in November 2008,\u201d said Mr. Hale, the spokesman for the Office of the director of National Intelligence. As N.S.A. and GCHQ analysts worked around the clock after the attacks, the flow of intelligence enabled Washington, London and New Delhi to exert pressure on Pakistan to round up suspects and crack down on Lashkar, despite its alliance with the ISI, according to officials involved. In the stacks of intelligence reports, one name did not appear, Mr. Goel clearly recalls: David Coleman Headley. None of the intelligence streams from the United States, Britain or India had yet identified him as a conspirator.", "Mr. Headley\u2019s many-sided life \u2014 three wives, drug-smuggling convictions and a past as an informant for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration \u2014 would eventually collapse. But for now, he was a free man, watching the slaughter on television in Lahore, Pakistan, according to his later court testimony. At the time, he was with Faiza Outalha, his Moroccan wife, having reconciled with her after moving his Pakistani wife and four children to Chicago.", "Mr. Headley\u2019s unguarded emails reflected euphoria about Lashkar\u2019s success. An exchange with his wife in Chicago continued a long string of incriminating electronic communications by Mr. Headley written in a transparent code, according to investigators and case files. \u201cI watched the movie the whole day,\u201d she wrote, congratulating him on his \u201cgraduation.\u201d", "About a week later, Mr. Headley hinted at his inside information in an email to fellow alumni of a Pakistani military school. Writing about the young terrorists who carried out the mayhem in Mumbai, he said: \u201cYes they were only 10 kids, guaranteed. I hear 2 were married with a daughter each under 3 years old.\u201d His subsequent emails contained several dozen news media photos of the Mumbai siege.", "Almost immediately, Mr. Headley began pursuing a new plot with Lashkar against a Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. He went to Denmark in January and cased the newspaper, meeting and exchanging emails with its advertising staff, according to his later testimony and court records. He sent messages to his fellow conspirators and emailed himself a reconnaissance checklist of sorts, with terms like \u201cCounter-Surveillance,\u201d \u201cSecurity (Armed?)\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Square\u201d \u2014 the site of the newspaper.", "Those emails capped a series of missed signals involving Mr. Headley. The F.B.I. conducted at least four inquiries into allegations about his extremist activity between 2001 and 2008. Ms. Outalha had visited the United States Embassy in Islamabad three times between December 2007 and April 2008, according to interviews and court documents, claiming that he was a terrorist carrying out missions in India.", "Mr. Headley also exchanged highly suspicious emails with his Lashkar and ISI handlers before and after the Mumbai attacks, according to court records and American counterterrorism officials. The N.S.A. collected some of his emails, but did not realize he was involved in terrorist plotting until he became the target of an F.B.I. investigation, officials said.", "That inquiry began in July 2009 when a British tip landed on the desk of a rookie F.B.I. counterterrorism agent in Chicago. Someone named \u201cDavid\u201d at a Chicago pay phone had called two suspects under surveillance in Britain, planning to visit. He had contacted the Britons for help with the plot, according to testimony. Customs and Border Protection used his flight itinerary to identify him while en route, and after further investigation, the F.B.I. arrested him at Chicago O\u2019Hare Airport that October, as he was preparing to fly to Pakistan. For his role in the Mumbai attacks, he pleaded guilty to 12 counts and was sentenced to 35 years in prison.", "After disclosures last year of widespread N.S.A. surveillance, American officials claimed that bulk collection of electronic communications led to Mr. Headley\u2019s eventual arrest. But a government oversight panel rejected claims giving credit to the N.S.A.'s program to collect Americans\u2019 domestic phone call records. Case files and interviews with law enforcement officials show that the N.S.A. played only a support role in the F.B.I. investigation that finally identified Mr. Headley as a terrorist and disrupted the Danish plot.", "The sole surviving attacker of the Mumbai attack, Mr. Kasab, was executed in India after a trial. Although Pakistan denies any role in the attacks, it has failed to charge an ISI officer and Mr. Mir, who were indicted by American prosecutors. Though Mr. Shah and other Lashkar chiefs had been arrested, their trial remains stalled six years after the attack. Mr. Menon, the former Indian foreign secretary, said that a lesson that emerged from the tragedy in Mumbai was that \u201ccomputer traffic only tells you so much.

In Georgia, the ratio of black girls receiving suspensions in the same period compared with white girls was 5 to 1, and in Henry County, that ratio was 2.3 to 1, said J D Hardin, the spokesman for the county\u2019s school district.

The process doesn\u2019t require an attorney, although if a family believes that a student\u2019s civil rights have been violated, they shouldn\u2019t hesitate to contact a civil rights attorney because of cost. \u201cThe law provides for the recovery of reasonable legal fees,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still lawyers who will help.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/us/a-step-by-step-guide-to-berkeleys-many-quirks.html": ["BERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Tom Dalzell looks too strait-laced to be the arbiter of the eccentric.", "Nonetheless, almost two years ago, Mr. Dalzell, 63, set out in his khakis and comfortable shoes to walk every street, alleyway and path and document this city\u2019s material oddities on a website he calls Quirky Berkeley. \u201cThere is a tremendous diversity of thought here,\u201d Mr. Dalzell said. \u201cAnd one of the ways we express our lack of conformity is with the quirky things we put on our houses and in our yards.\u201d", "The rules are simple: no seasonal decorations, and all quirk must be viewable from the street.", "So far, Mr. Dalzell has walked nearly 150 miles and shot some 9,000 photos of rogue garden gnomes who moon passers-by; a four-foot-wide peace sign outside a house long occupied by Wavy Gravy of Woodstock fame and his Hog Farm commune compatriots; dozens of colorful hard hats hanging from a front yard tree; a massive wolf sculpture made from old car parts; a menagerie of animal-shaped mailboxes; a giant metal orange that once served as a roadside refreshment stand but now sits in a wooded side yard; and a variety of wildly painted houses and sculptures.", "Sometimes Mr. Dalzell uses the site to riff on the city\u2019s culture and history.

Third, nothing (as the Buddhists say) is permanent. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll see something really interesting, only to go back a week later to find it gone,\u201d Mr. Dalzell said.", "Still, there are some who view the whole Quirky Berkeley enterprise more as a testament to its creator\u2019s kookiness than its subjects\u2019.", "\u201cWe urban and architectural historians exhibit variants of this strange behavior in cities around the globe,\u201d said Stephen O.

Alas, though, world crude oil prices collapsed, making it less likely that the world will do what the International Energy Agency recently told us we must: keep most of the world\u2019s proven oil and gas reserves in the ground.

China also committed to build by 2030 an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of clean power \u2014 or nearly as much new renewable energy in China as all the electrical capacity in America today.

In addition, Hephaestus created Talos, a bronze giant, to patrol and defend the island of Crete, thus giving us the first war-against-the-robots plot, which has been serviceable ever since.", "As we moved closer to the modern age, we continued to amuse ourselves with tales of proto-robots: brass heads that could talk, man-created golems fashioned out of clay, puppets who came to life, and fake women \u2014 such as Olympia and Copp\u00e9lia of opera and ballet fame. Meanwhile, we were working away at the real thing: Steam-powered automatons date to ancient times; Leonardo da Vinci designed an artificial knight; and the 18th century went overboard on windup animals, birds and manikins that could perform simple actions. The Digesting Duck, introduced in 1738, went further: It appeared to eat, digest and then poop.

Who will buy all the stuff the robots can so endlessly and cheaply churn out? Even seemingly nonthreatening uses of robots can have their hidden downsides.", "But, their promoters say, think of the potential for saving lives! Nanorobots could revolutionize noninvasive surgery.

Jackson, an influential hedge-fund manager, had become fixated on Yahoo and the efforts of its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, to turn around the enormous yet floundering Internet company. It was July 21, 2014, almost exactly two years to the day since Mayer took over, arriving at Yahoo\u2019s headquarters to an unfurled purple carpet and Shepard Fairey-style \u201cHOPE\u201d posters bearing her face. During those 24 months, Mayer eliminated dozens of products and rebooted others. She acquired 41 start-ups and even hired Katie Couric. But just one week earlier, Mayer announced the company\u2019s lowest quarterly earnings in a decade. Jackson argued in his post that Yahoo no longer made sense as an independent entity. Instead, it might be a nice takeover target for one of the tech industry\u2019s Big Four: Apple, Facebook, Amazon or Google.", "Jackson\u2019s conclusion wasn\u2019t based simply on a discouraging quarter. It was a result of an eye-opening calculation he had performed \u2014 what\u2019s known on Wall Street as a sum-of-the-parts valuation. Yahoo had a market value of $33 billion at the time, but that figure owed largely to its stake in Alibaba, the Chinese Internet conglomerate. According to Jackson\u2019s valuation, Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba was worth roughly $37 billion. But if you subtracted that position, the entirety of Yahoo\u2019s core business, all its web products and content sites, actually had a market valuation of negative $4 billion. A conquering company could theoretically buy Yahoo, sell off its Asian assets and absorb its business units free. This sort of sale would make a lot of money for Yahoo\u2019s shareholders, Jackson wrote, even if it meant gutting the company and losing Mayer as C.E.O. after only two years.", "A day after his post, Jackson received an unusual email. A major Yahoo shareholder had written to explain that he and many other investors, along with numerous employees and advertisers, had themselves become extremely frustrated with Mayer. Her turnaround plan, he said, had failed. The start-ups she acquired (most notably the social blogging platform Tumblr, which Yahoo bought for $1.1 billion in 2013) had failed to revive the company\u2019s flat revenues of roughly $5 billion per year. Nor had Mayer succeeded, despite her track record overseeing Google\u2019s search engine, in turning any of Yahoo\u2019s many products into an industry leader. There were also a number of embarrassing management setbacks. The best outcome for Yahoo, the shareholder said, might be to sell the company.", "One day later, on July 23, Jackson published a subsequent Forbes column that outlined parts of the shareholder\u2019s argument. It went viral within the investment community, and in the following days, Jackson fielded several calls from other significant Yahoo investors, including managers of large mutual funds and hedge funds, who encouraged him to continue his campaign. Jackson\u2019s own fund didn\u2019t have the capital to mount an offensive, which would require buying a large stake in Yahoo and using it as leverage to effect changes within management. But he knew someone who might. Jeffrey Smith, who ran an activist fund called Starboard Value, had recently led such a campaign against AOL, leading the company to eliminate its money-losing local news network, Patch. While still on vacation, Jackson looked up Smith\u2019s email on his Bloomberg terminal. Within hours, the two men were on the phone with a handful of associates from Starboard.", "Jackson\u2019s dire calculation of Yahoo\u2019s value would soon be reinforced in the markets. On Sept. 19, Alibaba went public on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $93.89 per share. But as Alibaba\u2019s stock soared, Yahoo\u2019s dropped, an indication that the market seemed to concur with Jackson\u2019s analysis: Yahoo\u2019s core business was worth less than zero dollars. A week later, Smith published an open letter calling for Yahoo to divest itself of its Alibaba assets, return the money to its shareholders and then merge with AOL. Redundancies could be eliminated, thousands of people could be fired and two former Internet superpowers would be downsized into a single and steady (if uninspiring) entity that sold ads against its collective online properties \u2014 news, blogs and Web products like email, maps and weather. \u201cWe trust the board and management will do the right thing for shareholders, even if this may mean accepting AOL as the surviving entity,\u201d Smith wrote.", "Dynamic and wildly profitable Internet companies like Facebook and Google may get most of the attention, but Silicon Valley is littered with firms that just get by doing roughly the same thing year after year \u2014 has-beens like Ask.com, a search engine that no longer innovates but happily takes in $400 million in annual revenue, turning a profit in the process. Mayer, who is 39, was hired to keep Yahoo from suffering this sort of fate. She believed it could again become a top-tier tech firm that enjoyed enormous growth and competed for top talent. And two years in, Mayer, who has a tendency to compare herself with Steve Jobs, wasn\u2019t about to abandon her turnaround plan. On the afternoon of Oct. 21, she entered a web TV studio on Yahoo\u2019s garrisonlike campus to present the company\u2019s latest quarterly results. But the presentation effectively became a response to Starboard\u2019s campaign. Even though Yahoo\u2019s revenue had decreased in five of the past six quarters, Mayer attested that she had \u201cgreat confidence in the strength of our business.\u201d", "Mayer\u2019s resolve was consistent with other remarks she had made at the time, in both public and private. She highlighted various signs of promise. Yahoo\u2019s mobile revenues, while still small, had doubled from the previous year. Display advertising revenue was down 6 percent, but the number of ads sold had actually increased by 24 percent. Yahoo was engaging more mobile users than ever before. Mayer didn\u2019t bother talking about a potential AOL takeover. Her goal was nothing less than to return her company to the level of the Big Four. \u201cWe believe deeply in the future potential of Yahoo,\u201d she said into the camera, \u201cand the transformation we are pursuing to bring an iconic company back to greatness.\u201d", "Generally speaking, there are only a few ways to make money on the Internet. There are e-commerce companies and marketplaces \u2014 think Amazon, eBay and Uber \u2014 that profit from transactions occurring on their platforms. Hardware companies, like Apple or Fitbit, profit from gadgets. For everyone else, though, it more or less comes down to advertising. Social-media companies, like Facebook or Twitter, may make cool products that connect their users, but they earn revenue by selling ads against the content those users create. Innovative media companies, like Vox or Hulu, make money in much the same way, except that they\u2019re selling ads against content created by professionals. Google, which has basically devoured the search business, still makes a vast majority of its fortune by selling ads against our queries.", "Yahoo essentially invented the online-advertising business. In 1994, two graduate students at Stanford, Jerry Yang and David Filo, dreamed up a way to help early users navigate the web. They picked URLs that they each liked \u2014 beginning with around 100 links, including one for Nerf toys and one dedicated to armadillos \u2014 and listed them on a page called \u201cJerry and David\u2019s Guide to the World Wide Web.\u201d Within a year, their guide had to be divided into 19 categories (art, business, etc.) and was generating one million clicks a day. In 1995, the year Yahoo started selling ads, a former company executive estimated that the entire market was about $20 million. By 1997, Yahoo\u2019s ad revenues alone were $70.4 million. The next year, they were $203 million.", "To keep up with the growth, Yahoo quickly expanded beyond its directory to create a multitude of ad-supported products. The company aimed to be all things to all web users, and for most of a decade, it was a wildly successful strategy. In 1997, Yahoo added chat rooms, classified ads and an email service. In 1998, it introduced sports, games, movies, real estate, a calendar, file sharing, auctions, shopping and an address book. Even during the crash of the Internet bubble, a profusion of more traditional advertisers began to migrate from print to digital. The search business, in particular, was growing enormously. In 2002, Yahoo\u2019s first full year monetizing search results with attendant ads, its revenues reached $953 million. In 2003, they eclipsed $1.6 billion. In 2004, they grew again to $3.5 billion. At its peak, Yahoo\u2019s market capitalization reached $128 billion. It was $20 billion larger than Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett\u2019s holding company.", "But this growth obscured a looming problem. While Yahoo was busy enlarging its portfolio, a new generation of start-ups was focusing on perfecting one single product. Soon enough, Yahoo was losing out to eBay in auctions, Google in search and Craigslist in classifieds. Then Facebook came along, replacing Yahoo as the home page for millions of people. The advertising dollars soon followed, and Yahoo\u2019s revenue flattened. Between 2007 and 2012, the company churned through four C.E.O.s. The last of them, Scott Thompson, resigned in disgrace after five months when a large activist shareholder, Dan Loeb, published an open letter accusing him of fabricating a computer-science degree. After Thompson\u2019s resignation, in May 2012, Yahoo was worth less than $20 billion on the public markets.", "As an ad-supported business, Yahoo had only two ways to increase its revenue. It could display more ads by attracting more people to its products \u2014 a plan that would require inventing (or acquiring) new products, improving old products or some combination. Alternately, it could elevate ad prices by upgrading its content. In the opinion of Thompson\u2019s interim successor, Ross Levinsohn, Yahoo would be best positioned as such a \u201cpremium\u201d content company. In Levinsohn\u2019s vision, Yahoo had fallen so far behind its competitors in building successful back-end technology, like real-time advertising auctions and search, that it should cede most of those businesses altogether. In the process, the company could also shed more than half of its 15,000 employees, and home in on its best asset: reach. Some 700 million people still visited Yahoo\u2019s home page every month, making it almost seven times as large as the combined online audiences of The New York Times, The Daily Mail and The Washington Post. Levinsohn believed that offering this audience better content could raise Yahoo\u2019s earnings by up to $2 billion in two years.", "But in Silicon Valley, the big money, and most of the prestige, is in making cool products. This is partly because product businesses, based on technology, are easier to scale than content ones, which require more human labor. It also reflects a cultural bias. The Valley\u2019s greatest companies, from Hewlett-Packard onward, have been built around technological ingenuity. Tech executives know how to hire engineers and designers; they\u2019re less adroit at recruiting editors or producers. When Loeb joined the Yahoo board, he recruited Michael J. Wolf, the former president of MTV, and the two consulted the noted venture capitalist Marc Andreessen about who should become the next C.E.O. of Yahoo. Andreessen made the case for a product executive.", "Loeb\u2019s decision was facilitated by another factor too. At the time, Google was valued at $250 billion; Facebook was worth $100 billion. Loeb opted to refashion Yahoo in their image. And so, in the spring of 2012, Loeb and Wolf began coveting a product C.E.O. The two board members asked the executive recruiter Jim Citrin of Spencer Stuart to approach Marissa Mayer, the wunderkind engineer who oversaw the user interface of Google\u2019s search engine. Citrin cautioned that Mayer, who was among the first 25 people to join Google back in 1999, appeared to be a lifer. She had already earned hundreds of millions of dollars following Google\u2019s 2004 I.P.O. and presumably had her pick of job opportunities. Still, he said he\u2019d reach out to her.", "Unknown to Citrin, however, Mayer was interested in pursuing her own turnaround of sorts. A couple of years earlier, she lost a turf battle to a powerful engineer within Google and was quietly reassigned to oversee Google Maps and other so-called local products. Mayer tried to spin the move positively, but that became harder after Larry Page, one of the company\u2019s founders, regained the role of C.E.O. and removed Mayer from the group of executives reporting to him. According to one friend, Mayer had been observing the Yahoo vacancy for months. After Citrin called her cellphone, she told him she was interested.", "The challenge of redirecting Yahoo was immense, but the next C.E.O. would have one tremendous advantage. In 2005, Yahoo invested $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in a little-known company called Alibaba. It turned out to be a remarkably prescient bet. Alibaba is commonly referred to as the Google of China, but it\u2019s something more akin to the country\u2019s version of Google, eBay and Amazon all in one \u2014 a web portal that provides e-commerce and business to business services. Weeks before Mayer was hired in July 2012, Yahoo sold half its 40 percent stake back to Alibaba for $7.1 billion. As a part of that deal, Alibaba was offered incentives to hold an initial public offering within the next few years. Suddenly the easiest way for Wall Street to make a bet on Alibaba \u2014 a hot start-up in a hot market, guaranteed an I.P.O. \u2014 was through an investment in Yahoo.", "The arrangement ensured that Yahoo\u2019s stock, for the next two years, would be tied to the performance of Alibaba rather than that of its own core business. This was a tremendous benefit to an incoming C.E.O., essentially offering a two-year air cover. Without having to manage the company\u2019s stock price, inevitably one of a chief executive\u2019s most distracting tasks, Mayer could focus on acquiring start-ups, jump-starting products and making strategic changes. Moreover, in two years she would be able to use the Alibaba cash to reinvest in her putative growth. When Citrin offered the job, she accepted.", "Turning around a technology company has been historically rare. Tech companies invent new ways of doing things, but as they expand, often metastatically, they tend to shift their focus toward protecting their booming business rather than investing in new disruptive ones. Inevitably some newer company, usually financed by a wealthy venture-capital firm, beats them to it. It\u2019s a cycle that happens in all industries, but everything moves faster in technology \u2014 too fast, usually, to allow for turnarounds. Steve Jobs may have resurrected Apple, and IBM was able to reinvent itself from a P.C. company into a business-services firm. But the next best example is probably Jeffery Boyd\u2019s deliverance of Priceline \u2014 not exactly a titan of the industry. And his plan was almost a total restart, including dialing down the \u201cname your price\u201d pitch line and switching the company\u2019s strategy from air travel to hotel bookings.", "In order to revive Yahoo as a product company, Mayer would try to treat it as a giant start-up itself. Hours after entering Yahoo\u2019s complex on the morning of July 17, 2012, she set up her computer to log into the company\u2019s code base so she could personally make changes, much like the founder of a tiny tech firm might do. During her second week, she devised a weekly all-staff update, called \u201cF.Y.I.,\u201d that she would host at URL\u2019s, a cafeteria on the Yahoo campus. (Employees pronounce it \u201cEarl\u2019s.\u201d) She also tried to make the company a more desirable place to work. Yahoo employees, until then confined largely to BlackBerrys, were given iPhones or Samsungs as their company phones. All meals at URL\u2019s would henceforth be free. For years, the partitions between the bathroom stalls didn\u2019t go all the way to the wall. People hung toilet paper to try to fill the gaps. Soon after Mayer\u2019s arrival, new partitions were installed.", "Mayer saw her plan as a return, in a sense, to Yahoo\u2019s original mission. Yahoo grew in popularity and value during the late 1990s, when it was the most user-friendly way to peruse the World Wide Web. Now, Mayer believed, it could ride the shift from P.C.s to smartphones and make the mobile web-browsing experience more user-friendly too. Yahoo, in other words, would need to become a really great apps company. Mayer wanted to narrow its product portfolio down to approximately a dozen from more than 100. She and her C.M.O., Kathy Savitt, did some market research and found a list of common user activities on mobile devices. She called this list the \u201cDaily Habits,\u201d and they included news-reading, checking weather, reading email and photo-sharing. Mayer was determined to ensure that Yahoo had the best mobile app for each.", "This was going to be difficult. Previous Yahoo C.E.O.s had underinvested in mobile-app development, plowing money into advertising technology and web tools instead. A couple of days into the job, Mayer was having lunch at URL\u2019s when an employee walked up to her and introduced himself as Tony. \u201cI\u2019m a mobile engineer,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI\u2019m on the mobile team.\u201d", "Mayer responded to Tony, \u201cGreat, how big is our mobile team?\u201d After some back and forth, Tony replied that there were \u201cmaybe 60\u201d engineers. Mayer was dumbfounded. Facebook, for instance, had a couple of thousand people working on mobile. When she queried the engineering management department, it responded that Yahoo had roughly 100. \u201cLike an actual hundred,\u201d Mayer responded, \u201cor like 60 rounded up to 100 to make me feel better?\u201d The department responded that it was more like 60.", "Companies like Facebook and Google are known for their fast-paced product updates. Yahoo, by contrast, was sluggish. Yahoo Mail, with its 30 billion emails a day, was arguably the company\u2019s most important product. But despite the decline in desktop email use, Yahoo hadn\u2019t built mail apps for smartphones. It had simply made the Yahoo Mail website usable on smaller mobile screens. Now an app was going to be designed for four separate platforms, including both Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s mobile operating systems. During her first meeting with the executive in charge of Mail and Messenger, Vivek Sharma, Mayer said that she wanted it done by December. (Mayer declined to comment for this article.)", "Mayer subsequently immersed herself in the redesign. Months into her tenure, she was meeting with Sharma\u2019s team regularly in a conference room that started to look more like a design studio: projectors hung from the ceiling, rendering screens displayed on the wall. All around, dozens of foam core boards were pinned with ideas. Mayer would regularly interrogate designers about the minutest details of display and user experience. By early December, one day before Yahoo Mail was set to release, she convened a meeting at Phish Food, a conference room in the executive building of Yahoo\u2019s campus, to talk about the product\u2019s color. For months, the team had settled on blue and gray. If users were going to read emails on their phones all day long, the thinking went, it was best to choose the most subtly contrasting hues. But now, Mayer explained, she wanted to change the colors to various shades of purple, which she believed better suited Yahoo\u2019s brand.", "Some around the table were encouraged that their C.E.O. refused to release a product that she was less than fully satisfied with. If changing a few pixels led to an increase of 0.01 percent more users, that could translate to millions of dollars in ad revenue. Others, however, were visibly furious. According to one senior executive, Sharma\u2019s body language changed the moment Mayer issued her request. He looked deflated. Altering the color of such an intricate product would require that members of his team spend all night adjusting colors in thousands of places. He slumped off and prepared to tell his staff the bad news.", "In reality, Yahoo needed to move fast. And Mayer, who had begun her tenure while six months pregnant, tried to lead by example; she often slept only four hours a night and thrived on the breakneck pace. In her first months on the job, she unveiled a new version of Flickr, Yahoo\u2019s photo-sharing social network, and a new Yahoo home page. Then Mayer overhauled the same products again, even as the company released new apps like Yahoo Weather and Yahoo News Digest. She outbid Facebook by a couple hundred million dollars to buy Tumblr. In the three quarters before Mayer\u2019s arrival, Yahoo\u2019s home-page team tested five new looks. In Mayer\u2019s first two months, she prototyped 37.", "Mayer also announced that she wanted to repair Yahoo\u2019s search engine, her specialty at Google. \u201cI don\u2019t see a reason why our search share should fall below 15 percent, which is where it roughly is today,\u201d she told employees at an F.Y.I. \u201cI also don\u2019t see a reason why it can\u2019t climb back up to the 20 percent that we had.\u201d According to one executive, she told a group of six vice presidents that she wanted a redesigned search product unveiled by the end of the year. \u201cTell me if you can do it,\u201d she instructed the group. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll find people who can.\u201d", "Largely owing to Mayer\u2019s age and Google pedigree, her hiring had initially brought her overwhelmingly positive press during her first months at Yahoo. An article by Dan Frommer, an influential beat reporter for the industry news site ReadWrite, summed up a popular view: \u201cThis is a great move for Yahoo, which has stewed in mediocrity for years.\u201d And by the beginning of 2013, just six months into the job, Mayer\u2019s turnaround seemed to be ahead of schedule. In March, Yahoo\u2019s stock rose to $22 per share, and Mayer added a tool to the company\u2019s internal network that allowed employees to view their stock compensation.", "At a board meeting in April, Mayer admitted that she had not yet identified a \u201cbreakthrough product,\u201d but she reminded those in attendance that Steve Jobs didn\u2019t come up with the iPod until five years into his second tenure at Apple. At an F.Y.I. around that time, she read a speech that Jobs gave to Apple employees at the beginning of his turnaround. Afterward, channeling Jobs, Mayer told hundreds of employees sitting at URL\u2019s, \u201cOur purpose is to inspire and delight our users, to build beautiful services, things that people love to use and enjoy using every day, and that\u2019s our opportunity.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe are the world\u2019s largest start-up. We have $5 billion in revenue, but it can and will go in the blink of an eye if we don\u2019t do our jobs.\u201d", "At Google, Mayer made her name as the executive who helped determine how products would look and work. She was less sure, however, about how to monetize them. At Yahoo, her most important hire was supposed to be someone who could figure all that out for her while also running Yahoo\u2019s 1,000-plus-person sales force. Mayer did not have to search far. Within weeks of becoming C.E.O., she received an email from Henrique de Castro, the fashionable Portuguese president of Google\u2019s media, mobile and platforms businesses. De Castro asked if she was available for a dinner and suggested a place. Mayer countered with a quieter venue and even arranged to get a table in the back.", "Over dinner, de Castro impressed Mayer with his knowledge of Yahoo\u2019s business and his specific proposals for building it. For several mornings in a row, the two exchanged emails to negotiate de Castro\u2019s salary. Every night, Mayer would make an offer, only to wake up to a reply with a list of more conditions. Eventually de Castro negotiated himself a contract worth around $60 million, depending on the value of Yahoo stock. The Yahoo board was aghast, but Mayer argued that de Castro had to be compensated for the unvested Google stock he was abandoning. Anyway, she said, his talent ensured that Yahoo would reap many multiples of his salary in return. Henrique de Castro would pay for himself.", "Mayer\u2019s turnaround plan may have been predicated on building irresistible products to sell ads against. But hundreds of employees at Yahoo already worked on a side of the business that generated advertising revenues the more traditional way \u2014 by creating or licensing content, from beauty tips and Kardashian stories to daily videos on the financial markets and scripted comedies. For most of her first year at Yahoo, Mayer hardly paid any attention to this group, which generated $1.5 billion in annual revenue. This began to change in the spring of 2013, however, when Mayer attended the NewFronts, the annual event in New York where digital-content businesses display their coming programming for ad-agency buyers. Mayer kicked off the show by reading a corporate script from a prompter in an office-casual cardigan. Her talk felt woefully out-of-place at a splashy event whose other attendees included Ed Helms, the actor, and the Lumineers, the popular rock group. Still, the glamour of the event seemed to ignite Mayer\u2019s interest in content, and within a month she asked that all programming decisions be run by her.", "While some at the company favored upgrading Yahoo\u2019s content, there was a fear that Mayer, who preferred to read Town and Country and wear Oscar de la Renta couture, might undermine the company\u2019s middle-American brand. To some, she also seemed to lack the instincts of a media executive. During a breakfast with Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, Mayer asked if there might be any partnership opportunities between the magazine and Shine, Yahoo\u2019s site for women. According to Mayer\u2019s own telling of the story to top Yahoo executives, Wintour looked appalled. Shine, with its 500 million monthly page views, appealed to a mass audience, not a narrow and affluent one. Nevertheless, Mayer quickly became infatuated with the idea that Yahoo could attract more sophisticated consumers. She began pushing for deputies to commission high-quality shows, the way Netflix was doing with \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d One Yahoo executive was forced to explain that only a company that sold subscriptions to consumers could expect to make money off such expensive productions.", "Reared in Google\u2019s data-obsessed culture, Mayer tended to require countless tests about user preferences before making an important product decision. But when it came to media strategy, she seemed perfectly comfortable going with her gut. As a teenager in Wisconsin, she grew up sneaking into the living room to watch \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and occasionally recited sketches during meetings; in April 2013, Yahoo paid an estimated $10 million per year for the \u201cS.N.L.\u201d archives. Even though the actress Gwyneth Paltrow had created a best-selling cookbook and popular lifestyle blog, Mayer, who habitually asked deputies where they attended college, balked at hiring her as a contributing editor for Yahoo Food. According to one executive, Mayer disapproved of the fact that Paltrow did not graduate college.", "Over the summer, Mayer greenlighted a plan to hire Katie Couric, the former anchor of \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d and former co-host of the \u201cToday\u201d show. As was the case with de Castro, Couric put the idea in Mayer\u2019s head herself after the two shared a stage at an advertising event in the Turks and Caicos. Couric, who was then hosting a failing daytime talk show on ABC, told Mayer she wanted to do something big for Yahoo. Couric had previously worked with the company to produce a video series, \u201cKatie\u2019s Take,\u201d in which she interviewed experts on topics like health and parenting. Despite Couric\u2019s star power, users didn\u2019t click on her videos, no matter how prominently editors positioned them on the page. Mayer ignored those metrics, and in mid-2013, she named Couric Yahoo\u2019s \u201cglobal anchor\u201d in a deal worth more than $5 million a year.", "Yahoo also lured a slate of expensive journalists to helm a series of new \u201cdigital magazines.\u201d Mayer hired David Pogue, The New York Times\u2019s gadget columnist, to be the editor of Yahoo Tech. She personally recruited Joe Zee, the creative director of Elle, telling him to consider Yahoo his \u201cplayground.\u201d Mayer\u2019s team asked the former Page Six editor Paula Froelich to run Yahoo Travel; the makeup star Bobbi Brown would oversee Yahoo Beauty. And Yahoo Shine, with its $45 million in yearly revenue, was shot down.", "For the NewFronts event in June 2014, Mayer wore a designer dress and introduced a slate of buzzy new shows that she personally approved. Behind the scenes, though, her hands-on strategy was backfiring. \u201cI just think it is a strategic mistake to take on big media where they are strongest,\u201d Jonah Peretti, the C.E.O. of Buzzfeed, wrote me in an email earlier this year, referring to her focus on stars, scripted shows and glossy content. \u201cEspecially when there is a huge open space at the intersection of media and tech where it is hard for other big companies to compete.\u201d Couric, meanwhile, had done several interviews with high-profile figures, including former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, but Yahoo\u2019s users weren\u2019t clicking on the videos. In May, Yahoo Tech had just nine million visitors, placing it in seventh place among competitors, far behind rivals like CNET and Gizmodo. Yahoo Tech would sometimes go weeks without running a single ad. Yahoo Food was 12th in its market. Yahoo\u2019s display advertising revenues dipped 7 percent during the second quarter of 2014.", "One of the Yahoo board\u2019s hesitations upon hiring Mayer was her relative lack of experience as a manager. While running search at Google, she oversaw 250 people. Mayer liked to spin her demotion by saying that it left her in charge of more than 1,000 staff members, but a majority of them were contractors. Either way, in her haste to turn around Yahoo, this relative inexperience began to surface. Some on the board had hoped that Ross Levinsohn would stay on as C.O.O., but any hope was jettisoned when Mayer asked him to fly from L.A. for a meeting and then stood him up. Mayer\u2019s refusal to delegate became a sticking point, too. She insisted on personally approving every hire. One executive complained to a friend that Mayer spent as much time deliberating Yahoo\u2019s parking policies as she did strategizing over the sale of its Alibaba stock.", "Mayer also had a habit of operating on her own time. Every Monday at 3 p.m. Pacific, she asked her direct reports to gather for a three-hour meeting. Mayer demanded all of her staff across the world join the call, so executives from New York, where it was 6 p.m., and Europe, where it was 11 p.m. or later, would dial in, too. Invariably, Mayer herself would be at least 45 minutes late; some calls were so delayed that Yahoo executives in Europe couldn\u2019t hang up till after 3 a.m. In theory, Mayer kept up with her direct reports through weekly individual meetings. In practice, she often went weeks without seeing them.", "This delinquency eventually became a problem outside Yahoo. At a major advertising event in the South of France, Mayer sat for an interview with Martin Sorrell, the C.E.O. of WPP, one of the world\u2019s largest agencies. In front of a filled auditorium, Sorrell asked Mayer why she did not return his emails. Sheryl Sandberg, he said, always got back to him. Later, Mayer was scheduled for dinner with executives from the ad agency IPG. The 8:30 p.m. meal was inconvenient for the firm\u2019s C.E.O., Michael Roth, but he shuffled his calendar so he could accommodate it. Mayer didn\u2019t show up until 10.", "At F.Y.I.s, Mayer liked to tell employees that she believed in taking risks and that she was unafraid to admit failure. This philosophy worked well for web products but not for strategic hires. Despite the board\u2019s urging, Mayer opted against vetting Henrique de Castro. As a result, she was unaware that de Castro had a poor reputation among his colleagues in Google\u2019s advertising business. Many had derisively called him the Most Interesting Man in the World, in reference to the satirically fatuous spokesman for Dos Equis beer. De Castro had a tendency to make grand, awkwardly worded pronouncements. He was the inspiration for the Twitter handle @HdCYouKnowMe, which posted tweets that straddled the line between reality and parody: \u201cTo incentivize the sales force, you need to hit them with the carrot\u201d and \u201cProduct is like snakes .\u2009.\u2009. slippery \u2014 we need someone with a big hammer.\u201d De Castro\u2019s new Yahoo colleagues got a full dose of his strange locution at the company\u2019s annual sales meeting, in early 2013, when he berated his sales force with a rangy, pedantic speech. (De Castro did not respond to requests for comment.)", "De Castro\u2019s plan for growing Yahoo revenues focused on user-generated content, like the videos available on YouTube or Instagram. The only problem was that Yahoo did not have access to enough user-generated content to support this plan. (Its attempt to acquire Daily Motion, a YouTube clone, had fallen apart.) As Yahoo\u2019s ad revenues continued to decline, de Castro began to alienate his staff and fellow executives. After one of his direct reports gave a presentation about Yahoo\u2019s business in front of some 40 senior executives, de Castro humiliated the person, saying: \u201cI think your strategy\u2019s more of a fantasy. You make it up. You just make it up.\u201d More important, advertising revenue declined in every quarter since he was hired. Within a year, Mayer had personally taken control of Yahoo\u2019s ad team. De Castro would leave the company in January 2014. For about 15 months of work, he would be paid $109 million.", "Mayer\u2019s largest management problem, however, related to the start-up culture she had tried to instill. Early on, she banned working from home. This policy affected only 164 employees, but it was initiated months after she constructed an elaborate nursery in her office suite so that her son, Macallister, and his nanny could accompany her to work each day. Mayer also favored a system of quarterly performance reviews, or Q.P.R.s, that required every Yahoo employee, on every team, be ranked from 1 to 5. The system was meant to encourage hard work and weed out underperformers, but it soon produced the exact opposite. Because only so many 4s and 5s could be allotted, talented people no longer wanted to work together; strategic goals were sacrificed, as employees did not want to change projects and leave themselves open to a lower score.", "One of the uglier parts of the process was a series of quarterly \u201ccalibration meetings,\u201d in which managers would gather with their bosses and review all the employees under their supervision. In practice, the managers would use these meetings to conjure reasons that certain staff members should get negative reviews. Sometimes the reason would be political or superficial. Mayer herself attended calibration meetings where these kinds of arbitrary judgments occurred. The senior executives who reported to Mayer would join her in a meeting at Phish Food and hold up spreadsheets of names and ratings. During the revamping of Yahoo Mail, for instance, Kathy Savitt, the C.M.O., noted that Vivek Sharma was bothering her. \u201cHe just annoys me,\u201d she said during the meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be around him.\u201d Sharma\u2019s rating was reduced. Shortly after Yahoo Mail went live, he departed for Disney. (Savitt disputes this account.)", "As concerns with Q.P.R.s escalated, employees asked if an entire F.Y.I. could be devoted to anonymous questions on the topic. One November afternoon, Mayer took the stage at URL\u2019s as hundreds of Yahoo employees packed the cafeteria. Mayer explained that she had sifted through the various questions on the internal network, but she wanted to begin instead with something else. Mayer composed herself and began reading from a book, \u201cBobbie Had a Nickel,\u201d about a little boy who gets a nickel and considers all the ways he can spend it.", "\u201cBobbie had a nickel all his very own,\u201d Mayer read. \u201cShould he buy some candy or an ice cream cone?\u201d", "Mayer paused to show everyone the illustrations of a little boy in red hair and blue shorts choosing between ice cream and candy. \u201cShould he buy a bubble pipe?\u201d she continued. \u201cOr a boat of wood?\u201d At the end of the book, Bobby decides to spend his nickel on a carousel ride. Mayer would later explain that the book symbolized how much she valued her roving experiences thus far at Yahoo. But few in the room seemed to understand the connection. By the time she closed the book, URL\u2019s had gone completely silent.", "Mayer\u2019s plan to restore Yahoo to the ranks of the tech giants had been premised on producing apps that hundreds of millions of people wanted to use. But as the Alibaba I.P.O. approached this fall, Yahoo\u2019s new and updated apps weren\u2019t getting enough traction. The digital-magazine strategy had not taken off, either; few of the strategic acquisitions seemed poised to break out; and Yahoo\u2019s search business, which Mayer hoped to grow to a 20 percent market share, had dropped to around 10 percent. Mayer\u2019s plan to sell a new kind of advertising in apps had been undermined by her trouble building relationships with clients, like Sorrell and Roth. Despite her efforts, Yahoo was still not growing. On July 15, the company reported dismal second-quarter revenues. Weeks later, Alibaba went public, and Jeff Smith pounced.", "Since Starboard began its campaign to force an AOL merger, Mayer has been meeting with shareholders to reassure them about her strategy. Many public-company C.E.O.s become belligerent when activist investors come charging, but Mayer appears to be open to a compromise. Most Yahoo observers expect that, in the coming weeks, she will announce a plan to transfer almost all of the company\u2019s Alibaba gains to shareholders while simultaneously resisting any merger with AOL. Mayer often compares her situation with the one Jobs inherited, and many expect her to insist that she needs at least the five years he received before his turnaround began to succeed with the release of the iPod.", "But Mayer may not be able to buy herself the time. Major Yahoo shareholders have recently begun collaborating on a series of spreadsheets that calculate that AOL and Yahoo are worth between 70 and 80 percent more when combined than they are apart. Some investors are further attracted to the merger because it will bring AOL\u2019s chief executive, Tim Armstrong, into Yahoo. Like Mayer, Armstrong made his career as an early Google employee \u2014 but he was in charge of its sales force. After a rough start, Armstrong has managed to get AOL\u2019s stock going again, not by inventing some new consumer product but by optimizing its ad and media assets.", "Armstrong, who has seen a version of this analysis, appears willing to consider a deal. Doing so, of course, would provide enormous personal benefit; Armstrong, who owns 5 percent of AOL, could stand to gain tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. For Mayer, the calculus is less enticing. It\u2019s unlikely that her personal turnaround plan included shrinking a $30 billion company into a $5 billion one, all to combine it with a $3 billion company and realize $1 billion in cost-savings.", "But it\u2019s also unclear what, if any, other options she has. Turning Yahoo into a growing products company and appeasing its activist shareholders are now almost mutually exclusive tasks. If Yahoo were to sell off its stake in Alibaba, it would become an entirely different sort of entity. Its market capitalization could drop to $5 billion from $50 billion. Efficiencies that once seemed small would become, in the language of investors, \u201cmaterial.\u201d Starboard might pressure Mayer to sell Yahoo\u2019s real estate or to lay off 10,000 employees. Acquisitions would get harder, as smaller bets would become much bigger relative to Yahoo\u2019s market capitalization.", "Aswath Damodaran, a professor at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business, has long argued about the danger of companies that try to return to the growth stage of their life cycle. These technology companies, he said, are run by people afflicted with something he calls the Steve Jobs syndrome. \u201cWe have created an incentive structure where C.E.O.s want to be stars,\u201d Damodaran explained. \u201cTo be a star, you\u2019ve got to be the next Steve Jobs \u2014 somebody who has actually grown a company to be a massive, large-market cap company.\u201d But, he went on, \u201cit\u2019s extremely dangerous at companies when you focus on the exception rather than the rule.\u201d He pointed out that \u201cfor every Apple, there are a hundred companies that tried to do what Apple did and fell flat on their faces.\u201d", "In many ways, Yahoo\u2019s decline from a $128 billion company to one worth virtually nothing is entirely natural. Yahoo grew into a colossus by solving a problem that no longer exists. And while Yahoo\u2019s products have undeniably improved, and its culture has become more innovative, it\u2019s unlikely that Mayer can reverse an inevitability unless she creates the next iPod. All breakthrough companies, after all, will eventually plateau and then decline. U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar company in 1901, but it was worth about the same in 1991. Kodak, which once employed nearly 80,000 people, now has a market value below $1 billion. Packard and Hudson ruled the roads for more than 40 years before disappearing. These companies matured and receded over the course of generations, in some cases even a century. Yahoo went through the process in 20 years. In the technology industry, things move fast.", "\u201cSometimes,\u201d Damodaran told me, \u201ccompanies have to act their age.\u201d For Yahoo, embracing its maturity means settling for a business that earns close to $1 billion in profit every year. It has outlasted other formerly iconic Internet portals, from AltaVista to Excite, and even dwarfs more recent web sensations like Myspace and Ask.com.

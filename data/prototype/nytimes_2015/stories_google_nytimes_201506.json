But here is the surprising part. The defendants in the suit were not individual human beings. They were YouTube and its parent company, Google. In other words, the entities that were alleged to have all of these intentions and attitudes were actually corporations.", "Cases like this one have long puzzled philosophers. In everyday speech, it seems perfectly correct to say that a corporation can \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cknow,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cwant\u201d or \u201cdecide.\u201d Yet, when we begin thinking the matter over from a more theoretical standpoint, it may seem that there is something deeply puzzling here. What could people possibly mean when they talk about corporations in this way?", "One possible approach would be to try to dismiss this whole issue as merely a misleading figure of speech. Sure, people sometimes describe a corporation using words like \u201cdecides\u201d or \u201cknows,\u201d but they don\u2019t necessarily mean this literally. Maybe all they really mean to say is that it is able to take in certain information and then use that information to adjust its plans and policies.", "Then again, maybe the way people talk about corporations is getting at something more fundamental. One of our most basic psychological capacities is our ability to think about things as having mental states, such as intentions and beliefs. Researchers refer to this capacity as \u201ctheory of mind.\u201d Our capacity for theory of mind appears to be such a fundamental aspect of our way of understanding the world that we apply it even to completely inanimate entities.", "Think about it: Has it ever crossed your mind that your computer is out to get you? Or that the big snowstorm somehow knew you needed to make it home especially quickly this time? You might recognize on some level that these entities don\u2019t have minds, but all the same, some part of you might be drawn to thinking of them in this way. Is it such a big leap, then, to suppose that people might think of corporations as having intentions?", "This is a disturbing thought. Corporations play an absolutely fundamental role in contemporary society, and if we are going to react to them appropriately, we need to make sense of them in terms of the complex structure that they actually have. It is deeply worrisome to think that our approach to understanding corporations might be shaped in part by a mode of thought that would be more appropriate for understanding the minds of individual human beings.", "To put this idea to the test, I teamed up with the cognitive neuroscientists Adrianna Jenkins, David Dodell-Feder and Rebecca Saxe, and together we ran a study. Participants came into the lab and were given a task that involved reasoning about corporations in much the same way that people often do in ordinary life. This time, however, they were lying in an fMRI scanner that made it possible to look at the patterns of activation within their brains. The key question was whether people thinking about corporations would show the distinctive sort of neural response associated with thinking of something as having mental states.", "While lying in the scanner, participants read a series of sentences. Some of the sentences just described the mental states of individual human beings. For example, one of the sentences was:", "George thought it really might be possible to make a killing in asparagus sales.", "Then other sentences described corporations and other large organizations. For example, another sentence was:", "United Food Corp. thought that stocks would continue to go up.", "This design made it possible to compare what was happening in people\u2019s brains as they considered sentences of each of these types.", "For the sentences about individual human beings, the results were exactly what one would expect. We found activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ), and the precuneus (PC). These are the regions that pretty much always show activation when people are thinking about other people\u2019s minds. In fact, this collection of regions has come to be known as the \u201ctheory of mind network.\u201d", "For the sentences about corporations, though, we found a result that really caught us by surprise. The pattern of activation for these sentences was completely indistinguishable from the one for sentences about individual human beings. We found activation in all regions of the theory of mind network. Not only that, we found activation to the same degree: There were no significant differences in any of these regions between the sentences about corporations and the sentences about human beings.", "In other words, if we pick out the brain regions that show activation when you are thinking about another human being\u2019s mind, we find activation in those exact same brain regions when you are thinking about Google. This result provides some evidence that people sometimes make sense of corporations by applying their capacity for theory of mind.", "But now one might raise another objection. Perhaps the sentences we are examining are not really about corporations themselves; perhaps they are actually about the individual human beings who control the corporations. For example, when people say \u201cGoogle intends,\u201d it might be that they are just using a convenient shorthand for something like \u201cThe individual human beings who control Google intend\u2026\u201d If this view is on the right track, it could be that people are simply applying theory of mind to a bunch of individual human beings, not to the corporation itself.", "To address this objection, we ran a quick follow-up study. In this study, we gave people a series of brief vignettes about corporations and other organizations. Then we asked in each case whether the organization itself had a certain mental state and also whether the individual human beings in the organization had that mental state. Strikingly, people were often happy to say that the organization itself had a certain mental state even when they thought that there wasn\u2019t a single human being within the organization who had that state.", "For example, people are happy to say that NASA knows how to build a space shuttle even if there is not a single individual human being within NASA who knows how to build a space shuttle. In a case like this, people are not thinking about the individual NASA employees; they are thinking about NASA itself, the whole organization, and they are describing it by saying that it \u201cknows\u201d certain things. Or, to take another example, consider an organization that arrives at decisions by aggregating the preferences of its members according to some complicated rule. People are happy to say that such an organization could decide to pursue a policy even if there were no individual members who decided on that policy or showed any desire at all for it to be implemented. Here again, people seem to be talking about the organization as a whole, and they are describing the organization by saying that it \u201cdecided.\u201d", "Putting the results of our two experiments together, we acquire evidence for a larger conclusion. It seems that a certain kind of psychological process does involve theory of mind (from our first experiment) and is directed at the corporations themselves (from the follow-up experiment). Of course, we should not jump to any strong conclusions based just on two studies \u2014 more research is necessary \u2014 but we now have some serious evidence that indicates that people apply theory of mind to corporations.", "In saying this, I certainly don\u2019t mean to imply that people hold a belief that corporations have minds. Suppose that instead of conducting a neuroimaging study, we had simply asked people, \u201cDo you think that Google has a mind?\u201d Most likely, they would have given us a quizzical stare and failed to understand what we were even asking. If they did take the question seriously, they might have said something like, \u201cObviously not. Google is a gigantic multinational institution. It could not possibly think or feel anything at all.\u201d", "Still, our results suggest that things are more complex than they might at first appear. Even if people believe on some level that corporations do not have minds, they seem to be using the same sort of psychological process for thinking about corporations that they use for thinking about the minds of human beings.", "This is a finding that should give us pause. When we are thinking things over at a more intuitive level, it may seem obvious to us that corporations should be severely punished for their misdeeds or that they should be given legal rights, such as the right to free speech. But before we accept these conclusions, we should take a moment to think about why it is that they seem so compelling.", "One possibility is that we have firmly in our minds a clear conception of what a corporation is. Then perhaps we are concluding that this very thing, a certain kind of bureaucratic institution, is deserving of severe punishment or of legal rights. If so, great; we have nothing to fear from the experimental findings. But it is also possible that our thinking may be taking a somewhat different turn. Despite all of our awareness of how corporations really work, it may be that our conclusions about how they should be treated are shaped in part by a psychological process that understands them as having thoughts, goals and intentions, even when we specifically believe that they do not.", "Joshua Knobe is a professor of cognitive science and philosophy at Yale University and a co-editor of \u201cExperimental Philosophy.", "Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and on Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/business/energy-environment/california-farmers-dig-deeper-for-water-sipping-their-neighbors-dry.html": ["Early one morning in late April, Parvinder Hundal stood beside a hole in the ground at the edge of his almond farm near Tulare in the Central Valley of California. The hole, which was about the size of a volleyball and was encased in a shallow block of concrete, was the opening of a well, one that went hundreds of feet into the earth. He had paid $100,000 to have it drilled, but it wasn\u2019t producing water. Mr. Hundal was hoping that if he cleaned out the well, the water would start flowing again.", "On the nearby trees, some leaves had turned yellow and the almond husks appeared smaller than usual. In February, Mr. Hundal received emails from various water districts, informing him that, because of a historic drought that has left reservoirs nearly dry, he would most likely get no surface water to irrigate his 4,000 acres of crops this summer. Not one drop.", "Mr. Hundal watched as his nephew, his right-hand man, prepared to lower pipe into the hole. \u201cWe\u2019ll have water by the end of the day, I hope,\u201d Mr. Hundal said.", "Mr. Hundal is an optimist. An immigrant from Punjab in northwest India, he arrived in California in 1986 with little money and, through a combination of borrowing and shrewdness, he managed to make a small fortune through farming. But he\u2019s also a pragmatist. Since he can\u2019t count on the virtually unlimited surface water he\u2019s been allotted in the past, he\u2019s been looking for water underground. This year, Mr. Hundal spent $300,000 to hire a contractor to dig three new wells, including the one in Tulare. Those didn\u2019t pan out. So he wired $670,000 to a broker in Texas to buy his own used drill. No water, no problem. Mr. Hundal will drill when he wants.", "There\u2019s a well-drilling boom in the Central Valley, and it\u2019s a water grab as intense as any land grab before it. Drilling contractors are so swamped with requests that there is a wait of four to six months for a new well. Drilling permits are soaring. In Tulare County, home to several of Mr. Hundal\u2019s almond farms, 660 permits for new irrigation wells were taken out by the end of this April, up from 383 during the same period last year and just 60 five years ago \u2014 a figure rising \u201cexponentially,\u201d said Tammie Weyker, spokeswoman for Tulare County Health and Human Services Agency.", "The new drill that Mr. Hundal ordered from Texas should be up and running in a few weeks. He says it can push 2,500 feet into the ground, tapping new aquifers and making way for wells that can produce thousands of gallons of water a minute. He plans to drill at least six new wells on his various farms across the Central Valley: Four of them are in Tulare, and two are on property 100 miles north.", "\u201cIt\u2019s about survival,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is pulling water out of the ground.\u201d", "\u201cNobody is bothered,\u201d he added. \u201cThe neighbors aren\u2019t bothered. Everybody is doing what they\u2019ve got to do.\u201d", "It turns out, though, that some people are bothered \u2014 very bothered \u2014 and are growing hostile. That\u2019s because the drilling has serious side effects. Rampant drilling causes underground water levels to fall. When shallow farm and domestic wells that serve residences dry up, the underground bounty goes to those who can afford to dig deeper.", "When it comes to drilling for water, there are few rules and no boundaries. Generally, farmers who follow a set of modest regulations can drill on their own land.", "California passed stronger regulations last year that are intended to govern underground drilling. Details of the rules are still being worked out. But even then, the rules won\u2019t have any real effect for 25 years or more, says Jay Famiglietti, senior water scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.", "\u201cYou drill a well on your property, you draw it out, even if it means you draw from under your neighbor\u2019s property,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re drawing water from every direction.\u201d", "Underground water supply isn\u2019t fenced or restricted; it is moisture held in the soil, rocks and clay, and drawn through wells like soda through a straw.", "In a normal year, Mr. Famiglietti says, 33 percent of California\u2019s water comes from underground, but this year it is expected to approach 75 percent. Since 2011, he says, the state has lost eight trillion gallons from its overall water reserves, two-thirds of that from its underground aquifers.", "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d Mr. Famiglietti says.", "The draining of the aquifers creates another hazard aboveground. As water is pulled from the spongy layers below, the ground above collapses, creating what is known as subsidence. Where subsidence is the worst, the land can sink as much as a foot each year.", "Water scarcity and buckling land have neighboring farmers eyeing one another warily. Relations are fraying, with the drilling threatening to revive tensions that have been subdued for half a century or more, when farmers last relied so heavily on groundwater, says Gary Sawyers, a prominent lawyer on water rights in the region. But now, with the expansion of agriculture in the Central Valley and the planting of thirsty, year-round crops like almonds, the demand for water is much greater.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the same situation as 60 or 70 years ago,\u201d Mr. Sawyers says, \u201cbut squared, or on steroids.\u201d", "Worth More Than Gold", "On Aug. 18, 1962, President John F. Kennedy landed in a helicopter near an enormous dusty bowl in the Central Valley. He had come for a groundbreaking ceremony at the future site of the San Luis Reservoir, which would eventually store hundreds of billions of gallons of the water from the Sierra Nevada to the north.", "Speaking from beneath an ornate tent to hundreds of sunbaked listeners, President Kennedy said that coming to the area, he could see \u201cthe greenest and richest earth producing the greatest and richest crops in the country, and then a mile away see the same earth and see it brown and dusty and useless \u2014 all because there\u2019s water in one place and there isn\u2019t in another.\u201d", "The construction in 1963 of the California Aqueduct system changed all that. Before it was built, farmers had relied on wells for their water, which led to the land collapsing. The surface water irrigation meant less pumping and led to \u201cwidespread groundwater recoveries, and subsidence essentially ceased in many areas,\u201d notes Michelle Sneed, a senior scientist at the United States Geological Survey.", "Scarcity of water has always been an issue in the Central Valley; this part of the valley gets only about 10 inches of rain a year. A German immigrant named Henry Miller, who was a pioneer in the region in the latter half of the 1800s, developed a system of canals and founded the region\u2019s first irrigation company for farmers. A legend, he was called the Cattle King of California, and he \u201crealized early on that water was ultimately of higher value than gold in California,\u201d according to a biography edited by the German Historical Institute.", "The value of water has become acutely real to Mr. Miller\u2019s great-great-great-grandson Cannon Michael, who is the president of the Bowles Farming Company.", "Tall and well spoken, Mr. Michael is the product of an elite boarding school and the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in English. After 15 years working at Bowles \u2014 which has $25 million in annual sales, about 15 percent of that profit \u2014 he became president of the family enterprise just last year.", "It wasn\u2019t the easiest time to take charge.", "Sitting at a conference table in his ranch-style offices, Mr. Michael displayed a Google Earth map on a large monitor on the wall. The map showed the area in and around his 10,500-acre farm, not far from the San Luis Reservoir, in the northern part of the Central Valley \u2014 much closer to Silicon Valley than to Los Angeles.", "On the map, some areas were yellow, others red. Yellow areas, he said, had suffered moderate subsidence. Red meant real trouble \u2014 in some of those red areas, the land had been dropping nearly a foot a year, on average, since 2008.", "Near the bottom of the map was a spot swirling with yellow and red: Sack Dam.", "\u201cThat\u2019s our diversion point,\u201d Mr. Michael told me.", "Sack Dam is the place on the San Joaquin River where surface water finishes its long journey from the north and is diverted onto the farms of Mr. Michael and his neighbors. Because Mr. Michael\u2019s farm is a parcel from the Miller farm, established in 1858, he has high-priority access to surface water. That is particularly important now, because in times of scarcity, these senior water rights holders \u2014 generally, farms established before 1914 \u2014 get their water allotment before farms with lower-priority rights, like those owned by Mr. Hundal.", "But now there\u2019s a problem for all the farmers, no matter what rights they have to surface water: Heavy drilling by farmers near Sack Dam is causing the land to cave in so much that the water is having trouble taking its normal path. Further subsidence will make it hard for water to get through Sack Dam to Mr. Michael\u2019s farm and those of his neighbors.", "\u201cWater traditionally flowed with gravity,\u201d as Mr. Michael put it. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to run uphill.\u201d", "One of the hundreds of farms in the Sack Dam area belongs to Mr. Hundal. He and Mr. Michael have never met, so in one sense, there\u2019s no particular connection between them. But like all the farmers in the region, they are connected by water.", "This year, thanks to his senior status, Mr. Michael will get surface water, about 50 percent of his usual amount, a hardship that means fallowing about 2,500 acres of wheat, cotton, alfalfa and tomato fields. By happenstance, the water that he and his neighbors get this year comes from a source that historically supplied the lower-priority water rights holders in Tulare. Those farmers, including Mr. Hundal, won\u2019t get any water.", "Another connection between these farmers has to do with subsidence, as Mr. Michael showed on his map. He found Mr. Hundal\u2019s farm, about 20 miles northeast of Sack Dam. It was colored yellow and red to signify heavy subsidence, and the stream of color connected all the way down to Mr. Michael\u2019s diversion point.", "Mr. Michael doesn\u2019t rebuke Mr. Hundal or others for drilling. \u201cYou take away a guy\u2019s surface water,\u201d he said, \u201cand he\u2019s going to do what he has to do to survive.\u201d But his tone hardened when he talked about what could amount to a $10 million bill to install a pump to push the water uphill at Sack Dam if the subsidence worsens.", "\u201cWe could make a legal case that these folks are causing the issue,\u201d he said of the farmers who are drilling near the dam.", "That sentiment is shared by a number of the senior water rights holders, says Chase Hurley, the manager of the San Luis Canal Company, which manages water for about 45,000 acres, including Mr. Michael\u2019s land. Mr. Hurley says the farmers with senior rights have been rumbling about a way to \u201cget this thing straightened out\u201d or else go after the other farmers in court. They are focused on drillers within about five miles of the dam.", "Mr. Hurley tells them they don\u2019t have a very good legal case. \u201cBased on current California law,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can dig as many holes as you want.\u201d", "Besides, he adds, which landowners would they sue? Farmers whose land borders Sack Dam, or those a few miles out, like Mr. Hundal?", "Geology isn\u2019t neat, and the aquifer is like a giant earthy sponge, explains Ms. Sneed of the United States Geological Survey. And not all the holes in the sponge connect; sometimes, drilling in one well might drain a hole at a distance and not affect one nearby. There is no simple way, she says, to trace a crater to the particular well that sucked the groundwater out of it.", "Taking What They Can", "Mr. Hundal, 57, drove me around his farms in his Ford F-250 pickup truck and described growing up on a farm in India, getting a college degree and immigrating to San Francisco. Seven years after he arrived, he had a master\u2019s degree in agronomy from Chico State and 20 acres. Then, a few years later, he bought 90 more acres \u2014 \u201cthat was a really risky step,\u201d he said. He smiled at the audacity. He said he borrowed the $650,000 for the new land and grew almonds, long before it was common to do so.", "Now he takes in $14 million in sales from his collection of farms, mostly almond orchards. He hires 25 farmworkers from February through October, but still tends to a lot himself, using a jury-rigged tractor to plant almond and cherry trees. He and his wife recently bought a second home at Pebble Beach for $8 million.", "At one of his farms in Tulare, he stopped at a rectangular reservoir six feet deep and a quarter of the size of a football field. \u201cWhen we get water, we put it here,\u201d he said. It was, on that April day, a dusty bed, with patches of green.", "I told him about Mr. Hurley\u2019s concerns about the heavy drilling.", "\u201cThat\u2019s just baloney,\u201d Mr. Hundal said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s causing problems.\u201d He said the subsidence could be caused \u201cby heavy ground.\u201d (His is not a position supported by science.)", "Besides, he said, \u201cThey take our water and don\u2019t want us to drill.\u201d", "I told him that some of the farmers with senior water rights have talked about suing farmers drilling near the dam \u2014 not Mr. Hundal necessarily, but maybe ones closer to Sack Dam.", "\u201cThey can do that,\u201d but it would be a \u201cwaste of time in court,\u201d he said, kicking a cloud of dust. Mr. Sawyers \u2014 who works for farmers on both sides of Sack Dam \u2014 says that a lawsuit over subsidence could be the first of its kind. He couldn\u2019t recall another. But neither has there been such a drought in recent history. \u201cThe current circumstances,\u201d he says, \u201cmay give rise to all kinds of new lawsuits.\u201d", "This is not to say a lawsuit is imminent or even likely. Mr. Hurley, who runs the water management company, has helped the farmers with senior water rights try diplomacy. Their group has spent $250,000 to help the districts to the east study how to fix the subsidence. Farmers on both sides of the dam have talked of jointly developing an underground reservoir that would be replenished with floodwaters. But floodwaters, even under normal climate conditions, are released only about every four years, Mr. Hurley says. Other possible solutions, like using pipes to connect farms so they can share water more efficiently, could also take years.", "Many farmers in the Central Valley agree on a collection of nemeses that includes the news media, regulators and environmentalists. But now there are new tensions. Chris Hurd, a farmer in the region for three decades, still contends that environmental interests and regulators are most to blame for water scarcity, but he notes that comity among farmers has started to fray. \u201cThe infighting that\u2019s going on is going to get real bad,\u201d he says. It\u2019s \u201cone year at a time,\u201d he explained of farmers\u2019 mind-set. \u201cMost guys can make money if they can figure out how to get things wet the next 120 days.\u201d", "\u201cGuys are overdrafting right next to each other,\u201d he says of the water drilling, adding that he recently saw one farmer\u2019s wells go dry just days after a farmer half a mile away put in a deeper well.", "But \u201cwhat\u2019s going to drive it to the forefront,\u201d he says, is not farmer losses but \u201cwhen a lot of domestic wells will go dry this summer.\u201d", "The Race to Drill Deeper", "What\u2019s bad for California farmers is turning out to be good for Michael Higgins. He owns Summit Power & Supply, a company in Austin, Tex., that buys and sells drilling equipment, for water and oil wells. He gets six calls a week from Golden State farmers, up from one every two months just two years ago.", "\u201cThey\u2019re getting frantic,\u201d Mr. Higgins says.", "When Mr. Hundal went to Texas to shop for drills, he discovered something remarkable: Mr. Higgins\u2019s customers were familiar names. \u201cI knew everybody,\u201d Mr. Hundal says. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d", "Mr. Higgins has delivered drilling rigs to Bakersfield, Goleta, Madera, Orland, Porterville and other places in California. Two of the drills he sold went to a contractor in Los Banos, and in late April those drills were used to put new wells on the Bowles farm run by Mr. Michael.", "For all his concerns about drilling, Mr. Michael decided he had no choice but to join the drillers as a long-term \u201cinsurance policy.\u201d Plus, with reduced surface water this year, he says he needs to pull the water from somewhere. He says he\u2019s drilling wells \u2014 costing $100,000 each \u2014 that go only a few hundred feet deep, above the layer that seems to cause ground collapse.", "Two simple, if contradictory, themes have emerged among farmers: One, we\u2019re all in this together. Two, it\u2019s every man for himself.", "Steve Laird, who has a small farm in the area, puts it this way: \u201cWhen it comes down to it, it\u2019s either mine or yours. You do what you have to do to survive.\u201d", "Mr. Hundal\u2019s new drill arrived from Texas in the middle of May. Then another challenge arose: He had reached a handshake agreement with a licensed driller to operate the drill, but the driller, Mr. Hundal said, started \u201cdragging his feet.\u201d", "Mr. Hundal suspected the reason. \u201cHe wants big money. He smells that,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t drill without a license.\u201d", "As he waited to start drilling a new well, Mr. Hundal discovered that his neighbor was also drilling across the street, just 100 feet away. Mr. Hundal thought it was possible that the neighbor\u2019s well would suck up his water.", "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, but I can\u2019t tell him to drill away from me,\u201d Mr. Hundal said. \u201cIt\u2019s his land, not mine.\u201d", "If his well goes dry, Mr. Hundal said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to drill another one and go a little deeper.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/business/the-american-way-of-tech-and-europes.html": ["With this month\u2019s announcement that the European Union is investigating Amazon for possible anticompetitive behavior in the sale of e-books, antitrust fervor in Europe seems to have hit fever pitch.

In Europe, there are none among the top 10.", "Yet if any region of the world could compete successfully with the United States in technological prowess, it would seem to be Europe. The European Union has venerable universities, a well-educated work force, affluent and technically skilled consumers and large pools of investment capital.", "Europe has a long history of world-changing inventions, including the printing press, the optical lenses used in microscopes and telescopes and the steam engine.", "But recently? Not so much. King Digital Entertainment, creator of the video game sensation Candy Crush and now based in London, was founded a decade ago in Sweden, which has emerged as a hotbed of video game innovation. A German, Karlheinz Brandenburg, is credited with the invention of the MP3 format for digital music, and the telecommunications application Skype was created by a group of two Scandinavians and three Estonians. But Apple created the iPod MP3 player and eBay bought Skype in 2005. (It\u2019s now owned by Microsoft.)", "This hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed in Europe. Last month, the European Union unveiled its \u201cDigital Single Market\u201d strategy aimed at fostering European entrepreneurs and easing barriers to innovation. European countries have tried to replicate the critical mass of a Silicon Valley with technology centers like Oxford Science Park in Britain, \u201cSilicon Allee\u201d in Berlin and Isar Valley in Munich, and \u201cSilicon Docks\u201d in Dublin.", "\u201cThey all want a Silicon Valley,\u201d Jacob Kirkegaard, a Danish economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me this week. \u201cBut none of them can match the scale and focus on the new and truly innovative technologies you have in the United States. Europe and the rest of the world are playing catch-up, to the great frustration of policy makers there.\u201d", "Petra Moser, assistant professor of economics at Stanford and its Europe Center, who was born in Germany, agreed that \u201cEuropeans are worried.\u201d", "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to recreate Silicon Valley in places like Munich, so far with little success,\u201d she said. \u201cThe institutional and cultural differences are still too great.\u201d", "There are institutional and structural barriers to innovation in Europe, like smaller pools of venture capital and rigid employment laws that restrict growth. But both Mr. Kirkegaard and Professor Moser, while noting that there are always individual exceptions to sweeping generalities about Europeans and Americans, said that the major barriers were cultural.", "Often overlooked in the success of American start-ups is the even greater number of failures. \u201cFail fast, fail often\u201d is a Silicon Valley mantra, and the freedom to innovate is inextricably linked to the freedom to fail. In Europe, failure carries a much greater stigma than it does in the United States. Bankruptcy codes are far more punitive, in contrast to the United States, where bankruptcy is simply a rite of passage for many successful entrepreneurs.", "Professor Moser recalled that a businessman who had to declare bankruptcy in her hometown in Germany committed suicide. \u201cIn Europe, failure is regarded as a personal tragedy,\u201d she said. \u201cHere it\u2019s something of a badge of honor. An environment like that doesn\u2019t encourage as much risk-taking and entrepreneurship.\u201d", "When David Byttow, co-founder of the anonymous social app Secret, announced this spring that he was shutting down the San Francisco-based start-up, he didn\u2019t seem the least bit chastened. \u201cI believe in failing fast in order to go on and make only new and different mistakes,\u201d he wrote in a blog post.", "There is also little or no stigma in Silicon Valley to being fired; Steve Jobs himself was forced out of Apple. \u201cAmerican companies allow their employees to leave and try something else,\u201d Professor Moser said. \u201cThen, if it works, great, the mother company acquires the start-up. If it doesn\u2019t, they hire them back. It\u2019s a great system. It allows people to experiment and try things. In Germany, you can\u2019t do that. People would hold it against you. They\u2019d see it as disloyal. It\u2019s a very different ethic.\u201d", "Europeans are also much less receptive to the kind of truly disruptive innovation represented by a Google or a Facebook, Mr. Kirkegaard said.", "He cited the example of Uber, the ride-hailing service that despite its German-sounding name is a thoroughly American upstart. Uber has been greeted in Europe like the arrival of a virus, and its reception says a lot about the power of incumbent taxi operators.", "\u201cBut it goes deeper than that,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cNew Yorkers don\u2019t get all nostalgic about yellow cabs. In London, the black cab is seen as something that makes London what it is. People like it that way. Americans tend to act in a more rational and less emotional way about the goods and services they consume, because it\u2019s not tied up with their national and regional identities.\u201d", "One of Europe\u2019s greatest innovations was the forerunner of the modern university: Bologna, founded in 1088. But as centers of research and innovation, Europe\u2019s universities long ago ceded leadership to those in the United States.", "With its emphasis on early testing and sorting, the educational system in Europe tends to be very rigid. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do well at age 18, you\u2019re out,\u201d Professor Moser said. \u201cThat cuts out a lot of people who could do better but never get the chance. The person who does best at a test of rote memorization at age 17 may not be innovative at 23.\u201d She added that many of Europe\u2019s most enterprising students go to the United States to study and end up staying.", "She is currently doing research into creativity. \u201cThe American education system is much more forgiving,\u201d Professor Moser said. \u201cStudents can catch up and go on to excel.\u201d", "Even the vaunted European child-rearing, she believes, is too prescriptive. While she concedes there is as yet no hard scientific evidence to support her thesis, \u201cEuropean children may be better behaved, but American children may end up being more free to explore new things.\u201d", "None of this will be easy to change, even assuming Europeans want change. \u201cIn Europe, stability is prized,\u201d Professor Moser said. \u201cInequality is much less tolerated. There\u2019s a culture of sharing. People aren\u2019t so cutthroat. Money isn\u2019t the only thing that matters. These may be good things.\u201d But Europeans can\u2019t have it both ways. She said that successful innovators quickly discover it\u2019s hard to break through these cultural norms.", "Mr. Kirkegaard agreed. \u201cEuropeans are conservative with a small \u2018c,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey pretty much like things the way they are.\u201d"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/tipping-point-in-transit/": ["One sunny morning a few weeks ago, I slipped into the inviting cockpit of a Mercedes-Benz S550 sedan, a ride equipped with massaging front seats, reclining back seats, a heads-up display worthy of a fighter jet and more speakers than a political convention. At $136,000, this was a car fit for a rap star or a European Union functionary, of which I am neither (yet).", "Instead, I write about the future, and embedded in the S550 are a host of technologies that roughly approximate the future of automobile transportation \u2014 already available, for a high price, on the road today.", "For decades, pundits and theorists have been expecting a future in which cars drive themselves, and companies like Google have been testing advanced versions of these systems for several years.", "But the S550 \u2014 some of whose self-driving features can be found in other luxury automobiles, including Cadillacs, Volvos and soon the Tesla Model S \u2014 shows that in many ways, the future of transportation is already here, and it is evolving at a pace that would surprise even the most optimistic enthusiasts.", "And today\u2019s semiautonomous road car isn\u2019t the only sign that transportation is changing quickly. Because of on-demand services like Uber, the very idea of owning a car is being undermined.", "Observers say that advances in transportation may be especially apparent in cities, where technology is creating an emerging multitude of options, from app-powered car sharing and car-pooling to new modes of driving and parking to novel forms of short-distance travel and private jitney buses with seats allocated by phone.", "Communication systems and sensors installed in streets and cars are creating the possibility of intelligent roads, while newer energy systems like solar power are altering the environmental costs of getting around. Technology is also creating new transportation options for short distances, like energy-efficient electric-powered bikes and scooters, or motorcycles that can\u2019t tip over.", "\u201cCars and transportation will change more in the next 20 years than they\u2019ve changed in the last 75 years,\u201d said M. Bart Herring, the head of product management at Mercedes-Benz USA. \u201cWhat we were doing 10 years ago wasn\u2019t that much different from what we were doing 50 years ago. The cars got more comfortable, but for the most part we were putting gas in the cars and going where we wanted to go. What\u2019s going to happen in the next 20 years is the equivalent of the moon landing.\u201d", "Mr. Herring is one of many in the industry who say that we are on the verge of a tipping point in transportation. Soon, getting around may be cheaper and more convenient than it is today, and possibly safer and more environmentally friendly, too.", "But the transportation system of the near future may also be more legally complex and, given the increasing use of private systems to get around, more socially unequal. And, as in much of the rest of the tech industry, the moves toward tomorrow\u2019s transportation system may be occurring more rapidly than regulators and social norms can adjust to them.", "\u201cAll the things that we think will happen tomorrow, like fully autonomous cars, may take a very long time,\u201d said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who studies emerging transportation systems. \u201cBut it\u2019s the things we don\u2019t even expect that will happen really fast.\u201d", "A step toward that future is something that Mercedes calls, clunkily, Distronic Plus with Steering Assist, a kind of advanced cruise control that lets a vehicle basically drive itself on freeways. Using radar and cameras, the S550 can center itself within a lane, remain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead and automatically brake and steer to keep pace with traffic.", "But that didn\u2019t mean that I could exactly doze off on the road. The self-driving system, for example, can\u2019t handle sharp turns. Both the car and the company warned me not to see the car\u2019s abilities as permission to distract myself, which is a bit like warning the fox to exercise some self-control around that newfangled self-guarding henhouse. The Mercedes issues an alarm when you\u2019ve taken your hands off the wheel for more than 10 seconds.", "Still, the car lulled me: With the S550 making most major decisions, I could safely look at incoming Twitter messages while jammed in bumper-to-bumper traffic. The car even promises to respond to emergency situations, like if it senses that you\u2019re veering off the road into the median, or if the vehicle ahead of you suddenly jams on the brakes.", "Thankfully, I didn\u2019t get a chance to test those features.", "The technologies pushing rapid changes in transportation are similar to those altering much of the rest of the world: sensors, smartphones and software.", "The sensors help cars, roads and other elements of modern infrastructure become aware, letting vehicles keep track of other vehicles and the roads around them. And smartphones keep track of people. They help companies like Uber take payments and route drivers and riders efficiently.", "And they enable companies like Leap Transit, one of several app-powered luxury private bus services operating in San Francisco, to measure demand on its routes. Finally, the software ties the sensors and the smartphones together.", "When the entire transportation system has been wired, powerful software operating within cars, on phones and in the computing cloud will analyze all the incoming data to constantly reallocate resources, watch for any emergencies and prompt action as soon as they happen.", "\u201cYou\u2019re adding intelligence to every step of the system,\u201d said Stefan Heck, a research fellow at Stanford University who explored the benefits of smart transportation last year in \u201cResource Revolution,\u201d a book he wrote with Matt Rogers, a management consultant at McKinsey.", "Like many who\u2019ve studied the issue, the pair argue that autonomous driving, intelligent roads and other advances would make transportation far safer and more efficient than it is now.", "Every year, more than 30,000 Americans are killed in cars, and traffic crashes cost society at least $300 billion a year, according to a study by AAA. Most accidents are caused by human error that could, in theory, be mitigated or avoided by artificial intelligence.", "Reducing fatalities on American roads by the tens of thousands is within the realm of the plausible, according to experts and automakers. In 2008, Volvo even set a goal for itself: By 2020, the Swedish carmaker hopes that \u201cnobody shall be seriously injured or killed in a new Volvo.\u201d It is a vision that rests in large part, it says, on increasing automation.", "Efficiency gains are also likely. Today, most cars spend most of their time idle, and even when they\u2019re moving, they frequently carry a single person, a tremendously inefficient allocation of resources. That could change not just through smartphone-enabled car-pooling and reduced vehicle ownership, but also because automation would change driving itself.", "Cars that couldn\u2019t crash could be made lighter, and they could pack closer together on freeways and travel in platoons, reducing congestion and, eventually, the amount of space cities devote to roads. Intelligent roads, Mr. Heck and Mr. Rogers argue, could save untold numbers of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars.", "That\u2019s the dream. But the path to full automation isn\u2019t likely to be smooth or quick. Although Google recently announced that it would soon begin test-driving self-driving cars, many experts said they believed that fully autonomous cars for the public were at least a decade away.", "More than technical limitations, price hampers vehicles with this capability. Prototype self-driving cars of the sort that Google uses are usually equipped with a high-end laser sensor known as Lidar, a comical device that sits on the car\u2019s roof and spins like a windmill, detecting obstacles in all directions. Google has said that the Lidar units on its prototypes cost as much as $85,000 each. Though costs are expected to come down, the devices are too expensive for today\u2019s production cars.", "Many carmakers plan to start testing their autonomous vehicles over the next five years, but none have offered any date for selling them to the wider public.", "But if full automation is still years away, what car companies call \u201csemiautonomous\u201d features are already here \u2014 and they\u2019re getting better, cheaper and more widely available every year. The semiautonomous features found in luxury cars use ordinary sensors that are largely invisible to the outside world. Among these are radar, often powered by units mounted in the grille or the top of the windshield. There are also cameras and ultrasonic systems positioned around the car that allow it to detect objects and pedestrians at close range.", "Together, these sensors let the car see pretty much everything a human driver can see, and a whole lot that a driver would most likely miss, like a sudden slowdown by the vehicle two cars ahead.", "Some cars now or may soon take advantage of so-called telemetry data, like mapping information that describes the bend of a curve or an emerging traffic jam. Manufacturers say it wouldn\u2019t take too much work for such data to be integrated into the semiautonomous systems in today\u2019s cars.", "In practice, these could lead to a driving experience that very closely mimics self-driving in certain conditions. Tesla, which plans to introduce a self-driving feature called Autopilot as a software update to its Model S sedan this year, has said that on highways, its cars will be able to steer into turns steeper than mere gentle bends.", "\u201cWe can basically go between San Francisco and Seattle without the driver doing anything,\u201d Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, told reporters in March.", "There are early signs that certain semiautonomous features will improve safety. The Highway Loss Data Institute, which tracks insurance loss statistics on vehicles, has found that Volvo\u2019s forward-collision avoidance system, which slows or stops the car if it senses an imminent crash, has reduced claims of bodily injury by at least 18 percent.", "Radar and cameras are such old tech, and are produced at such large scale, that they don\u2019t add much cost to vehicles. Many manufacturers sell their semiautonomous systems as an upgrade for about $3,000 or less, and several carmakers said they could envision autonomous features becoming standard features across a wide range of vehicles. If they continue to show safety and efficiency gains, they may one day even be mandated by the government.", "\u201cThere is not a fundamentally expensive technology involved in any part of this,\u201d Erik Coelingh, who runs Volvo\u2019s safety technology program, said of the semiautonomous features coming to cars.", "Not all coming advances may be democratically allocated. Though the prices charged by car-hailing apps like Uber have fallen sharply because of huge scale, they are not as cheap as many public transportation options.", "And other privatized transportation technologies like the Leap bus service or Shuddle, a car-sharing app for driving children to school, are starting with high prices that may fall as the services grow larger, though it\u2019s far from clear that will happen. Even optimists concede these difficulties of access. \u201cNot all of this will make everyone better off,\u201d said Mr. Heck of Stanford.", "The bigger problem may be the way the culture, laws and our brains respond to improvements in transportation. One worry about technology that makes commuting less of a headache is that it will lead people to move farther away from their jobs, which will in turn increase sprawl and drive up demand for cars, eliminating any overall benefit from the advances.", "Another is a well-known paradox of safety called the \u201coffset hypothesis.\u201d If we make cars safer, won\u2019t people then just act more dangerously, offsetting any benefit?", "I noticed this effect during my days with the Mercedes. With the car steering for me, and promising to take care of emergencies, I felt much safer fiddling with the stereo, the GPS navigator and even my phone while driving 75 miles an hour down the highway.", "\u201cHere is a technology that will significantly reduce the kinds of crashes that we know about. But at the same time, it will lead to different behaviors, and it could lead to new crashes,\u201d said Mr. Smith, the University of South Carolina law professor. He added that automakers would have to spend years fine-tuning the design of their autonomous and semiautonomous systems so it became clear to drivers what the capabilities and shortcomings of the technologies were and to push drivers away from risky behavior.", "\u201cThe solution is saying, we have to accept that humans are imperfect, and design accordingly,\u201d he said."],

He\u2019s an egomaniac, sort of (but who isn\u2019t, in the N.B.A.?). In 2013, an interviewer asked him whom he would pick to shoot, given one chance to win a game and a lineup of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Ray Allen, Reggie Miller \u2014 and Stephen Curry. Curry said: Jordan. But after Jordan, he continued, \u201cI\u2019m No. 2.\u201d At the time, he was 25. He has since become the game\u2019s greatest scorer.", "Commentators like to refer to Curry\u2019s \u201cgunslinger mentality.\u201d By this they mean that Curry does not suffer from self-doubt. His team, the Golden State Warriors, is a single win from the N.B.A. championship, and it isn\u2019t hyperbole to say that what happens next largely depends on him. Yet search Curry for even a trace of nervous tension and you will find \u2026 well, there is one thing. Curry chews his mouth guard.", "No one watching these wonderful N.B.A. finals can have missed it. When Curry shoots a free throw, he likes to gnaw on it: The clear plastic U, like a tiny snorkel, curves up toward the rafters from the side of his mouth. After he makes a field goal, it tends to pop out of place, protruding just past his lips, like terrible dentures. When the field goal is very, very nice, the denture effect becomes more pronounced, to the point that it starts to resemble a second, retractile mouth, tucked within the larger one; I think of \u201cAlien.\u201d (Generally, the farther Curry\u2019s mouth guard ventures from his teeth, the greater his disbelief is at what just happened. Amazing plays, like awful calls, can prompt him to pull it out, and even to throw it.) And when the person defending Curry happens to be the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 Matthew Dellavedova \u2014 who not only wears and flaunts and nibbles at his own mouth guard but is also practically bucktoothed (his surname \u201cliterally translates to \u2018the teeth of the leopard,\u2019 maybe,\u201d as one Grantland writer memorably put it) \u2014 we seem to be witnessing the birth of a tic. That athletes mustn\u2019t \u201coverthink it\u201d is a truism. And we all know that mind trumps matter. But what if your mouth, like a double agent, keeps on betraying what\u2019s in your head?", "It isn\u2019t just biters like Mike Tyson and Luis Su\u00e1rez, the tongue of Jordan, the smile of Bobby Orr. For all athletes, who are eloquent by other means, the problem may be that the mouth has little to say. This can be merely (and cruelly) a matter of aesthetics. Consider the case of Andy Murray. Last September, a picture of the mouth of the Scottish tennis star began circulating on Twitter. Taken from a broadcast of his fourth-round victory at the U.S. Open, it showed him howling. As early viewers of this picture were quick to notice, Murray\u2019s mouth is rather big: horsy, yawning, abyssal. Nor was this the only image of Murray\u2019s mouth of its kind. Like many tennis players, Murray howls to himself often \u2014 indeed, he does it so often, and in such consistent fashion, that it can be hard to say what we are seeing (but not, to be clear, hearing): true feeling or an awkward attempt to control it.", "Anyway, Murray\u2019s mouth became a meme. Look for it on Google now, and you will find it wittily transposed into various images \u2014 Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cScream,\u201d a split-screen panel on the \u201cHannity\u201d show, a still from \u201cJaws.\u201d To date, Murray\u2019s only response to all this has been to tweet, \u201cWhat is a meme?\u201d", "Curiously, a meme may even be said to resemble the kind of nervous tic Murray was exhibiting, only on a larger scale: something infinitely adaptable and suggestive, but also lowly funny, that branches out across the culture like a contagion. No athletic mouth meme has been as contagious as the mouth guard. It isn\u2019t just Curry and Dellavedova: Mouth guards, chewed and otherwise, are spreading through the N.B.A. LeBron James wears one. \u201cOne explanation is, it\u2019s just a trend,\u201d said Joel H. Fish, director of the Center for Sport Psychology in Philadelphia. He was skeptical of the attempt to discern much meaning in the chewing. \u201cHabits come and go, but most great athletes are not dependent on one mouth guard.\u201d", "Others were willing to hazard some theories, warily. \u201cThere\u2019s probably something very soothing about it,\u201d William Wiener, a sports psychologist in Manhattan, suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s like an athletic way of twiddling your thumbs.\u201d When I asked Paul P. Baard, a sports psychologist at Fordham University, what all this chewing meant, he said: \u201cI\u2019m nervous! I\u2019m nervous! I\u2019m nervous.\u201d Dr. Baard said the chewing could signify excessive anxiety. \u201cThe mind must have a thought in it,\u201d Dr. Baard explained. \u201cIt can\u2019t not have a thought unless you\u2019re brain-dead. So, sometimes you give them a mantra.\u201d", "Perhaps the mouth guard, endlessly chewable, is like a mantra for the teeth, promising safety and confidence, leaving behind a faint rubbery taste. Meant for internal use, it looks a little strange when you show it off in public. Certainly, it makes for weirder, more Freudian television \u2014 sports inflected by the muddles of the inner life. It is ironic that the most distracting nervous tic in basketball right now belongs to its least nervous player, the undistractable Curry \u2014 who is also the league\u2019s M.V.P. Chewing aside, he is not an athlete with many quirks. The mechanics of his shot are so textbook that they even emit a whiff of pedantry, as if he didn\u2019t just want to score but to instruct. It occurs to you that Curry\u2019s tic actually is very helpful \u2014 to his viewers. Far from a crutch, it is a keyhole, a glimpse into a mind otherwise closed off by a carapace of skill.", "On YouTube, you can find a video of Curry shooting free throws with his coach, Steve Kerr. (He doesn\u2019t miss.) Thirty seconds in, he chants to himself: \u201cControl your own destiny! Control your own destiny!\u201d This is what every tic is telling the body, as well as what it confirms that the body can\u2019t do. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d the Huffington Post said about LeBron James\u2019s mouth-guard-chewing back in 2011. And that\u2019s fair enough. It isn\u2019t sexy. It\u2019s barely conscious. It\u2019s a residue of the uncontrollable, proof that even the greats don\u2019t choose their destinies.

I\u2019ve previously found Sigur R\u00f3s to be about as pleasant as airport security, but something about listening in the morning, just before coffee, seemed to register.

They make him seem inconsistent and unpredictable.", "Of course, it\u2019s possible to interpret this in a different way entirely: to say that the willingness to change your look on a whim actually demonstrates security, a talent for taking risks and unconventional thinking, whatever other people may say. It might be that was how the Twitter board saw the situation.", "When you\u2019re a public company, such preconceptions matter.", "And certainly, if it turns out that Mr. Dorsey is a visionary and comes up with some transformative new idea for Twitter during his leadership period, this may set a new paradigm for chief executive style switcheroos.

That question, and the action it inspires, is the driving force behind Catie Disabato\u2019s \u201cThe Ghost Network,\u201d a smart and thorny debut novel with a mystery at its heart.", "On the surface, the story is simple enough. Molly Metropolis is a teen idol with a taste for the postmodern, embracing the Situationist philosopher Guy Debord as her hero and mixing the highbrow and lowbrow with an ease that makes her a natural contemporary to pop queens like Miley and Rihanna. Molly charms her way through music videos and interviews \u2014 all the while harboring a secret obsession with the Chicago-area train system, which she catalogs in a so-called ghost network, a physical map with components in the cloud. It starts with the present system and overlays points of abandoned, half-constructed and \u00adproposed-but-never-constructed routes and stations. When Molly vanishes, everyone among her friends, employees and fans \u2014 especially the shadowy New Situationist movement, which has adopted her as an idol \u2014 becomes a suspect.", "In the same way that Molly\u2019s maps bring alternate worlds into a single system, \u201cThe Ghost Network\u201d layers alternate realities to construct the truth from disparate angles. The bulk of the narrative is attributed to Cyrus K. Archer, a professor at Oberlin who takes interest after a student in his department joins the search for Molly only to go missing herself. Cyrus grows fixated on Molly and (as lonely professors are wont to do) elevates and academizes her to become the central figure of a book-length discourse. His work, in turn, is finished and finessed by one Catie Disabato, who casts herself as the only person left to sort out the mystery. In following the lives and work of Molly\u2019s entourage, first Cyrus and then Catie weave themselves into the story.", "The depth of the technology-enabled navel gazing is only part of what makes Disabato\u2019s story truly contemporary. This is a novel that references pop gossip on Gawker and reviews on Slate by journalists real and invented, and that attributes the creation of the academic journal Molly Skyscraper to the scholar and artist Kate Durbin (who did, in real life, create the academic journal Gaga Stigmata to explore all things Lady Gaga). It leans hard into the dissociative effect of culture on thought, such that the existence of the book itself forms the foundation of a real-unreal network of interviews and blog posts and reviews like the one you are reading now. (Somebody has already snagged Molly\u2019s Twitter handle, \u00ad@MollyMetro, and soon enough may begin churning out another layer on the map.) Teasing the real from the invented would itself be a book-length task, particularly now that the book has entered a culture cataloged by Google. You might rightly feel a sense of information fatigue in considering its scope.", "This is not to insinuate that \u201cThe Ghost Network\u201d is anything less than an excellent story on its own merits; one of the most impressive elements of this deep and probing narrative is the compelling mystery overlaid like the El on the city. Disabato leads her readers expertly through a kind of Wonderland that requires footnotes, walking the balance of tension and action with the same comfort her protagonist would take with an arena crowd. Like the trap doors and hidden hallways of the New Situationist headquarters, \u201cThe Ghost Network\u201d presents the maze of modern culture with all its dead ends and truncations, but reveals treasure to those who walk the path.", "THE GHOST NETWORK\nCatie Disabato\n282 pp. Melville House.

Especially ambitious is his Grand Tourbillon Minute Repeater, created for Ateliers deMonaco, a watch company he helped start. When I visited his bright, sunlit factory in Geneva in May, he opened a refrigerator-size safe to show me one of them.", "\u201cIf you want to go for the real complex stuff,\u201d he said, \u201chere it is.\u201d The watch, a gorgeous chunk of white gold, includes more than 400 painstakingly machined, polished and hand-assembled parts. One of them is a circular metal gong, struck by small hammers that mark the time with two-tone melodies. The watch\u2019s mechanisms \u2014 including its \u201cbalance wheel,\u201d whose oscillation is visible through an opening in the watch face \u2014 are so precise that the device loses or gains only two seconds a day. The Grand Tourbillon Minute Repeater sells for just over $200,000, and Koeslag has made just eight of them.", "\u201cA Prince of Qatar has bought three already,\u201d said Koeslag, a mannerly blond man who wore a trim pinstriped suit. \u201cVery special watches, for very special people.\u201d On the factory floor behind us, a dozen white-coated women were piecing together other watches that Koeslag has designed for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant, a midrange watch brand. These will sell for as much as $30,000. One woman peered into a microscope as she carefully wielded a long, thin needle to apply a drop of pink oil, before setting a tiny pin in place. This is the tradition that Koeslag is selling to his customers: the patient Swiss art of manufacturing complex, handmade mechanisms.", "Last fall, however, Koeslag set off on a very different, decidedly 21st-century project: a smartwatch. In response to Apple\u2019s plans to introduce a high-tech watch this year, the chief executive of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant, Peter Stas, decided the company would produce its own. It would not be a minicomputer with a screen, like Apple\u2019s. Instead, it would combine the functions of a Fitbit, a device that tracks physical activity, with a traditional Swiss timepiece, a $1,200 entry-level Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant watch. A Silicon Valley company would produce the tiny sensors that count steps and measure sleep cycles, and this information would be transmitted to a phone through a Bluetooth connection. The phone would also control the watch \u2014 resetting its hands in different time zones, for example. From the outside, the watch wouldn\u2019t look \u201csmart\u201d at all, but it would be packed with electronics. Koeslag\u2019s job was to bring to life this chimera of Swiss engineering and Silicon Valley wizardry.", "Koeslag faced a significant problem, though: He had never worked with chips and sensors before. He didn\u2019t even own a soldering iron. Swiss watchmakers don\u2019t need them; their devices are put together with screws and screwdrivers.", "He led me to a large microscope and placed one of the chip sets under it. When the image appeared on a large computer screen, he zoomed in on the Bluetooth antenna, which looked like a dark, square block. Getting that into the right spot caused him a great deal of trouble, he said.", "\u201cUnder the microscope, we actually welded it on, by hand,\u201d he said. To install it properly, he sought advice from an associate at a technology company. \u201cI said, \u2018I have to place this big antenna, which way do I put it?\u2019\u2009\u201d The technician told him it couldn\u2019t be done manually; technology companies use robots to fix in place components that require that kind of precision. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll see.\u2019\u2009\u201d He had to shave the tip of his soldering iron down to a fine point to use it successfully.", "By January, he finally had a prototype working well, just in time to show it off at Baselworld, the annual Swiss jewelers\u2019 and watchmakers\u2019 fair. Watch designers typically boast about their latest \u201ccomplications,\u201d clever ways of creating gear work to power new features, like calendars or extra dials. This year, though, the chatter at Basel kept coming nervously back to the Apple smartwatch. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant was producing its enhanced watch, and a few Swiss companies were announcing similar plans. But what did this trend mean for the industry? Should they move into smartwatches? Adding chips might help these watchmakers ride the high-tech wave, but it also risked eroding what made them special.", "The prospect made Koeslag jittery. The night before the show, he wore his smartwatch to bed. It tracked his sleep patterns. \u201cI was so stressed I woke up eight times,\u201d he said. His deep sleep totaled just 25 minutes. Many observers had predicted that Apple would spell trouble for Swiss watchmakers, and now Koeslag had some personal data to prove it.", "Smartwatches have been around for years, but none have received as much attention as the Apple Watch. Much of the allure, of course, was Apple\u2019s famously elegant design. It was recognizably a watch, complete with a crown that controlled on-screen apps, but it had Apple\u2019s distinctive aesthetic, with its minimal lines and sleek curves; the watch is a smaller version of an iPhone, essentially.", "Very few companies can turn out such consistently glossy electronics, because few sell enough of their devices to justify the automated processes that keep quality high and prices relatively affordable. For example, to achieve the satiny finish on the bodies of the Apple Watch Sport, the company uses robotized nozzles to blast the aluminum surface with microscopic beads of zirconia. \u201cNo company in the world is finishing and anodizing to Apple\u2019s level,\u201d the product designer Greg Koenig has written. The company\u2019s design prowess rests in part on its mastery of high-volume operations like this.", "Swiss watchmaking emerged from a radically different background, one rooted in meticulous manual labor. The industry got its start in the 16th century after John Calvin persuaded the City Council in Geneva to impose sumptuary laws banning jewelry, and the city\u2019s skilled jewelers joined forces with the makers of pocket watches instead. Later, French Catholics chased Protestant Huguenots out of their country; many of these French exiles happened to be watchmakers, and they settled in Switzerland. In the mountains of the Jura region, they encountered local farmers who spent half the year indoors and idle and who turned out to be extremely patient and detail-oriented. The \u00e9migr\u00e9s hired them to spend their winters hand-polishing tiny metal components for the \u201cmovements,\u201d the watch\u2019s spring-driven inner workings.", "By the 20th century, Swiss watches had become famous for their reliability and complexity. They are also marvels of energy efficiency, because dozens or even hundreds of components depend on tiny wound springs for power. Each new \u201ccomplication\u201d \u2014 say, a calendar that advances the date with a satisfying snap at midnight \u2014 demanded a new set of gears and more energy, thus requiring ever more clever compensations. A mechanical watch is both a dance with and a fight against physics.", "In the early 1970s, centuries of tradition were overturned by an upstart technology: quartz watches. In these, a battery\u2019s electricity causes a quartz crystal to vibrate at an extremely regular frequency, running a motor that turns the watch hands. The resulting timepiece is far more accurate and much cheaper than most mechanical watches. Swiss inventors actually helped pioneer this technology, but watchmakers regarded it as beneath them. A quartz watch might have only a few dozen parts, compared with hundreds in a mechanical one. Where was the challenge?", "When Swiss companies declined to make quartz devices, inexpensive Japanese watches from companies like Seiko became popular around the world. The \u201cquartz crisis\u201d killed off so many Swiss watchmakers that by the end of the 1970s, the number of workers in the industry had shrunk to 30,000 from 90,000. Brands in existence for centuries vanished in a puff of disruption.", "In the 1980s, Swiss companies came back. Swatch introduced a line of inexpensive quartz watches, and other Swiss companies followed its lead. In the 1990s, as Ryan Raffaelli, a Harvard business professor who has studied the Swiss industry, has written, Swiss watchmakers hit on an even more profitable strategy: marketing their expensive mechanical watches as luxury items steeped in history. If you wanted to hand something down to your children, the sales pitch went, spend thousands of dollars on a Rolex or, at the very least, several hundred on a quartz watch with elegant Swiss design. Sales of Swiss watches rebounded; exports have more than doubled since 2000, rising even in the years after the economic meltdown.", "These days, nobody needs a watch to know the time. Time is all around us, displayed on every computer, phone and microwave oven. The Swiss watchmakers realize this. They market their mechanical watches as not only accurate but also deeply symbolic. For those willing to spend $30,000, a traditional Swiss watch marks its owner as a man or woman who appreciates quality, artistry and ingenuity (and, of course, as a wealthy and conspicuous consumer). Wearing a mechanical watch today makes an explicitly antidigital statement, embracing the long pedigree of a device that predates not only computers but electricity itself. It tells the time but is timeless. \u201cA mechanical watch,\u201d Jean-Claude Biver, the chief executive of TAG Heuer, said, \u201cis a piece of eternity in a box.\u201d", "Is the smartwatch the next \u201cquartz crisis\u201d? Few Swiss executives think smartwatches will kill off the high-end market. Nobody, they argue, who spends $50,000 on a piece of handmade eternity will regard an Apple Watch as a substitute. But luxury brands also sell a great many less-expensive quartz watches, and this is where the Apple Watch poses a threat.", "\u201cIf a young man, young woman, is 25 years old, would they rather put 1,200 Swiss francs\u201d \u2014 about $1,300 \u2014 \u201cfor a watch that tells you what time it is and the date, or will they buy, for only $800, a watch that tells you everything?\u201d Biver said. \u201cFor me there is no doubt we will have a very tough competition in the $1,200 price segment.\u201d", "For Switzerland to compete with Silicon Valley, it needed to answer a question that was no longer just stylistic or technical but existential. Raffaelli said, \u201cWhat does it mean to be a watchmaker in a digital world?\u201d", "Peter Stas began pondering that question two years ago. A Dutch \u00e9migr\u00e9 in Switzerland, Stas and his wife, Aletta, founded Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant in 1988 to make the sort of midlevel quartz timepieces now threatened by Apple. Their watches retail for $1,000 and more: \u201cClassical, accessible luxury,\u201d he called them as he sat in his office, surrounded by models of his mahogany motorboat.", "At first, Stas considered making a smartwatch through and through \u2014 LCD screen, apps, Google\u2019s free operating system for wearable devices. He consulted a Portuguese design team but couldn\u2019t find a concept he liked. One crucial issue was power. Watches can accommodate only very small batteries, so users would have to charge their watches every night. (This has been a complaint leveled against the Apple Watch.) The energy-hungry display would be turned off most of the time and activated with a flick of the wrist, but the gesture isn\u2019t always successful. (Another complaint about Apple\u2019s watch: You turn your wrist to check the time, and the screen remains dark.) Like most watchmakers, Stas wanted his quartz watches to run for two years on a single battery.", "A subtler problem was the screen shape. In 2013, the only LCDs available to him were rectangular. \u201cAnd in the watch industry,\u201d Stas told me, \u201cwe know actually that square screens don\u2019t sell to men.\u201d", "So if a screen-based smartwatch wasn\u2019t viable, he wondered, was there another alternative? Stas knew that \u201cactivity tracker\u201d wristbands were popular. A watch is inherently a wristband, albeit a prettier one. After hunting online for suitable electronics to work with, Stas found Fullpower Technologies, a company in Santa Cruz, Calif., that makes the sensors and firmware in activity-trackers built by companies like Nike. He contacted Philippe Kahn, the chief executive, who told Stas that Fullpower\u2019s technology could run for two years on one watch battery. Better yet, Kahn could make the phone software for Stas. It would analyze activity and deep-sleep patterns, so the watch\u2019s alarm could go off at precisely the least disruptive time to wake its wearer.", "The prospect of a partnership excited Stas. Kahn too: He detested the environmental waste of many disposable electronics and loved the idea of building sensors into a watch sufficiently expensive that it would be regarded as an heirloom. Watches are easy to open and repair, unlike many of today\u2019s electronics. When Fullpower develops new sensors a few years from now, owners can have their Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant watches upgraded with better electronics.", "\u201cThe Swiss watch industry sells tens of millions of watches a year, and they are wearable objects that people tend to keep,\u201d Kahn told me. \u201cI\u2019m a dad, and I\u2019ve got kids, and I don\u2019t want to leave a Kleenex world where nothing\u2019s worth fixing and everything gets thrown away.\u201d", "In pursuing an analog design, they hit upon an intriguing concept. Using the phone app, the owner can set an activity goal, like 8,000 steps for a day. Then the watch displays how close you are to meeting it, using the hand on a small, secondary dial: At 2,000 steps, for example, the hand would point to 3 o\u2019clock, signifying 25 percent. Eventually, the dial could quantify all sorts of data: How full is your inbox? How close is your friend to arriving at the restaurant? To Ronnie Bernheim, co-owner (with his brother Andr\u00e9) of the watchmaker Mondaine, which is licensing some of Stas\u2019s and Koeslag\u2019s technology, this approach is superior to the blunt accuracy of a screen. A watch hand is \u201cglanceable,\u201d as he puts it, because it\u2019s only semi-accurate; we peek at an analog wall clock to get a general sense of the time of day, not a precise one.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not interested if it\u2019s 23 percent or 27 percent.\u201d Bernheim said. \u201cYou only want to know \u2018Do I have to move or have I already done pretty good?\u2019\u2009\u201d (The French watchmaker Withings began selling a cheaper watch with similar capabilities this spring.)", "When Koeslag handed me a Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant smartwatch to try on, it had a pleasantly hefty feel. It didn\u2019t seem like a smartwatch at all; there was nothing visibly electronic about it. I loved it. I\u2019m a fan of gadgets and even wore early, clunky smartwatches with LCD screens able to display texts and tweets. But Koeslag\u2019s stylish analog design felt like a steampunk midpoint, the best of both domains: a device that delivered modern types of information, with the romance of old-fashioned dials.", "Bernheim and Stas are diplomatic about the Apple Watch. \u201cWe try to be nice,\u201d Stas said. But he thinks its limitations \u2014 especially the hassle of charging it every night \u2014 will deter some would-be owners. \u201cThere will be plenty of people who are going to buy them. I think the real question will be in three months, five months, if people are still going to wear them.\u201d", "He is even more dubious that any Silicon Valley company could create something with aesthetics lovely enough to penetrate the European luxury market. \u201cWe have to be very clear here,\u201d he told me, leaning back on his black chaise longue. \u201cLuxury business is coming either from Paris, or it\u2019s coming from Italy, and watches are coming from Switzerland. They\u2019re not coming from the U.S.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSilicon Valley \u2014 my God, what they\u2019re wearing and everything! They really don\u2019t have this culture of refinement. We bring something else to the story.\u201d", "A\u2009traditional watch with hidden electronics is one solution to the smartwatch challenge. Montblanc, the European luxury-goods brand, has another, more unusual idea.", "When I visited Alexander Schmiedt, who runs the company\u2019s watch business, in the village of Villeret, he handed me a smartwatch prototype. The actual timepiece is entirely mechanical, from Montblanc\u2019s \u201cTimeWalker\u201d line of watches. It contains no circuitry.", "Instead, the computerized parts are in the wristband. This \u201ce-Strap\u201d features a small rubber module that sits on the wrist\u2019s underside. The module has an inch-and-a-half touch-screen, where white text and images alert the wearer to incoming calls, SMS messages, emails and social-media messages. The screen can only display 16 characters at a time, so reading a message means swiping back and forth across it. Internal activity sensors track and send data to your phone. (The module I saw was a nonworking mock-up.) Watch and e-Strap together will sell for roughly $5,000.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to put the technology inside the watch,\u201d Schmiedt said as he strapped on the TimeWalker, a handsome brushed-stainless-steel body whose black-and-red face was encircled by a black ceramic ring. \u201cIt would mean that after a predetermined while, the watch itself would become outdated.\u201d", "At Montblanc, he said, the engineers tell a story to illustrate the perils of high-tech obsolescence: At graduations in the 1990s, students receive gifts from their parents \u2014 some the latest mobile phone, others a Montblanc fountain pen. Decades later, a phone from the \u201990s is a useless relic. But the Montblanc pen is as good as ever; indeed, the years have imparted character. \u201cIt has a meaning, it has little scratches,\u201d Schmiedt said. \u201cIf I ever scratch up a watch, or \u2014 I don\u2019t know, my child maybe dropped it \u2014 it\u2019s a mark of life.\u201d Our electronics are much less tolerant of faults, he noted, grinning as he held up his own iPhone, whose screen was spider-webbed with cracks.", "Dividing the Montblanc smartwatch into two components may make it less intrusive, Schmiedt believes, because the e-Strap\u2019s screen usually faces away from the wearer. \u201cYou don\u2019t always have it in your sight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can choose when you want to see it.\u201d The OLED screen preserves battery life, too. Montblanc promises five days before the device needs charging.", "Schmiedt is enthusiastic about the e-Strap, of course. But looking at this Janus device \u2014 analog and digital faces on opposing sides \u2014 I couldn\u2019t help thinking that it would be harder for Montblanc to strike a balance between smartwatch and mechanical device than for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant or Mondaine. The latter are younger companies, and Mondaine primarily sells affordable quartz watches. Montblanc, however, is trying to safeguard a much older brand name: In 2007, it bought Minerva, a storied Swiss watchmaker founded in 1858. Famous for producing deeply complex movements beloved by collectors, Minerva foundered during the quartz crisis. When Schmiedt walked into the Minerva factory for the first time, it had a mere 20 workers, fashioning watches using century-old tools.", "\u201cYou had really this living heritage, like a sleeping beauty, as if the thing had been stopped in time,\u201d he told me.", "When I visited that factory, it was alive with quiet, careful activity. In one room, a line of expert watchmakers polished individual pieces. One man in a white coat was hunched over an elongated figure eight of stainless steel, which he would spend a week shaping; next to him, a woman used a 40x magnification microscope and color-coded emery boards to etch 45-degree beveled edges into a half-inch-long \u201cbridge.\u201d Across the room sat a master watchmaker with tattoos down his left arm and on his elbow. His job was to assemble the watch and ensure it worked, then to disassemble it, recleaning and reoiling the parts before putting it back together one final time. On the wall was pinned one of the oldest types of technology in the building: the dried stalk of a local flower. It\u2019s used, I was told, to polish brass parts to a luminous glow.", "At Basel this year, Edouard Meylan, chief executive of the high-end watchmaker H. Moser, issued a news release claiming that he, too, would be introducing a smartwatch. But at the Basel fair, he displayed a traditional mechanical timepiece \u2014 a \u201cperpetual calendar\u201d with bold dials and a meter showing how much energy the spring has left in it. In a promotional video, H. Moser called it \u201cthe original smartwatch,\u201d joking that even \u201cour grandmother could use it.\u201d The message was clear: Watches are already smart.", "When I spoke to Meylan, he was even more direct. Making smartwatches is a mistake, he argued, particularly for elite brands. To be sure, he said \u2014 as many of his peers did \u2014 the Apple Watch will probably be successful. \u201cWith the right battery, eventually it\u2019ll become something very useful that I will probably wear myself,\u201d he said. But he considers putting smartwatch technology inside a mechanical Swiss timepiece to be brand suicide. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a gimmick,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially in our range.\u201d His company, like Montblanc and Ateliers deMonaco, sells watches that cost tens of thousands of dollars. They shouldn\u2019t be creating \u201csome kind of monsters that are a merger of a mobile phone and an actually beautiful mechanical watch.\u201d", "Once a timepiece becomes a computer, what should it not do? Should there be limits? Does watchness become only a trivial part of a smartwatch\u2019s function? \u201cThat\u2019s a little bit the scary thing,\u201d says Pim Koeslag of his work at Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant. \u201cOnce you get into it, you see that this is only the beginning of the beginning.\u201d There\u2019s no GPS in his smartwatch now, but he could imagine putting it in. \u201cYou could put in cameras or weather stations or whatever. The only limit is imagination.\u201d", "TAG Heuer is one high-end brand that plans to produce what Silicon Valley might recognize as a smartwatch: a digital version of the TAG Heuer Carrera. TAG Heuer\u2019s engineers will design the physical case, but everything else will come from technology partners. Intel will make the touch screen and the electronics; Google will provide Android Wear software. The goal is to release something by the end of this year that can compete with Apple on the apps front while also being unmistakably Swiss.", "\u201cAt two meters distance, you will not know, \u2018Is this guy wearing a TAG Heuer Carrera connected or is this guy wearing a chronograph Carrera normal?\u2019\u2009\u201d said Biver, the chief executive of TAG Heuer, when I visited his office in Nyon. \u201cThat will give us the watchmaking appeal, which the computer guys at Apple, Samsung don\u2019t have.\u201d", "Biver is a famously voluble, opinionated figure, prone to grand statements and poetic riffs on the beauty of timepieces. He wears, and occasionally caresses, a chunky watch from Hublot (another luxury brand that he oversees). He says the design of the Apple Watch is \u201cnot very sexy.\u201d", "\u201cThere is not enough emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a reduction of the phone for the wrist.\u201d", "Yet it\u2019s fair to ask how \u201cSwiss\u201d his prospective watch will really be. As several observers told me, it\u2019s just as much an Intel-and-Google watch. \u201cWhere is your value-add?\u201d asks Amy Glasmeier, an M.I.T. professor who has written about the watch industry. Swiss watchmakers, she adds, will need to create their own high-tech intellectual property in smartwatches. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat they\u2019ve got is just the use of their name. It\u2019s not the use of their human capital.\u201d Raffaelli, the Harvard professor, is a bit more sanguine. He says that the Swiss watchmakers may promote their preindustrial history, but they\u2019ve long been experts at innovating. All those mechanical features \u2014 perpetual calendars, self-winding mechanisms \u2014 were the transformative high tech of their day. The clock itself was a first step toward the \u201cquantified self,\u201d making visible information that was previously hidden, your precise progress through the day.", "Even if the Swiss smartwatch never takes off, many of the watch executives I spoke with said that the Apple Watch might be good for sales of high-end mechanical watches.

It came in the midst of a furor over layoffs in January of 250 tech workers at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. People who lost jobs there said they had to sit with immigrants from India, some on temporary work visas known as H-1B, and teach them to perform their jobs as a condition for receiving severance.", "But it remained unclear on Tuesday who had initiated the change of strategy at Disney/ABC or whether it was part of a larger change in direction, because Disney executives declined to discuss it.", "Emails and calls over several days to Kevin Brockman, a senior spokesman for Disney/ABC Television Group, were not returned. Cognizant, the global outsourcing company based in New Jersey that was bringing immigrants to the television group, also did not respond to calls or emails.", "About 15 of the television group\u2019s tech employees were in New York and the rest were based in Burbank.", "The layoffs at Walt Disney World and at other companies have added fuel to a debate about temporary visas, including H-1B\u2019s, that outsourcing firms use to bring immigrants, mainly from India, for technology work. The visas are meant for foreigners with specialized skills to fill discrete positions when Americans with those skills are not available. In the applications large companies must file for the visas, they have to confirm that no American workers will be displaced.", "The Labor Department said last week that it had opened an investigation into two outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, for work they did for Southern California Edison, a power utility. It also referred complaints to the Justice Department for a separate inquiry. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, has called for an investigation of the H-1B visa program.", "Tech workers who lost jobs in Orlando said Cognizant was one of the firms importing Indian immigrants to replace them.", "Current and former Disney tech workers have previously not spoken publicly about the layoffs.

Instead, she grew up to be a designer and professional magpie, founding a company that combined her clothing line with objects collected on her travels.", "She started A D\u00e9tacher in 1998 with $60,000 in the bank, and grew the business in a manner \u2014 slowly, steadily \u2014 that would mystify the venture capitalists who are increasingly swashbuckling into fashion.", "Ms. Kowalska has limited her retail presence, for example, to a single store on the northernmost border of Little Italy (a recent relocation from a few blocks north, on Mott Street) and her wholesaling to a few dozen outposts. The company is kept afloat by a handful of employees. Ms. Kowalska writes the program notes for her runway shows herself, and sometimes models the clothes. One season she turned her teenage daughter\u2019s handwriting into a print.", "Collections emerge in high-concept dollops. Past shows have been inspired by disobedience, sports injuries, grandmotherliness, divorce, the novelist Elena Ferrante, camouflage, Mount Vesuvius, knots, folklore, futurism and female coal-mine workers of the Victorian era. Flipping through photos of old shows is like treating yourself to a rapturous hourlong session with the \u201cRandom\u201d button on Wikipedia.", "The current collection favors roomy playclothes in prints and colors straight from 1970s album art. A cotton top with a jumbo cloud print ($450) has dropped sleeves that yawn at mid-arm, as though a puff sleeve got drunk and keeled over. A marigold frock ($680) is featherlight to the touch and cavernous in shape, less like wearing a dress than being hugged by a bolt of silk.", "Some of the smocklike items toe the (surprisingly thin) line between \u201cgraceful\u201d and \u201cescaped sanitarium patient,\u201d but this doesn\u2019t seem like a misapprehension that would bother the store\u2019s target demo.

We can all live without these curiosities, yet they will make a certain kind of person \u2014 a person whose tastes converge with Ms. Kowalska\u2019s \u2014 exceptionally happy. The store feels personal to a degree verging on taboo, like sneaking upstairs at a dinner party to poke around the host\u2019s walk-in closet.", "It\u2019s also an experiment in behavior modification.

Yet this patient\u2019s heart was beating normally; there was no reason for her to have such clots.", "Could this be some kind of infection in the heart? Some bacteria or viruses can invade the heart muscle and cause unusual growths on the heart itself. Tiny strokes are a known complication of these types of infections.

And she had an echocardiogram done of her heart to look for a clot or abnormal growth.", "Her heart was normal. Most of the blood tests were normal. After nearly a week of searching, the only significant abnormality found, besides the strokes themselves, was a slight increase in antibodies that promote clot formation. That suggested that she might have a disorder known as antiphospholipid syndrome, or APS. This disease is seen mostly in young or middle aged women and can make blood clot as it passes through the small vessels of the brain and cause strokes.", "However, it wasn\u2019t a very convincing diagnosis. The blood level of these antibodies was just a little above normal. Still, it was the only thing found that might explain the strokes. She was put on a medication to reduce her ability to form blood clots and sent home.", "Back to Normal?", "At home the patient eagerly went back to her routine. Her week in the hospital remained something of a blur in her memory, but she felt like she was back to normal for the most part. She was thinking clearly and the weird sensations she had in her legs and eyes were gone. She was ready to move on and put the whole thing behind her.

She listened as the patient went over the events of the past 15 months, since her return from that awful trip to Africa, and examined her carefully. The exam was normal. But the scans she had brought were striking, dotted with the white spots that had been thought to represent strokes.", "Dr. Schepp reviewed the thorough work-up she had had so far. What hadn\u2019t been considered? There were a couple of unusual causes of stroke that came to mind, but none seemed likely.", "What if these white spots weren\u2019t strokes? Could this be multiple sclerosis? MS was most commonly seen in women, usually in this age group. It too shows up on M.R.I.\u2019s as scattered white spots in the brain. The spinal cord is usually affected as well.", "She sent the young woman to get an M.R.I. of the spine and a spinal tap. The presence of abnormalities in these tests would support a diagnosis of MS.", "But even if those tests were normal, it wouldn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t have it. MS is not an easy disease to diagnose. And although her symptoms weren\u2019t classic for the disorder, it is by far the most common chronic neurological disease among women her age.", "The tests were negative.

The sultans and the members of their court refused to learn the languages of the infidels, so the task of expediting communication with Europe devolved upon a hereditary caste of translators, the Phanariots. They were Greeks with Venetian citizenship residing in Istanbul. European diplomats never liked working with them, because their loyalty was not to the intent of the foreign original but to the sultan\u2019s preference.

If that were possible, a variety of local industries would lose the final advantage of their natural camouflage, and centralization \u2014 in social networking, the news, science \u2014 would accelerate geometrically. Nobody in machine translation thinks that we are anywhere close to that goal; for now, efforts in the discipline are mostly concerned with the dutiful assembly of \u201ccargo trucks\u201d to ferry information across linguistic borders. The hope is that machines might efficiently and cheaply perform the labor of rendering sentences whose informational content is paramount: \u201cThis metal is hot,\u201d \u201cMy mother is in that collapsed house,\u201d \u201cStay away from that snake.\u201d Beyond its use in Google Translate, machine translation has been most successfully and widely implemented in the propagation of continent-\u00adspanning weather reports or the reproduction in 27 languages of user manuals for appliances.

In May, a computational linguist named Lane Schwartz, who teaches at the University of Illinois at Urbana-\u00adChampaign, hosted the first Machine Translation Marathon in the Americas, a weeklong hackathon to improve the open-source tools that those without Google resources share. Urbana-Champaign is largely known outside Illinois for two people: David Foster Wallace, who grew up there, and Marc Andreessen, who invented the first widely adopted graphical web browser as a student at the university.

At the presentations, computer scientists with straight faces regularly made comments like \u201cParagraphs arguably should be coherent in topic\u201d or \u201cGrammatical structure can matter in a sentence.\u201d One presenter said that sometimes French places its adjective before the noun and sometimes after, but that, he concluded with a short shrug, \u201cnobody knows why or when.\u201d", "One of the American marathon presenters wore two consecutive days of threadbare grammar T-shirts \u2014 one read, \u201cGood grammar costs nothing!\u201d and the other, \u201cI am silently correcting your grammar\u201d \u2014 so I imagined he might see his algorithmic work in the context of broader linguistic interests. I asked him if he spoke any other languages, and he said: \u201cI speak American high-school French, which is to say I don\u2019t. But it\u2019s surprising how little it helps to know another language. When you\u2019re working with so many languages, it\u2019s actually not helpful to know one.\u201d (His third T-shirt read, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me, I\u2019m lost, too.\u201d)", "The possibility of machine translation, Schwartz explained, emerged from World War II. Weaver, an American scientist and government administrator, had learned about the work of the British cryptographers who broke the Germans\u2019 Enigma code. It occurred to him that cryptographic investigations might solve an immediate postwar problem: keeping abreast of Russian scientific publications. There simply weren\u2019t enough translators around, and even if there were, it would require an army of them to stay current with the literature. \u201cWhen I look at an article in Russian,\u201d Weaver wrote, \u201cI say: \u2018This is really written in English, but it has been coded in some strange symbols. I will now proceed to decode.\u2019\u2009\u201d In this view, Russian was merely English in frilly Cyrillic costume, only one small step removed from pig Latin.", "Within a year or two, this idea was understood as absurd, and yet the broader notion of algorithmic processing held. By 1954 the American public was treated to a demonstration of the first nonnumerical application of computing. A secretary typed a Russian sentence onto a series of punch cards; the computer whirred and spat out an English equivalent. The Christian Science Monitor wrote that the \u201celectronic brain\u201d at the demonstration \u201cdidn\u2019t even strain its superlative versatility and flicked out its interpretation with a nonchalant attitude of assumed intellectual achievement.\u201d", "That demonstration, however, was basically rigged. The computer had been given a pidgin vocabulary (a total of 250 words) and fed a diet of simple declarative sentences. In 1960, one of the earliest researchers in the field, the philosopher and mathematician Yehoshua Bar-\u00adHillel, wrote that no machine translation would ever pass muster without human \u201cpost-\u00adediting\u201d; he called attention to sentences like \u201cThe pen is in the box\u201d and \u201cThe box is in the pen.\u201d For a translation machine to be successful in such a situation of semantic ambiguity, it would need at hand not only a dictionary but also a \u201cuniversal encyclopedia.\u201d The brightest future for machine translation, he suggested, would rely on coordinated efforts between plodding machines and well-\u00adtrained humans. The scientific community largely came to accept this view: Machine translation required the help of trained linguists, who would derive increasingly abstract grammatical rules to distill natural languages down to the sets of formal symbols that machines could manipulate.", "This paradigm prevailed until 1988, year zero for modern machine translation, when a team of IBM\u2019s speech-\u00adrecognition researchers presented a new approach. What these computer scientists proposed was that Warren Weaver\u2019s insight about cryptography was essentially correct \u2014 but that the computers of the time weren\u2019t nearly powerful enough to do the job. \u201cOur approach,\u201d they wrote, \u201ceschews the use of an intermediate mechanism (language) that would encode the \u2018meaning\u2019 of the source text.\u201d All you had to do was load reams of parallel text through a machine and compute the statistical likelihood of \u00admatches across languages. If you train a computer on enough material, it will come to understand that 99.9 percent of the time, \u201cthe butterfly\u201d in an English text corresponds to \u201cle papillon\u201d in a parallel French one. One researcher quipped that his system performed incrementally better each time he fired a linguist. Human collaborators, preoccupied with shades of \u201cmeaning,\u201d could henceforth be edited out entirely.", "Though some researchers still endeavor to train their computers to translate Dante with panache, the brute-force method seems likely to remain ascendant. This statistical strategy, which supports Google Translate and Skype Translator and any other contemporary system, has undergone nearly three decades of steady refinement. The problems of semantic ambiguity have been lessened \u2014 by paying pretty much no attention whatsoever to semantics. The English word \u201cbank,\u201d to use one frequent example, can mean either \u201cfinancial institution\u201d or \u201cside of a river,\u201d but these are two distinct words in French. When should it be translated as \u201cbanque,\u201d when as \u201crive\u201d? A probabilistic model will have the computer examine a few of the other words nearby. If your sentence elsewhere contains the words \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201crobbery,\u201d the proper translation is probably \u201cbanque.\u201d (This doesn\u2019t work in every instance, of course \u2014 a machine might still have a hard time with the relatively simple sentence \u201cA Parisian has to have a lot of money to live on the Left Bank.\u201d) Furthermore, if you have a good probabilistic model of what standard sentences in a language do and don\u2019t look like, you know that the French equivalent of \u201cThe box is in the ink-\u00adfilled writing implement\u201d is encountered approximately never.", "Contemporary emphasis is thus not on finding better ways to reflect the wealth or intricacy of the source language but on using language models to smooth over garbled output. A good metaphor for the act of translation is akin to the attempt to answer the question \u201cWhat player in basketball corresponds to the quarterback?\u201d Current researchers believe that you don\u2019t really need to know much about football to answer this question; you just need to make sure that the people who have been drafted to play basketball understand the game\u2019s rules. In other words, knowledge of any given source language \u2014 and the universal cultural encyclopedia casually encoded within it \u2014 is growing ever more irrelevant.", "Many computational linguists continue to claim that, after all, they are interested only in \u201cthe gist\u201d and that their duty is to find inexpensive and fast ways of trucking the gist across languages. But they have effectively arrogated to themselves the power to draw a bright line where \u201cthe gist\u201d ends and \u201cstyle\u201d begins. Human translators think it\u2019s not so simple. The machinist\u2019s attitude is that when someone\u2019s mother is trapped under a house, it\u2019s fussy and self-\u00adimportant to worry too much about nuance. They see the redundancy and allusiveness of natural languages as a matter not of intricacy but of confusion and inefficiency. Most valuable utterances revert to the mean of statistical probability. If this makes them unpopular with poets and fanciers of language, so be it. \u201cGo to the American Translators Association convention,\u201d one marathon attendee told me, \u201cand you\u2019ll see \u2014 they hate us.\u201d", "This is to some extent true. As the translator Susan Bernofsky put it to me, \u201cThey create the impression that translation is not an art.\u201d (A widely admired literary translator, who wished to remain anonymous, admitted that although she worries about machine translation\u2019s mission creep, she thinks Google Translate is a wonderful tool for writing notes to the woman who cleans her house.)", "What mostly annoys human translators isn\u2019t the arrogance of machines but their appropriation of the work of forgotten or anonymous humans. Machine translation necessarily supervenes on previous human effort; otherwise there wouldn\u2019t be the parallel corpora that the machines need to do their work. I mentioned to an Israeli graduate student that I had been reading the Wikipedia page of Yehoshua Bar-\u00adHillel and had found out that his granddaughter, Gili, is a minor celebrity in Israel as the translator of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books. He hadn\u2019t heard of her and didn\u2019t seem interested in the process by which a publisher paid to import books about magic for children. But we would have no such tools as Google Translate for the Hebrew-\u00adEnglish language pair if Bar-\u00adHillel had not hand-\u00adtranslated, with care, more than 4,000 pages of an extremely useful parallel corpus. In a sense, their machines aren\u2019t actually translating; they\u2019re just speeding along tracks set down by others. This is the original sin of machine translation: The field would be nowhere without the human translators they seek, however modestly, to supersede.", "Perhaps to paper over the associated guilt, the group in Urbana-Champaign cultivated a minor resentment toward their human counterparts. More than once I heard someone at the marathon refer to the fact that human translators are finicky and inconsistent and prone to complaint. Quality control is impossible. As one attendee explained to me, \u201cIf you show a translator an unidentified version of his own translation of a text from a year ago, he\u2019ll look it over and tell you it\u2019s terrible.\u201d", "One computational linguist said, with a knowing leer, that there is a reason we have more than 20 translations in English of \u201cDon Quixote.\u201d It must be because nobody ever gets it right. If the translators can\u2019t even make up their own minds about what it means to be \u201cfaithful\u201d or \u201caccurate,\u201d what\u2019s the point of worrying too much about it? Let\u2019s just get rid of the whole antiquated fidelity concept. All the Sancho Panzas, all the human translators and all the computational linguists are in the same leaky boat, but the machinists are bailing out the water while the humans embroider monograms on the sails.", "But like many engineers, the computational linguists are so committed to the power and craftsmanship of their means that they tend to lose perspective on whose ends they are advancing. The problem with human translators, from the time of the Phanariots, is that there is always the possibility that they might be serving the ends of their bosses rather than the intent of the text itself. But at least a human translator asks the very questions \u2014 What purpose is this text designed to serve? What aims are encoded in this language? \u2014 that a machine regards as entirely beside the point.", "The problem is that all texts have some purpose in mind, and what a good human translator does is pay attention to how the means serve the end \u2014 how the \u201cstyle\u201d exists in relationship to \u201cthe gist.\u201d The oddity is that belief in the existence of an isolated \u201cgist\u201d often obscures the interests at the heart of translation. Toward the end of the marathon, I asked a participant why he chose to put his computer-\u00adscience background to the service of translation. He mentioned, as many of them did, a desire to develop tools that would be helpful in earthquakes or war. Beyond that, he said, he hoped to help ameliorate the time lag in the proliferation of international news.

But Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is in a sense the Valley\u2019s closest rival. American investors are beginning to catch on, and venture capital is starting to flow west, across the Pacific. An early-stage American venture firm called 500 Startups recently spun off a small fund called 500 Kimchi, which focuses exclusively on South Korea. Last fall, Goldman Sachs led a round of investment in Woowa Brothers and its delivery service. In May, Google opened a campus in Seoul, its first in Asia.

In it, they can glimpse a future where the most ambitious dreams of Silicon Valley \u2014 a cashless, carless, everything-on-demand society \u2014 have already been realized. Nearly all of Seoul\u2019s residents use smartphones, and many of the services just now gaining in popularity in the United States have been commonplace in South Korea for years.", "Much of this was made possible by two decades of enormous public investment. Seoul is blanketed with free Wi-Fi that offers the world\u2019s fastest Internet speeds \u2014 twice as fast as the average American\u2019s. Back in 1995, the government began a 10-year plan to build out the country\u2019s broadband infrastructure and, through a series of public programs, to teach Koreans what they could do with it. South Korea also eased regulations on service providers to ensure that consumers would have a multitude of choices \u2014 in marked contrast to America, where a handful of cable and telecommunications monopolies dominate the market. Such healthy competition in Korea keeps the cost of access low.", "To maintain South Korea\u2019s lead, the country\u2019s Science Ministry recently announced a $1.5 billion initiative to upgrade Korea\u2019s mobile infrastructure. By 2020, the government predicts, it will be 1,000 times faster \u2014 so fast you could download a feature-length movie in approximately one second.

KakaoTalk was developed in 2010 by Beom-su Kim, an early web pioneer in Korea who built a popular online gaming portal called Hangame. A failed effort to take Hangame to the United States happened to coincide with the release of the first iPhone. Beom-su Kim bought several and began developing apps for them, a full two years before the device would arrive in South Korea. KakaoTalk was one of his first creations.", "The app was quickly adopted by Korean users as a free alternative to text messaging. Part of its success is due to the fact that KakaoTalk functions like its own version of the Internet within a smartphone: Users don\u2019t have to close the app, ever, to check the news, talk to friends, order dinner or play games. To an American, the app\u2019s design is insane, like stepping into a demented fun house. Pages are drenched in neon and populated with googly-eyed cartoon animals.", "By contrast, American mobile design is fetishistically minimalist. Silicon Valley applauds itself for good taste in this regard, but this aesthetic has sprung up partly in response to a deficiency: Americans have learned to strip out bandwidth-guzzling elements because they slow down loading times. Korean designers, lacking such bandwidth restraints, can stuff their apps full of all the information and widgets they like. On-screen real estate isn\u2019t an issue, either, because Koreans prefer massive phones. While the \u201cphablet\u201d \u2014 the missing link between a phone and a tablet \u2014 is popular as a punch line in the United States, it\u2019s been in high demand in South Korea for years.", "This trans-Pacific gap in bandwidth is so pronounced that Korean developers often have to strip down their software if they want to take it stateside. Nicole Kim, chief executive of a file-sharing service called Sunshine, which recently opened an office in San Francisco, said the service had to be adapted to inferior American broadband. \u201cWe made Sunshine simpler because the speeds are quite lower than the Korean and Hong Kong networks,\u201d she said. She says her engineers recoded the app to allow for the sharing of smaller items, like design files and business documents. In Asia, people use Sunshine for more bandwidth-intensive files, like music and videos.", "Even when Korean firms don\u2019t encounter technological issues, the design gulch can confound their attempts to lure American customers. In 2014, Doyon Kim was tasked with taking Band, a South Korean mobile-messaging app, to Silicon Valley. Band lets friends chat, plan outings, share video files, split bills and even conduct informal polls about where to go to dinner. Doyon Kim says that the sheer number of Band\u2019s functions confused users who were not accustomed to performing all of those tasks within a single app.", "\u201cAs a newcomer in the United States, products have to have one strong feature to market,\u201d he said. \u201cBand had so many features and functionalities, that when people saw the product, they didn\u2019t really get it.\u201d The app got lost in the mix of services like GroupMe, Venmo, Tilt and Dropbox \u2014 well-established stand-alone products that let people perform the individual functions that Band offered.

Yo allows users to send messages saying one thing only \u2014 \u201cYo.\u201d \u2014 and thanks to its charming idiocy, it became an overnight sensation. It quickly raised $1.5 million and was valued at as much as 10 times that, despite having, to put it mildly, extremely limited utility. Still, it spawned a series of other hypersimple applications, including \u201cLo,\u201d which lets you share your location, and \u201c1minLate,\u201d which automatically alerts your friends when you\u2019re running late. The success of Yo revealed a lot about Silicon Valley ideology: For all the changing-the-world talk, novelty frequently outweighs functionality.", "Among the wave of single-use apps is a category that has come to be called \u201cUbers for X\u201d \u2014 firms that, as Uber does with cars, promise the delivery of a service in physical space at the tap of a button. A site called Product Hunt lists dozens of them, and, as a group, they\u2019re enlightening. There\u2019s Shortcut (Uber for haircuts), Minibar (Uber for alcohol), Doughbies On-Demand (Uber for fresh chocolate-chip cookies), JetMe (Uber for private jets), Eaze (Uber for marijuana) and many more.

Eric Kim, a founder of Goodwater Capital, a global venture firm that invests heavily in South Korea, said that the country\u2019s high population density and relative homogeneity makes it ideal for testing out new mobile services. There are about 50 million people in South Korea, and one in five of them lives in Seoul. Services that would be logistically difficult to deploy in much of the United States scale easily in the capital.", "Eric Kim offered the example of Coupang, a rising e-commerce company that offers same-day delivery, and sometimes same-hour delivery, for things like groceries and diapers. (He is on the company\u2019s board.) It helps that delivery culture is so deeply established in Seoul, where people are accustomed to having couriers meet them at the subway station near their homes to deliver their dry cleaning and, occasionally, their dinner. Meanwhile, most Americans are still adjusting to using Amazon for more than books and gifts.", "South Korea\u2019s biggest start-ups are still dwarfed by the behemoths of California. But the Valley is keen to learn from their businesses, many of which turn healthy profits \u2014 something that many celebrated start-ups don\u2019t do.", "One thing Silicon Valley hopes to learn is how to get Americans to actually pay for things on their phones. For years now, Koreans have carried out important daily transactions, like paying bills and shopping, on their smartphones. They\u2019re also more inclined to pay for virtual accouterments that liven up digital interactions: for example, virtual stickers that, for $1 to $2 per pack, can be pasted into online and mobile chats. Line and KakaoTalk are among the largest mobile chatting apps in South Korea, with revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and only a portion of their income is derived from advertising. The rest comes from selling those digital stickers, as well as music and games.", "Silicon Valley might also learn how to cater to more customers in more countries around the world. Most Korean companies have been internationally minded since their inception, aware of their own limitations: South Korea is such a small market that entrepreneurs are forced to consider how they might adapt to business abroad.", "But without a more affordable, better mobile web, even the best new offerings from American entrepreneurs will be stuck in the past. Perhaps one of the biggest lessons Silicon Valley\u2019s innovators should learn from South Korea is that to radically change how everyday people live their lives, they\u2019ll need to convince their nation to invest in infrastructure, so that we can actually use the services they want to sell us."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/technology/dick-costolo-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After replacing much of Twitter\u2019s top management team last year, Dick Costolo told members of the company\u2019s board that he wanted them to replace him as chief executive, too.", "On Thursday, they did just that, announcing that Mr. Costolo will step down July 1 and appointing Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s co-founder and former chief, as interim chief executive while they look for a permanent successor.", "Mr. Costolo, a wealthy former entrepreneur who has led Twitter for the last five years, had grown tired of second-guessing by Wall Street, with its focus on the social network\u2019s sluggish user growth and its repeated failures to make its products more appealing.

Only 1 percent of the liquid-crystal display panels it bought from the cartel suppliers were shipped directly to Motorola in the United States for assembly in cellphones sold in the United States. Another 42 percent of the panels were shipped to Motorola foreign subsidiaries, mainly in China and Singapore, for cellphones assembled there and sold in the American market. The remaining 57 percent of the panels were bought by Motorola\u2019s foreign subsidiaries for cellphones assembled abroad and sold in markets outside the United States.", "Motorola asserts that it operates as a \u201csingle enterprise,\u201d orchestrating its American and overseas operations to design and produce products globally.

(In a court filing last year, Motorola said it repatriated the profits from its foreign subsidiaries in the five years covered by the cartel case.)", "\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Judge Posner writes, \u201cMotorola thinks U.S. antitrust remedies more fearsome than those available to its foreign subsidiaries under foreign laws.\u201d", "But, he adds later, \u201cMotorola can\u2019t just ignore its corporate structure whenever it\u2019s in its interests to do so. It can\u2019t pick and choose from the benefits and burdens of United States corporate citizenship.\u201d", "Motorola, Judge Posner writes, was an \u201cindirect purchaser\u201d of the panels its foreign subsidiaries bought and used to assemble cellphones. Thus, he concludes, Motorola cannot bring a civil antitrust suit in the United States \u2014 even though many Motorola cellphones with price-fixed screens were sold in the American market and the Justice Department had a strong criminal case.", "The Motorola side disputes Judge Posner\u2019s analysis. The judge, said Thomas C. Goldstein, counsel for Motorola, \u201cgot it wrong, and this is a superimportant issue.\u201d", "Some antitrust experts question Judge Posner\u2019s ruling. The law he cited, the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982, was passed to ensure American exporters that the United States antitrust law would generally not follow them abroad. \u201cBut Motorola is an importer here, and the statute has been turned against them, which wasn\u2019t the intent of the law,\u201d said Harry First, a professor at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThe ruling is bizarre in that sense.\u201d", "His colleague at the N.Y.U. law school, Eleanor M. Fox, said if the ruling in the civil case stands, it would be \u201ca retrogressive step for world antitrust enforcement, reducing deterrence and opening the door to more global cartels.\u201d", "Still, it is unclear how much the Judge Posner ruling might affect the operations of companies and their global trading behavior.", "Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Iowa College of Law, says that while the underlying evidence in the criminal and civil cases is similar, the legal standards are different. And he sides with Justice Posner\u2019s opinion. \u201cBoth cases were rightly decided, in my view,\u201d he said.", "Antitrust law, Mr. Hovenkamp suggests, has to be renewed and reinterpreted for a modern global economy, just as corporations must adapt and change. For proof of the latter, look no further than Motorola itself. In 2006, at the end of the five-year period covered in the cartel case, the company was riding high on the success of its sleek flip-style cellphone, the Razr. But Motorola lost its leadership in the smartphone era, which began with Apple\u2019s introduction of the iPhone in 2007.

My three-hour visit felt incredibly rushed.)", "The city has several other worthwhile attractions. Victor Hugo\u2019s birthplace, for example, is just 2.50 euros, and there\u2019s a free and good English audio tour of the lively museum devoted to the writer\u2019s political and literary life, which hadn\u2019t even started when he left the city as a baby of six weeks.

I did it fondue style, which worked just fine.

It also includes two glasses of wine, each chosen and delivered to you, by the owner.", "Figuring I wasn\u2019t likely to find myself back here anytime soon, I added a 7-euro starter, a croustillant au maroilles \u2014 pungent, nearly molten Maroilles cheese from the north of France and smoked pork belly wrapped in a crackling thin pastry the shape of a blintz. Final tally was 28 euros for a three-course meal with three paired wines.", "It was with three glasses of wine down the hatch that I visited the Citadel, which, come to think of it, may have increased my wonder at finding kangaroos.

It isn\u2019t every day that you hear a tech executive admit there is an opaque trade-off at the heart of his industry. We users give digital giants access to our most private information, and they shower us with technology we can\u2019t do without. It is an arrangement baked into every decision made in every boardroom in Silicon Valley, and it is a bargain that many of us are uneasy about. Now, finally, here was the leader of the world\u2019s most powerful company asking whether that deal is worth the trouble.", "But while Mr. Cook raised awareness for digital privacy, his speech glossed over two main issues. For one, he neglected to mention that Apple also collects a great deal of data about how we use technology. While it has more protections for that data than many rivals, the company plainly states in its privacy policy that it does use private data in many ways, including to build and market its own products, and to build its own advertising network. Apple\u2019s most profitable devices sit at the center of a tech ecosystem teeming with businesses that collect our data \u2014 and if those social networks, search engines and other free apps didn\u2019t exist, Apple\u2019s products would be far less useful.", "Mr. Cook also failed to fairly explore the substantial benefits that free, ad-supported services have brought to consumers worldwide. Many hundreds of millions of people now have access to more information and communication technologies because of such services.", "An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.", "The fact that Apple goes out of its way to include free services like Google search in its iPhones and iPads suggests that it agrees with the rest of the tech industry \u2014 and many users \u2014 that ad-supported services can, on balance, be good for the world. The question to ask is not whether we should ever use those free services, but rather whether, when we do use them, we are given enough information and disclosure to be able to make those decisions rationally.", "\u201cThere are timeless principles around fair dealings with consumers,\u201d said Nuala O\u2019Connor, the president and chief executive of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a tech-focused think tank. \u201cAnd the first and main thing is, does the customer know what\u2019s happening to them?\u201d She argued that if companies were transparent and honest about how they use people\u2019s data, customers could freely weigh the benefits and costs of online services.", "In his speech to EPIC, Mr. Cook offered a much starker, and less practical, view of privacy. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you should ever have to trade it for a service that you think is free but actually comes at a very high cost.\u201d", "That bold pronouncement got me wondering whether Mr. Cook uses a different iPhone from every iPhone that Apple has ever sold me. On my iPhone, Google is right there in the search bar, by default. Microsoft\u2019s Bing is built into Siri, and Facebook and Twitter beckon me from the sharing menu.", "If Apple really didn\u2019t think that its customers should trade their data for free services, you\u2019d guess that it would build its own ad-free web search engine for its devices. But Apple does not do so. Instead, it sells off the search bar to ad-supported search companies. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that Apple\u2019s current deal with Google is worth billions; at least indirectly, then, Apple benefits financially from Google\u2019s ad-gotten gains.", "And that\u2019s not all. When I go to Apple\u2019s App Store, I\u2019m presented with a bevy of free apps that are supported either in whole or in part by ads. This vibrant marketplace works in Apple\u2019s favor \u2014 the more free apps there are, the more useful the iPhone becomes. That dynamic explains why, in 2010, Apple created iAd, its own advertising network meant to foster the ad-supported app marketplace. IAd lets marketers target users of Apple\u2019s devices based on their purchases from the iTunes store, purchases that Apple of course tracks by default. (You can use an ad-supported search engine like Google to find instructions for opting out.)", "There\u2019s nothing terribly wrong with any of this. Yes, there are downsides to the ad-supported tech industry, and, yes, privacy advocates and tech insiders like Mr. Cook should continue to push the entire industry to more stringently protect our data. But it would be insane to argue that we haven\u2019t seen benefits in return for this data. Anyone who uses devices like the ones Apple makes can see that ad-driven businesses like Google, Facebook and Twitter have improved people\u2019s lives in major ways.", "Among other things, ad-supported services give us instant access to more information than was ever stored in the entirety of the world\u2019s libraries just a few decades ago. They also create systems that allow for instant communication and organization between more than a billion people. They are helping to provide life-changing miniature computers, also known as phones, to people in developing nations for about $50 each. They\u2019ve given us artificial-intelligence supercomputers that can instantly translate languages or recognize speech. And, indirectly, they\u2019re creating upcoming wonders like self-driving cars and balloons that wire up the globe in Internet access.", "Mr. Cook is fond of arguing that \u201cwhen an online service is free, you\u2019re not the customer; you\u2019re the product.\u201d That view is simplistic because it overlooks the economic logic of these services, especially the idea that many of them would never work without a business model like advertising. Services like social networks and search engines get substantially better as more people use them \u2014 which means that the more they cost to users, the worse they are. They work best when they\u2019re free, and the best way to make them free is to pay for them with another business that depends on scale \u2014 and advertising is among the best such businesses.", "Mr. Cook is right to promote Apple\u2019s privacy policies. Apple places more restrictions on the use of data than other tech companies. This has been especially true recently after Apple moved to institute more rigorous security measures after an embarrassing hacking last fall in which female celebrities\u2019 photos were stolen from their iCloud accounts.", "Apple\u2019s newer privacy and security initiatives \u2014 including its decision to encrypt your iPhone data by default in a way that makes it virtually inaccessible to the government \u2014 are laudable. At its developer conference this week, executives made the case that they could create services based on data about how you use your phone without sending that data into the cloud for analysis. This, they argued, was far safer than Google\u2019s practice of combining all your activities into a single dossier housed online that could be used to create more services but also to help advertisers.", "\u201cI\u2019m not saying Apple is perfect, but I think on privacy Apple does compare favorably with Google,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of EPIC, the group that honored Mr. Cook. Mr. Rotenberg pointed to a number of areas in which ad-supported Internet companies have played loose with users\u2019 privacy; Google, Facebook, Snapchat and Myspace have all signed settlements with the Federal Trade Commission after misbehaving with data.", "But it is also worth noting that Google and Facebook do not actually sell people\u2019s data to advertisers, as Mr. Cook suggested they did in his EPIC speech. (As with Apple\u2019s ad system, they allow marketers to target you based on your profile.) In many areas of security and transparency, Google has been ahead of Apple. For instance, Google offered two-factor authentication of cloud-bound data before Apple did.", "Apple\u2019s business model also comes at a cost. Services that are sold as part of its hardware are usually hampered by lock-in and limits of reach. IMessage and FaceTime promise end-to-end encryption, which will prevent anyone from ever snooping on your conversations. But iMessage and FaceTime work only with other Apple devices because Apple has little business interest in building encrypted chat for people who can\u2019t afford iPhones.", "So what to do if your friends can\u2019t afford privacy? You\u2019re not out of luck. Apple has made it easy for you.

Ever since desktop computers became popular, there has always been some degree of parallelism in computers, with several different computations being performed simultaneously, by different components, such as the hard-drive controller and the central processor.

Much of the logic can be executed in parallel, much like what happens in a brain.", "Although my colleagues and I don\u2019t literally think that the brain is a field programmable gate array, our suggestion is that the brain might similarly consist of highly orchestrated sets of fundamental building blocks, such as \u201ccomputational primitives\u201d for constructing sequences, retrieving information from memory, and routing information between different locations in the brain. Identifying those building blocks, we believe, could be the Rosetta stone that unlocks the brain.", "To put this differently, it is unlikely that we will ever be able to directly connect the language of neurons and synapses to the diversity of human behavior, as many neuroscientists seem to hope. The chasm between brains and behavior is just too vast.", "Our best shot may come instead from dividing and conquering. Fundamentally, that may involve two steps: finding some way to connect the scientific language of neurons and the scientific language of computational primitives (which would be comparable in computer science to connecting the physics of electrons and the workings of microprocessors); and finding some way to connect the scientific language of computational primitives and that of human behavior (which would be comparable to understanding how computer programs are built out of more basic microprocessor instructions).", "If neurons are akin to computer hardware, and behaviors are akin to the actions that a computer performs, computation is likely to be the glue that binds the two.", "There is much that we don\u2019t know about brains.

That uncertainty only added weight to all the questions about his recovery and the Mets\u2019 search for a stopgap replacement.", "\u201cI don\u2019t expect him back in the next couple of weeks, by any means,\u201d General Manager Sandy Alderson said. \u201cBut at the same time, we do expect him back sometime this season.\u201d", "Even though Wright has been gone for so long, he had his own locker set up here, and he stood there answering questions for about 23 minutes. He described his current schedule: working with the back specialist Dr. Robert Watkins, attending therapy seven days a week and checking his progress once a week.", "Wright said that from his understanding, the condition developed because of two factors: He naturally has a narrower spinal column than normal, and a stress fracture he sustained in his back in 2011 narrowed the column even further.", " Wright recalled a moment when he was talking with a doctor over the phone, relaying his symptoms, and he first heard the word \u201cstenosis.\u201d The doctor warned Wright not to search the term on Google, but Wright did so anyway.

Earlier in the day, Wright sat in Manager Terry Collins\u2019s office, talking about his injury, his progress and himself. One by one, when his teammates passed the door, they stopped to talk, too. Many of them had been texting him frequently.", "\u201cI don\u2019t have any problems getting ready,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you how those guys feel. I just know that when David got hurt the first time, when he hurt the hamstring the first day and was going to be out, the veteran guys stood up and said: \u2018Listen, we still have a good team. We can still do this. He\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u201d", "The Mets have played all but eight games without Wright this season. They have tried to squeak by at third base, playing backups \u2014 Eric Campbell, Danny Muno, Ruben Tejada \u2014 as if they thought Wright\u2019s return was imminent.", "But on Tuesday, Alderson indicated that he would search the free-agent and trade markets. The most logical candidate would be a veteran whose contract expires at the end of the season, which would minimize the cost to acquire and pay the player.", "Alderson also indicated that Wilmer Flores or Daniel Murphy could move to third base. Collins said Monday that aside from Wright, Murphy was the Mets\u2019 best third baseman. Flores\u2019s athleticism would seem better suited for third, but Alderson stressed the importance of continuity. He worried that moving Flores would imply that the Mets did not believe in his ability at shortstop.", "\u201cWe\u2019re not on the edge of our seat waiting for David to come back at this point,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cWe have to continue to assess what our options may be. We do that, not on a daily basis, but very frequently.\u201d", "Still, he later added, \u201cwe\u2019re not looking for his replacement.\u201d", "For now, Wright is trying to relieve the inflammation in his back. Then he will continue strengthening his back muscles as a way to compensate for the weak areas. He will have to exercise a certain way, and prepare for games in a different way.", "His doctors have warned him that if he rushes his rehab, the injury will worsen. The likelihood of having surgery would then increase, and at Wright\u2019s age, if he wanted to keep playing, they strongly suggested he avoid the surgery. When Wright eventually returns, he will have to be mindful of his back at all times. If he tries to play through pain the way he has in the past, he could easily reinjure it.", "\u201cIf that means being a little more conservative, then that means being a little more conservative,\u201d Wright said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not just talking about playing baseball. We\u2019re talking about walking and standing and being pain-free.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/zeynep-tufekci-mark-zuckerberg-let-me-pay-for-facebook.html": ["FACEBOOK.

He even helped invent the pop-up ad because corporations were wary of the user content appearing next to their ads. He came to regret both: the pop-up and the ad-financed business model. The former is annoying but it\u2019s the latter that is helping destroy the fabric of a rich, pluralistic Internet.", "Mr. Zuckerman points out that Facebook makes about 20 cents per user per month in profit. This is a pitiful sum, especially since the average user spends an impressive 20 hours on Facebook every month, according to the company. This paltry profit margin drives the business model: Internet ads are basically worthless unless they are hyper-targeted based on tracking and extensive profiling of users. This is a bad bargain, especially since two-thirds of American adults don\u2019t want ads that target them based on that tracking and analysis of personal behavior.", "This way of doing business rewards huge Internet platforms, since ads that are worth so little can support only companies with hundreds of millions of users.", "Ad-based businesses distort our online interactions. People flock to Internet platforms because they help us connect with one another or the world\u2019s bounty of information \u2014 a crucial, valuable function. Yet ad-based financing means that the companies have an interest in manipulating our attention on behalf of advertisers, instead of letting us connect as we wish. Many users think their feed shows everything that their friends post. It doesn\u2019t. Facebook runs its billion-plus users\u2019 newsfeed by a proprietary, ever-changing algorithm that decides what we see. If Facebook didn\u2019t have to control the feed to keep us on the site longer and to inject ads into our stream, it could instead offer us control over this algorithm.", "Many nonprofits and civic groups that were initially thrilled about their success in using Facebook to reach people are now despondent as their entries are less and less likely to reach people who \u201cliked\u201d their posts unless they pay Facebook to help boost their updates.", "What to do? It\u2019s simple: Internet sites should allow their users to be the customers. I would, as I bet many others would, happily pay more than 20 cents per month for a Facebook or a Google that did not track me, upgraded its encryption and treated me as a customer whose preferences and privacy matter.", "Many people say that no significant number of users will ever pay directly for Internet services. But that is because we are misled by the mantra that these services are free. With growing awareness of the privacy cost of ads, this may well change. Millions of people pay for Netflix despite the fact that pirated copies of many movies are available free. We eventually pay for ads, anyway, as that cost is baked into products we purchase. A seamless, secure micropayment system that spreads a few pennies at a time as we browse a social network, up to a preset monthly limit, would alter the whole landscape for the better.", "There are other obstacles. Someone has to build those viable, privacy-preserving micropayment systems \u2014 but Silicon Valley is known for its entrepreneurial spirit, right? And we\u2019re not starting from scratch.

But as the project heads for its end-of-year deadline and the basic shape of the BEPS principles becomes clear, nobody in Washington is paying attention to a simple fact: The United States lost, and lost big.", "As they are being developed, the BEPS rules \u2014 mainly written at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in Paris \u2014 will not be likely to generate more tax revenues for the United States. Instead, the BEPS rules, as written, will encourage American companies to quickly move high-paying jobs such as those of research scientists and software developers to Europe to take advantage of lower tax rates.", "In other words, unless Congress acts quickly to reform the ossified American corporate tax system, the BEPS rules have the potential to turn into an enormous job-and-revenue grab by Europe, and an enormous loss of jobs and revenues by the United States.", "How does this work? The BEPS rules would do two things. First, they would close the most egregious international tax loopholes. Most multinationals would end up paying more taxes to someone, somewhere. That\u2019s good.", "But the project also changes the international tax rules by forcing companies to pay corporate taxes according to the location of the economic activity and value creation generating their profits. At first blush, that would seem to benefit the United States, home to much of the world\u2019s innovation and many innovative companies. Certainly the Obama administration seems to think so, because it continues to support the BEPS effort.", "But the administration\u2019s support is rooted in political anti-corporate rhetoric rather than cold hard analysis.", "Remember that most European countries already have substantially lower corporate tax rates than the United States does. Britain, for example, has a national corporate tax rate of 20 percent, compared with a marginal rate of 35 percent in the United States. Increasingly countries, including Britain, have also instituted what are known as patent boxes, or I.P. boxes, offering tax rates of 10 percent, or less, for companies that create their intellectual property in that country. This difference in tax rates is huge.", "Under the proposed BEPS rules, though, the only way for American companies to take advantage of these lower rates in a European country would be to prove to tax authorities that they are engaged in value creation in that country. And the simplest way to show the location of value creation is to move jobs to that country. Indeed, this is a principle that Obama administration officials have endorsed.", "Right now, American companies have been able to take advantage of these low rates by moving their intellectual property across national borders, but not moving that many workers. But under the new rules, such companies will have to locate many of their top workers \u2014 managers, R&D scientists, innovation specialists \u2014 in Britain or France or the Netherlands in order to gain the lower rates. What\u2019s more, the personal tax revenues generated by those workers will move as well.", "This outgoing flood of skilled workers and tax revenue is not hypothetical. The BEPS rules are still being developed, but American multinationals are already having internal conversations about moving workers, right now. And given the speed at which the project is moving, it could start happening by the end of 2015. The O.E.C.D. International Tax Conference, which is being held in Washington on June 10 and 11, will further spur strategic planning by American companies.

Cutting the federal corporate tax rate, now 35 percent, down to internationally competitive levels is important to dissuading companies from wanting to move in the first place. Equally important is the creation of a patent or innovation box that offers lower taxes for profits from intangible assets like intellectual property.", "Republicans and Democrats are struggling over tax reform, but the loss of jobs is not a partisan issue.

The company is placing a large investment \u2014 contributing software developers, technology and education programs \u2014 behind an open-source project for real-time data analysis, called Apache Spark.", "The commitment, according to Robert Picciano, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s data analytics business, will amount to \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d a year.", "In the big data software market, much of the attention and investment so far has been focused on Apache Hadoop and the companies distributing that open-source software, including Cloudera, Hortonworks and MapR. Hadoop, put simply, is the software that makes it possible to handle and analyze vast volumes of all kinds of data. The technology came out of the pure Internet companies like Google and Yahoo, and is increasingly being used by mainstream companies, which want to do similar big data analysis in their businesses.", "But if Hadoop opens the door to probing vast volumes of data, Spark promises speed. Real-time processing is essential for many applications, from analyzing sensor data streaming from machines to sales transactions on online marketplaces. The Spark technology was developed at the Algorithms, Machines and People Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. A group from the Berkeley lab founded a company two years ago, Databricks, which offers Spark software as a cloud service.", "Spark, Mr. Picciano said, is crucial technology that will make it possible to \u201creally deliver on the promise of big data.\u201d That promise, he said, is to quickly gain insights from data to save time and costs, and to spot opportunities in fields like sales and new product development.", "IBM said it will put more than 3,500 of its developers and researchers to work on Spark-related projects. It will contribute machine-learning technology to the open-source project, and embed Spark in IBM\u2019s data analysis and commerce software. IBM will also offer Spark as a service on its programming platform for cloud software development, Bluemix. The company will open a Spark technology center in San Francisco to pursue Spark-based innovations.", "And IBM plans to partner with academic and private education organizations including UC Berkeley\u2019s AMPLab, DataCamp, Galvanize and Big Data University to teach Spark to as many as 1 million data engineers and data scientists.", "Ion Stoica, the chief executive of Databricks, who is a Berkeley computer scientist on leave from the university, called the IBM move \u201ca great validation for Spark.\u201d He had talked to IBM people in recent months and knew they planned to back Spark, but, he added, \u201cthe magnitude is impressive.\u201d", "With its Spark initiative, analysts said, IBM wants to lend a hand to an open-source project, woo developers and strengthen its position in the fast-evolving market for big data software.", "By aligning itself with a popular open-source project, IBM, they said, hopes to attract more software engineers to use its big data software tools, too. \u201cIt\u2019s first and foremost a play for the minds \u2014 and hearts \u2014 of developers,\u201d said Dan Vesset, an analyst at IDC.", "IBM is investing in its own future as much as it is contributing to Spark. IBM needs a technology ecosystem, where it is a player and has influence, even if it does not immediately profit from it. IBM mainly makes its living selling applications, often tailored to individual companies, which address challenges in their business like marketing, customer service, supply-chain management and developing new products and services.", "\u201cIBM makes its money higher up, building solutions for customers,\u201d said Mike Gualtieri, a analyst for Forrester Research. \u201cThat\u2019s ultimately why this makes sense for IBM.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/upshot/maiden-names-on-the-rise-again.html": ["When Donna Suh married in September, wearing a short white dress at San Francisco City Hall, she decided to keep her last name. Her reasons were practical, not political.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a feminist reason, but it\u2019s just my name for 33 years of my life,\u201d Ms. Suh said. \u201cPlus, I\u2019m Asian and he\u2019s not, so it\u2019s less confusing for me to not have a white name. And on social media I thought it might be harder to find me.\u201d", "The practice of keeping one\u2019s maiden name after marriage \u2014 which appears to have declined sometime in the 1980s or 1990s \u2014 has begun rising again, according to an Upshot analysis of data from multiple sources. The share has surpassed that of the 1970s. Yet unlike in that Ms. Decade, the decision now tends to be less political. For many women, sociologists say, keeping their maiden names has lost its significance in defining their independence and its symbolism as a feminist act.", "Roughly 20 percent of women married in recent years have kept their names, according to a Google Consumer Survey conducted by The Upshot. (An additional 10 percent or so chose a third option, such as hyphenating their name or legally changing it while continuing to use their birth name professionally.)", "By comparison, about 17 percent of women who married for the first time in the 1970s kept their names, a number that fell to 14 percent in the more conservative 1980s before rising to 18 percent in the 1990s, the Google survey shows. These numbers should be viewed as estimates, not precise counts, but the overall trend is apparent across several data sources.", "A separate analysis of New York Times wedding announcements (which cover a select, less representative share of women) showed similar patterns. Last year, 29.5 percent of women in the wedding pages kept their name, up from 26 percent in 2000 and a recent low of 16.2 percent in 1990.", "From the time that the equal rights activist Lucy Stone became famous for keeping her name when she married in 1855, maiden names have been politically charged. In the 1970s \u2014 when state laws still required a woman to use her husband\u2019s name to vote, do banking or get a passport \u2014 keeping one\u2019s maiden name became a tenet of the women\u2019s movement.", "Yet as women continued to get education, have careers, use birth control and marry later, the share of women keeping their names went in the opposite direction and shrank, to the surprise of social scientists and women who fought for the right in the 1970s.", "\u201cThe pressure is huge,\u201d said Laurie Scheuble, who teaches sociology at Penn State and studies marital naming. \u201cThis is the strongest gendered social norm that we enforce and expect.\u201d", "She said the resurgence in keeping names could be because women now go to college at higher rates than men, celebrities often keep their names and couples commonly live together before marriage.", "\u201cWhen they do get around to marrying, they\u2019ve already lived in a household with two names, so maybe it seems normal to them,\u201d Ms. Scheuble said.", "The Google survey found that higher-income urban women were much more likely to keep their names, and this subgroup is reflected in the wedding pages of The Times. Nearly half of women featured in The Times since 1985 changed their names, while about a quarter kept their names and a quarter did not say, according to an analysis of 7,835 opposite-sex wedding announcements in five-year intervals.", "In all years of the Times announcements analyzed, women married in Jewish ceremonies were less likely to take their husband\u2019s name than those married in Roman Catholic ceremonies. The largest gap was in 1995, when 66 percent of Catholic women took their husband\u2019s names and 33 percent of Jewish women reported doing so.", "Many women still find the decision hard, and some object to the name-changing tradition as patriarchic. But for many, the choice reflects a modern-day approach to gender equality. Basic rights have been achieved, so the gesture carries less weight either way.", "\u201cSo many women are working and they have established careers for themselves, it almost seemed bigger to decide to take his name than to not take his name,\u201d said Ms. Suh, a buyer for Heath Ceramics.", "It often comes down to weighing the inconvenience of changing versus keeping. Some say it would be too complicated to change their professional or social media identity. Others say it is too difficult to have a name that\u2019s different from the one for the rest of their family, or fear the prospect of divorce.", "Sarah Marino, a lawyer who lives in Connecticut, has degrees from two elite universities. At 37, she was older than the average bride when she married this month, in a ceremony overlooking a pond in Vermont. Her husband does most of the cooking. She earns more money. The marriage is a modern one; even so, she changed her name.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re a unit if you have the same last name,\u201d Mrs. Marino said. \u201cAnd it makes things easier in terms of hotel reservations and things like that.", "\u201cI see us as equal partners in our relationship. But I don\u2019t tie my personal success and me trying to be a successful woman lawyer to keeping my original name.\u201d", "Women are more likely to keep their names if they are older, not religious, have children from a previous marriage or have an advanced degree and established career, according to data from the Google survey, the Times announcements and previous studies.", "Of brides in The Times since 1990, 18 percent of those who were under 30 when they married kept their names, compared with 31 percent of those in their 30s and 44 percent in their 40s.", "There have been few studies of women\u2019s married names because the data is hard to obtain. But a Census Bureau study using 2004 American Community Survey data found that women with an advanced degree were five to 10 times more likely to keep their names. Asian and Hispanic women were more likely to as well. Just 6.4 percent of native-born married women used their birth name, it found. One reason the share is so low is that the study included older women who married before it was legal to keep their name and excluded foreign-born women, who are more likely to keep their names. Among women in younger generations, the percentage of name keepers was 9 percent.", "A Harvard University study found that, among its alumni, each year that women delayed marrying or having children related to a 1 percentage point decline in the probability that they would change their names. The most important predictor was whether a woman \u201cmade a name\u201d for herself before marriage, said Claudia Goldin, an economics professor and an author of the study.", "Yet even as more women made names for themselves, the same study found, both Harvard alumni data and Massachusetts birth records show a drop-off in name-keeping. The Google survey shows it beginning in the 1980s; the Harvard study shows it in the 1990s. In the Times announcements, 66 percent of brides changed their name in 1990, the highest of any year analyzed.", "Researchers say the decline in name-keeping may have been part of a return to conservative attitudes after the tradition-breaking 1970s, or perhaps the beginning of women deciding that they did not need to change their name to prove a point.", "\u201cYou had a militancy about it in the \u201970s, a period when in many states, marriage was still legally defined as an unequal relationship,\u201d said Stephanie Coontz, who teaches history and family studies at Evergreen State College and wrote \u201cMarriage: A History.\u201d \u201cMany women are saying now: \u2018This is not such a big deal to me. How you treat me and what you pay me is a huge deal to me.\u2019 \u201d", "More recently, the children of parents who divorced in record numbers might also be inclined to change their names out of fear of divorce, Ms. Goldin of Harvard said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that changing your name, having the linens with one set of initials, is really part of the crazy glue of life that binds you together.\u201d", "A small number of women in each generation find a new answer. Some, like Hillary Rodham Clinton, use their maiden name as a middle name, and others use their birth name professionally and their husband\u2019s name in their private lives. Only 1.3 percent of women have hyphenated their names or use both surnames, the census study found.", "A few couples combine two names to create a new one. A former mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, was Antonio Villar before he married Corina Raigosa, a teacher (they are now divorced). Rarely, a man takes a woman\u2019s name. Marco Saldana, an artist, was Marco Perego before he married Zoe Saldana, the actress.", "American families have been shedding tradition in many ways: People marry less often and later in their lives; older women are having more children outside of marriage; and as of Friday, people can have spouses of the same sex nationwide. The married name tradition is still strong, but as more women embrace their maiden names, it is changing, too."]}

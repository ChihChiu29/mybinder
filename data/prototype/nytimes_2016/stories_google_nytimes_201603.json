The program is a blend of deep learning and Monte Carlo algorithms, meaning it is both good at recognizing patterns and has the ability to exhaustively search vast libraries of possible moves.", "What appears to be happening is the timetable for computing dominance of Go has been moved up roughly a decade from when it had been expected. That\u2019s largely because the new ability to blend pattern recognition algorithms and vast data sets has been yielding spectacular results in the last half-decade. It\u2019s like computer scientists have found a powerful new hammer, and they\u2019re using it to pound lots of different nails.", "Mike: Wow.

I read your article on the first match our friend Mr. Lee lost to the evil computer genius, and something struck me: He said part of playing Go takes a certain amount of \u201chuman intuition\u201d to do well. Over time, Go players develop a style or personality and approach.", "I have no idea how this game works, except from what I see of the guys playing against each other in, like, Washington Square Park.", "But it made me think of playing poker. Part of what makes a person good at a card game \u2014 in my case, a hand of No Limit Texas Hold \u2018em \u2014 is the instinct of the player, developed over time. I may read an opponent, for instance, and bluff them, or trap them, or something. In theory, I am better because of my ability to play my opponents psychologically instead of sticking solely to the logic of how good or bad my cards are.", "One would think that Mr. Lee has a similar advantage. But I imagine a computer program \u2014 even a fancy one from Google \u2014 would lack this certain set of skills. Is there something here I\u2019m not getting?", "John: I think we might be talking about a slightly different kind of intuition. The Google program combines two types of algorithms. One is a machine learning algorithm, which does an extremely good job of recognizing patterns based on being trained on a vast set of examples. So it is likely to have seen almost any move that a human could make, and also know which responses are better ones.", "A second type of algorithm can also see the consequences of particular moves far, far in advance of the game by playing millions and millions or perhaps even billions of combinations of moves. In contrast, human Go experts have their experience to rely on, but it is fuzzy by comparison. Think of this as an intellectual version of John Henry and the jackhammer. And remember, right now the only thing the program can do is play Go.", "Mike: Wowie woo! I recall John Henry ended up winning in the end!

The ocean waters are a gathering spot for humpback whales, which migrate through the region during the same months.

It was opened by a Barcelona native and his Costa Rican wife, and the menu includes classic (and excellent) dishes such as patatas bravas and croquetas de jam\u00f3n, along with local, Spanish-inspired seafood dishes.

Here are my answers to some of those that were most frequently asked, along with my impressions of the device after testing it for a day.", "Does the iPhone SE have all the bells and whistles of the iPhone 6S, just smaller? \u2014 Joseph Kaplan, Maryland", "It has most of the bells and whistles, but some features were left out.", "The iPhone SE has the same processor (called A9) as the 6S, meaning it will be just as fast. (In my speed tests using the app Geekbench, the SE was slightly faster than the 6S.) The small iPhone has the same superb camera as the 6S, along with the ability to shoot Live Photos, or photos that turn into miniature videos, and support for Apple Pay, the mobile payments system. The phones also support the same basic connections: the Lightning port for power cables and a standard headphone jack for audio accessories.", "However, the SE lacks a number of attributes of the 6S. It does not have 3D Touch, the feature that lets you control some software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The SE also has a lower-quality front-facing camera (meaning your selfies will come out grainier) and a slower fingerprint sensor compared with the 6S. Last but not least, from side-by-side comparisons, the SE\u2019s screen isn\u2019t as bright or as vibrant as the 6S display.", "Why were some 6S features left out of the SE?", "Apple says it left some of the 6S components out of the SE largely to fit within the design constraints of the smaller body. Components like 3D Touch would have added thickness to the device, which probably would have made it unattractive.", "Will a new iPhone SE fit into the very expensive LifeProof case I have been using for my iPhone 5C? \u2014 Robert Di Stasio, Vista, N.Y.", "The SE will fit snugly in older cases designed for the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S.

The SE\u2019s starting price is $399. On an installment plan, like AT&T\u2019s Next 24 plan, you could pay $13.30 a month for 30 months with the option to upgrade to a new phone after 24 months.", "If you want to avoid getting lost in the maze of smartphone payment plans, I recommend paying for the SE outright. Doing that will give you the flexibility of trading in your phone, and upgrading to a new phone or switching to another carrier, whenever you want.", "But if you don\u2019t have that much money to spend right away, installment plans are a safe bet because they incur zero interest fees, meaning it makes no difference financially to pay the full $399 upfront or spread out the cost over a year or two.", "Who is a smaller iPhone for?", "A few categories of consumers come to mind for the SE:", "1. Obsessive emailers or social media users who like the ability to quickly type or juggle between apps with one hand. The smaller iPhone is better suited than larger phones for one-handed use. In my tests, I could type the full alphabet with one hand on a SE about three seconds faster than I could on a 6S. On a 6S, using the phone with one hand is manageable, but all the thumb-reaching can become tiring when using apps; on a 6S Plus, typing with one hand just isn\u2019t doable unless you\u2019re one of those giants in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d", "2. Parents who want to buy cheaper smartphones for their teenagers. The $399 starting price for the SE is considerably lower than the $650 starting price for the 6S. If you\u2019re looking to save a few hundred bucks by buying your children smaller iPhones, they probably wouldn\u2019t loathe you much. (Because the SE\u2019s front-facing camera isn\u2019t as good as the one on the 6S, their selfies will be a bit blurrier, but they probably won\u2019t notice the difference if you don\u2019t mention it.)", "3. People who want to spend less time on their smartphones. The larger screens on the 6S and 6S Plus are enablers for long reading sessions or YouTube streaming. If you just want a smartphone for getting in and out of quick tasks, like shooting off an email, the SE\u2019s smaller screen can certainly make digital media less addictive.", "I have an iPhone 5S. Should I upgrade to the iPhone SE, or wait for the iPhone 7? \u2014 John Erickson, Nashville", "Here\u2019s where buyer\u2019s advice comes in. When I first heard about a four-inch iPhone several months ago, I thought I would want to switch back to the smaller screen because I missed being able to use the iPhone easily with one hand.", "But after taking a closer look at the SE side by side with a newer iPhone, the biggest trade-off is the loss of detail in the SE display\u2019s picture. The SE\u2019s screen looks dimmer and the colors are more muted than on the 6S, which significantly affects the experience of using the phone, for example, looking at photos or reading web articles. After weighing all the pros and cons (including the features missing from the SE), I personally would spend a bit more on the larger iPhone and say goodbye to the glory days of one-handed phones.", "But whether you wait for the iPhone 7 or upgrade now to the SE should purely have to do with your preference for screen size. If you are married to the four-inch screen, the SE is an excellent upgrade from the four-inch 5S: The SE is extremely fast, takes nice photos and, ergonomically, is the most comfortable iPhone to use in the hand and fit inside a pocket.", "If you think you are willing to sacrifice the benefits of a smaller screen and step up to a bigger one, then wait about six months for the next major upgrade to the bigger iPhone models. Apple typically announces new iPhones in the fall.", "What kind of reaction has Apple gotten to the SE so far?", "I\u2019m told Mr. Joswiak, who spoke at the Apple event about consumers who were pleading for a new small phone, got dozens of customer thank-you emails."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/theater/review-mayhem-gambling-disco-in-disaster-its-all-there-for-the-spoofing.html": ["Alert the authorities!

That six-point gap isn\u2019t especially large; I wouldn\u2019t have made anything of it in a different context. It could easily be explained by demographic differences or the tendency for his supporters to decide early (and perhaps vote early) rather than by the huge difference in Mr. Cruz\u2019s support.

A strong showing on March 15 would put Mr. Trump in a pretty good position to amass a majority of delegates by the end of the primary season, though he would have to continue to win primaries.", "Mr. Cruz\u2019s challenge in the blue states is somewhat more complicated.

He won 17 percent of the vote there \u2014 and that was a showing with little or no precedent for him in the South on Super Tuesday. The only Southern metropolitan counties where Mr. Kasich even broke 10 percent on Super Tuesday were the two counties including Atlanta, Fulton and DeKalb, where Mr. Kasich won around 12.5 percent. Mr. Kasich also hit 16 percent and 22 percent in the counties that include Louisville and Lexington in Kentucky.", "In general, Mr. Kasich outperformed expectations by a lot on Saturday, especially for a slate of caucuses and red states. He hit 16 percent in both Kansas and Kentucky, two red-state caucuses. His previous best in a caucus was 5.7 percent (in Minnesota). His previous best in a red state was 7.6 percent in South Carolina, and that\u2019s a fairly establishment-friendly state.", "What does that mean?

Facebook changed its news feed in 2009 by switching to an algorithm largely based on the popularity of posts, among other signals. Last month, Twitter introduced older, popular tweets to the top of users\u2019 feeds, out of order, if the user had been away from the service for a time.", "On Tuesday, Instagram joined that club. The photo-sharing service plans to begin testing an algorithm-based personalized feed for users, similar to one already used by its parent company, Facebook. That means it would shift away from the strictly reverse chronological order that the service has used since it began in 2010. Instead, Instagram will place the photos and videos it thinks you will most want to see from the people you follow toward the top of your feed, regardless of the time those posts were originally shared.", "That could mean that if your best friend posted a photo of her new Bernese mountain dog\u2019s puppies five hours ago while you were on a flight without Internet connectivity, Instagram might place that image at the top of your feed the next time you open the app. Based on your history of interaction with that friend, Instagram knows you probably would not want to miss that picture.", "The move is partly a function of Instagram\u2019s popularity.

In the early days of the web, users largely congregated around portals like AOL and Yahoo, before Google gained ground, beckoning people to type in queries to find exactly what they were seeking. Then, social networking ushered in the era of the feed: a simple, linear way to gather and display the content contributed by your friends and family worldwide.", "At the time, it was a revolutionary idea. \u201cFeeds are a powerful way for users to navigate the web and get to the information they need,\u201d Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist and early investor in Twitter, wrote in a personal blog post in 2008. \u201cMy kids are growing up with the news feed as their start page.

As they are now, posts will be clearly stamped with the date they occurred.", "Mike Krieger, Instagram\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer, said the changes to the feed may be less disruptive than those of other networks, considering Instagram is centered almost entirely on photos, not words.", "\u201cLook at my feed now.

The actor Lars Mikkelsen towers over Robin Wright, making it that much more striking when she looks up \u2014 way up \u2014 into his eyes and says, \u201cYou\u2019re a beggar, and you will take whatever we shove down your throat.\u201d", "Later, after she returns to the White House ahead of Frank\u2019s return, Claire is again deliberately positioned in the frame to look small, particularly when she\u2019s curled up in the fetal position on the love seat at the foot of her bed. Knowing that Frank is back, she looks minimized, diminished and drained of purpose. Frank, still in recuperation mode, looks diminished as well; the slick brown dye in his hair has faded to gray, making him appear older and, coupled with his reduced physical size, frail. Kevin Spacey\u2019s performance in the whole Claire reunion sequence \u2014 when he chokes up over Meechum\u2019s death and struggles to walk with Claire\u2019s help \u2014 may be the best work he\u2019s ever done on \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d For once, he gets to exhibit vulnerability that feels genuine.", "\u201cI said you were nothing, in the Oval, without me,\u201d Frank tells his wife, alluding to their fight at the end of Season 3 and also echoing the words Petrov used to insult Claire just hours earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s the other way around.\u201d", "Frank promises her that she can have something more than just the role of first lady, continuing the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d tradition of treating that job dismissively but also giving Claire what she wants and making them co-pilots again. Question: Shouldn\u2019t Frank be more angry with Claire? She abandoned him while he was undergoing surgery and wouldn\u2019t even take his call when he woke up for the first time in days, if not weeks. That certainly seems like grounds for holding a grudge.

So it is in \u201cThe Night Gardener,\u201d a debut written and illustrated by the brothers Terry and Eric Fan, set in a gray town where green things are happening. Every morning the townspeople discover that another large tree has been reshaped into magnificent topiary. The vivid animal figures spark delight in this grim place. Young William, who lives in an orphanage but is apparently free to come and go, happens one evening upon the Night Gardener, a mysterious old man with a walrus mustache who (because this is William\u2019s book, or his fantasy) engages the boy as apprentice.

Still, they achieve a lovely, luminous effect. Illustrator-authors often write themselves stories involving spectacular scenes of fantasy; it\u2019s understandable.

In a strangely archaic moment, a mysterious old woman gives the boy three wishing seeds. He lifts a brick and pokes them into the ground, and soon the city is engulfed in forests.

Compactly told in short lines, these pieces are part beginning-reader stories and part poetry. In spirit they remind me of Arnold Lobel\u2019s wonderful Frog and Toad books.

Why does this matter? After all, computers surpassed humans in chess in 1997, when IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov. So why is AlphaGo\u2019s victory significant?", "Like chess, Go is a hugely complex strategy game in which chance and luck play no role. Two players take turns placing white or black stones on a 19-by-19 grid; when stones are surrounded on all four sides by those of the other color they are removed from the board, and the player with more surrounded territory and captured stone at the game\u2019s end wins.", "Unlike the case with chess, however, no human can explain how to play Go at the highest levels. The top players, it turns out, can\u2019t fully access their own knowledge about how they\u2019re able to perform so well. This self-ignorance is common to many human abilities, from driving a car in traffic to recognizing a face. This strange state of affairs was beautifully summarized by the philosopher and scientist Michael Polanyi, who said, \u201cWe know more than we can tell.\u201d It\u2019s a phenomenon that has come to be known as \u201cPolanyi\u2019s Paradox.\u201d", "Polanyi\u2019s Paradox hasn\u2019t prevented us from using computers to accomplish complicated tasks, like processing payrolls, optimizing flight schedules, routing telephone calls and calculating taxes. But as anyone who\u2019s written a traditional computer program can tell you, automating these activities has required painstaking precision to explain exactly what the computer is supposed to do.", "This approach to programming computers is severely limited; it can\u2019t be used in the many domains, like Go, where we know more than we can tell, or other tasks like recognizing common objects in photos, translating between human languages and diagnosing diseases \u2014 all tasks where the rules-based approach to programming has failed badly over the years.", "Deep Blue achieved its superhuman performance almost by sheer computing power: It sifted through millions of possible chess moves to determine the optimal move. The problem is that there are many more possible Go games than there are atoms in the universe, so even the fastest computers can\u2019t simulate a meaningful fraction of them. To make matters worse, it\u2019s usually far from clear which possible moves to even start exploring.", "What changed? The AlphaGo victories vividly illustrate the power of a new approach in which instead of trying to program smart strategies into a computer, we instead build systems that can learn winning strategies almost entirely on their own, by seeing examples of successes and failures.", "Since these systems don\u2019t rely on human knowledge about the task at hand, they\u2019re not limited by the fact that we know more than we can tell.", "AlphaGo does use simulations and traditional search algorithms to help it decide on some moves, but its real breakthrough is its ability to overcome Polanyi\u2019s Paradox. It did this by figuring out winning strategies for itself, both by example and from experience. The examples came from huge libraries of Go matches between top players amassed over the game\u2019s 2,500-year history. To understand the strategies that led to victory in these games, the system made use of an approach known as deep learning, which has demonstrated remarkable abilities to tease out patterns and understand what\u2019s important in large pools of information.", "Learning in our brains is a process of forming and strengthening connections among neurons. Deep learning systems take an analogous approach, so much so that they used to be called \u201cneural nets.\u201d They set up billions of nodes and connections in software, use \u201ctraining sets\u201d of examples to strengthen connections among stimuli (a Go game in process) and responses (the next move), then expose the system to a new stimulus and see what its response is. AlphaGo also played millions of games against itself, using another technique called reinforcement learning to remember the moves and strategies that worked well.", "Deep learning and reinforcement learning have both been around for a while, but until recently it was not at all clear how powerful they were, and how far they could be extended. In fact, it\u2019s still not, but applications are improving at a gallop, with no end in sight. And the applications are broad, including speech recognition, credit card fraud detection, and radiology and pathology. Machines can now recognize faces and drive cars, two of the examples that Polanyi himself noted as areas where we know more than we can tell.", "We still have a long way to go, but the implications are profound. As when James Watt introduced his steam engine 240 years ago, technology-fueled changes will ripple throughout our economy in the years ahead, but there is no guarantee that everyone will benefit equally. Understanding and addressing the societal challenges brought on by rapid technological progress remain tasks that no machine can do for us."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/magazine/what-happened-when-venture-capitalists-took-over-the-golden-state-warriors.html": ["I\nt was still dark one morning early this year when Joe Lacob, the majority owner of the Golden State Warriors, drove his Mercedes station wagon through the Stanford University campus. He parked near the business school, then walked down a sidewalk through a drizzle to meet a group of Silicon Valley executives. The ex-C.E.O. of OpenTable, now a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, was coming. So were a founder of the online-learning start-up Curious and a managing director of Vanguard Ventures. On another morning, they all might have met at a charity event or a TED Talk. But it was a Tuesday, and that meant basketball.", "Lacob, who has worked in venture capital for three decades, has an open, expressive face and broad shoulders. He\u2019s six feet tall but seems taller. The previous night, he watched his Warriors play a home game in Oakland, and now he looked tired. \u201cThe Tuesday mornings after we play Monday nights are the hardest,\u201d he said. The basketball court, which is normally used by students and faculty members, has a tidy, corporate look: gleaming hardwood surrounded by plexiglass walls. In his Warriors T-shirt and shorts, Lacob pushed his hands against the glass and stretched his legs. \u201cHonestly, this is my favorite time of the week,\u201d he told me.", "One by one, other players arrived. Most have known Lacob for years, since early in his career at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which is when he helped start this pickup game. There was no reason for anyone to be deferential to him. But owning a basketball team has cachet, especially when that team has come to rank among the best in N.B.A. history. Nobody mentioned his own business affairs, but everyone was eager to talk about Lacob\u2019s. \u201cJoe, good to see Barnes back,\u201d someone said, referring to Harrison Barnes, a Warriors player who had missed games with an injury.", "The group ran the court for an hour, playing games to 13 by twos and threes. Lacob, 60, was one of the older players there, and he had clearly thought through his strengths and limitations. He would head to a particular spot \u2014 often one on the right side, about a third of the way around the three-point arc \u2014 and wait. When he saw an opportunity, he called for the ball or cut along the arc toward it. If he received a pass, he would usually shoot. His shot was peculiar, fluttering like a knuckleball, rotating only a few times before it reached the basket, but it went in more often than not. The first game ended with his sinking a three-pointer, then raising his arms in triumph. A few minutes later, his team moved in position to win again. Lacob stood at the top of the key with the ball. \u201cHere comes the game-winner,\u201d he said to nobody in particular.", "After he finished playing, Lacob wiped the perspiration from his hands with a towel. Then he pulled out his championship ring and passed it around for examination. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asking to see it for two months,\u201d he explained. The ring had an extravagant and revealing design. One diamond had been inlaid for each of the 200-odd games the Warriors won from 2010, when Lacob and his investors bought the team, through last year\u2019s N.B.A. finals. \u201cHow much does this thing weigh?\u201d asked Tom McConnell, the managing director from Vanguard Ventures, lifting his hand up and down as if trying to estimate its value.", "Silicon Valley \u2014 the place itself, but also the society of smart, technologically savvy people who surround it \u2014 is full of basketball fans. Many of them made a lot of money in their 30s and 40s. Now in their 50s, they\u2019re looking for something gratifying to do with it. In 2002, Wyc Grousbeck, a principal at Highland Capital Partners who spent two years at Stanford\u2019s business school, bought the Boston Celtics along with a group of investors that included Lacob. In recent years, venture capitalists, private-equity investors and hedge-funders have been acquiring N.B.A. teams. The Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Atlanta Hawks all belong to this new class of investor. The Sacramento Kings and the Memphis Grizzlies are both owned by Silicon Valley engineers. If you include Lacob\u2019s Warriors, that\u2019s more than a quarter of the league.", "Lacob was not the first venture capitalist to buy a franchise, but he is the first to operate one according to what might be called Silicon Valley precepts: nimble management, open communication, integrating the wisdom of outside advisers and continuous re-evaluation of what companies do and how they do it. None of that typically happens in professional sports. Most franchise owners of previous generations became wealthy mastering businesses that did one specific thing, if only because that was the way that people used to become wealthy in America. They\u2019ve run their teams, for better or worse, in the same autocratic, hidebound fashion that they ran those companies. As a manager, Lacob prefers to surround himself with expertise and exploit it.", "This season, Lacob\u2019s sixth as majority owner, the Warriors are on pace to break the league record of 72 wins in a season (which is just 82 games long). He and his partners bought a team that already had Stephen Curry, Golden State\u2019s best player and a transcendent talent who is having one of the most dominant seasons in league history. He would be hitting tongue-flick jump shots from 30 feet away from the basket no matter who owned it.", "But Lacob won\u2019t accept that what the Warriors have achieved is a product of anything but a master plan. \u201cThe great, great venture capitalists who built company after company, that\u2019s not an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of this is an accident, either.\u201d", "After the pickup game, Lacob pulled on a sweatshirt and went to breakfast at a cafeteria on the ground floor. He goes there so often that one of the smoothies on the menu, involving orange juice, vanilla yogurt, bananas and strawberries, has been named for him. He pointed this out, then ordered one. When I asked him about the previous night\u2019s game, he could hardly contain himself. He boasted that the Warriors are playing in a far more sophisticated fashion than the rest of the league. \u201cWe\u2019ve crushed them on the basketball court, and we\u2019re going to for years because of the way we\u2019ve built this team,\u201d he said. But what really set the franchise apart, he said, was the way it operated as a business. \u201cWe\u2019re light-years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we\u2019re going to go about things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a handful for the rest of the N.B.A. to deal with for a long time.\u201d", "When Lacob and his group of investors bought the Warriors in 2010, the $450 million they paid was deemed wildly excessive by nearly everyone. Larry Ellison, one of the 10 richest people in the world, was the losing bidder. It was more than anyone had ever spent on an N.B.A. franchise at the time. And this wasn\u2019t the Lakers or the Celtics or even the Knicks. This was the Warriors, a team that plays in Oakland and had last won a championship in 1975. In 2010, Lacob promised another within five years. And last June, the Warriors won the finals, defeating LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games.", "In the months since, they\u2019ve attained the status of a cultural phenomenon. More than any team since the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers of Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, they\u2019ve become famous not just for winning but also for how they win. You don\u2019t need to know the nuances of the sport to appreciate Curry\u2019s uncanny accuracy, or the fact that he routinely launches shots from longer distances than anyone ever has. You just need Internet access and a willingness to suspend disbelief. Curry has moved beyond \u201cSportsCenter\u201d to mainstream pop culture; even his 3-year-old, Riley, has developed a following. When Curry went on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d to be interviewed, a reaction shot of her in the audience elicited the biggest cheer of the night.", "What\u2019s happening with the Warriors as a business isn\u2019t something Kimmel is likely to mention, but it\u2019s equally impressive. The $450 million that Lacob\u2019s group paid to Chris Cohan, the former owner, seemed so laughably expensive because of the woeful state of the Warriors franchise. This wasn\u2019t just a bad team, but a team that seemed permanently stuck in a state of irrelevance. \u201cThe little engine that couldn\u2019t\u201d is how the investor Nick Swinmurn, the founder of Zappos and a lifelong fan of the Warriors, describes it. During Cohan\u2019s 16-year ownership, the Warriors had reached the N.B.A. playoffs only once. Sixteen of the league\u2019s 30 teams advance every season. \u201cSo on an odds basis,\u201d Lacob notes, \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to make it half the time. Something was very wrong.\u201d", "Such ineptitude had eroded interest. There were only 7,000 season-ticket holders. The arena where the team played, in a vast parking lot beside a highway, was outdated. Its corridors were narrow, its catering facilities rudimentary. It didn\u2019t have rooms that could be leased for corporate meetings. While the league\u2019s newest facilities have been built with palatial home clubhouses the size of health clubs, the Warriors\u2019 was austere and cramped. One look at it during a road trip was said to discourage players around the league from considering the team when they became free agents.", "Other potential buyers perceived the institutional decrepitude as a drawback. Lacob and his partner, the Hollywood entrepreneur Peter Guber, believed it represented an opportunity. \u201cThat\u2019s what Joe does,\u201d says Chip Perry, the founder of Autotrader.com, a Kleiner Perkins investment that Lacob aided as a board member for 14 years. \u201cHe saw potential in what we were doing with Autotrader, even when others were dismissive. He\u2019s one of those rare people who can look around the corner and see something interesting.\u201d In the Warriors, Lacob saw a start-up disguised as an underperforming business, a sports franchise that had been run autocratically \u2014 and therefore ineptly \u2014 as the industry evolved around it.", "That $450 million investment is now worth around $2 billion. In 2019, the Warriors will move to a new, self-financed arena complex on the San Francisco waterfront that will include office buildings and commercial space. The move is estimated to add as much as $1 billion more to the club\u2019s value. And while there\u2019s only one Curry, the way Lacob and Guber run the franchise is replicable \u2014 at least in theory.", "Among this emergent generation of investment tycoons, that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. \u201cI knew what Joe had done,\u201d said Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, a Moroccan-born billionaire who partnered with the private-equity investor Wesley Edens to buy the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the same.\u201d Lasry insists he loves basketball, but the way he described his intentions sounded less like \u201cHoosiers\u201d than like \u201cThe Big Short\u201d: \u201cWe looked at it and said: \u2018The Bucks have huge potential. We think we can bring in the way we do business and do a huge turnaround.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Venture capitalists make large investments in companies that they don\u2019t necessarily control. Lacob brought the same mind-set, if not the actual structure, to his basketball team. \u201cIn venture capital, I started 70 companies,\u201d he told me. \u201cI also watched my partners\u2019 deals, maybe 200 of them. That\u2019s a lot of companies. I thought about the way we design a board of directors, the way we design the financing. There\u2019s an architecture to it. And I started thinking about the architecture I would use when I owned and built my own team someday.\u201d", "Lacob gave Guber, who owns a smaller share, all but equal standing because Guber brought four decades of connections in movies, music, sports and media to the deal. Together, they hired a general manager who had never worked for a team before, let alone run one, and two coaches who hadn\u2019t coached at any level. At the time, these moves were perceived around the league as rookie mistakes. But Lacob was no rookie, not at building companies. And it turned out that they were not mistakes.", "Underneath the stands in Oracle Arena, off a corridor that connects the Warriors\u2019 clubhouse to the court, is a modest-size room where Cohan, when he was owner, entertained family and friends. After taking control, Lacob renamed it the Bridge Club and opened it to the team\u2019s minority shareholders and their guests. They congregate there before each game, filling plates with carved roast beef and elaborate canap\u00e9s. There is an open bar and, for those who prefer fine wine, unencumbered access to it from automated, climate-controlled dispensers.", "One evening this season, Lacob arrived late after fighting traffic from Menlo Park. He asked politely for a turkey burger, then found a seat at a high-top table. Between bites, he greeted a steady flow of friends and colleagues, most of whom are big names in Silicon Valley. John Walecka of Redpoint Ventures \u2014 whose current investments include companies called Moogsoft, Quantifind, Datameer and Qihoo 360 Technology \u2014 walked past. So did Mark Stevens, who was a partner at Sequoia Capital when the firm helped finance Google, PayPal and LinkedIn.", "The Bridge Club has become one of the best venues for venture-capital networking in the Bay Area. It\u2019s a perk for the minority owners, but it serves a purpose for Lacob. Before and after each game, he\u2019s accessible to any investors who want his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s the atmosphere of knowing you have a voice \u2014 knowing you\u2019re part of this,\u201d he explained. \u201cOne thing I didn\u2019t like when I owned part of the Celtics \u2014 was I really heard? I don\u2019t know. I wanted to make sure that when I did this, everybody got heard.\u201d", "The N.B.A. demands that each franchise confer one owner, regardless of stake size, with nearly dictatorial power. Lacob wields his softly, just as he typically sits in the back of corporate board meetings without saying much, absorbing information, then guiding the discussion toward a decision. \u201cI\u2019m a professional listener,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of smart people in the world, you know. I\u2019m not the smartest. I\u2019m just an integrator. The N.B.A. isn\u2019t like the outside world. I can do whatever I want. But you don\u2019t treat people that way.\u201d", "Even teams in small markets cost hundreds of millions of dollars these days. Unless you\u2019re Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief who spent $2 billion on the Los Angeles Clippers without the help of outside investors, most potential owners don\u2019t have the wherewithal, or the gumption, to finance a purchase themselves. But rather than money without strings attached \u2014 investors who would have little involvement beyond writing checks \u2014 Lacob and Guber purposefully sought out entrepreneurs and businessmen with attributes and access that complemented their own. \u201cEveryone he\u2019s partnered with has a strategic reason to be there,\u201d says Dennis Mannion, C.E.O. of the Detroit Pistons, who has held executive positions with teams in all four major American sports leagues. \u201cYou have this phenomenal bullpen of talent.\u201d", "So after the shareholder Dennis Wong, the managing director of SPI Holdings, advised Lacob on the real estate purchase for the new arena, Walecka helped with the financing. When I spoke with Swinmurn, he reeled off rapid-fire opinions on the design of the Warriors\u2019 branded attire, the type of food sold at the concession stands and other disparate topics. Occasionally, minority partners can even influence what happens on the court. John Burbank of Passport Capital, who uses a deep knowledge of mathematics in his own investments, contributes detailed memos applying complex metrics to potential acquisitions. \u201cI don\u2019t know if any of it has 180ed us on a player,\u201d Bob Myers, the Warriors\u2019 general manager, told me, \u201cbut it has certainly moved us in a direction, one way or another. And he\u2019s done it enough that it\u2019s just the course of things now. It\u2019s part of the process.\u201d", "Small-percentage shareholders have always existed in sports, but they\u2019ve typically been local doctors or car dealers who\u2019ve thrown in maybe a few hundred thousand dollars. They get a trip to spring training or a playoff game, a handshake at the Christmas party, a nice profit when they sell their shares, and not much else. \u201cNothing is more limited than being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner\u2019s\u201d is a quip that is most frequently attributed to the former Yankees investor John McMullen.", "But sports isn\u2019t a small industry anymore. Playing the games and charging people to see them now constitutes only a fraction of the business. Franchises run gourmet restaurants and concert venues these days, and entire streets of retail outlets. They service fans in distant cities through audio and video streaming and proprietary content. Those owners who want to personally dictate everything \u201cdown to the color of the underwear,\u201d as Stevens puts it, can find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard when someone has had great success in another business \u2014 the fish-delivery business, the box-cutting business,\u201d Guber says. \u201cAnd then you come into this because \u2018I want to buy a sports team, and I know how to run a business.\u2019 That just isn\u2019t a formula for great success in today\u2019s world.\u201d", "Lacob\u2019s experience in venture capital, building a diverse portfolio of businesses, prepared him well for the peculiarities of owning a franchise, which perhaps explained why spending time in the Warriors\u2019 front office often felt like hanging out at a software company. Soon after buying the team, Lacob supervised the removal of the walls inside its headquarters, which sit atop a parking garage in downtown Oakland. The various departments now share the same open-plan room; when I visited, I kept expecting to see a kegerator or some hoverboards. \u201cYou walk through there now, and it\u2019s young, and there\u2019s excitement,\u201d said Gib Arnold, a former University of Hawaii head coach, who spent several days observing the franchise last year. \u201cIt\u2019s Google in the N.B.A.\u201d", "In sports, unlike other businesses, companies have two bottom lines. Their owners want to win, of course, but they also want to make money, and the two are linked more loosely than you might think. You can make a lot of money with a bad team, as the N.F.L.\u2019s Washington Redskins have done since 1999, when they were bought by Daniel Snyder. He has been a terrible owner, winning just 43 percent of his games, burning through seven head coaches, never reaching the Super Bowl and stubbornly refusing to change the team\u2019s polarizing name. Yet if you judge him by the standards of any other business, he has been exemplary. The Redskins are the third-highest-grossing team in the N.F.L.; Snyder\u2019s $800 million investment has more than tripled. If the team had public stockholders, they would be giving him a party.", "Competitive success is more elusive. Teams that win a sequence of titles, or even come close, need superior talent. That\u2019s especially true in basketball, where an extraordinary player \u2014 a Bill Russell, a Magic Johnson or a Michael Jordan \u2014 is one of only 10 on the court at any time. Put two or more together, uniting Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with Johnson or Jordan with Scottie Pippen, and you can create what in sports is hyperbolically called a dynasty.", "How much this ever has to do with the owner of the team is questionable. The Chicago Bulls amassed six N.B.A. titles with Jordan. But Jerry Reinsdorf, who bought the franchise in 1985, hasn\u2019t won since the last of those titles, in 1998. (He also has owned baseball\u2019s Chicago White Sox since 1981. The White Sox won the World Series in 2005 but otherwise have performed unmemorably.) Whatever magic Reinsdorf used to create the Bulls dynasty in the 1990s presumably remains at his disposal, yet the team has cracked .500 in just seven of the 17 seasons since Jordan departed. The determining factor there seems easy to identify.", "This isn\u2019t to say that owners have no impact. They choose how to spend their money \u2014 and how much of it to spend. They determine the goals of a franchise and how it will go about attaining them. But their attempts to directly influence the sports side of their operations have usually ended badly. \u201cThese people have been wildly successful in all their endeavors,\u201d says Jerry West, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer who spent 20 years as the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cBut being involved in a sports team is so much different than anything they\u2019ve done in their lives.\u201d", "In Los Angeles, West worked for Jerry Buss, arguably the most successful owner in modern sports history. Buss presided over a franchise that reached the N.B.A. finals 16 times in his 33 seasons. He also invented or perfected club seating, luxury boxes and the glitzy showmanship that now seems an integral part of sporting events. \u201cJerry Buss was an innovator who thought basketball should have the cachet of a Broadway show,\u201d West told me. \u201cThe fun! The excitement! But what made that possible? It was winning the way we won. Magic Johnson played the game with a joy that everyone could see. And he played with maybe the greatest player ever in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And he had James Worthy. We had seven players you could put on an All-Star team. And Jerry Buss had nothing to do with that.\u201d", "As West describes it, Buss regularly needed to be talked out of personnel moves that would have destroyed his team. \u201cYou don\u2019t know some of the things that he wanted to do,\u201d West said. He described one potential trade that Buss agreed to make: Worthy, the future Hall of Famer, to Dallas for Mark Aguirre and Roy Tarpley, who each had a reputation for being easily distracted. West found that idea so objectionable that he vowed to quit if Buss didn\u2019t renege. \u201cI went home to my wife and said, \u2018I\u2019m probably going to lose my job, but I can\u2019t have this happen,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. In the end, West says, he was able to persuade Buss.", "When Lacob and Guber bought the Warriors, they hired West as a senior adviser. They hoped his reputation as a basketball genius could stave off criticism of any controversial personnel moves they might make \u2014 \u201cthe cover of darkness,\u201d as Guber termed it. \u201cPeter said, \u2018We\u2019re taking over this team, it\u2019s a disaster, it\u2019s going to be ugly, all these things will go wrong, we\u2019re not going to win for a while,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lacob recalls. \u201cIf we make a mistake, \u2018Well, Jerry West thought it was a good idea.\u2019\u2009\u201d But West was also promised a deeper role, one without decision-making power but with plenty of input. \u201cBringing in Jerry West is not just a V.C. move but a typical Kleiner move,\u201d says Vanguard Ventures\u2019 McConnell. \u201cThey always put Nobel laureates on their advisory boards. In basketball, that\u2019s West.\u201d", "West is known for his spirited, and occasionally profane, defense of his strongly held opinions. But Lacob doesn\u2019t mind the shouting. His professional experience involved investing hundreds of millions of dollars in nascent businesses, some of them in categories that didn\u2019t yet exist, then relying on the judgment of the executives he hired to guide them to profitability. He doesn\u2019t just appreciate conviction; he relies on it.", "Since joining the Warriors, West has disagreed strongly with Lacob on several personnel moves. Each time, Lacob has deferred. \u201cNot everything you\u2019ll do as an owner will work,\u201d West says. \u201cSome things that you\u2019ll do, or might want to do, will not work. So you have to have the right people in place who can tell you that, not people who will crumble as soon as you express your opinion. That\u2019s the first part. And then you have to be willing to listen to them.\u201d With all the innovations that the ownership group has put into place, West seems to be saying, if Lacob\u2019s skin had been a little thinner or his need to assert his authority a little greater, the Warriors might still be struggling.", "Lacob has fantasized about owning a team since he was 9, when he walked into a Boys Club in New Bedford, Mass., his hometown, and saw his first parquet basketball floor. He graduated from the University of California, Irvine, as the first in his family to attend college and earned additional degrees at U.C.L.A. and Stanford. By then, his life\u2019s blueprint was just about complete. He would use the first half to get rich, then devote the rest to acquiring and running a team. \u201cThe first day that I met Joe, in 1998, he told me that he wanted to buy the Warriors,\u201d says Warren Thaler, a former Cleveland Cavaliers director who serves with Lacob on the board of Align Technology.", "Once he had his investors in place, Lacob treated the Warriors like another of his fledgling companies in need of adept management. In 2011, he hired Bob Myers as an assistant general manager. He promoted him to general manager a year later. Myers, now 41, lettered in basketball at U.C.L.A. as a walk-on, studied law at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, then started a career as an agent, representing athletes. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m sitting here now is because of that V.C. model,\u201d he told me. \u201cI had no track record. I had no past experience. If you only believed in past performance, you\u2019re talking to someone else. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have hired me.\u201d Last season, Myers was named the N.B.A.\u2019s Executive of the Year.", "At Kleiner Perkins, Lacob was often forced to change entire management teams and restructure companies before he could make them profitable. He wasn\u2019t daunted by the challenge of turning around the Warriors. \u201cYou make highly contentious decisions in venture capital all the time,\u201d says Trae Vassallo, a former Kleiner Perkins partner who worked with Lacob. \u201cBut not everybody sees them.\u201d", "In March 2012, Lacob took the microphone during a game at halftime to honor Chris Mullin, who played for Golden State from 1985 to 1997. From the moment he began speaking, Lacob was booed. It had nothing to do with Mullin. The previous week, the Warriors sent Monta Ellis, the team\u2019s most popular player, to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Andrew Bogut. With time, that would take its place among the most effective trades in basketball history. The Warriors did more than acquire Bogut, a seven-footer who had missed half the season with a broken ankle. Trading Ellis allowed Curry, the point guard, to look for his own shots instead of mainly facilitating Ellis\u2019s. In truth, Lacob hadn\u2019t wanted to trade Ellis. His basketball advisers, including West, persuaded him. \u201cThey made their case, especially Jerry,\u201d Lacob says, \u201cand I accepted it. They were right.\u201d", "Lacob understood that the Warriors, who had a losing record, needed to be dismantled before they could be rebuilt. He often had to implement a similar strategy with struggling companies. But the fans had been hearing about long-range plans for decades and had little confidence in them. And now they no longer had Ellis. The booing continued for so long that the former Warrior Rick Barry had to beseech the crowd to allow the ceremony to continue. By then, Lacob was shaking. The humiliation was so public, so raw, that Lacob\u2019s friends were moved to send messages of support. Many mention it now, four years later, as a rite of passage.", "That fall, the team had to decide whether to extend Curry\u2019s contract. The guard had shown flashes of exceptional talent, but he kept injuring his ankles. The previous season, which was shortened by a labor dispute, he missed 40 of 66 games. \u201cWe had to make a decision in the margins, in the gray area,\u201d Myers says. \u201cHe was hurt at the time \u2014 he\u2019d just sprained his ankle again.\u201d Lacob listened to both sides. Then he asked if anyone could recall an N.B.A. player whose career had ended because of ankle injuries. \u201cNobody could think of any,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd that kind of made the decision for us.\u201d", "What they did by offering Curry a four-year, $44 million extension, Lacob explained, was rely not on the future stability of Curry\u2019s anatomy so much as the composition of his psyche: his determination to push through nagging discomfort to make himself great. \u201cNow, if we were wrong, we\u2019d just committed $44 million to a player who can\u2019t play basketball,\u201d Myers says. \u201cSo the risk was there.\u201d Not only has Curry developed into the sport\u2019s best player, but his paltry \u2014 in terms of N.B.A. superstardom \u2014 $11 million annual compensation gives the Warriors ample salary-cap room to surround him with other talent.", "In 2011, Lacob and Guber chose Mark Jackson, the former St. John\u2019s and Knicks point guard, to be their team\u2019s head coach. Jackson was an unusual hire; he played for seven N.B.A. teams and worked as a commentator, but he had never coached. In his second and third seasons, he led the Warriors to the playoffs. \u201cWe were at the zero-yard line when Mark showed up here,\u201d Myers says. \u201cAnd he got us to the playoffs, and we won a round and became respectable.\u201d So when Lacob fired him in 2014, after a 51-31 season, and replaced him with Steve Kerr, the basketball world was shocked. But Lacob had decided that a different type of leadership was needed for the Warriors to make the leap from a playoff team to a championship team. Such noodling with success, replacing a leader with a limited strategic vision with another who is comfortable aiming higher, rarely happens in sports. But in venture capital it happens all the time.", "Lacob had known Kerr since the late \u201990s. They had been part of a group that traveled to Scotland on golfing trips. Kerr won N.B.A. titles as a player, first with Jordan and the Bulls and later with the Spurs. He ran the Suns\u2019 front office as their general manager. He had commentated on N.B.A. broadcasts. What he hadn\u2019t done, as the man in charge or even as an assistant, was coach a basketball team. But Lacob had an intuition that Kerr would do better in the organization\u2019s structure \u2014 in which department heads are expected to weigh in on matters outside their jurisdiction \u2014 than the more regimented Jackson.", "Kerr\u2019s willingness to at least consider suggestions from almost any source may have saved the Warriors during last year\u2019s championship series. They were behind Cleveland, 2-1, when Nick U\u2019Ren \u2014 Kerr\u2019s assistant, whose responsibilities include constructing the musical playlists used during practices and splicing highlight reels \u2014 happened to be watching a tape of the 2014 playoffs. Noticing how San Antonio defended LeBron James, he suggested that the Warriors replace Bogut in the lineup with Andre Iguodala, who is half a foot shorter but athletic enough to at least force James to work to get good shots. Kerr took the suggestion, and the Warriors didn\u2019t lose another game. Kerr publicly gave U\u2019Ren the credit.", "\u201cI\u2019ve played for nine different organizations,\u201d Shaun Livingston, a Warriors guard, told me, \u201cand I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. This wasn\u2019t even an assistant coach; it was a video coordinator. And Steve Kerr listened to him, and he did it. All the bridges are open here. There\u2019s an open forum of ideas. A good idea really can come from anywhere. And that kind of thinking has to start at the top.\u201d", "But you know what\u2019s a really good idea? Letting Curry shoot the ball 16 times from beyond the three-point line, as the Warriors did during a February game against Oklahoma City. The Warriors take more three-point shots than any other team, and they make a lot more of them \u2014 20 percent more than the closest-ranking team, the Houston Rockets. In a sense, they\u2019ve turned the standard way to run a basketball offense inside-out by looking to end a possession not with a layup but with an open jumper from back near midcourt. It\u2019s a revolutionary strategy, but one that seems likely to work only if you have Curry to take the shot. And like so much else about Curry, that obscures the impact of Lacob and Guber\u2019s innovations. Maybe they would have transformed the franchise without Curry, but it\u2019s impossible to know.", "Oklahoma City was the Warriors\u2019 sixth stop in nine days on a winter road trip that had strained the limits of continental travel, from Portland to Los Angeles to Miami, and a loss to one of the league\u2019s best teams would hardly have been a disgrace. Curry wouldn\u2019t let it happen. He made 12 of those three-pointers, scoring 47 points in all. And with four seconds left in overtime and the game tied at 118, he brought the ball past the half-court line and stopped to set himself just beyond the R in the Thunder logo that straddles midcourt. Then he swished a jump shot. The Warriors, who led for a total of 29 seconds out of 53 minutes of play, had won again.", "Even after winning the league\u2019s M.V.P. award last season, Curry has improved in virtually every trackable metric. He is averaging more than 30 points a game while making 51 percent of his shots, including a preposterous 46 percent of three-pointers. Still, there\u2019s no way to do statistical justice to those stretches on the court, sometimes a minute or two and sometimes an entire quarter, when Curry appears to have entered a freeze frame, running around while everyone else remains still.", "I saw it happen in Oakland this season. The Warriors were behind Phoenix in the second quarter. Curry hit a casually spectacular fadeaway from the foul line that ended with him sitting on the court. Then he brought the ball downcourt at speed and abruptly flipped it to another player, who was unguarded, without looking his way, creating an easy jumper. Finally, with the crowd at full roar, Curry launched the ball from several steps beyond the three-point line, and its parabola toward the basket seemed to last forever. It was impossible to watch the ball and Curry at the same time, but out of the corner of my eye I saw Curry turn and begin to run back downcourt, his arms spread wide, before his shot had even reached the top of its trajectory. For me, the moment seemed to crystallize the entire Warriors season.", "Lacob presents winning as an inevitable result of the way the team has been constructed. I couldn\u2019t argue with one of the best records in N.B.A. history. Yet I also couldn\u2019t shake the idea that the story could easily have gone a different direction. Since the start of the 2013-14 season, the Warriors have won 76 percent of their games. Playing without Curry, they\u2019re 3-6. And if he were sidelined for the playoffs tomorrow, it seems unlikely that the Warriors would be favored to win the championship. As with Jordan and the Bulls, a strong case can be made that Curry, not the ownership group, provides the point of difference. \u201cThey did what every really good organization should do with their star,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 Lasry said. \u201cThey nurtured him. But they got lucky in that Steph became far and away the best player in the league.\u201d", "Still, Curry\u2019s mere presence wouldn\u2019t have created the means to overhaul a franchise. It takes an extraordinary player to do it \u2014 but that isn\u2019t all it takes. LeBron James still hasn\u2019t won a championship for the Cavaliers; playing together, the perennial All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook haven\u2019t won in Oklahoma City. The decision to keep Curry, coupled with the good fortune that he remained healthy and grew into a transcendent player, gave Lacob and Guber\u2019s structural innovations the chance to have their desired effect. But as Lacob sees it, Curry\u2019s dominance on the court, though essential, is inextricable from everything else he\u2019s done with the franchise over the last few years, from knocking down the office walls to the Ellis trade. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Steph Curry,\u201d he told me once. \u201cIt\u2019s architecting a team, a style of play, the way they all play together. It\u2019s all extremely thought through.\u201d", "This confluence of good planning and luck reminded me of a conversation I had with Lacob over a glass of wine one evening at the Bridge Club. He confided that he figures he\u2019s one of the 10 best blackjack players in the world. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say this,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I\u2019ve won over $1 million at one sitting nine times.\u201d As in gambling, there are no certain outcomes in sports, which is exactly what makes them worth watching. Whether you\u2019re playing pickup basketball on a Tuesday morning or hoping to turn a substandard N.B.A. franchise into a champion, all you can do is try to increase your chances of getting the outcome you desire. It was easy to see that Lacob had a knack for doing just that. For everything he did, he had worked out a system.", "As an undergraduate at Irvine, Lacob took a calculus class from Edward Thorp, whose 1962 book, \u201cBeat the Dealer,\u201d proved that a blackjack player could gain a slight edge on the house by counting cards. Thorp was banned by casinos, so he taught his students the system, backed them on trips to Las Vegas and shared in the rewards. Lacob was one of those students. When he goes to a casino now, his blackjack sessions aren\u2019t certainties, but Lacob has far better odds of succeeding at them than anyone else at the table. His purchase of the Warriors, I realized, was the same way. He counted the cards and played the odds. And he won."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/technology/autonomous-google-car-hits-public-bus-during-test-drive.html": ["A self-driving car being tested by Google struck a public bus on a city street in Mountain View, Calif.

Labor productivity has been growing at an average of only 1.3 percent annually since the start of 2005, compared with 2.8 percent annually in the preceding 10 years. Without somehow improving productivity growth, living standards will continue to lag, this widely held narrative concludes.", "Still, not everyone views the situation this way. For instance, Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur and venture capitalist, says information technology is providing significant benefits that just don\u2019t show up in the standard measurements of wages and productivity. Consider that consumers have access to services like Facebook, Google and Wikipedia free of charge, and those benefits aren\u2019t fully accounted for in the official numbers. This notion \u2014 that life is getting better, often in ways we are barely measuring \u2014 is fairly common in tech circles.", "Until recently, this debate was inconclusive. It consisted mainly of anecdotes, with individuals describing how important advances like the Internet were \u2014 or were not \u2014 to them personally. But now Chad Syverson, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, has looked more scientifically at the evidence and concluded that the productivity slowdown is all too real. These results are outlined in his recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper \u201cChallenges to Mismeasurement Explanations for the U.S. Productivity Slowdown.\u201d", "Professor Syverson notes that a slowdown has come to dozens of advanced economies, more or less at the same time, which indicates it is a general phenomenon. Furthermore, the countries with smaller tech sectors still have comparably sized productivity slowdowns, and that is not what we would expect if a lot of unmeasured productivity were hiding in the tech industry.", "An additional problem for the optimistic interpretation is this: The productivity slowdown is too big in scale, relative to the size of the tech sector, to be plausibly compensated for by tech progress. Basically, under a conservative estimate, as outlined by Professor Syverson, the productivity slowdown has led to a cumulative loss of $2.7 trillion in gross domestic product since the end of 2004; that is how much more output would have been produced had the earlier rate of productivity growth been maintained. To make up for this difference, Professor Syverson estimates, consumer surplus (consumer benefits in excess of market price) would have to be five times as high as measured in the industries that produce and service information and communications technology. That seems implausibly large as a measurement gap.", "Keep in mind that while Facebook is free to its users, much of the tech industry consists of services that are measured and at least partly incorporated into G.D.P. For instance, the free Uber app arranges paid transportation. Even Facebook, Google and Wikipedia have a lot of their value expressed in G.D.P. figures, albeit indirectly. Those services make people eager to pay for smartphones, broadband connections and iPads, and those purchases are recorded as part of G.D.P.", "From this standpoint, the measurement problem isn\u2019t all that serious. It\u2019s like going to an all-you-can-eat restaurant buffet. The chicken may be free, but the presence of so many quality items induces customers to pay more for the overall bundle, and that registers as a sale, regardless of the price of the individual items you put on your plate. Also, some of the value of Google and Facebook comes from the advertisements, which induce many purchases, which again are recorded in the national statistics. Consumers pay for many apps as well.", "Or look at it this way: The tech economy just isn\u2019t big enough to account for the productivity gap. That gap has caused measured G.D.P. to be about 15 percent lower than it would have been otherwise, yet digital technology industries were only about 7.7 percent of G.D.P. in 2004. Even if the free component of the Internet has become more important since 2004, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it is so much better now that it accounts for such a big proportion of G.D.P.", "Alternatively, consider the 2012 estimate of the gains from free Internet services made by Erik Brynjolfsson, professor of management at M.I.T., and Joo Hee Oh, assistant professor of management at the Erasmus University Rotterdam School of Management. They looked at how much time people spent on the Internet, and using that method they valued free Internet services at about $106 billion a year. That\u2019s less than 1 percent of G.D.P., and again it doesn\u2019t close the measured productivity gap. Professor Syverson considers other measures of Internet value as well, but all the different numbers keep circling back to the same conclusion: The productivity gap is real.", "None of these remarks should be taken as a lack of appreciation for information technology. Arguably the Internet brought its biggest gains in the mid- to late 1990s, and in those years measured economic productivity was in fact very high. Information technology is still one of the most dynamic sectors of the American economy, and it probably will remain so, and grow yet more influential, even if its absolute impact is not as large as the optimistic revisionists suggest.", "That still leaves us with a big productivity problem. We need to acknowledge that while many Internet entrepreneurs are economic heroes, statisticians are also pretty good at what they do, and we may simply need to accept some of the lessons embedded in their numbers. America\u2019s productivity crisis is real and it is continuing. While information technology remains the most likely source of future breakthroughs, Silicon Valley has not saved us just yet."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/28/business/media/charters-67-billion-cable-merger-hinges-on-the-cord-cutters.html": ["Charter Communications is within striking distance of finally capturing its prize.", "As soon as this week, the cable company could get the green light from federal regulators on its pair of deals \u2014 totaling $67.1 billion \u2014 to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. The merger will create a powerful new force in the industry that will dramatically reshape the future of how people gain access to the Internet, watch televisionand much more.", "Emily Steel, who covers media for The New York Times, and Cecilia Kang, who writes for The Times from Washington about technology policy, have been following the story since it broke in the summer of 2013.", "EMILY STEEL: Hi, Cecilia. It\u2019s hard to believe that this day is finally coming. What\u2019s the latest that you\u2019re hearing from regulators in Washington on the Charter deals?", "CECILIA KANG: Hello from the seat of government, where corporations come to win hearts at the risk of getting theirs broken. In this case, it looks as if Charter, a small cable company with big ambitions, will find rare success. The Federal Communications Commission shot down two big mergers in the last five years but is about to approve Charter\u2019s bid for Time Warner Cable and Bright House. The acquisitions will create the second-largest broadband provider, after Comcast, with 19.4 million subscribers, and the third-largest video provider, after Comcast and DirecTV, with 17.3 million customers. The combined company will span 40 states and include big markets such as Los Angeles and New York.", "The creation of such a giant cable and Internet company upsets consumer advocacy groups, which say a lack of competition has led to increased prices and poor customer service. But the F.C.C. thinks the deal won\u2019t harm consumers because the companies don\u2019t really compete in the same markets. While Comcast made a similar argument in its failed bid for Time Warner Cable, the F.C.C. was more skeptical in that case because Comcast\u2019s big media holdings with NBCUniversal held the potential for a conflict of interest.", "Charter and Time Warner Cable have also persuaded regulators that together, they\u2019ll be able to bring faster broadband to more households.", "The big focus at the F.C.C. has been on how this deal will affect the fastest-growing area of media: video streaming. Emily, what do people in the media and tech industries think?", "EMILY STEEL: Streaming has definitely been a hot topic. The big fear is that a gigantic Charter will have both the power and the incentive to hurt rival streaming services. It also could hinder the invention of other new offerings.", "In the three years since Charter started circling Time Warner Cable, there has been an explosion of new options for cord cutters, who want to ditch their traditional cable subscriptions but keep feeding their TV addictions. HBO and Showtime, for example, both started \u00e0 la carte streaming services. And Dish Network started a service called Sling TV that offers live and on-demand viewing for about two dozen channels. Those new services are usually cheaper than a typical cable TV offering (like what Charter sells) and also give people more choice to pay for what they want to watch, when they want to watch it. (I tried out Sling to watch my North Carolina Tar Heels in the March Madness college basketball tournament this year.)", "If Charter is selling traditional cable service, why would it want to ease the way for a new set of competitors? Both Dish and Time Warner, the parent company of HBO, have warned regulators that Charter\u2019s takeover could alter the future of streaming.", "How do you expect regulators to address that concern?", "CECILIA KANG: As a condition of approval, the F.C.C. persuaded Charter to agree to a number of public interest commitments, including a promise that it will treat streaming services fairly. It\u2019s possible that Charter will promise not to pressure programmers like Viacom and Disney to withhold shows from companies like Hulu and Netflix, which could siphon viewers away from Charter\u2019s offerings. Arrangements to withhold programming, known as \u201cmost favored nation\u201d clauses, are common but secret. But the F.C.C. and Department of Justice, which is also reviewing the deal, have made more noise about them in various speeches because they think such deals stifle streaming services by keeping the most popular shows exclusively in the cable bundle.", "Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., has talked a lot about his mission to ensure that nascent media and telecom services blossom during his tenure. After the agency rejected Comcast\u2019s bid for Time Warner Cable last April, the F.C.C.\u2019s top lawyer said that particular deal would have threatened streaming companies that competed with Comcast\u2019s video service.", "Which raises a question: Why would regulators say yes to Charter but no to Comcast?", "EMILY STEEL: For one, this deal is not as big. The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have united the country\u2019s two largest cable companies into an entity that controlled as much as 57 percent of the nation\u2019s broadband market and just under 30 percent of pay television. That would have put a lot of power in the hands of one company that several TV executives already described as a major bully. And while Charter\u2019s deal has generated its share of critics, the opposition to the Comcast deal was much louder and came from a wider base of lawmakers, public interest groups and big companies like Netflix, Dish and Discovery Communications.", "Comcast lashed out against its critics, calling some extortionists. Charter, on the other hand, has taken a more conciliatory approach, striking deals with potential opponents, like one in which it promised not to charge access fees to online content companies such as Netflix no matter how much traffic they create. (Charter has a major financial incentive to make the concessions necessary for approval: Time Warner Cable will receive a breakup fee of up to $2 billion if the deal falls apart.)", "One other interesting point, I think, is the idea that regulators could be using the Charter deal to drive the industry to adopt new business models. Cecilia, what do you think the F.C.C. is hoping to achieve through the merger?", "CECILIA KANG: This F.C.C. clearly wants to support streaming video services, and that push is seen in so many of its regulatory decisions. Its net neutrality rules \u2014 a condition of this deal that will be upheld even if the agency\u2019s rules are overturned in federal court \u2014 would ensure that Netflix and Hulu are never slowed or blocked by Charter. The F.C.C. hopes that opening up the set-top-box market will allow companies like Google and Amazon to sell devices that blend cable programming with Hulu, YouTube and online video services.", "Mergers are also used to spur broadband providers to extend service to more customers and offer cheaper plans for low-income households, a provision Charter has already volunteered to adopt. Other commitments could include the promise not to impose data caps or usage-based pricing for broadband customers.", "And even if the deal gains approval from federal regulators, it has one more hurdle: Regulators in California are also reviewing the merger. But there is little indication it will be blocked by state commissioners.", "The completion of one merger is near, Emily, but I\u2019m sure another big cable, wireless or media merger will have us back here talking again very soon.

Overwhelmingly peaceful, they helped produce two Nobel Peace Prizes. The first went to Lech Walesa, the heroic leader of Poland\u2019s 10-million-strong Solidarity Trade Union, in 1983; seven years later, the leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, was honored for having the courage to acknowledge the moral, political and economic bankruptcy of the old regime.", "These two political figures \u2014 Mr. Walesa, who became the first democratically elected president of Poland, and Mr. Gorbachev, who served as the last Soviet leader \u2014 have since become the most potent symbols of 1989. Now the heroic status of both men, and the very legacy of those revolutions, are being called into question.", "Mr. Gorbachev has been accused of betraying his country, and Mr. Walesa of betraying his fellow anti-Communists.", "In Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia, the resentment against 1989 is so intense that when the celebrated movie director and Kremlin loyalist Nikita Mikhalkov recently denounced Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s policies leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union as \u201ca real crime,\u201d the public hardly blinked \u2014 people thought he was just stating the obvious.", "What did make news was a prankster presenting himself as Mr. Mikhalkov who called Mr. Gorbachev and apologized. Everyone got a good laugh at the Nobel Prize winner, who was grateful to accept an apology that was never made. Russians are not really nostalgic for Communism per se, but they pine for the days of the Soviet Union as a superpower. In Russia, 1989 doesn\u2019t symbolize society\u2019s victory over Communism, but rather Moscow\u2019s defeat and humiliation at the hands of the West.", "Almost at the same time as the Mikhalkov affair, the Institute for National Memory in Poland released documents, some of them obtained from the widow of the last Communist interior minister, reviving the claims that Mr. Walesa was a secret police informer in the 1970s. (He was cleared by a special court after an earlier wave of accusations in 2000.)", "Unsurprisingly, Mr. Walesa called the document a \u201cfabrication,\u201d and thousands of people took to the streets of Warsaw, Gdansk and other Polish cities in defense of the former Solidarity leader.

To be sure, no. It is most likely that Mr. Walesa, like many others, cut various small deals with the authorities in the 1970s to secure his freedom after being arrested for pro-democracy activities.", "But the demonstrators on the street, some of them old Solidarity activists themselves, also understand that the secret police was hardly above fabricating police files in order to discredit its opponents. And those same demonstrators are fully aware that the miracle of Solidarity would have been impossible without leaders like Mr. Walesa.", "The larger point, though, is that people on the streets of large Polish cities today are defending something greater than Mr. Walesa \u2014 the legacy of 1989 itself. They suspect the government is using the attack on Mr. Walesa as an instrument to delegitimize liberal democracy.", "And they seem to be right. Antoni Macierewicz, the current Polish defense minister, claimed bluntly that Mr. Walesa\u2019s police file proved that \u201cpost-Communist Poland was a product of the secret police and not of democratically elected institutions.\u201d", "It is one thing to have to defend the 1989 revolution in \u201cdefeated\u201d Russia. But why is it suddenly so hard to do so in victorious Poland, where people are freer and more prosperous than ever before and where Solidarity is a national icon?", "The irony of the current wave of revisionism is that 1989 is rejected for the same reasons that it has long been acclaimed, namely its absence of radicalism. The fact that it chose to integrate the old elites instead of persecuting them has turned out to be, at once, the revolution\u2019s lasting achievement and its ultimate Achilles\u2019 heel.", "The populist insurgency feverishly advancing in Poland, Hungary and other parts of Eastern Europe is a rebellion against moderates and moderation. The events of 1989 are condemned as little more than an ingenious plot to transform the elites\u2019 political power into economic power (like the Who song, it\u2019s \u201cmeet the new boss, same as the old boss.\u201d)", "In this narrative, 1989 marks the liberation not of the people, but of the Communist elites. They were liberated from fear (of party purges and anti-Communist uprisings), guilt, ideology, the chains of community and even national loyalty \u2014 before they had the privilege to travel; now they have the right to be part of the West. Before they ran the country, but now they own it. The shadow power of the old elites has become the ultimate explanation for everything that went wrong after 1989 \u2014 rising inequality, betrayed expectations.", "Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s politics of anger, like Mr. Putin\u2019s politics of resentment, resonates with the younger generations, who live in a world where history no longer matters. They have Google and smartphones but little patience for the moral complexities of the Communist period, and thus no desire to understand what Mr. Walesa actually did in the 1970s, or what choices Mr. Gorbachev faced in the 1980s. For those generations that cannot claim any personal experience with the destructive and self-destructive nature of revolutionary politics, moderation is neither inspiring nor justified.", "The heroes of 1989 traded peace for justice.

Another rule would require companies to protect the data and notify customers, the commission and law enforcement agencies if the information was stolen.", "These are similar to the protections the commission has long imposed on phone companies.

But even when data is encrypted, companies can still tell what websites people are visiting. And many websites still do not use encryption.", "Another criticism is that these rules treat broadband providers differently than Internet businesses like Google and Facebook, which collect huge amounts of personal data about users. But the commission has no authority to regulate those websites. And it is far easier for consumers to avoid those sites than to avoid their Internet service providers, especially since in many parts of the country people have only one or two choices for broadband.", "Mr. Wheeler is able to make this proposal because the commission wisely decided in February 2015 to treat broadband as a telecommunications service rather than as a lightly regulated information service. That decision also made it possible for the commission to forbid cable and phone companies to create fast and slow lanes on the Internet.", "The commission will vote on March 31 to open Mr. Wheeler\u2019s proposal to public comments before it can be finalized, probably before the end of the year.

By contrast, Hillary Clinton is popular with older voters, who spend less time online, but have very high turnout rates.", "Indeed, Google\u2019s record so far in forecasting Democratic races has been more mixed. In both the Iowa and Nevada caucuses, there were more searches asking specifically how to caucus for Mrs. Clinton than how to caucus for Mr. Sanders, but in terms of broader search interest, there were more searches for Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton won both caucuses narrowly; in Iowa it was a virtual tie. In New Hampshire, Mr. Sanders\u2019s 22-point win was larger than most pollsters had anticipated, but Google had actually predicted him to do five points better.", "But South Carolina was a big miss. There were fewer Google searches for Mrs. Clinton than for Mr. Sanders in South Carolina while the polls were open, even though Mrs. Clinton walloped him among voters by nearly 50 points. It\u2019s a result consistent with Mr. Stephens-Davidowitz\u2019s observation that \u201cpeople Google Sanders more than Clinton, consistently.\u201d", "At this point, the sample of elections is sufficiently small that it is hard to know whether Google Trends is truly prescient, or just a bit lucky.

After a few months, the apps weren\u2019t just a repository of daily facts; they had become a legible map to my body. My period no longer caught me off guard, and I eventually learned to connect the arc of my cycle to changes in mood, appetite, fatigue and sex life, and adjust my routines accordingly.

We looked very carefully at all of the provisions to make sure that the new framework fully met the standards set by the European Court of Justice.", "Q. What were the hardest compromises that you had to make to reach a final agreement?", "A.

How did you balance the American view on privacy with the somewhat different European view?", "A. The U.S. has a different structure than Europe, but both systems offer robust privacy protection. Part of the challenge was to make sure that the European negotiators understood how our system works.", "Unlike the E.U., we don\u2019t have a single overarching privacy law. We have sectoral laws.

Though the interiors might have advanced lighting systems, state-of-the-art fitness facilities and cafeterias serving farm-to-table fare, the exteriors \u2014 flat, unarticulated facades; ribbon windows; hard right angles \u2014 could come from any suburban office corridor anywhere in the country, and from any moment in the past half-century.", "This is why the recently revealed plans for the new campuses of Google, in Mountain View, Calif., designed by Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick, and Apple, in Cupertino, from Sir Norman Foster, are so striking: They, like the companies they will house, point to the future \u2014 the future, that is, as it looked in the 1960s. Images of the projected Apple campus \u2014 a four-tiered ringlike structure nestled in a thickly wooded landscape \u2014 evoke the landing of an alien spaceship. The central structure in Ingels\u2019s and Heatherwick\u2019s design is canopied by a sinuous glass membrane, a protective bubble or amniotic sac, shielding an entire section of the campus \u2014 not just buildings but bike paths and desks \u2014 while letting the abundant Northern California light stream in. In aerial renderings it looks like larvae, incubating a new and possibly terrifying future.", "Like the rest of Silicon Valley, however, this future is in fact rooted in the past. It comes, transfigured, from the wrecked dreams of communal living, of back-to-the-land utopias, of expanding plastic spheres and geodesic domes that populated the landscape of Northern California around the time (and around the same place) that the first semiconductors were being perfected. This is the world of what a recent exhibit at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis has termed \u201cHippie Modernism.\u201d Out of the ferment of the \u201960s came a spectacular brew of experiments that softened the edge of the bureaucratic architecture of Modernism and explored new shapes and styles of building, new ideas about how to live and work. In the world of the counterculture, round and pliant was good; sharp and angular was bad. These concepts found their way into the cinema \u2014 into the soft plastic finishes of the circular, rotating space station in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d where it was the antithesis of the sourceless, death-bringing black slab monolith, itself almost the clone of that icon of corporate Modernism, Mies van der \u00adRohe\u2019s Seagram Building.

The cover of the first issue was an image of the earth \u2014 another sphere \u2014 taken from space, exemplifying its spirit of holism.

Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired and one of the editors of The Whole Earth Catalog, thought that the magazine\u2019s ethos of sharing products and communications, even its cobbled-together design, prefigured the blog.

Beneath it were the words: \u2018Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\u2019\u200a\u201d Brand himself would later call Jobs one of the exemplary fusers of the counterculture and technology.", "Brand was also an enthusiast for countercultural design ideas as a way to build a new society. In an issue from 1971, he called for the creation of an \u201cOutlaw Area,\u201d a territory removed from civilization, where human community could be reinvented. \u201cAny design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens,\u201d he wrote, suggesting that the Outlaw Area would transform our understanding of what human beings were capable of, \u201cbending reality off into unimaginable directions with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.\u201d", "The designers who followed up on Brand\u2019s injunctions over the next decade would create forms that startlingly presage the new office worlds being designed by Google and Apple.

Architects became attracted to furniture and buildings that resembled bubbles. As the design critic Alastair Gordon observed in his book \u201cSpaced Out: Radical Environments of the Psychedelic Sixties,\u201d not only did the trippy shimmer of the bubble delight the hippies, its transparency and unpredictable movement seemed at once stimulating and human. The visionary architect Buckminster Fuller\u2019s famous concept of a \u201cgeodesic dome,\u201d a giant all-purpose shelter, drew heavily on bubble imagery. Meanwhile, students at Antioch College in Ohio conceived of a \u201cNomadic/Pneumatic Campus,\u201d an outdoor classroom sheltered by a 40-foot-high polyvinyl canopy. For a time the \u201coffices\u201d of The Whole Earth Catalog, in their temporary digs in California\u2019s Saline Valley, were sheltered in just such a bubble. The fact that they were temporary was the key: Like the conversion of garages into tech offices, the bubble shelter was meant to be forgiving, improvisatory, for a nomadic and restless society seeking a new relationship with how to fuse life and work.", "Not that these future society plans were limited entirely to the planet. In 1969, Princeton physics professor, Gerard O\u2019Neill, and his students began to imagine how to create a space colony to house a million people. O\u2019Neill\u2019s vision comprised two concentric cylinders (round forms, again), spinning in opposite directions to generate gravity, and on which each person would be allotted five acres of land. The designer Don Norman did a rendering of the concept, and it bears a striking resemblance to the images of the new Google office: Filled with dazzling foliage, plentiful water and bucolic housing, it looks a lot like Marin County, placed under glass.", "These images and experiments fueled the imagination of Silicon Valley, even as the young tech entrepreneurs began converting their ramshackle means to far different ends. It was, after all, an earth held in common that inspired the hippie Modernists to find new ways of designing and living. The new unearthly Silicon Valley campuses represent the triumph of privatized commons, of a verdant natural world sheltered for the few. Neither the Google nor Apple campus is open to the public, nor are their designs replicable on the scale that the \u201960s utopians imagined for their designs. Well after the orchards of Northern California were overwhelmed by glass boxes and suburban tracts, the tech companies find themselves looking longingly at an Edenic, prelapsarian moment, when it seemed that \u2014 to adapt a more recent slogan \u2014 another world was possible. But what was originally borne from improvisation and a desire to live simply is now borne from unimaginable mountains of cash. The new Apple office will cost an estimated $5 billion, making it possibly the most expensive office building in history.

Many Galaxy phones have sold briskly, catapulting Samsung to the top spot in the worldwide handset market.", "But try as Samsung might, its smartphones always run into the same criticisms. The gadgets are inferior to Apple\u2019s iPhones, which work seamlessly with the iOS mobile software, some critics say. And while the hardware design of the Galaxy phones \u2014 featuring large, vivid screens and high-quality cameras \u2014 wins plaudits, the devices keep getting thumbs down for some of their junky software.", "With two new flagship phones \u2014 the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, which were released last week \u2014 Samsung is hoping to overcome those criticisms. The phones, which cost roughly $700 to $800, are water-resistant, equipped with fast cameras and capable of displaying virtual-reality apps and games through Samsung\u2019s headset, the Gear VR. Samsung also loaded the new phones with about a third less software than previous versions.", "\u201cWe know that one thing that our users want is a little bit less software, and we\u2019ve made a serious effort with this device to include less,\u201d said Philip Berne, a Samsung marketing manager.", "I tested the new devices to come up with a few rules of thumb for how to get the most out of Samsung\u2019s smartphones.

Here are four easy steps for improving Samsung phones, which I put together with the help of Florence Ion, a writer for Greenbot, a website about Android-based products.", "Probably the most annoying aspect of Samsung devices is their inclusion of inferior apps made by mobile carriers like Verizon Wireless and AT&T, known in tech industry parlance as carrier bloatware. These include apps like mapping or music services provided by the carriers, which are generally unpopular.", "Fortunately, most of the carrier-installed apps on Samsung phones can be disabled. The apps included will differ from carrier to carrier, but generally bloatware can be turned off and better alternatives downloaded.", "Using the Verizon version of the S7 as an example, open the Apps folder and then open the Verizon folder.

Ms. Ion named a few popular launchers including Action, which makes it easy to create shortcuts that activate different functions inside apps; Nova, which enables deeper customizations; and Google Now, which makes Android look the way Google intended.", "In my testing, I preferred the Google Now launcher. It makes the app icons look clean and vibrant, and swiping to the left of the main screen displays a list of cards containing Google account information, including calendar, recent Amazon purchases and the weather. It\u2019s a convenient way to take a quick peek at useful personalized data.", "Apart from apps included by carriers on the Galaxy phones, Samsung also loads some of its custom-made software, like its calendar, voice assistant and email app, on the devices.

There are plenty of better alternatives to download through the Google Play app store.", "Here again I would recommend Google\u2019s keyboard, which has auto-prediction, or the ability to quickly predict intended words after a few keystrokes. It also allows typing by swiping around the keyboard.", "There\u2019s a downside to de-Samsungifying the Samsung phones. While most of the included software from both Samsung and mobile carriers can be deactivated, some apps cannot be removed without taking extreme measures to wipe out all the software on the phone and replace it with a fresh install of Android, a method called rooting or flashing. That process is complicated, so it\u2019s not for the faint of heart.", "That means a lot of apps included on the Samsung phones will linger inside folders even after alternatives have been installed. Duplicates of some apps will probably remain.", "But the Samsung software is easy enough to ignore by creating shortcuts to the ones you actually want.

But unlike most itineraries you find in travel publications, Popular Itineraries are not created by editors or writers. They are based on anonymous and aggregated data across a large pool of travelers who have opted into sharing their mobile location data with Google. It\u2019s the same technology Google uses to create its Popular Times graphs; i.e. people using mobile phones in a restaurant help Google determine the busiest and slowest times.

Its primary purpose, a Google product manager told me, is to help users figure out where to go. The technology of Google Flights, my go-to comparison tool, and hotel search are baked into Destinations. Google Flights shows options across multiple airlines, but to book you go to an airline\u2019s own website. Choosing a hotel through Destinations takes you to a Google search page with information about the hotel, its location, reviews and the option to book through a partner site such as Hotels.com, Booking.com or Venere.com.", "Google says Destinations is designed for the leisure traveler who takes a trip or two a year and is concerned about making the right choices for that big getaway.

The price bar graph is a quick way to narrow down when to go. And a flexible dates feature allows you to say that you want to go in June, for instance, and then see your travel options for the entire month, rather than for specific dates. Details about rainfall and temperature mean you don\u2019t have to run a separate search to see if you were planning to visit during hurricane season. And Points of Interest and Suggested Itineraries could be handy for business travelers parachuting into a place for a night or two but hoping to get to a must-see spot between meetings.", "Is Destinations regularly unearthing hidden treasures? No. Does Destinations make it easier to spark ideas and to start plotting? Absolutely. You can type \u201cCaribbean vacation\u201d in the search box and instantly begin finding the island that\u2019s right for you.

It isn\u2019t much to look at, and even describing its utility is difficult.

But there are a couple of reasons it has earned such raves from users.", "First, it\u2019s simple to learn, and its voice-recognition capabilities are more intuitive than those of many other vocal assistants (like Apple\u2019s Siri or Google Now). More than that, it keeps gaining new powers.", "During an interview at a media event last week, Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, said the company created the Echo because it had seen interesting possibilities arising out of advances in microphone technology, speech recognition and cloud connectivity. Amazon\u2019s engineers spent years perfecting the device\u2019s unusual capabilities. Unlike competing assistants, the Echo can be activated hands-free from far across the room (Siri only works from a couple of feet away), and it can decipher your voice in noisy environments, even when it\u2019s playing music.", "Amazon also worked to make sure the device responded very quickly. \u201cEarly on in the product, to play music took eight or nine seconds, and it\u2019s just unusable when it\u2019s like that,\u201d Mr. Limp said. \u201cNow it\u2019s often 1,000 milliseconds or 1,200 milliseconds.\u201d", "The speed makes a crucial difference. Compared with the trudge of chatting with Siri, speaking to Alexa feels natural, closer to speaking to a human than a machine \u2014 and even when it gets your request wrong, which in your early days with the device will happen often, it doesn\u2019t feel like you have paid a huge penalty for trying.", "More important, just like the early iPhone, Amazon has managed to turn the Echo into the center of a new ecosystem. Developers are flocking to create voice-controlled apps for the device, or skills, as Amazon calls them. There are now more than 300 skills for the Echo, from the trivial \u2014 there is one to make Alexa produce rude body sounds on command \u2014 to the pretty handy. It can tell you transit schedules, start a seven-minute workout, read recipes, do math and conversions, and walk you through adventure games, among other possibilities.", "Makers of digital home devices like Nest are also rushing to make their products compatible with the Echo. Alexa can now control your Internet-connected lights, home thermostats and a variety of other devices.

When you tell it to reorder popcorn, it gets your order through Amazon, of course. Still, Mr. Wingo noted that Amazon had so far kept the platform relatively open \u2014 other retailers and product manufacturers are free to build their own apps that will allow for interactions with their stores.", "The Echo is far from perfect. It still gets queries wrong and it still feels like it\u2019s missing potentially useful features. Mr. Limp concedes this. Amazon\u2019s teams keep working to add new tricks to the Echo, he said. The device also faces limited retail distribution \u2014 it\u2019s unusual enough that it would benefit from being displayed on shelves, but Amazon\u2019s retail rivals are unlikely to stock it anytime soon. (Some analysts have speculated that Amazon\u2019s retail plans may be an effort to show off its hardware.)", "Amazon would be wise to step on the gas because while the Echo has no direct competitors, a few may be emerging. Among them is SoundHound, a start-up that has been working on voice-recognition for more than a decade, which is now offering hardware makers access to its service. Within the next year, according to the company, lots of gadgets will be using SoundHound\u2019s software to talk to users.", "Do you want that?

When it finally fell apart, I was unwilling to make the change that was needed. Instead of embracing equilibrium, I clutched tighter than ever to hold on to control.

On almost every metric, President Frank Underwood seemingly falls short of Conway, who is young (at roughly 39, he meets the age requirement for a presidential candidate, but just barely), savvy when it comes to social media, and a happily married family man. In short, as one of the president\u2019s advisers puts it, he\u2019s a rock star.", "Conway and Frank even start their days in what feel like different universes. Conway enjoys spirited \u201cgood morning\u201d sex in the bathroom with his beautiful, British wife, while Frank stands alone in front of a bathroom vanity filled with medications as his wife peeks in from a cautious distance.

Unlike the Conways, Frank and Claire appear to derive their earthly pleasures from coaching each other toward professional success. In a pair of deftly edited sequences we first see Frank advising Claire about how to hone her message during a meeting with the head of the National Rifle Association, then, later, Claire helping Frank perfect his approach to an important conversation about who should be his running mate. Everything they lack in romantic passion, they make up for in their strategic synchronicity, a quality that, true or not, many have always imagined is core to the Clintons\u2019 relationship as well.

He\u2019s smart enough to spin his relationship with Pollyhop, the Google of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d as a positive, for example, by using language that emphasizes openness and transparency. It\u2019s the stuff designed to resonate with millennials weaned on Wi-Fi access. \u201cThis is my way of listening to millions of you,\u201d he says, adding that he plans to publicly share all of the emails, texts and videos on his personal cellphone, which surely is a sly nod to the Hillary Clinton email scandal.", "The notion of tapping into Americans\u2019 personal information is a hot-button issue and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d uses it to further accentuate the differences between the candidates. While Conway seeks to gain intel about voters\u2019 preferences using technology that takes advantage of willingly shared information, Frank wants to just take it by way of a federal court ruling that allows for widespread domestic surveillance, justified by airstrikes against ICO, the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d version of ISIS. It\u2019s the stuff of Edward Snowden\u2019s most extreme nightmares, and Frank has the good judgment to abort both the military mission and his plan. Still, one wonders if he\u2019ll find another way to tap, wire or otherwise, into the minds of voters and in the process, perhaps find out that Tom Hammerschmidt is still investigating Lucas Goodwin\u2019s claims about him.", "There\u2019s another important quality that Conway and Frank don\u2019t share and that\u2019s ruthlessness. As Claire notes, the Underwoods are willing to go farther than anyone, including the Conways, to get what they want. If there was any thought that, post-surgery, Frank might soften, this episode puts an end to that notion. His overdramatic, fourth-wall-breaking monologues, easily the most irritating of the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d signature stylistic flourishes, are back in full force. And his insistence, with Claire\u2019s agreement, that \u201cwe are going to destroy\u201d the Conways suggests things are going to get very ugly in the remainder of the season.", "While watching that video of the 2012 New Year\u2019s Eve party, both the president and first lady realize they have something to hold over their rival\u2019s head.

Paper, $17.", "Teju Cole\u2019s captivating and lauded novels, \u201cOpen City\u201d and \u201cEvery Day Is for the Thief,\u201d reflect his identity as a writer with a global perspective \u2014 born in the United States and raised in Nigeria. His international access as an author, art historian and photographer \u2014 one who also teaches and is a photography critic for The New York Times Magazine \u2014 shapes not only his obsessions but, in a chicken-and-egg sense, determines his gaze. He takes in news from African countries and American cities; but also, by necessity and interest, Asian, European and Latin American culture and history. In short, the world belongs to Cole and is thornily and gloriously allied with his curiosity and his personhood. \u201cKnown and Strange Things,\u201d his first collection of nonfiction, journeys through all the landscapes he has access to: international, personal, cultural, technological and emotional. When he feels homesick, he informs us in this book, he \u201cvisits\u201d his parents in Nigeria through Google maps \u2014 a sweet if distant form of connection.", "In \u201cThe Anxiety of Influence,\u201d the renowned critic Harold Bloom argued that poets, especially those in the Western tradition since the Renaissance, necessarily negotiate the work of their predecessors as they write. \u201cThe precursors flood us,\u201d Bloom wrote, \u201cand our imaginations can die by drowning in them, but no imaginative life is possible if such inundation is wholly evaded.\u201d Cole shares Bloom\u2019s interest in the fraught and burdened relationship writers and artists have to our ancestors, and he seeks to answer yet another question: How does the imagination cross and recross racial and filial boundaries, and what does this crossing mean? With our ever-enlarging global access to the visions and voices and influences of others, Cole attempts to untangle the knot of who or what belongs to us and to whom or what do we belong as artists, thinkers and, finally, human beings.", "In this light, \u201cBlack Body,\u201d the opening essay in \u201cKnown and Strange Things,\u201d engages the \u201cquestion of filiation\u201d that tormented James Baldwin in his essay \u201cStranger in the Village.\u201d Baldwin, reflecting on his stay in the white-peopled Swiss village of Leukerbad, was moved to write that \u201cthe most illiterate among them is related, in a way I am not, to Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo. .\u2008.\u2008. Out of their hymns and dances come Beethoven and Bach. Go back a few centuries and they are in their full glory \u2014 but I am in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.\u201d", "Cole, revisiting the terrain of Leukerbad, pairs himself with Baldwin (also echoing, in his parenthesis, the poet Elizabeth Bishop\u2019s \u201cOne Art\u201d): \u201cI am black like him; and I am slender; and have a gap in my front teeth and am not especially tall (no, write it: short) .\u2008.\u2008. and feel myself in all places, from New York City to rural Switzerland, the custodian of a black body, and have to find the language for all of what that means to me and to the people who look at me. The ancestor had briefly taken possession of the descendant.\u201d", "But Cole soon distances himself from Baldwin\u2019s feeling of alienation. He states that Baldwin\u2019s \u201cself-abnegation\u201d prevents him from embracing Bach or Rembrandt, who Cole insists do not belong to one race. He might even care more about these artists \u201cthan some white people do,\u201d Cole writes.", "The first section of the collection, \u201cReading Things,\u201d has Cole claiming filiation with a number of authors (all male) who prove important to him. In the case of many of them, influence begets influence. Along with Baldwin comes V.S. Naipaul (\u201cThe benevolent rheumy-eyed old soul: so fond of the word \u2018nigger,\u2019 so aggressive in his lack of sympathy toward Africa, so brutal in his treatment of woman\u201d); Tomas Transtromer (\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m unembarrassable about influence, because I realize now how many of Transtromer\u2019s concepts I have hidden away in my own work\u201d); W.G. Sebald (\u201cThis expert mixing of forms owed a great deal to his reading of the 17th-\u00adcentury melancholics Robert Burton and Thomas Browne\u201d); Derek Walcott (\u201cHe names painters as his exemplars more often than he names poets: Pissarro, Veronese, C\u00e9zanne, Manet, Gauguin and Millet roll through the \u00adpages\u201d); and Andr\u00e9 Aciman (\u201cAciman\u2019s debt to Proust is deep and freely acknowledged\u201d).", "This opening section concludes with \u201cA Conversation With Aleksandar Hemon,\u201d in which Hemon \u2014 a writer and critic and self-identified \u201cdiasporic person\u201d \u2014 questions Cole on what Nigerian history means to him. Cole\u2019s answer catapults him into a global context: \u201cMy identity maps onto other things: being a Lagosian (Lagos is like a city-state), being a West African, being African, being a part of the Black Atlantic. I identify strongly with the historical network that connects New York, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro and Lagos.\u201d Hemon is also interested in what happens when influences are constantly shaping and reshaping the imagination. For Cole, visual artists, especially painters, are least affected by that anxiety of influence and \u201cknow that everything is a combination of what\u2019s observed, what\u2019s imagined, what\u2019s overheard and what\u2019s been done before.\u201d He argues that to acknowledge influence is to let go of notions of \u201cliteral records of reality\u201d and cultural or racial ownership of content. All Cole wants is to be \u201cdragged down into a space of narrative that I haven\u2019t been in before.\u201d", "The stunning second section, \u201cSeeing Things,\u201d is especially captivating and reveals Cole\u2019s voracious appetite for and love of the visual. Taken together, the essays in this section provide a comprehensive look at contemporary photography, placed within a historical framework. This approach brings forward evidence of things unseen, things, as Susan Sontag put it, \u201cleast likely to be known.\u201d The artists who have Cole\u2019s attention impose their individual and subjective sense on the material of the world, rejecting the notion, as most photographers do by nature, that it is possible to capture objective \u201crecords of reality.\u201d He is drawn toward filmmakers and the visual artists who see with this photographer\u2019s orientation. The collage work of Wangechi Mutu, described as \u201cboth easy and difficult to look at, seductive in their patterning, grotesque in their themes,\u201d relies on actual photographic images; Cole\u2019s favorite films by Michael Haneke and Krzysztof Kieslowski bring into view images of life so ordinary they could escape our attention. Cole believes that all of this work allows us to think with the eyes, and though the Australian composer Peter Sculthrope is also included here, his music becomes a passageway into the landscape and history of Australia.", "But it\u2019s the essays that focus explicitly on photography, especially, that demand our attention. Cole considers here the work of both well and lesser known photographers such as Seydou Keita, Malick Sidibe, J.D. \u2019Okhai Ojeikere, Joseph Moise Agbodjelou, Zanele Muholi, Henri \u00adCartier-Bresson, Sergei Ilnitsky, Sam Abell, Glenna Gordan, Saul Leiter, Richard Renaldi, Thomas Demand, as well as Google-based photographic and filmic practitioners like Doug Rickard, Mishka Henner, Aaron Hobson, Michael Wolf and Dina Kelberman. These photographers, whether reframing \u201canthropological images of \u2018natives\u2019 made by Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\u201d or applying a curatorial eye to the world around us, are democratizing the history of photography.", "When the occasional essay fails to hold interest it\u2019s because the connections Cole draws to some European lineage remain tenuous. This is the case, for example, with Cole\u2019s meditation on death through the woodcuts entitled \u201cPictures of Death,\u201d by Hans Holbein the Younger, which brings him to the killing of the African-\u00adAmerican Walter Scott by a South Carolina police officer in 2015, which in turn makes him think about the writer Sir Walter Scott and one of his short stories, about a premeditated murder, \u201cThe Two Drovers.\u201d This associative style enables Cole to move across disciplines and through time, but in this case seems tendentious.", "In the third section, \u201cBeing There,\u201d photography\u2019s ability as a discipline to present a unique archive of reality comes most clearly into light. These essays track Cole\u2019s journeys around an explosive world of drones, wars and diseases, including the kidnappings of young girls in Chibok and assassinations of terror suspects by drone warfare. Cole happens to be streets away when the poet Kofi Awoonor is killed in a terrorist massacre in a Nairobi mall. He finds in Awoonor\u2019s work some echoes of T.S. Eliot, but Cole ends his essay with a line from Awoonor, himself quoting \u201can ancient poet from my tradition\u201d: \u201cI will say it before death comes. And if I don\u2019t say it, let no one say it for me. I will be the one who will say it.\u201d Even as Cole positions Awoonor relative to the European tradition, he also allows Awoonor to have the last word.", "One of the most resonant and powerful essays in \u201cBeing There\u201d is \u201cThe White Savior Industrial Complex,\u201d an expansion of Cole\u2019s seven-part-Twitter-feed response to \u201cKony 2012,\u201d a video calling for the arrest of the Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony. He meditates more fully here on the interconnectivity of American political polices to their outcome. Activist philanthropy that begins in amnesia lacks, in Cole\u2019s words, \u201cconstellational thinking.\u201d He lays bear the relationship among sentimentality, ignorance, corruption, pillage and complicity within our global communities. Under Cole\u2019s watchful eye the world shrinks into a network of countries, communities and individuals influenced by, dependent on and affected by other countries, communities and individuals.", "This brilliant collection closes with an epilogue, \u201cBlind Spot,\u201d in which Cole recounts the time he first had an episode of papillophlebitis, or \u201cbig blind spot syndrome.\u201d If epilogues benefit from hindsight, it\u2019s difficult not to feel the piece is intended by Cole to be read diagnostically, beyond its autobiographical content. In the essay, Cole admits to feeling shame as he worries that a waitress in a Hudson, N.Y., cafe he stumbles into might not interpret his inability to read a menu as eye trouble but assume instead that he was \u201cilliterate.\u201d This use of the word \u201cilliterate\u201d is an echo of the James Baldwin quotation in the first essay in the collection, \u201cBlack Body.\u201d Suddenly the essays endeavoring to connect and build lines of influence between the canon of Western and African literature and art tremble as they stand in relation to the strange and surprising feeling of being misread. How quickly the black body can be thrown out of its cosmopolitanism and literacy, as the author\u2019s own anxieties overtake him sitting at a counter in that cafe next to \u201ctwo blond women and two men, also fair haired.\u201d", "Cole\u2019s global perspective hits its limit here. History \u2014 literary, political, social or personal \u2014 offers us a vast archive of knowledge that both influences and challenges the definitions we construct for ourselves. On every level of engagement and critique, \u201cKnown and Strange Things\u201d is an essential and scintillating journey."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/sports/tennis/united-states-open-new-grandstand.html": ["When Dan Wiley heard that Caroline Wozniacki was playing Taylor Townsend in a first-round United States Open match at the Grandstand, he did what he had done many times before to get there: He passed through the walkway that connects Louis Armstrong Stadium to the adjacent court.", "But once there, Wiley, a 53-year-old community coordinator for Representative Nydia M.

Apple has proferred its superior devices, like the iPhone. Google has fought back with its Android operating system and a series of mobile apps that are more flexible and compatible with a broader set of devices than Apple\u2019s apps.", "On Tuesday, Google underscored that strategy with the release of its latest mobile app: Duo, a video-calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple\u2019s FaceTime.", "The app fits squarely into Google\u2019s playbook in mobile. Over the last few years, Google has increasingly offered its important software and internet services, including Google Maps, Google Photos and Google Docs, to iPhone customers. All of those apps were compelling alternatives to Apple\u2019s proprietary apps, like Apple Maps, Photos and Notes, because they work on a wider variety of devices, including Macs, Windows PCs, Android devices and iPhones.", "Duo is no exception. People can only use FaceTime to call others who have Apple devices. But Duo lets you place video calls between Android and iPhone users, and sizably increases the universe of people with whom you can hold a video conversation.", "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether your call will connect, or if your friend is using the same type of device as you are,\u201d Google said in a statement, in a veiled jab at Apple. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that nearly half of U.S. adults never make video calls on mobile.\u201d", "All of this feeds into Google\u2019s strategy to attract iPhone users over to Android. Google\u2019s apps generally work better on Android devices than on iPhones, so the more that people get hooked on Google\u2019s core apps, the less incentive there is to stay loyal to Apple.", "Nick Fox, Google\u2019s head of communication products, said the top priority with Duo was to build a great product and to increase the use of video calling among Android users. But he added that making Android more attractive to iPhone owners was a secondary motive. He said that Duo\u2019s appeal was that it was simple to use, fast and more widely accessible.", "\u201cOur view is video calling should work for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can only call half the people you know, that\u2019s very limiting.\u201d", "Apple does not profess to be worried by Google\u2019s moves. When the iPhone maker reported falling sales last month, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, repeatedly highlighted that the rate at which people were switching from Android-based devices to iPhones was the highest the company had seen.", "\u201cOur year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we\u2019ve seen in any nine-month period,\u201d Mr. Cook said in the call, without disclosing precise figures.", "An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Mr. Cook\u2019s comments.", "I decided to test Duo to see how the new app plays into the debate about whether iPhone users should consider switching to Android devices. After trying an early copy of Duo and comparing it side by side with FaceTime, I found that Duo was just as intuitive and fun to use as FaceTime, but that it was too early to tell which service was more reliable.", "A Short History", "First, a little context about Duo and where it fits into the universe of Google apps. The Silicon Valley company announced in May at its annual developer conference that Duo would be coming. The app is solely dedicated to video chats between two people, the company said, to make video calling simpler to access.", "This is not the first time Google has provided video calling. Google started offering mobile video calling several years ago inside its Hangouts app, which also includes messaging and voice-calling capabilities. The video-calling feature in Hangouts will remain intact.", "Crystal Dahlen, a Google spokeswoman, said the name Duo conveyed that the app was designed for one-to-one video calling on mobile devices, in contrast to Hangouts, which lets groups of people make video calls over mobile devices and computers. Duo will roll out globally over the next few days.", "FaceTime, in contrast, is now six years old. When Apple unveiled the video-calling ability in iPhones in 2010, Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, said he had dreamed of mobile video calling since he grew up watching \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek.\u201d Apple later expanded FaceTime to work with iPads and Macs, among other Apple products. The company has not published statistics on FaceTime use, but the technology helped make mobile video calling mainstream.", "Duo Versus FaceTime", "The Duo app is downloadable and free through Google\u2019s Play store and Apple\u2019s App Store. When you open the Duo app, there is just one button: video call. Tapping that loads your contacts list, and from there you can choose whom to call.", "Duo starts streaming video to a recipient as soon as the call is placed, meaning the person you are calling will be able to see you waving or making faces before he or she picks up. Google calls this feature Knock Knock. It can be disabled in case you have friends who are likely to make inappropriate hand gestures.", "With FaceTime, you place a call directly through the iPhone\u2019s contacts list or through the separate FaceTime app. The recipient does not see the video streaming until after the call is answered.", "I placed video calls over Duo and FaceTime over a strong Wi-Fi connection as well as a weak cellular connection. In the tests, the video calls looked clearer on Duo, though that is an unreliable measure because very few people are currently able to use Duo, so the network is unrealistically uncongested. When more people use Duo, we can expect the picture quality to vary depending on network traffic and internet speeds.", "There is a minor difference for Duo between Android and iPhone users. An Android user receiving a Duo call will see a Knock Knock video on the home screen by default. Those using Apple devices will see a notification on top of the screen and will have to open the Duo app before seeing Knock Knock in action. Otherwise, the app works the same for both Android and iPhone.", "Against the Rest", "I also compared Duo calls with video calls placed over Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Facebook Messenger. Against those two, Duo\u2019s simplicity won hands down.", "In Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, the video-calling feature is embedded in the corner of a message box, so it is hard to find and not intuitive to use. In fact, every call I have ever made with Messenger has been by mistake.", "On Skype, the video-calling feature is in a place similar to Messenger\u2019s, in the corner of a message box. More annoyingly, to find other Skype users you have to manually add them to your Skype contacts list or toggle on an option to synchronize your address book with Skype.", "The Bottom Line", "For now, FaceTime is just as intuitive as Duo so I see no compelling reason to use Duo over FaceTime to call iPhone users.", "But if I had to video call an Android user, I would use Duo over other video-calling services like Skype or Facebook Messenger, which have more cluttered interfaces than Duo\u2019s single-button approach."], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/08/09/us/politics/ap-us-campaign-2016-trump-fact-check.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/technology/personaltech/off-to-college-maybe-these-devices-should-go-along.html": ["WHEN Vanessa Arreola, 18, starts her freshman year at Stanford University this fall, the top item on her back-to-school wish list is a MacBook Pro.", "She said she wouldn\u2019t consider a tablet because she prefers a traditional keyboard.

Half of her textbooks are digitized, and she uses apps like Microsoft Excel and Word \u2014 so her ideal school device would be a Windows machine with a touch screen, like a Microsoft Surface tablet.", "The polarizing responses illustrate how back-to-school shopping for technology gadgets has become increasingly complex for parents. In the past, the dilemma for most students was whether to get a Windows PC or a Mac. Now, because of a proliferation of different computing forms with the rise of mobile devices, the debate has shifted toward whether to buy a computer or a tablet \u2014 and which operating system on top of that.", "Then there are the different types of software and tools that students use, like flashcard apps or readers for digital textbooks, some of which are for mobile devices and others for computers.", "To make back-to-school season easier, parents should have a conversation with their children about what devices and which operating system to buy based on their student\u2019s area of studies and the apps they use.", "I also compiled a guide to some of the best back-to-school products, including computers, mobile devices, audio accessories and food gadgets. The list was curated after testing dozens of products and interviewing five college students about the tools that help them do homework and get through cramming sessions. (While this list focuses on college students, many of whom will be getting their own computers for the first time, some items would also be a good fit for high schoolers.)", "The students I polled were split on whether a laptop or tablet would be the best study tool. In general, students in science-oriented fields would probably benefit from a laptop, which can handle multitasking more easily and run more powerful apps than tablets. For designers and liberal arts majors who are using more lightweight apps for writing essays or drawing sketches, a tablet may be a better fit.", "For students in science-oriented fields, like Ms. Arreola, the $899 MacBook Air stood out as the most versatile and convenient computer. It can run both the Mac and Windows operating systems, weighs only 2.4 pounds and has at least nine hours of battery life. It also has an excellent keyboard and ports for plugging in accessories like a display, mouse or phone charger.", "For those seeking a tablet, devices like the $599 iPad Pro or $499 Microsoft Surface 3 should work well. The ability to remove the keyboard for reading digital books or to use a stylus to make drawings would come in handy on either of these devices.", "Chances are that your son or daughter already has a smartphone, given that on average, children are getting their first smartphones at age 10. But if they have a hand-me-down, four-year-old iPhone or Android device, it may be a good time to get a speedier, more capable phone.", "The best ones on the market come from Apple and Samsung Electronics: the iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S7. Which one you pick should partly depend on your child\u2019s computing device, since iPhones are more tightly integrated with Apple devices and Android devices generally mesh better with Windows computers.", "There are two caveats. First, Apple is expected to release a brand-new iPhone this fall; so if you go the Apple route, it would be wise to wait a few months. Second, these are high-end phones that cost roughly $700, which could easily blow your budget.", "If price is a concern, there are plenty of excellent lower-tier smartphones. The iPhone SE, which has most of the same guts as the iPhone 6s but a smaller 4-inch screen, is a solid option at $399. For Android devices, I like Huawei\u2019s Nexus 6P, which also costs $399. It has a nice look and feel and works with Project Fi, Google\u2019s low-cost cellular service.", "With the amount of shuffling around that students do on campus, I also recommend a battery pack to give smartphones more juice throughout the day. Anker\u2019s PowerCore Slim 5000, about $20, is affordable and provides about two full charges to a smartphone in a compact battery pack.", "High-quality audio gear is a sound investment for students. Roommates can be loud distractions from schoolwork and sleep, plus a bit of music can ease the pain of typing out a tedious essay.", "That makes it worthwhile to invest in a pair of noise-canceling headphones. My favorite set is the Bose QuietComfort 35. They are wireless, comfortable and extremely effective at filtering out noise, plus they sound great. At $350, they are pricey but will provide comfort and nice sound for many years.", "Another useful audio device is the $180 Amazon Echo, the internet-connected speaker that responds to voice commands. It can stream music from services like Spotify and Pandora and also dictate a student\u2019s calendar events. When set up with an internet-connected power outlet, like TP-Link\u2019s Smart Plug, the Echo could even be used to turn on an electric kettle for boiling water for tea or coffee first thing in the morning, if you say, \u201cAlexa, turn on the kettle.\u201d", "Speaking of water kettles, a food gadget or two will not go amiss in students\u2019 lives, especially if the devices offer a shortcut to downing some caffeine or gobbling up ramen.", "A great electric kettle for quickly boiling water is Bonavita\u2019s $55 BV3825B Gooseneck. The stainless steel kettle can boil up to a liter of water and has a long gooseneck spout that lets you smoothly pour water into a teapot, french press or cup of noodles.", "For a fast and inexpensive gadget to make coffee, check out the $30 AeroPress. You place the AeroPress chamber on a mug, add one scoop of ground coffee, add hot water and plunge the coffee through a filter into the mug. It makes cheap coffee taste delicious.", "For heating up food, I recommend a toaster oven instead of a microwave. A well-made toaster oven is not only capable of heating up microwave dinners, but it can also toast bagels and leftover slices of pizza or even roast a chicken leg. Breville\u2019s $150 Mini Smart Oven evenly heats up foods and will get students through times of desperation.", "In the end, it\u2019s up to students to use their imaginations to get the most out of their back-to-school gear.

On Facebook, they rival the reach of their better-funded counterparts in the political media, whether corporate giants like CNN or The New York Times, or openly ideological web operations like Breitbart or Mic. And unlike traditional media organizations, which have spent years trying to figure out how to lure readers out of the Facebook ecosystem and onto their sites, these new publishers are happy to live inside the world that Facebook has created. Their pages are accommodated but not actively courted by the company and are not a major part of its public messaging about media. But they are, perhaps, the purest expression of Facebook\u2019s design and of the incentives coded into its algorithm \u2014 a system that has already reshaped the web and has now inherited, for better or for worse, a great deal of America\u2019s political discourse.", "In 2006, when Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college to run his rapidly expanding start-up, Mark Provost was a student at Rogers State University in Claremore, Okla., and going through a rough patch. He had transferred restlessly between schools, and he was taking his time to graduate; a stock-picking hobby that grew into a promising source of income had fallen apart. His outlook was further darkened by the financial crisis and by the years of personal unemployment that followed. When the Occupy movement began, he quickly got on board. It was only then, when Facebook was closing in on its billionth user, that he joined the network.", "Now 36, Provost helps run US Uncut, a left-leaning Facebook page and website with more than 1.5 million followers, about as many as MSNBC has, from his apartment in Philadelphia.

This strange new class of media organization slots seamlessly into the news feed and is especially notable in what it asks, or doesn\u2019t ask, of its readers. The point is not to get them to click on more stories or to engage further with a brand. The point is to get them to share the post that\u2019s right in front of them. Everything else is secondary.", "While web publishers have struggled to figure out how to take advantage of Facebook\u2019s audience, these pages have thrived. Unburdened of any allegiance to old forms of news media and the practice, or performance, of any sort of ideological balance, native Facebook page publishers have a freedom that more traditional publishers don\u2019t: to engage with Facebook purely on its terms. These are professional Facebook users straining to build media companies, in other words, not the other way around.", "From a user\u2019s point of view, every share, like or comment is both an act of speech and an accretive piece of a public identity.

Many more people simply want to share specific beliefs, to tell people what they think or, just as important, what they don\u2019t.

But even better is a headline, or meme, that skips straight to an ideological conclusion or rebuts an argument.", "Rafael Rivero is an acquaintance of Provost\u2019s who, with his twin brother, Omar, runs a page called Occupy Democrats, which passed three million followers in June. This accelerating growth is attributed by Rivero, and by nearly every left-leaning page operator I spoke with, not just to interest in the election but especially to one campaign in particular: \u201cBernie Sanders is the Facebook candidate,\u201d Rivero says. The rise of Occupy Democrats essentially mirrored the rise of Sanders\u2019s primary run. On his page, Rivero started quoting text from Sanders\u2019s frequent email blasts, turning them into Facebook-ready memes with a consistent aesthetic: colors that pop, yellow on black. Rivero says that it\u2019s clear what his audience wants. \u201cI\u2019ve probably made 10,000 graphics, and it\u2019s like running 10,000 focus groups,\u201d he said.

Audiences grow quickly on Facebook but can disappear even more quickly; in the case of left-leaning pages, many had accumulated followings not just by speaking to Sanders supporters but also by being intensely critical, and often utterly dismissive, of Clinton.", "Now that the nomination contest is over, Rivero has turned to making anti-Trump content. A post from earlier this month got straight to the point: \u201cDonald Trump is unqualified, unstable and unfit to lead. Share if you agree!\u201d More than 40,000 people did.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like a meme war,\u201d Rivero says, \u201cand politics is being won and lost on social media.\u201d", "In retrospect, Facebook\u2019s takeover of online media looks rather like a slow-motion coup. Before social media, web publishers could draw an audience one of two ways: through a dedicated readership visiting its home page or through search engines. By 2009, this had started to change. Facebook had more than 300 million users, primarily accessing the service through desktop browsers, and publishers soon learned that a widely shared link could produce substantial traffic. In 2010, Facebook released widgets that publishers could embed on their sites, reminding readers to share, and these tools were widely deployed. By late 2012, when Facebook passed a billion users, referrals from the social network were sending visitors to publishers\u2019 websites at rates sometimes comparable to Google, the web\u2019s previous de facto distribution hub. Publishers took note of what worked on Facebook and adjusted accordingly.", "This was, for most news organizations, a boon. The flood of visitors aligned with two core goals of most media companies: to reach people and to make money. But as Facebook\u2019s growth continued, its influence was intensified by broader trends in internet use, primarily the use of smartphones, on which Facebook became more deeply enmeshed with users\u2019 daily routines. Soon, it became clear that Facebook wasn\u2019t just a source of readership; it was, increasingly, where readers lived.", "Facebook, from a publisher\u2019s perspective, had seized the web\u2019s means of distribution by popular demand. A new reality set in, as a social-media network became an intermediary between publishers and their audiences. For media companies, the ability to reach an audience is fundamentally altered, made greater in some ways and in others more challenging. For a dedicated Facebook user, a vast array of sources, spanning multiple media and industries, is now processed through the same interface and sorting mechanism, alongside updates from friends, family, brands and celebrities.", "From the start, some publishers cautiously regarded Facebook as a resource to be used only to the extent that it supported their existing businesses, wary of giving away more than they might get back. Others embraced it more fully, entering into formal partnerships for revenue sharing and video production, as The New York Times has done. Some new-media start-ups, most notably BuzzFeed, have pursued a comprehensively Facebook-centric production-and-distribution strategy. All have eventually run up against the same reality: A company that can claim nearly every internet-using adult as a user is less a partner than a context \u2014 a self-contained marketplace to which you have been granted access but which functions according to rules and incentives that you cannot control.", "The news feed is designed, in Facebook\u2019s public messaging, to \u201cshow people the stories most relevant to them\u201d and ranks stories \u201cso that what\u2019s most important to each person shows up highest in their news feeds.\u201d It is a framework built around personal connections and sharing, where value is both expressed and conferred through the concept of engagement. Of course, engagement, in one form or another, is what media businesses have always sought, and provocation has always sold news. But now the incentives are literalized in buttons and written into software.", "Any sufficiently complex system will generate a wide variety of results, some expected, some not; some desired, others less so. On July 31, a Facebook page called Make America Great posted its final story of the day. \u201cNo Media Is Telling You About the Muslim Who Attacked Donald Trump, So We Will ...,\u201d read the headline, next to a small avatar of a pointing and yelling Trump. The story was accompanied by a photo of Khizr Khan, the father of a slain American soldier. Khan spoke a few days earlier at the Democratic National Convention, delivering a searing speech admonishing Trump for his comments about Muslims. Khan, pocket Constitution in hand, was juxtaposed with the logo of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. \u201cIt is a sad day in America,\u201d the caption read, \u201cwhere we the people must expose the TRUTH because the media is in the tank for 1 Presidential Candidate!\u201d", "Readers who clicked through to the story were led to an external website, called Make America Great Today, where they were presented with a brief write-up blended almost seamlessly into a solid wall of fleshy ads.

A credit link beneath the story led to a similar-looking site called Conservative Post, from which the story\u2019s text was pulled verbatim. Conservative Post had apparently sourced its story from a longer post on a right-wing site called Shoebat.com.", "Within 24 hours, the post was shared more than 3,500 times, collecting a further 3,000 reactions \u2014 thumbs-up likes, frowning emoji, angry emoji \u2014 as well as 850 comments, many lengthy and virtually all impassioned. A modest success. Each day, according to Facebook\u2019s analytics, posts from the Make America Great page are seen by 600,000 to 1.7 million people. In July, articles posted to the page, which has about 450,000 followers, were shared, commented on or liked more than four million times, edging out, for example, the Facebook page of USA Today.", "Make America Great, which inhabits the fuzzy margins of the political Facebook page ecosystem, is owned and operated by a 35-year-old online marketer named Adam Nicoloff. He started the page in August 2015 and runs it from his home outside St. Louis. Previously, Nicoloff provided web services and marketing help for local businesses; before that, he worked in restaurants. Today he has shifted his focus to Facebook pages and websites that he administers himself. Make America Great was his first foray into political pages, and it quickly became the most successful in a portfolio that includes men\u2019s lifestyle and parenting.", "Nicoloff\u2019s business model is not dissimilar from the way most publishers use Facebook: build a big following, post links to articles on an outside website covered in ads and then hope the math works out in your favor. For many, it doesn\u2019t: Content is expensive, traffic is unpredictable and website ads are both cheap and alienating to readers. But as with most of these Facebook-native pages, Nicoloff\u2019s content costs comparatively little, and the sheer level of interest in Trump and in the type of inflammatory populist rhetoric he embraces has helped tip Nicoloff\u2019s system of advertising arbitrage into serious profitability. In July, visitors arriving to Nicoloff\u2019s website produced a little more than $30,000 in revenue. His costs, he said, total around $8,000, partly split between website hosting fees and advertising buys on Facebook itself.", "Then, of course, there\u2019s the content, which, at a few dozen posts a day, Nicoloff is far too busy to produce himself. \u201cI have two people in the Philippines who post for me,\u201d Nicoloff said, \u201ca husband-and-wife combo.\u201d From 9 a.m. Eastern time to midnight, the contractors scour the internet for viral political stories, many explicitly pro-Trump. If something seems to be going viral elsewhere, it is copied to their site and promoted with an urgent headline. (The Khan story was posted at the end of the shift, near midnight Eastern time, or just before noon in Manila.) The resulting product is raw and frequently jarring, even by the standards of this campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s No Way I\u2019ll Send My Kids to Public School to Be Brainwashed by the LGBT Lobby,\u201d read one headline, linking to an essay ripped from Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze; \u201cAlert: UN Backs Secret Obama Takeover of Police; Here\u2019s What We Know ...,\u201d read another, copied from a site called The Federalist Papers Project. In the end, Nicoloff takes home what he jokingly described as a \u201cdoctor\u2019s salary\u201d \u2014 in a good month, more than $20,000.", "Terry Littlepage, an internet marketer based in Las Cruces, N.M., has taken this model even further. He runs a collection of about 50 politically themed Facebook pages with names like The American Patriot and My Favorite Gun, which push visitors to a half-dozen external websites, stocked with content aggregated by a team of freelancers. He estimates that he spends about a thousand dollars a day advertising his pages on Facebook; as a result, they have more than 10 million followers. In a good month, Littlepage\u2019s properties bring in $60,000.", "Nicoloff and Littlepage say that Trump has been good for business, but each admits to some discomfort. Nicoloff, a conservative, says that there were other candidates he preferred during the Republican primaries but that he had come around to the nominee. Littlepage is also a recent convert. During the primaries, he was a Cruz supporter, and he even tried making some left-wing pages on Facebook but discovered that they just didn\u2019t make him as much money.", "In their angry, cascading comment threads, Make America Great\u2019s followers express no such ambivalence. Nearly every page operator I spoke to was astonished by the tone their commenters took, comparing them to things like torch-wielding mobs and sharks in a feeding frenzy. No doubt because of the page\u2019s name, some Trump supporters even mistake Nicoloff\u2019s page for an official organ of the campaign. Nicoloff says that he receives dozens of messages a day from Trump supporters, expecting or hoping to reach the man himself. Many, he says, are simply asking for money.", "Many of these political news pages will likely find their cachet begin to evaporate after Nov. 8. But one company, the Liberty Alliance, may have found a way to create something sustainable and even potentially transformational, almost entirely within the ecosystem of Facebook. The Georgia-based firm was founded by Brandon Vallorani, formerly of Answers in Genesis, the organization that opened a museum in Kentucky promoting a literal biblical creation narrative. Today the Liberty Alliance has around 100 sites in its network, and about 150 Facebook pages, according to Onan Coca, the company\u2019s 36-year-old editor in chief. He estimates their cumulative follower count to be at least 50 million. Among the company\u2019s partners are the former congressman Allen West, the 2008 election personality Joe the Plumber, the conservative actor Kirk Cameron and the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Victoria Jackson. Then there are Liberty\u2019s countless news-oriented pages, which together have become an almost ubiquitous presence on right-leaning political Facebook in the last few years. Their names are instructive and evocative: Eagle Rising; Fighting for Trump; Patriot Tribune; Revive America; US Herald; The Last Resistance.", "A dozen or so of the sites are published in-house, but posts from the company\u2019s small team of writers are free to be shared among the entire network. The deal for a would-be Liberty Alliance member is this: You bring the name and the audience, and the company will build you a prefab site, furnish it with ads, help you fill it with content and keep a cut of the revenue. Coca told me the company brought in $12 million in revenue last year. (The company declined to share documentation further corroborating his claims about followers and revenue.)", "Because the pages are run independently, the editorial product is varied. But it is almost universally tuned to the cadences and styles that seem to work best on partisan Facebook. It also tracks closely to conservative Facebook media\u2019s big narratives, which, in turn, track with the Trump campaign\u2019s messaging: Hillary Clinton is a crook and possibly mentally unfit; ISIS is winning; Black Lives Matter is the real racist movement; Donald Trump alone can save us; the system \u2014 all of it \u2014 is rigged. Whether the Liberty Alliance succeeds or fails will depend, at least in part, on Facebook\u2019s algorithm. Systemic changes to the ecosystem arrive through algorithmic adjustments, and the company recently adjusted the news feed to \u201cfurther reduce clickbait headlines.\u201d", "For now, the network hums along, mostly beneath the surface. A post from a Liberty Alliance page might find its way in front of a left-leaning user who might disagree with it or find it offensive, and who might choose to engage with the friend who posted it directly. But otherwise, such news exists primarily within the feeds of the already converted, its authorship obscured, its provenance unclear, its veracity questionable. It\u2019s an environment that\u2019s at best indifferent and at worst hostile to traditional media brands; but for this new breed of page operator, it\u2019s mostly upside. In front of largely hidden and utterly sympathetic audiences, incredible narratives can take shape, before emerging, mostly formed, into the national discourse.", "Consider the trajectory of a post from August, from a Facebook page called Patriotic Folks, the headline of which read, \u201cSpread This: Media Rigging the Polls, Hiding New Evidence Proving Trump Is Winning.\u201d The article cited a litany of social-media statistics highlighting Trump\u2019s superior engagement numbers, among them Trump\u2019s Facebook following, which is nearly twice as large as Clinton\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the lying media \u2014 the only legitimate attack they have left is Trump\u2019s poll numbers,\u201d it said. \u201cSocial media proves the GOP nominee has strong foundation and a firm backing.\u201d The story spread across this right-wing Facebook ecosystem, eventually finding its way to Breitbart and finally to Sean Hannity\u2019s \u201cMorning Minute,\u201d where he read through the statistics to his audience.", "Before Hannity signed off, he posed a question: \u201cSo, does that mean anything?\u201d It\u2019s a version of the question that everyone wants to answer about Facebook and politics, which is whether the site\u2019s churning political warfare is actually changing minds \u2014 or, for that matter, beginning to change the political discourse as a whole. How much of what happens on the platform is a reflection of a political mood and widely held beliefs, simply captured in a new medium, and how much of it might be created, or intensified, by the environment it provides? What is Facebook doing to our politics?", "Appropriately, the answer to this question can be chosen and shared on Facebook in whichever way you prefer. You might share this story from The New York Times Magazine, wondering aloud to your friends whether our democracy has been fundamentally altered by this publishing-and-advertising platform of unprecedented scale. Or you might just relax and find some memes to share from one of countless pages that will let you air your political id. But for the page operators, the question is irrelevant to the task at hand. Facebook\u2019s primacy is a foregone conclusion, and the question of Facebook\u2019s relationship to political discourse is absurd \u2014 they\u2019re one and the same.

Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.", "Tensions have escalated in the industry in recent months as some ride-hailing companies have worked to figure out what to do with their most expensive operations.

One example: terrorism.", "I tested how anxiety searches changed after the five largest recent terrorist attacks in the European Union \u2014 Madrid, London, Paris, Brussels and Nice \u2014 each of which killed or injured more than 100 people. In the weeks that followed, there was no rise in anxiety searches in the country that was attacked. I also tested whether anxiety searches rose in Boston after the marathon bombing. They didn\u2019t. Ditto for Orlando, Fla. after the nightclub shooting.", "Of course, it may be that terrorist attacks terrify people without making them Google about their anxiety, but it still surprised me.", "Another potential source of anxiety that doesn\u2019t pop up in the data: Donald J. Trump. Many people, I assumed, are anxious over the prospect that Mr. Trump could become president of the United States. And I thought they would express this anxiety through Google. However, while anxiety searches have continued their decade-long rise this year, there was no noticeable change in this trend as the prospect of Mr. Trump\u2019s actually winning became more plausible. Nor have Democratic-leaning parts of the country witnessed an unusually large rise in anxiety searches.", "I also thought Mr. Trump\u2019s fear-mongering was helping to create fear. Anxiety must have risen after Mr. Trump\u2019s dystopian acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, right? Not so. There was no increase in searches related to anxiety or panic attacks.", "In fact, the data suggest that fear-mongering politicians may not create all that much anxiety. Consider the 2004 presidential election between George W. Bush and John Kerry, in which the incumbent continually emphasized the threat of terrorism. I compared anxiety searches in the summer and fall of 2004 in swing states and non-swing states. Swing states, where advertising was concentrated, would have been exposed to far more fear-based messages. But they did not show more anxiety or panic attacks.", "I did find two factors that cause anxiety. The first \u2014 and this is hardly a surprise \u2014 is a major recession. States that were more deeply affected by the Great Recession saw bigger increases in anxiety during and after the recession. I estimate that each percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with a 1.4 percent increase in anxiety.", "The second was not something I had thought about, so let me explain how I even stumbled upon the possibility. Google Correlate is a service that makes data available to researchers so that they can test which searches are most frequently made in the weeks a particular search is made. For example, at certain times of year, when people are searching a lot for \u201csweaters,\u201d Google Correlate tells us they are also searching for \u201cscarves,\u201d \u201cfleece pajama pants\u201d and \u201chot cocoa.\u201d", "A few weeks ago, I put \u201cpanic attack\u201d in Google Correlate, and one of the highest correlated search queries was \u201copiate withdrawal.\u201d Panic attacks are a known symptom of opiate withdrawal, although looking at the striking correlations here, I wonder if they may be an even more common symptom than we had realized.", "The places with high opiate prescription rates \u2014 and high search rates for opiate withdrawal \u2014 are among the places with the highest search rates for panic attacks. These areas include Appalachia and the South.", "During years in which many people complained of opiate withdrawal, many people also complained about panic attacks. Interestingly, searches for opiate withdrawal and panic attack have continued to rise over the past few years, even as opiate prescription rates have finally fallen.", "Searches for opiate withdrawal consistently start high at the beginning of the year. They mostly drop through the year, although they rise in the summer and then surge around Christmas. New Year\u2019s resolutions and doctor vacation schedules may play roles in these patterns. Searches for panic attacks follow a similar pattern, although there is less of a rise around Christmas.", "To be honest, I still don\u2019t know what to make of this huge rise in anxiety-related searches. I have a lot of questions. Has fear of a black president contributed? Is anxiety contagious \u2014 if someone loses her job and gets anxious, are her kids and friends likely to become more anxious as well? Is anxiety subject to tipping points and bubbles? How much of a role is the return of heroin playing in the rise of panic attacks?", "Before I look into this further, though, I will take a break from working and instead indulge in my own favorite 2016 habit.

The Times-Picayune of New Orleans cut printing to three days a week, while The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is online only.

At The Herald, there were two newsrooms, one for the newspaper and one for the web.", "The division created a rift.

It rankled more seasoned veterans in the print newsroom, who lamented the shift away from weightier topics like the domestic economy and global politics.", "\u201cIt was viewed that online there was a lot more Paris Hilton than Paris, France, and that to win online you needed to be a tabloid newspaper,\u201d said Mark Scott, a former Fairfax executive who most recently served as chief executive of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThe Herald\u2019s strength had always been its great quality, broadsheet traditions.\u201d", "The newsrooms were eventually merged and the website now takes a somewhat more balanced approach.

Its big bets on residential solar and on a national charging network for electric vehicles were ahead of their time and fizzled.", "The shale and fracking booms in the United States made natural gas cheap and abundant, pulling down the price of electricity and making power sources that NRG still depends on heavily \u2014 including coal, nuclear and renewables \u2014 less profitable. Investors lost faith in the company, NRG\u2019s stock plummeted, and its previous chief executive was summarily fired, replaced by Mr. Gutierrez.", "Far from emerging as an industry pioneer, NRG has become a cautionary tale. A power-hungry nation needs to change the way it is fueled, but as NRG shows, transitioning to clean power is messy business.", "\u201cThe power producers and utilities are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d said Aron Cramer, C.E.O. of Business for Social Responsibility, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of road kill in the midst of this transition to a lower-carbon energy system.\u201d", "No two companies face the exact same set of challenges. But at some level, the quandary preoccupying NRG is one that all power producers and utilities will ultimately face: how to make more electricity while emitting fewer greenhouse gases.", "NRG wasn\u2019t always a clean-energy proponent. Until recently, it was just another power producer, burning fossil fuels to electrify the grid.", "In 2003, it tapped David Crane to be its chief executive. Mr. Crane, who previously ran a traditional London-based power company, set about expanding NRG\u2019s core business. He acquired Reliant Energy, which sells electricity to homes and businesses in Texas, as well as GenOn Energy, a rival based in Houston. These moves vastly expanded NRG\u2019s scale, and its emissions.", "By 2006, Mr. Crane began to respond to the climate crisis and became one of the country\u2019s most unlikely environmentalists.", "At first, he made modest changes. NRG bought a wind power company, which it later sold. Soon, though, Mr. Crane made large investments in wind and solar plants and spent heavily on pet projects like a national network of electric-car charging stations.", "Seemingly overnight, the fossil fuels executive became a champion of renewable energy. He wanted to turn the hub-and-spoke utility model \u2014 with big power plants sending electricity out to homes and businesses \u2014 inside out.", "Instead, in Mr. Crane\u2019s vision, solar panels and wind turbines would blanket the country, heralding an era of distributed energy production. He called environmental protection a \u201cmoral imperative.\u201d Last year, NRG said it would slash carbon emissions in half by 2030 and reduce them by 90 percent by 2050.", "\u201cIt\u2019s the destiny of NRG to be a leader,\u201d Mr. Crane said at the groundbreaking of the new headquarters, \u201cto create a more sustainable and prosperous future while winning the fight against climate change.\u201d", "Mr. Crane was channeling the spirit of the time. In December, world leaders in Paris pledged to combat climate change. The United States said it would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than a quarter in 10 years. With wind and solar power cheaper than ever and consumers starting to embrace energy-saving technologies, these targets could be within reach.", "But the climate crisis won\u2019t be solved with more Teslas alone. If the goals set in Paris are to be met, big electricity producers like NRG will need to reduce emissions while increasing power production. So Mr. Crane set about trying to retool NRG\u2019s fleet of dirty power plants while building a new generation of utility-scale wind and solar projects.", "NRG\u2019s dual personality \u2014 fossil fuel giant and clean energy pioneer \u2014 is on display at two relatively new facilities on opposite ends of the country.", "Just south of Los Angeles International Airport, four smokestacks punctuate the sandy coastline. There in one form or another since the 1950s, they are part of the El Segundo Energy Center, which produces enough electricity to power nearly 450,000 homes.", "At first glance, it is just another power plant burning cheap and abundant natural gas. Yet the El Segundo plant is among the most sophisticated of its kind. The two operational units, which came online in 2013, replaced inefficient relics constructed a half-century ago. Wastewater is recycled, emissions controls minimize the production of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, and a mix of combustion and steam turbines greatly enhance the amount of energy derived from the gas.", "And perhaps most critically, the El Segundo Energy Center is only occasionally generating power.", "A generation ago, it operated almost constantly, feeding the vast energy needs of Los Angeles. But over the last several years, big power companies \u2014 including NRG \u2014 have constructed enormous solar power plants in Southern California, supplying a growing share of daytime electricity.", "When the sun is shining, NRG\u2019s new high-tech gas-fired power plant is often dormant, coming alive only when demand ramps up and the sun has dimmed. In that sense, the El Segundo plant is a big leap forward. Yet the very need to pour millions of dollars into retrofitting this gas-fired plant on the picturesque shore of the Pacific Ocean shows just how much work has yet to be done.", "Across the country, in Spencer, Mass., NRG is putting the final touches on a community solar project on the grounds of St. Joseph\u2019s Abbey, a Trappist monastery. There, on rolling green hills near the monks\u2019 quarters, hundreds of hard-hatted workers are busy erecting thousands of solar panels.", "The electricity generated from those panels will flow through new transmission lines, which were required because the existing grid infrastructure could not handle the influx of solar energy. The project will power about 2,000 nearby homes, which should have lower and more reliable electricity bills.", "By NRG\u2019s standards, the solar plant is relatively small, but more are in the works. With enough such plants on the grid, they could help NRG achieve its ambitious emissions reductions targets.", "This is exactly the kind of change that Mr. Crane championed. And yet he is no longer the chief executive of NRG. He was abruptly fired in December, after NRG stock plummeted 63 percent in a year.", "Earnings fell as cheap natural gas made NRG\u2019s coal-fired plants less competitive, and investors had grown weary of Mr. Crane\u2019s focus on clean energy. Even as NRG\u2019s core business was losing money, Mr. Crane devoted much of his quarterly earnings calls to discussions about clean-power projects.", "\u201cWe all believe in renewables,\u201d said Shahriar Pourreza, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. \u201cBut there was such a change in the message of the company that investors lost confidence in the management team.\u201d", "The NRG board named the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Mr. Gutierrez, as the new leader. He had grown up in Mexico City, where electricity was sometimes spotty. Mr. Gutierrez joined his family\u2019s engineering company, then worked for Dynegy, a power producer in Houston, before joining NRG. Yet he says that like his predecessor, he is committed to environmental stewardship.", "He drives a red Tesla and uses a Nest thermostat to remotely manage the temperature in his solar-paneled home in New Jersey. A Catholic, Mr. Gutierrez says he draws motivation from Pope Francis, who last year released \u201cLaudato Si,\u201d an encyclical on the environment.", "\u201cWhen a spiritual leader like the pope calls out our moral responsibility toward the environment, it\u2019s a pretty big thing,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cIt transcends science and policy.\u201d", "He was engaged in efforts to combat climate change well before Paris. As Mr. Crane\u2019s C.O.O., he led an NRG task force that recommended that the company adopt ambitious targets for emissions reduction. Mr. Gutierrez recently recommitted to those goals. \u201cRenewables is something that\u2019s very important for our portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good business.\u201d", "Mr. Gutierrez has a tricky balancing act. He must appease demanding investors and a skittish board, which most likely means reining in some of Mr. Crane\u2019s clean-energy ventures. Yet he must also fill the shoes of a chief executive who had raised hopes among environmentalists that a big energy producer was getting serious about climate change. He must profitably manage gas and coal assets \u2014 which still make up most of the company\u2019s power generation, sales and profits \u2014 while also preparing for a future that is more dependent on solar and wind.", "Analysts are pleased with Mr. Gutierrez\u2019s performance so far. He has simplified the corporate structure, played down some of Mr. Crane\u2019s side projects and focused on the balance sheet. NRG shares have risen 40 percent since Mr. Gutierrez took over.", "\u201cWith the old management, there was such a change in message, the company started to lose credibility,\u201d Mr. Pourreza said. \u201cMauricio is leading this company in the right direction.\u201d", "But how NRG will actually achieve vast reductions in its carbon footprint is unclear. As long as it is burning so much gas and coal, it will remain a major emitter of greenhouse gases. And while Mr. Gutierrez speaks hopefully of developments in carbon-capture technology and utility-scale battery storage, practical solutions remain elusive. \u201cDo we have a perfect line of sight on how we\u2019re going to get there? No,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we have a road map? Yes.\u201d", "Complicating matters, the Obama administration\u2019s signature effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector \u2014 the Clean Power Plan \u2014 is tied up in the courts. (NRG was among the companies that petitioned the E.P.A. to modify the plan, arguing that it made the power sector too reliant on natural gas.) The ambiguous fate of that plan has added regulatory uncertainty to an industry already in flux.", "\u201cYou have these goals set in Paris, you have a framework for getting there through the Clean Power Plan, and you have the judicial branch saying stop,\u201d said Ralph Izzo, chief executive of Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey utility. \u201cYou can\u2019t make economic decisions in that environment.\u201d", "Even NRG\u2019s big renewable projects \u2014 installations that are supposed to one day replace coal- and gas-fired plants \u2014 are mired in problems. In the Southern California desert, NRG oversees operations at Ivanpah, the world\u2019s largest solar thermal installation, where thousands of mirrors reflect the sun at enormous towers and water is converted to steam that powers turbines. NRG owns the plant along with BrightSource Energy and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.", "Heralded as a beacon of clean energy when it opened in 2014, Ivanpah has been continually troubled.", "From the outset, it produced less electricity than expected. Over the last few years, the cost of solar panels fell sharply, making Ivanpah\u2019s power comparatively expensive. In March, the consortium that owns the plant nearly defaulted on a contract with Pacific Gas & Electric, the Northern California utility.", "Then in May, a fire at the plant knocked out one of the towers, raising new questions about the project\u2019s viability. Last week, when NRG reported quarterly earnings, it said that revenue from its renewables businesses was down 14 percent to $57 million, largely the result of problems at Ivanpah.", "This isn\u2019t the first time that a big energy company has made ambitious plans to become a leader in green energy, only to be reined in. In 2000, BP introduced its \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d tagline and began investing heavily in renewable energy. It committed billions of dollars to wind and solar projects, and made investments in carbon capture and biofuels.", "After a decade of investment, BP largely backed off its renewables program. Most of its money was still coming from oil and gas, and the company set about selling its solar and wind power assets. They simply weren\u2019t profitable enough.", "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to recall that 10 years ago BP was one of the darlings of the green movement,\u201d said Justin Adams, managing director of global lands for the Nature Conservancy and a former executive at BP working on renewables.", "\u201cThrough that period, some investors were interested, most were ambivalent at best and some downright skeptical at worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat on earth was BP doing, taking its eyes off its core business and tinkering around with renewables?\u201d", "At NRG, Mr. Gutierrez has already backed away from residential solar and electric-vehicle charging projects that Mr. Crane held so dear. So far, however, there are no signs that NRG will completely reverse course. Mr. Gutierrez is still pushing community solar power, and NRG provides solar installations to big companies like Whole Foods. Last week, NRG spent nearly $200 million to acquire more solar and wind assets.", "Today, NRG generates about 9 percent of its electricity from renewable assets, up from less than 1 percent in 2008, and that figure is likely to grow. Across the industry, a majority of power plants being built today use renewables, not fossil fuels.", "Mr. Crane has not gone quietly into the night. In a letter to NRG employees shortly after his ouster, he said there was \u201cno growth in our sector outside of clean energy; only slow but irreversible contraction following the path of fixed-line telephony.\u201d Soon after that, he wrote a blog post titled \u201cIf I Was Right, Why Was I Fired?\u201d", "\u201cThe sad moral of this story is that it\u2019s very hard to be a C.E.O. for tomorrow, when the markets only care about being a C.E.O. for today,\u201d said Mr. Cramer of Business for Social Responsibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really questions his vision, but he wasn\u2019t given any opportunity to put it into action.\u201d", "Mr. Gutierrez says he shares his predecessor\u2019s vision. By 2050, he envisions enormous batteries storing solar power generated during the day, allowing people to use it at night. Distributed energy will be more common, as Mr. Crane predicted. Carbon-capture technology will make the burning of fossil fuels much less environmentally destructive, Mr. Gutierrez hopes. Perhaps coal-fired power plants will be gone altogether.", "\u201cWe are a part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are also a big part of the solution.\u201d", "It\u2019s an appealing vision of a green energy system, one that could fulfill the needs of an electricity-hungry world without spoiling the environment. But how NRG gets there \u2014 especially with investors and a board that seem intolerant of bold steps \u2014 remains vague at best. For now, Mr. Gutierrez is caught in the middle: hoping to arrive at a cleaner future while still satisfying today\u2019s investors, rolling out fields of solar while also burning tons of gas and coal.", "\u201cLet\u2019s all acknowledge that we can\u2019t change our energy system overnight,\u201d Mr. Cramer said. \u201cBut how do we start making meaningful progress?

The initiative, called Global Fishing Watch, uses satellite data to analyze fishing boat practices \u2014 including larger trends and information on individual vessels.", "From a young age, Mr. Auerbach had romantic notions about fishing, specifically the idea of catching fish to feed his family and neighbors.", "\u201cIt\u2019s cool in this day and age that people wake up in the morning and go make a living interacting with nature and feeding their community,\u201d he said. He went into commercial fishing straight out of college, taking a job on an Alaskan salmon boat and later returning to New England to work on lobster boats and learn more about the fishing industry there.", "Soon after Mr. Auerbach founded Red\u2019s Best in 2008, he realized that a combination of government regulations and commercial fishing\u2019s embrace of technology were effectively threatening the existence of small fishing boats. Yet smaller boats travel short distances and catch fewer fish, which Mr. Auerbach said improves their quality.", "\u201cWe try to push people to eat local, traceable fish,\u201d he said.", "Like most other seafood distributors, he was relying on an antiquated, four-part carbon copy system that was so cumbersome, he was routinely shuffling paperwork until 2 a.m.", "\u201cThe boat would get a copy at the point of unloading,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. \u201cThe government would get a copy. I\u2019d file a copy. And then I\u2019d write in the prices.\u201d As for paying the fishermen: \u201cI\u2019d have to get checks and then match the checks to the paperwork and mail them. It was an absolute nightmare that wasn\u2019t scalable.\u201d", "Now the Red\u2019s Best software does that work. For instance, a company driver backs a truck down to the long wooden pier in Woods Hole, Mass., each afternoon, so that fishermen can load their bluefish, striped bass, bonito, conch, horseshoe crabs and other seafood. But instead of a thick pad of paper and carbon sheets, the driver wields a waterproof wireless computer tablet with a Bluetooth mobile printer.", "\u201cHe\u2019s putting their catch data directly onto the internet, and our whole staff all over the country can see in real time as fish is being unloaded onto our truck,\u201d Mr. Auerbach said. When the fish arrives at Red\u2019s Best\u2019s Boston plant, it is instantly received into inventory and reported to the federal government.", "The company affixes a traceability label on each box of fish. The label has a two-dimensional bar code that can be scanned by smartphones to reveal who caught the fish, where and how. A unique web page is automatically created for that fish. Buyers, typically high-end wholesalers throughout the country, and their customers can scan the code to learn the story behind the fish.", "Mr. Auerbach, who has 100 employees, projects the company will sell 20 million pounds of seafood this year, caught almost exclusively by 1,000 small vessels.", "Eventually, Red\u2019s Best hopes to sell directly to consumers. \u201cLike, a bluefin tuna is being unloaded right this second in Provincetown, Mass., and you buy a pound of it to be delivered to your home tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI want that tuna sold as deep into the supply chain as possible.\u201d", "By that he means ideally the fish will travel from the company\u2019s Boston hub directly to home cooks\u2019 refrigerators. Currently, people can buy Red\u2019s Best fish at its store at the Boston Public Market, at several farmers\u2019 markets, or shipped through AmazonFresh and, starting last week, FedEx.", "\u201cI got the data,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the fish. I know people want it.\u201d", "Sea to Table hopes to sell fish directly to home chefs starting this year, too.", "But local seafood can cost more than many Americans are accustomed to paying, which partly accounts for the rampant seafood fraud in this country.", "\u201cU.S. fisheries are very well managed and are actually growing nicely,\u201d said Michael Dimin, the founder of Sea to Table. \u201cBut the U.S. consumer\u2019s been trained to buy cheap food, and imported seafood is really cheap because of I.U.U. fishing.\u201d I.U.U. stands for illegal, unreported and unregulated. The result is unsustainably fished, cheap seafood flooding American fish markets and grocery chains.", "\u201cTo us, the secret is traceability,\u201d Mr. Dimin said. \u201cIf you can shine a light on where it came from, you can make informed decisions.\u201d", "Mr. Auerbach concedes that some local fish is expensive, but he maintains that many lesser-known varieties are affordable. \u201cMaybe halibut and scallops are for the wealthy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut dogfish, skate, porgy and mackerel are all very inexpensive, healthy and great tasting.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/08/23/us/politics/ap-us-campaign-2016-immigration.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/08/22/us/ap-us-campaign-2016-clintons-beijing-moment.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/08/05/business/05reuters-google-urmson.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/sports/olympics/french-official-language-olympic-games.html": ["RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Micha\u00eblle Jean, secretary general of the International Organization of la Francophonie, spent a recent morning at the sultry Lagoa Olympic venue, where the world\u2019s most exciting rowing was taking place.

But Rule 23 of the Olympic charter states that the Games have two official languages, and Ms. Jean\u2019s organization, which represents 80 Francophone countries, is determined to make sure nobody forgets that one of them is French (the other is English).", "\u201cIt\u2019s a struggle each time you have the Olympic Games, in a different country and a different city,\u201d Ms. Jean said. \u201cWe must be there to make sure the French signs and documents and information are there. We have 3,000 athletes and a lot of people in the public from Francophone countries.\u201d", "Rule 23 is no accident. As the founder of the modern Olympic Games at the turn of the 20th century, Pierre de Coubertin got to choose what language they would be in, and he was French. But as the century wore on, and English became more dominant as a common international language, French usage at the Games began to fall by the wayside. This alarmed the French-speaking world and the Francophonie organization, one of whose goals, it says, is to \u201ccombat the perverse effects of globalization on languages.\u201d", "At each Olympics since Athens in 2004, the group has appointed a person known as le Grand T\u00e9moin \u2014 the Great Witness \u2014 whose job is to make the case for, and keep track of, French usage at the Games. This year\u2019s Grand T\u00e9moin is the internationally celebrated jazz saxophonist Manu Dibango of Cameroon. (Ms. Jean, a former governor general of Canada, had the job in London in 2012.)

Early discussions about French at the Rio Games were positive, Ms. Jean said, because the Brazilian government was sympathetic and because Carlos Nuzman, the president of the Brazilian organizing committee, speaks fluent French.", "But then the economy collapsed and the friendly government fell. When the new government came in, it had a lot on its mind, and that did not include the use of French at the Olympics. As the day of the opening ceremony approached, the Francophonie organization had no idea how the evening \u2014 traditionally a fine time for the world to hear and appreciate a lot of beautifully enunciated French spoken by important international officials \u2014 would go.", "It turned out to be a runaway success. All the main announcements and speeches were delivered in French, along with English and Portuguese.

Ms. Jean visited the athletes\u2019 village, only to discover that there were French-language signs in the cafeteria but nowhere else. She attributed it to Rio\u2019s budget woes \u2014 translation is expensive \u2014 and the frantic nature of pre-Games preparations. While she understood, she said, \u201cWe were very disappointed at the situation.\u201d", "Visitors to the Games, too, will see that the thousands of signs at the various event venues are printed only in English and Portuguese, not in French.

Rosenberg, examined the man\u2019s abdominal cavity, sifting his liver in his fingers, feeling for hard, dense tumors \u2014 but he could find no trace of cancer.", "It was 1968. Dr. Rosenberg had a hunch he had just witnessed an extraordinary case in which a patient\u2019s immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the man\u2019s blood, Dr. Rosenberg got permission to transfuse some of it into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the beginning of a lifelong quest.", "\u201cSomething began to burn in me,\u201d he would write later, \u201csomething that has never gone out.\u201d", "Half a century later, Dr. Rosenberg, who turns 76 on Tuesday and is chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute here, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream \u2014 turbocharging the body\u2019s immune system so that more cancer patients can experience recoveries like his long-ago patient\u2019s.", "Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Carl H. June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have been at the forefront of this research for decades, laboring in separate labs in an intense sometimes-cooperative, sometimes-competitive pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year.", "The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualized and souped-up version of their own immune system, one that \u201cworks better than nature made it,\u201d as Dr. June puts it.", "The patient\u2019s T-cells, the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the patient\u2019s blood, then genetically engineered to recognize and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the patient\u2019s bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumor assassins.", "This is an unusual pharmaceutical \u2014 a drug that is alive and can multiply once inside the body. Dr. June calls these cells \u201cserial killers.\u201d A single one can destroy up to 100,000 cancer cells.", "The killer cells are genetically engineered to produce a complex protein, an amalgam of pieces from different parts of the immune system that is unlike anything seen before.", "\u201cI call it a Frankenstein-like molecule,\u201d said Dr. Renier J. Brentjens, the director of cellular therapeutics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.", "This radical, science-fictionlike therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those off-the-shelf drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses.", "Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed specially for each patient, one of the many challenges the field faces in broadening its use. So far, the number of patients treated with cell therapy is in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works only for certain types of blood cancers, not common malignancies like breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also still working out how to control potentially lethal side effects. Just recently, a clinical trial was briefly halted after three patients died of brain swelling.", "Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options, stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race among companies to bring the treatments to market.", "Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks.", "\u201cIt was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg recalled.", "The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father\u2019s nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust.", "\u201cI saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,\u201d he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard.", "From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O\u2019Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research.", "\u201cI loved the night,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, \u201cThe Transformed Cell,\u201d published in 1992. \u201cI remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise.\u201d He added: \u201cTo be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world.\u201d", "When Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients T-cells harvested from pigs. That failed.", "He then began giving patients interleukin-2, or IL-2, a protein made by the body that spurs T-cells to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in IL-2. The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care.", "From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp \u201cdeath imminent.\u201d", "Ms. Taylor is still alive; her case and others catapulted Dr. Rosenberg and IL-2 onto the cover of Newsweek and the front pages of newspapers. Some of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head.", "But IL-2\u2019s vaunted prowess fizzled, helping only a few percent of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer.", "Dr. Rosenberg then tried to surgically remove tumors and extract the T-cells that had already penetrated them, so-called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. He multiplied those cells in the lab and infused them back in the patient, along with shots of IL-2. He limited his focus to melanoma, the skin cancer that seemed most susceptible to immune attack.", "The treatment eventually achieved remissions in about 10 percent to 25 percent of patients. But it was labor-intensive and its application to other cancers unclear.", "There had to be a better way. Indeed, one approach was taking shape across the street from Dr. Rosenberg, at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda.", "The Navy was not Carl June\u2019s desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in bone-marrow transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons.", "When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest.", "Dr. June turned to working with T-cells at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the mid-1980s. He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply T-cells in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the mid-1990s, working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients\u2019 T-cells to kill H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.", "But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple\u2019s three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June\u2019s research turned personal.", "Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001.", "\u201cA lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,\u201d said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June\u2019s work.", "Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer.", "\u201cThings that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,\u201d he said.", "In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge T-cells to fight cancer.", "\u201cAt the time it sounded very pipe dream,\u201d said Douglas Green, who was one of Dr. Sadelain\u2019s doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.", "But Dr. Sadelain, he continued, \u201cbelieved in his approach and he pursued it relentlessly.\u201d", "After earning his Ph.D., Dr. Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse T-cells.", "He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues \u2014 including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Rivi\u00e8re \u2014 showed that genetically engineered T-cells could eradicate certain cancers in mice.", "How is this done? To fight cancer, T-cells have to recognize cancerous cells.", "Each T-cell in the body has unique receptors, sort of like claws that jut out from its surface. T-cells patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of its claws latches on to such a fragment, the T-cell destroys the cell displaying it.", "But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body\u2019s own cells, not outsiders. T-cells do not always recognize them as something to kill.", "So scientists like Dr. Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the T-cells, one that could recognize cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells.", "The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body.", "But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the T-cell to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient\u2019s T-cells.", "Since this concoction is part antibody and part T-cell, it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR T-cell therapy, or CAR-T.", "Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute.", "Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.", "As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise; it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work.", "Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana\u2019s CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said.", "But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring mass-produced drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient.", "Again, a death from cancer propelled the field forward. In 2001, a 44-year-old woman, Kimberly Lawrence Netter, succumbed to breast cancer. Her father-in-law, Edward Netter, a wealthy financial services entrepreneur, and his wife, Barbara, formed the nonprofit Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy, which issued some of its first grants to Dr. June and Dr. Sadelain. Dr. June also got support from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.", "\u201cWithout that,\u201d Dr. June said of the charities, \u201cwe would not have had a clinical trial.\u201d", "As the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment \u2014 testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce peer-reviewed results.", "Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumors shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.)", "But the approach really attracted attention the next year when Dr. June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia went into complete remission.", "One of them, Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pa., left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running half-marathons.", "\u201cIt was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone,\u201d said Mr. Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later.", "Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered T-cells were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig\u2019s lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating.", "When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed.", "Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R.V. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make up for lost time,\u201d he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first great-grandchild.", "As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later.\u201d", "The 2011 publication of Dr. June\u2019s results transformed the field.", "Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June\u2019s lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt.", "While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy.", "The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn; Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute; and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital.", "Somewhat predictably, success provoked jostling and envy. Rather than being allies against a disbelieving world, the pioneers now had something worth fighting over \u2014 credit, and the gleam of a possible Nobel Prize.", "While the Sloan Kettering researchers had done some of the early genetic engineering, they did not publish strong results in five patients until 2013. By then, they had been scooped by Dr. Rosenberg with one patient and Dr. June with three.", "The spotlight further shifted to Dr. June because of his success with Emily Whitehead, a little girl whose miraculous recovery in 2012 made her the poster child for cell therapy. When Mr. Parker, the internet entrepreneur, announced in April that he would spend $250 million to start a new cancer immunotherapy institute, Emily, now 11, appeared on stage at the launch extravaganza with Lady Gaga.", "Dr. June\u2019s 2011 publications did not cite Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s paper from the previous year, prompting Dr. Rosenberg to write a letter to The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. June\u2019s publications also did not acknowledge that the genetic construct he had used was the one he had obtained from Dr. Campana of St. Jude.", "St. Jude sued the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis sided with Penn, and Juno Therapeutics with St. Jude.", "The suit was settled last year, with Novartis agreeing to pay $12.25 million plus possible future payments and royalties. Within days, Dr. June sent a correction and letter of regret to The New England Journal of Medicine, acknowledging that the CAR used in his groundbreaking 2011 study, and in treating Emily Whitehead, was \u201cdesigned, developed and provided\u201d by St. Jude.", "Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa., now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself.", "Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant all failed to help him.

The early 2015 rollout of People\u2019s Uber, a service that got ordinary Chinese drivers behind the wheel and taking passengers, helped Uber grab a chunk of market share from Didi.", "As it grew in China, Uber avoided many of the mistakes made by of its American tech forebears. For one, the company created local teams based around different cities, allowing it to respond quickly and flexibly to moves by the competition. That set it apart from other companies, which sought to control Chinese operations from the United States, slowing their responses.", "At the same time, Mr. Kalanick helped Uber overcome the biggest obstacle in China: the Communist Party. By traveling frequently to China, meeting with officials and speaking in language often used by party cadres, Mr. Kalanick helped the company avoid the regulatory tripwire that has led many companies to stumble in the market. Last week, Chinese officials said ride-hailing apps were legal and laid out a framework to license drivers.", "But entry is just the first obstacle to the Chinese internet market. Competition is fierce, and the focus is less on the product than on big spending to lure customers or on tricks to harm competitors. Fraudsters and opportunists also abound.", "Uber\u2019s engineers, operating from San Francisco, had to deal with drivers who simulated or faked rides to get commissions. At the same time, the company was blocked from marketing on China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat, because the internet giant Tencent was an early investor in Didi. All of that made it much harder to compete with a company that already had an advantage in scale, not to mention the backing of Tencent, Alibaba and Apple. When it raised $7 billion in June, Didi made it clear it was willing to continue the fight for a long time.", "That is perhaps not surprising given that Didi is itself the product of a spending war. In 2015, Didi\u2019s merger with what was its largest rival at the time, Kuaidi, was driven by investor concern about overspending for market share. In that previous round of the ride-hailing wars, Didi and Kuaidi did everything from offering subsidies to handing out beers to drivers in exchange for their loyalty.", "For all the publicity around the spat between Uber and Didi, the two had been in talks stretching back to the Didi-Kuaidi merger in the beginning of 2015, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. That person said the two sides could not overcome disagreements about valuations at the time.", "In another quirk to the latest deal, two members of the same well-known family in the world of technology were on opposite sides of the negotiating table: Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, is the daughter of Liu Chuanzhi, the Chinese founder of the largest computer maker in the world, Lenovo. Her cousin, Zhen Liu, is a vice president and regular spokeswoman for Uber China.", "Although the tie-up is expected to reassure investors, Chinese analysts said it would probably lead to a decrease in commissions. That could hurt customers and drivers alike, the analysts said, making it harder for smaller players to compete because their larger rival would no longer be saddled with such an expense.", "\u201cFor smaller companies like Yidao or Shenzhou, if they keep subsidizing users, it will only be temporary and will bring more financial burdens,\u201d said Hong Bo, an independent technology analyst in China.", "Li Bo, a 22-year-old driver from Henan, said the loyalty of drivers is determined by where they could get the best pay. That meant they would continue to follow the subsidies, he said.", "\u201cAll we care is who gives us the best deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Didi buys Uber, we just work for Didi.

A spokesman for Google declined to comment on those discussions, but Mr. Urmson disputed they were a reason for his departure.", "After the dispute, Mr. Urmson decided to take the summer off and only recently decided to leave the company.

On the eve of the bidding for the rights to show the 2014 and 2016 Olympic Games, he lost his top sports executive, Dick Ebersol, when talks for a new contract for Mr. Ebersol failed.", "It was the equivalent of the Yankees losing Derek Jeter just before the World Series. Mr. Ebersol had made the Olympics central to the NBC brand for two decades, and he was hands-down the American television executive best connected to Olympic officials in Switzerland.", "Mr. Roberts, a second-generation cable executive but a newbie in broadcast television, faced two seemingly bad options: He could break with Mr. Ebersol\u2019s legacy and go down in television history as the person who failed to keep the Olympics in the NBC stable or he could become known as the person who lost by keeping them.", "The rights were going to cost many billions of dollars, and NBC had lost more than $200 million on the 2010 Vancouver Games, an ominous harbinger. Mr. Roberts and his executive team \u2014 including Mr. Ebersol\u2019s successor, Mark Lazarus, and the NBCUniversal chief executive Steve Burke \u2014 had less than 30 days to figure it out. \u201cIt was a really stressful time,\u201d he told me in an interview on Wednesday.", "Comcast and NBC shocked the television and sports worlds by outbidding their closest competitor \u2014 Fox Sports \u2014 by nearly a billion dollars, offering $4.4 billion for four Olympics ending in 2020. And they followed that with a second deal to secure the rights for six Olympics through 2032 \u2014 at a cost of $7.75 billion. All told, Comcast has paid about $12 billion for rights to the Olympics, nearly 25 percent of what it paid for NBC itself.", "In short, Team Comcast bet the store, or, at least, a quarter of it. And they did it for what some analysts were calling \u201ca loss leader,\u201d something that was good for the brand, maybe, but bad for the bottom line.

They have already drawn more than $1.2 billion in ad sales, and receipts are continuing to come in.", "This despite the fact that overall traditional television viewing is ticking consistently down, due in large part to new competition from the internet.", "But in that environment, big-ticket live sports broadcasts have emerged as the last refuge for advertisers distraught by the slow death of the 30-second commercial, which is under siege from DVRs and online programming. The Olympics \u2014 like the Super Bowl or the World Cup \u2014 are best enjoyed live, when commercials still work the old fashioned way; they sneak up on you during breaks.", "\u201cTV is the best in terms of drawing people together and aggregating large audiences,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.", "It doesn\u2019t hurt that this year\u2019s Games are taking place one hour later than Eastern time, meaning Americans can easily watch them as they\u2019re happening, rather than on the dreaded tape delay (potentially after they already know the results).", "But more important to Comcast, and the entire media industry, is the future-of-television part of this equation.", "The trends that are causing television audiences to erode are not promising to abate any time soon. Alternative entertainment and media options continue to proliferate. But Comcast and NBC are using that as an opportunity during the Olympics; they are planning to fill every stream \u2014 on cable and the internet \u2014 as never before.", "To understand how significant a change this is, Mr. Roberts pointed to the last time the Summer Olympics were truly taking place live in prime time: the Atlanta Games in 1996.", "\u201cTwenty years ago, there was something like 170 hours of live content on one channel,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll have 6,800 hours on 11 channels, and up to 41 live streams. So that\u2019s effectively 52 channels with 6,800 hours versus one channel with 170 hours.\u201d", "It\u2019s also a ridiculous amount of content. Just think about it: How do you navigate that much sports? And do you even want to?", "Mr. Roberts thinks NBC and Comcast have found the solution. They\u2019ve arranged their most high-tech cable boxes \u2013 called the X1, it\u2019s in eight million homes, plus more through a licensing deal with Cox \u2014 so that viewers can easily click into whatever they want to watch, whether it\u2019s tennis on the Bravo network, or highlights from swimming on an internet feed that the box will send into the television.", "The box serves as a guide not only to the television, but also to the internet, or, at least, the parts of it where Comcast owns rights.

Comcast could have used the billions it spent on the Olympics on something else. Its decision to go all-in was predicated on a new bet \u2014 that for all their new options, Americans still want a big shared experience like the Olympics, and that big-ticket events are still part of the television future.

Jet was bleeding money, and some in the tech industry were predicting imminent doom \u2014 an unsurprising fate for a company entering a market that has been so thoroughly dominated by Amazon. So the Walmart acquisition was a surprise \u2014 at least it was to me \u2014 and it surely works out well for the investors who poured so much into the company.", "Mike: You and I went back and forth on this one, mainly because I think it was a win and a loss, in that Jet won\u2019t be what it wanted to be: a stand-alone company that could kill Amazon.

It was super awkward.", "Farhad: Snapchat says it recently hired a recruiter to focus on hiring underrepresented minorities, so perhaps Spiegel\u2019s view has changed.", "To me, these two incidents do underscore the importance of a diverse work force: Tech companies are usually small groups of homogeneous people who are trying to make products that satisfy the entire planet. At the very least, a diverse work force can help guard against them making choices that offend large swaths of their potential userbase. Even more than that, a diverse work force can help them come up with new ideas that may not have occurred to 20-something Stanford bros.", "Mike: That\u2019s why I applaud companies that make it a goal of theirs to strive for diversity at the outset, something that, unless you\u2019ve really made it a point to think about these issues, an entrepreneur may not have even thought of.

Meanwhile, novelists can soar and gain an untrammeled vista.", "But what are they actually seeing? Sometimes they deliberately describe what never was. Sometimes they claim more. In a draft for \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d Tolstoy wrote that he really wanted to tell the history of Russia\u2019s Napoleonic war but that if he undertook the task without fictional admixture, it would \u201cforce me to be governed by historical documents rather than the truth.\u201d", "What is that truth, which goes beyond the documents?

But more recently, it has given us Julian Barnes\u2019s novel \u201cThe Noise of Time,\u201d which pretends to give us the truth, not just the facts, about the composer Dmitri Shostakovich.", "This book, I think, is a beautifully written botch, and it has me wondering anew about truth. People have been doing that, of course, for a long time \u2014 at least since Pilate confronted Christ. And the wrangling over what the truth might be about Shostakovich and his experiences under Stalin has been going on, it sometimes seems, almost as long.", "Contention \u2014 between those who believe that Shostakovich was a blameless martyr, opposed to and victimized by the Soviet government, and those of us who believe he made pragmatic compromises to survive and prosper \u2014 reached such a pitch that if you search for \u201cShostakovich wars\u201d on Google, it will fetch thousands of hits. Shostakovich warriors, those who have sought to portray him as disaffected and tacitly hostile to the Soviets, distinguish the literal truth of the letters, journals and memoirs we have, from the essential truth that only inspired speculation can reveal.", "The fallacy of such thinking is to regard that essential truth as something revealed rather than created. Tolstoy did not make that mistake. He knew that the difference between real and fictional worlds is that a fictional world is wholly known. Nothing could remain hidden from Tolstoy about his imaginary Napoleonic Russia and its Natashas, Pierres and Andreis. But no matter how diligently he or we may burrow in the archives, there will always be more documents somewhere; some may contradict the ones we know, and there is no end to what was never recorded to begin with.", "Mr. Barnes has not fully lived up to the calling he professes. He might have invented his own Shostakovich \u2014 his marvelous novel \u201cThe Porcupine\u201d fictionalizes Todor Zhivkov, the fallen Communist ruler of Bulgaria, and lets us hear his inner voice as he faces trial. The owner of that voice is given a fictional name in the book, which frees the author from the factual record, and frees us from expectations based upon it.", "So why, then, is Shostakovich given his own name in \u201cThe Noise of Time\u201d (as are all the other characters)? If Mr. Barnes had called his hero, say, Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov and let the reader divine the resemblance to Shostakovich, I would accept his work without demur. But Mr. Barnes evidently wanted to capitalize on the interest that frenzied debate has drummed up in his subject and to claim implicitly to have settled the issues concerning the composer\u2019s relationship with Soviet power, which scholars continue to dispute. In an author\u2019s note appended to the novel, he advertises his fidelity to his sources and his superior insights. He is trying to have it both ways: He wants the novelist\u2019s freedom and also the historian\u2019s authority. But in trying for both, he achieves neither.", "Mr. Barnes\u2019s view of Shostakovich conforms in every detail to the sentimental Cold War fable of a passive, pathetic yet saintly figure buffeted by an obtuse, implacable force. This stereotype goes beyond Shostakovich and beyond his music, all the way to music itself, imagined as pure and spotless, utterly truthful the way mathematics is truthful, unresistant to martyrdom and co-option but ultimately triumphant. These are the na\u00efve assumptions of pop Romanticism.", "The sources on which Mr. Barnes most conspicuously relies are the two canonical texts of the Shostakovich wars. One is \u201cTestimony,\u201d a best-seller that appeared in 1979 whose subtitle is \u201cThe Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich as Related to and Edited by Solomon Volkov\u201d; the other is the invaluable \u201cShostakovich: A Life Remembered\u201d (1994) by Elizabeth Wilson, a compendium of third-person accounts by people who knew the composer. Mr. Volkov\u2019s book (despite the seductive, still widely believed stories it promulgates) has been exposed as a mixture of recycled material that Shostakovich had approved for republication and fabrications that were inserted after his death. The other makes no truth claims but presents a great gabble of conflicting viewpoints from which we are invited to draw our own conclusions.", "Mr. Barnes has done just that. But the remarkable, disappointing fact is that his fictional Shostakovich is not his own invention. He has adopted a ready-made: the sinless version of Shostakovich peddled by \u201cTestimony,\u201d supplemented by the most lurid tales from Ms. Wilson\u2019s argosy and a published letter or two. The resulting narrative predictably recycles three mangy tales from the Shostakovich wars.", "The first concerns the anonymous Pravda editorial of Jan. 28, 1936, \u201cMuddle Instead of Music,\u201d which denounced Shostakovich\u2019s wildly successful opera \u201cThe Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.\u201d It not only led to a ban on the opera but also, according to legend, put the composer under a cloud of suspicion that brought him within a hair\u2019s breadth of being \u201crepressed,\u201d as the saying went, in the Stalinist purges of 1936-38.", "The second recycled tale relates to the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, held in March 1949 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, where Shostakovich, fresh from a second denunciation at the hands of Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin\u2019s culture czar, was supposedly sent against his will as part of the Soviet delegation, only to be humiliated again in a confrontation with the composer Nicolas Nabokov.", "A decade later, as the third saga would have it, Nikita Khrushchev had Shostakovich browbeaten into joining the Soviet Communist Party so that he could serve as titular head of the Russian Federation\u2019s Union of Soviet Composers, after which the composer was supposedly so demoralized and filled with shame that he wrote a string quartet about it: his Eighth, often regarded as his masterpiece. All of its themes are derived from Shostakovich\u2019s initials, bearing witness to his own standing among the 20th century\u2019s \u201cvictims of war and fascism,\u201d in the words of the quartet\u2019s dedication.", "These three tales \u2014 the three books, so to speak, of the Shostakovich Apocrypha \u2014 correspond exactly to the three chapters of \u201cThe Noise of Time,\u201d and there is nothing in Mr. Barnes\u2019s account that cannot be found in the dubious sources he cites. His open fictionalization achieves nothing beyond what previous covert fictionalizations, like Mr. Volkov\u2019s, did.", "These episodes from Shostakovich\u2019s life contain abundant fodder for novelization, were the author more enterprising and inquisitive about his subject. Mr. Barnes has his hackneyed Shostakovich wonder whether Stalin had not only ordered up the editorial that attacked his opera but also had \u201cperhaps even written it himself.\u201d Nobody thought that in Russia in 1936: It was Mr. Volkov who raised the possibility for gullible Westerners in \u201cTestimony.\u201d But now we know who wrote it: a terrified former Yiddish writer named David Zaslavsky, who had become one of Stalin\u2019s most reliable literary hit men. His interior monologue would have made a great novel.", "To see Shostakovich as a passive pawn in Stalin\u2019s clutches at the Waldorf does scant justice to a man whose collisions with power had taught him to play a complicated game with exceeding, self-concealing skill. In his one well-documented person-to-person encounter with Stalin, the phone call through which the dictator sought to coerce the composer\u2019s presence in New York, Shostakovich leveraged the world fame that made him indispensable to secure a lifting of the ban on his own and his colleagues\u2019 works that followed the \u201cformalist\u201d denunciations the previous year.", "After his return from abroad, Shostakovich paid the powers back with a pair of often derided tribute works, an oratorio called \u201cSong of the Forests\u201d and the soundtrack score for the film \u201cThe Fall of Berlin.\u201d As the British musicologist Pauline Fairclough has shown in a patient analysis, they are no worse than the works of Shostakovich we now treat with respect. The Shostakovich of history did not write badly for them and well for himself. No one writes badly on purpose, nor could anyone make a career as successful as the one Shostakovich made in Soviet Russia while maintaining the kind of moral and aesthetic purity his mythologizers attribute to him. No one makes a successful career anywhere without learning and executing an intricate social dance.", "As for his official co-option, there is no reason to think that Shostakovich sought either the Party membership or the Union leadership that the government thrust upon him. But once in possession of political power, Shostakovich behaved not like a saint but like a politician. As his recently published official correspondence shows, he was not above settling scores.", "In 1948, one of the worst things anyone said about him at the hearings that preceded the Central Committee\u2019s \u201cResolution on Music\u201d came from Vladimir Zakharov, the director of the Pyatnitsky Choir, the Soviet Union\u2019s leading song-and-dance ensemble. \u201cFrom the point of view of the People,\u201d Zakharov taunted, Shostakovich\u2019s Eighth Symphony \u201cis not a musical work at all; it is a \u2018composition\u2019 which has nothing whatever to do with the art of music.\u201d", "At the very first Union meeting over which he presided as chair, Shostakovich paid back his tormentor (posthumously) with a scorching attack on the choir\u2019s repertory, which still consisted mainly of Zakharov arrangements. To one of the ensemble\u2019s then-active arrangers he wrote that the hapless fellow\u2019s setting of one particularly famous song \u201chas nothing in common with the art of music,\u201d echoing nearly verbatim Zakharov\u2019s old insult. Yes, his hands, too, were dirty. Everyone\u2019s were.", "The author of \u201cThe Porcupine\u201d knew that. What lured Mr. Barnes into hagiography when Shostakovich became his subject?

You can be Alibaba or you can be Amazon. You can be Uber or you can be Didi. But you can\u2019t be both. Given the rising Chinese market and increasing tension over the role of American tech firms in the rest of the globe, the gulf between the two sides promises to become one of the most important factors in determining the shape of global tech innovation.", "How exactly might the war play out? In some ways, being at the mercy of two poles of internet leadership could be good for citizens of planet Earth. In emerging markets like India, the Middle East and parts of Africa and South America, the giants of China and the United States are increasingly investing billions to compete for local customers in e-commerce, social networking, ride sharing and other markets.", "For instance, Duncan Clark, an investment adviser in China who wrote \u201cAlibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built,\u201d pointed to the way Amazon and Alibaba act as foils for one another.", "\u201cAmazon is increasingly making its own branded products, taking on Procter & Gamble and others, and also getting into the logistics business, and shipping, and everything else,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cBut Alibaba is a marketplace that doesn\u2019t hold inventory and describes themselves as helping local merchants \u2014 so maybe there\u2019s some argument that Alibaba could serve as a counter globally to Amazon.\u201d", "But Uber\u2019s deal with Didi \u2014 in which Uber will take an 18 percent stake in the combined company, which is certain to become the monopolistic player in the Chinese ride-hailing market \u2014 points to another potential outcome: A series of accommodationist deals in which giants cede large parts of the world to one another, pragmatically carving out their spheres of influence like players in The Great Game.", "\u201cIn that way it could be like the Yalta Conference,\u201d said Mr. Clark, referring to the 1945 meeting in which the victors of World War II determined the postwar geopolitical order.", "However the global order shakes out, each side\u2019s home territory seems safe from invasion by the other. Uber\u2019s retreat in China was preceded by a parade of failures by earlier American tech firms. Some fell short for obvious political reasons \u2014 companies that traffic in information, like Google, Facebook and Twitter, were essentially stymied from the start by the Chinese censorship regime. Others, like Amazon and eBay, failed to appreciate some of the differences in how business got done in China, especially the importance of personal connections.", "Of all American tech firms, Apple has achieved the biggest success in China \u2014 about 25 percent of its sales occurred in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in 2015. But in recent months, it, too, has been running into political hurdles in the region.", "\u201cThe barrels that will be thrown at you when you\u2019re trying to do business in China will just never stop,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the managing director of Marbridge Consulting, an advisory firm based in Beijing. \u201cYou\u2019ll constantly be above one barrel or recovering from jumping one, and as you\u2019re dusting yourself off you look down the road and here comes the next one.\u201d", "Compared with previous failures, Uber seemed to do everything right in China. It set up a separate company, Uber China, which had a buy-in from local investors, including from a local giant, Baidu. It hired many local experts, and worked closely with the national government to foster friendly relations.", "Insiders say Mr. Kalanick was also personally invested in the deal. He visited China eight times in the last year and a half, and became something of a tech star in the Chinese media.", "Publicly Mr. Kalanick had insisted he was fighting for total victory in China. But he must have known that Uber would always struggle to achieve dominance, given the emerging centrality of ride-sharing to the future of infrastructure in China. Still, even if he failed to win everything in China, investing early in the country seemed too big to skip.", "\u201cThe ride-sharing opportunity in China is basically as big as the rest of the world combined, if not bigger,\u201d said Ben Thompson, an analyst based in Taiwan who writes the tech newsletter Stratechery. \u201cFor Uber, China was basically frosting on the cake.\u201d", "For now, it\u2019s especially delicious frosting. The $2 billion Uber spent tackling China is now worth about $7 billion in the new merged entity; if Didi does become one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, the value of Uber\u2019s stake in China could rise geometrically, making the firm much more attractive in a potential initial public offering. Pulling out of China also frees up Uber to invest more in other markets \u2014 India and Indonesia are big targets \u2014 as well as expand its expertise in core technological initiatives like mapping data and self-driving cars.", "But if spending big to tackle China ultimately works out for Uber, it will be an anomaly, and certainly not a model for other American tech giants.", "\u201cThe ride-sharing market is one the few markets where the upside is big enough to justify going in,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cFor most other companies, going into China is still going to be nothing but pain.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-ride-hailing-news-owns-the-road.html": ["Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.", "Mike: Guten morgen, Farhad!

The future of advertising is grim, my friend.", "Farhad: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I buy all of my products based on Snapchat ads.

I do believe the work that was done there, overall, did more good than harm.", "At the very least, other Gawker Media properties like Deadspin and Gizmodo will live on under the new parent company Univision.", "Farhad: It\u2019s intriguing to me that many of the people who work at Gawker.com will move on to those other Gawker websites. Several are going to Deadspin. Will they recreate Gawker.com\u2019s spirit there? It will be interesting to watch.", "Mike: Yeah. But this week seemed to be the week of automakers and ride-hailing companies making big news, mostly in the absence of other tech news.", "Ford, for instance, made a grand proclamation that it expected to have a fully autonomous car fleet on the road within five years. This seems to be the magic number, since I\u2019ve heard it from practically every large American automaker \u2014 and many international ones, too \u2014 over this last year. Personally, I think it\u2019s all hogwash until I actually see a self-driving car on the road. And the only ones I\u2019m seeing that are anywhere close to that come from Google.", "And if these companies miss the target, everyone will forget since it\u2019s been five years and our collective memories are terrible.", "Also, Uber\u2019s lawsuit settlement with drivers who claim they should be classified as employees was denied by the judge presiding over the case. It seems as though most of that involved some quibbles over the ultimate settlement amount owed to drivers, so my guess is we\u2019ll see the two sides renegotiate to a higher price and come back with a number within the next few months.", "Farhad: Uber has some money, I\u2019ve heard, so it should all work out in the end.", "Mike: If only I could say that about myself.", "And this brings us to the main event: Uber. The company announced it was buying Otto, an autonomous vehicle research company that\u2019s focused on upending the trucking industry. People I spoke to said the deal was worth about 0.9 percent of Uber, $680 million after the funds raised are included in the total. Also, Otto gets 20 percent of any trucking business profits they end up creating.

It has seemed inevitable for some time that Uber was going to start doing autonomous vehicle testing, and the trucking thing also seems a bit obvious: Uber has always been open about its interest in logistics more than simply ride hailing, and this is a way for it to get into the logistics business.", "Mike: Wow. Aren\u2019t columnists paid to come up with ideas every week even in the absence of news? Come on, Farhad.", "Farhad: No, no thoughts from me. But I am really interested in how the test of ride sharing with autonomous vehicles will go. The Volvos will have human drivers in them to act as a backup, but I\u2019m curious about how the human passengers will react when the car is driving.", "Will they be scared? Will they try to avoid self-driving Ubers? Will they expect the price to go down, since the driver is just sitting there? I think this will expose a lot more social and cultural problems than technical ones \u2014 and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how Uber addresses them.", "Personally, I\u2019d be thrilled to be driven around by a computer. Computers are my friends.", "Mike: Yeah, they\u2019re your only friends. Also in auto news: I reported that Lyft, Uber\u2019s competitor, has been trying to sell itself to lots of different companies in the tech and auto industries, but it\u2019s had a hard time finding any takers. In other words, my life story.", "Farhad: I\u2019ve been increasingly skeptical of Lyft\u2019s future ever since Uber abandoned its China money-drain. As you wrote, this is a costly business, and the way it\u2019s proceeding involves huge investments in expensive technology: mapping, artificial intelligence, autonomous testing. Lyft has long positioned itself as the successful second player in the market \u2014 the Burger King to Uber\u2019s McDonald\u2019s.", "But the more that Uber\u2019s investments pay off, the more pressure it puts on all other players in the market. And I wonder if ride hailing is turning out to be another winner-take-all market \u2014 something like online search or computer operating systems, where one company takes the bulk of all profits. I think the people at Lyft genuinely believe otherwise, and who knows, maybe in five years Lyft will be a vibrant, profitable company.

The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies like Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make very powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people.", "But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine.", "\u201cThe mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,\u201d Brian Krzanich, Intel\u2019s current chief executive, said in an interview.", "From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now \u201cwhere computing is constantly shifting.\u201d Mr. Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel\u2019s core, but Mr. Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets.", "The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum in San Francisco. The conference is where the hard-core geeks of computing gather to hear about what\u2019s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world.", "Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years.", "At the Developer Forum, Mr. Krzanich will deliver a keynote speech, in which he is expected to dwell on topics like virtual reality, sensors and artificial intelligence, which was in the news last week when Intel bought an A.I. start-up, Nervana Systems, that has technology that will be used in Intel\u2019s data center chips.", "Shifting gears for the giant chip company is no easy task. \u201cIntel has four main business lines \u2014 PCs, mobile, internet of things and servers \u2014 and it\u2019s hitting on one of them,\u201d said Patrick Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who is now chief executive of the software company VMware.

I had been teaching writing at a summer camp for high schoolers, but when it was over, I was unemployed for the first time since I was 16. My husband had gone to an extended business training session in Texas, and while away had discovered a penchant for sleeping with men. I moved out \u2014 first to a shared room in Washington Heights with two mattresses on the floor, where I slept opposite a Russian woman who stayed up staring at me through the dark, then to a sweltering fifth-floor walk-up in East Harlem, an improvement by all accounts, but still dark, moldy and depressing. Broke, heartbroken and profoundly sweaty, I had taken to pacing the apartment sans pants in a diagonal across the sloping faux-parquet floor.

So I went to the library and trawled the stacks until I came upon \u201cThe Shipping News.\u201d", "I had read Annie Proulx\u2019s short stories the previous semester and Alan, my M.F.A. colleague and then love interest in the postmarriage fallout, had recommended the novel, about a man named Quoyle rebuilding his broken life in Newfoundland. Among Alan\u2019s charms was an unbridled passion for the giant dogs native to the province \u2014 his childhood pet was an obese Labrador he anthropomorphized so keenly in stories I envisioned him more like a brother. Sometimes Alan would email me stock photos of a Newfie having a swim, and we would joke about a fantasy trip to Newfoundland, home of the nicest dogs around.", "I brought the book back across Morningside Park and allowed myself to steep in it the way I hadn\u2019t really had a chance to since beginning graduate school. Quoyle\u2019s Newfoundland was a balm for my wounds: in each chapter a glimpse beyond the New York heat and the search for another job and a divorce lawyer. Quoyle had made a clean escape from his past; Quoyle lived in a house near the ocean; in Newfoundland there was always a breeze. Newfoundland, a name with the promise of a fresh start built into its very syllables.", "I\u2019m not sure, exactly, how Newfoundland went from novel setting and daydream to a plan that propelled me to the Port Authority. Having family in Croatia and South Jersey, I spent most of my summers either along the Adriatic coast or down by the Jersey Shore; though neither were without their benefits or even adventures, both were exclusively family affairs, large gatherings of relatives in which I could drift and feel safe. But fate had aligned in such a way that even my risk-averse and very sad self was willing to take a chance. Alan was already in Canada, in Montreal visiting friends. I could meet him there, and we could rent a car. We could go somewhere neither of us, and no one I knew, had ever been before.", "I bought a Greyhound ticket for a predictably hellish journey to Montreal that featured five bonus hours at the border when a fellow passenger was taken in by the police for extended questioning. I reunited with Alan, spent the dredges of my money on my half of the ferry passage and a rental car; a driving atlas of Atlantic Canada; bread, tomatoes and tins of anchovies; and tried to push the fears of financial ruin from my head as best I could. Then we drove through New Brunswick and across Nova Scotia, watching the familiarity of storefronts and landscapes dissipate in the rear view. We slept in the car in a Tim Hortons parking lot, the last bastion of brand recognition for the remainder of the trip. In the morning we woke and swam in the frigid North Atlantic along a beach of auburn sand. We hadn\u2019t left the mainland yet, but already I had never been to a place so empty \u2014 not deserted, just never quite settled in the first place.", "We reached the North Sydney port at midnight, put the car in the bowels of the ferry and climbed up to the deck for the six-hour passage across Cabot Strait. I promptly began to panic \u2014 I was prone to seasickness. Why had I chosen to take myself on an extended boat ride? Perhaps some cheap wine and an overpriced cupcake would have been a better analgesic for my particular troubles. I downed a dose of Duane Reade-brand sleeping pills from the bottom of Alan\u2019s knapsack and sat on a bench waiting for stomach pains to overtake me. I woke in the morning with a stiff neck, and Newfoundland on the horizon.", "I was still very stoned from the medication and took a series of ill-framed photos from the side of the boat \u2014 gray crags on which the first lighthouses and trap sheds were perched. All around, the shimmering navy blue water marked the real distance I had come, so different from the beryl Adriatic or the brown churn of the South Jersey Atlantic.", "At our first stop, we learned, among other things, that we were pronouncing Newfoundland wrong. We had driven those first hours with no plan, sticking to the main road on which the ferry dropped us, stopping only when we came to what looked like a traveling carnival. A young couple who had marked us as strangers from across the field were patient through our bungled explanation of what exactly we were doing in Newfoundland, and offered us some fast facts: It was NEW-fin-land \u2014 the \u201cnew\u201d stressed, the \u201cfound\u201d compressed, the \u201cland\u201d wide and stretched at the \u201ca\u201d; this was the Deer Lake strawberry festival and baking competition; and that was the mayor over there in the tent, judging the cakes.", "Was there a good local beer we should try? we asked. The two conferred for a moment, then said, decisively, \u201cCoors Light.\u201d", "We slept on the beach, woke at dawn rigid with cold, and resolved to choose our next destination based solely on the attractiveness of its name. The map was full of promises of the undiscovered, coves and lookout points, brooks and bights each harboring a secret second chance.", "One name in particular drew me in each time I looked at the map: Twillingate. A word so full of twinkle and twilight it felt as if it was getting away with something. It was out of the way, far from everything, but that seemed fitting. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Twillingate,\u201d I said. And because he was gracious, or maybe because he was thinking the same thing, Alan agreed.", "We drove northeast and climbed the Tablelands, a desaturated Martian landscape with mountain peaks inverted into snow-filled craters. We abandoned the plastic knife we\u2019d been using to cut the tomatoes, and instead bit into them and ate them whole like apples. We stopped for gas in Wiltondale and found in the station\u2019s cooler, the kind in which one encounters ice cream in a bodega, a pair of frozen rabbits.", "In the town bar the server looked at us with incredulity when we said we were from New York. Was I living just like they did on \u201cSex in the City?\u201d she wanted to know. I thought of the heat and my room share and my former husband. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d I said. We forewent the house special (canned moose and onions) in favor of mooseburgers. Was there a good local beer we should try? we asked. She nodded and brought us Coors Light.", "In the morning we ate tomatoes and strawberries on the hood of the car, then drove all day, passing through Summerford and New World Island, and arriving at Twillingate before sunset. I was both giddy and apprehensive about whether the place could live up to its name, and pulled over so we could go by foot. Here was the lighthouse, red and white just as I had imagined it; here were the jagged cliffs lush with wild grass. I stood on a decaying picnic bench at the edge of an overhang to study the horizon. Icebergs thrust up from the glassy water, their tips tapered to points by the summer sun.", "We ate cod and scallops with baked apple and local berries in the town\u2019s restaurant. No one much lived here anymore, the waitress said (she went to school in St. John\u2019s), but they all came back for the summer. We slept in the car in a bank parking lot that overlooked the ocean; in the moments before sleep I conjured plans for an ordinary life in Newfoundland, one made slightly better by grassy cliffs and salty air.", "In the morning, we pressed on toward St. John\u2019s. The towns on the way were smaller, the accents more pronounced. In Frederickton we slipped (undetected, we thought) into the back pew of a weatherboard church, where the congregants were singing hymns a cappella and by heart in what was approaching an Irish brogue. The pastor gathered the children in front of the altar and snapped his fingers in their faces when they failed to pay attention, then commanded them to sing the \u201cwelcome song\u201d and give us bags of hard candy.", "We passed through Lumsden and Newtown, stopped to roam among endless mazes of lobster traps on the docks. And in Gambo I ate the biggest portion of soft-serve ice cream I\u2019ve had to date. The closer we got to St. John\u2019s the colder it became \u2014 the east coast unbuffered from the ocean winds\u2019 true power. At night it was so cold in the car I woke and buried myself beneath a heap of our dirty clothes to keep from shivering.", "Then, finally, we dipped south to the Avalon Peninsula, and reached St. John\u2019s the next afternoon. While most of the province was dark blues and greens, St. John\u2019s was brazen in telegraphing its presence, the downtown lined with rowhouses in fuchsia, yellow and orange. Here there were stores and signs catering to tourists and plaques denoting historical achievements: Some considered St. John\u2019s the oldest English-founded city on the continent; Signal Hill was the site of the first trans-Atlantic wireless communication. But I wondered then and now about the history of those smaller places we had passed through with no plaques to speak of.", "At night there was music in the streets and crowds filled the pubs even though it was a Tuesday. I felt something inside me switch on again, the excitement of my very first days in New York City, the thrill of a new place alight and alive through the dark. We went to a bar on George Street, said yes to the house dinner special; it was called Brewis, which, in the server\u2019s best description, contained \u201ccodfish and wet bread.\u201d We ordered the beer ourselves.", "I don\u2019t remember where we slept that night, or the feverish drive back to the ferry port in the days that followed.

A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons.", "Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American whistle-\u00adblower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director \u2014 who became a Buddhist while making \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u2014 had gone all method again.

Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie\u2019s grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. \u201cLast January, Moritz calls me,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe says: \u2018You got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You\u2019re invited to Moscow.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "The call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie.", "\u201cAnd I know you from working on, what, three films?\u201d Stone said at the bar.", "\u201cFive,\u201d Borman said.", "At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a falling-\u00adout during the making of \u201cSavages,\u201d a beachy Blake Lively thriller. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our fights,\u201d Stone said. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s German; I\u2019m American.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.", "\u201cHe calls, and I go: \u2018Oh, [expletive]. Not again,\u2019\u2009\u201d Stone continued. It wasn\u2019t just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see \u201cSelma\u201d get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. \u201cYou get these scars, and they don\u2019t go away,\u201d Stone said.", "So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who single-\u00adhandedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like \u201cPlatoon\u201d and \u201cWall Street,\u201d his more recent films didn\u2019t receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone\u2019s millennial follow-\u00adup to \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990.", "But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two first-class tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena\u2019s office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of \u201cThe Life of David Gale,\u201d a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying first-class tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.)", "\u201cWhen that happened,\u201d Borman said, \u201cI thought, O.K., I guess Kucherena can pull the strings.\u201d", "As real-life narratives go, Snowden\u2019s is a compelling one. His transformation from a shy and pale 20-\u00adsomething \u2014 full of the sort of idealism those years can afford \u2014 to political dissident made him a hero figure to anti-\u00adestablishment liberals who are in the business of storytelling. Raised in a family of federal employees, Snowden grew up near Fort Meade, Md. He enlisted in the Army, went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and became a technology specialist for the N.S.A. By the summer of 2013, he had downloaded thousands of documents, taken off for Hong Kong and asked the journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras to meet him there.", "The initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N.S.A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N.S.A.\u2019s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple co-\u00adfounder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution.", "As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson. Civil-\u00adliberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including \u201cThe Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World\u2019s Most Wanted Man,\u201d by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and \u201cThe Snowden Operation: Inside the West\u2019s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,\u201d by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an \u201cinside\u201d look, neither writer had ever met Snowden.", "Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published \u201cNo Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. and the U.S. Surveillance State,\u201d a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.)", "Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window \u2014 or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States\u2019 endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed large-scale American hypocrisy.", "Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden\u2019s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia\u2019s asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F.S.B.). Snowden\u2019s case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden\u2019s stay and three months to write \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201d", "Stone\u2019s first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (\u201cI thought he was a gruff bear,\u201d Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn\u2019t meet them until they agreed to option \u201cTime of the Octopus.\u201d (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen\u2019s agreement: Stone would option the novel \u2014 if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client.", "I first spoke to Stone in June 2015, after reading that he was in the midst of shooting a film based on Kucherena\u2019s novel. He said he would be traveling to Moscow again that week to shoot Snowden and agreed to let me tag along. A day later, a peeved Borman called me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been disinvited,\u201d he said coolly.", "During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden\u2019s Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden\u2019s multiple emissaries. \u201cThere are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it\u2019s completely political,\u201d Borman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a political situation that goes way above your head.\u201d", "When Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in damage-\u00adcontrol mode. He told me that Snowden wasn\u2019t profiting from Stone\u2019s film in any way. \u201cOne hard-and-fast rule Ed always had was, I\u2019m not selling my life rights,\u201d Wizner said. Snowden\u2019s participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics \u2014 that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone\u2019s film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. \u201cWe were choosing between two bad options,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cHe could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm\u2019s length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm\u2019s-length relationship. And I didn\u2019t know how to advise him on that.\u201d", "According to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. \u201cIt\u2019s been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project \u2014 not deriving any benefit from it \u2014 and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,\u201d Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be good,\u201d Wizner added. \u201cYou know, Oliver Stone wrote \u2018Scarface.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Still, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement. Fact-\u00adchecking is one thing, I said; a cameo is another. \u201cIt is, and I\u2019m not entirely comfortable with it,\u201d Wizner said.", "Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn\u2019t observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena.", "A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a forward-\u00adleaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel\u2019s elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone\u2019s hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. \u201cI have some bad news,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot deliver Anatoly.\u201d He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. \u201cEd said he doesn\u2019t want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,\u201d Stone added.", "I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn\u2019t shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film.", "Soon after optioning Kucherena\u2019s novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his co-\u00adwriter, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M.F.A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese, \u00adJell-O cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. \u201cIt was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. \u201cI thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home.\u201d", "Snowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. \u201cOliver can be a bit of battering ram,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cHe\u2019s accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that\u2019s not Edward Snowden. He\u2019s not an alpha-\u00admale type. He\u2019s a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: \u2018Everything is going to be O.K. He\u2019s a good guy. It\u2019s going to be a good movie.\u2019\u2009\u201d Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood; his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills; and what he could about his work for the N.S.A.", "While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald\u2019s \u201cNo Place to Hide.\u201d By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena\u2019s book and Harding\u2019s \u201cThe Snowden Files.\u201d The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. \u201cNow what?\u201d Amy Pascal, then Sony\u2019s co-\u00adchairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal\u2019s colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics \u2014 \u201cJobs,\u201d with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cOliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,\u201d she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald\u2019s book, but Clooney passed. \u201cStone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,\u201d he replied.", "For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. \u201cThis is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,\u201d he said.", "While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph Gordon-\u00adLevitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif., and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might\u2019ve been considered bland,\u201d Stone said. \u201cThere\u2019s a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you.\u201d Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras.", "By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, \u201cSnowden\u201d was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out \u201cJobs\u201d \u2014 the Kutcher version.", "\u201cIt was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,\u201d Stone said.", "Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore.", "\u201cI\u2019d never heard of it,\u201d Stone said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally.\u201d", "The cover of \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d features a blown-up image of Snowden\u2019s face and a globe peeled like an orange to reveal the logo of the C.I.A. In his author photo, Kucherena indeed looks bearish, with a round face, matted white hair and a cellphone pressed to his right ear \u2014 as if he were midnegotiation. \u201cThe whole truth about the American agent on the run,\u201d the cover boasts. Also: \u201cOliver Stone is currently shooting a film based on this book.\u201d", "I had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. \u201cNow, it\u2019s easy to take a shot at this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it wasn\u2019t the basis of the movie. But it\u2019s fun. I enjoyed reading it.\u201d", "\u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their time-\u00adstamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (\u201cFile 004.wav\u201d), suggesting that they are the lawyer\u2019s transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold\u2019s case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly post-\u00adSoviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture \u2014 Steven Spielberg, B.B. King, \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d Penthouse magazine, Popeye, \u201cThe \u00adX-Files,\u201d Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, \u201cSpider-\u00adMan,\u201d \u201cBraveheart,\u201d Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned \u2014 and a gleeful taunt to its government. \u201cNot only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,\u201d Kucherena writes, \u201cbut he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen.\u201d", "In the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. \u201cBelieve me, Russia is not the worst option for you,\u201d the lawyer tells Cold. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t regard us with such mistrust.\u201d", "Once Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. \u201cI shall work in Russia and get an apartment!\u201d Cold announces. \u201cI thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison.\u201d", "\u201cAs far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,\u201d the lawyer assures him. \u201cAll will be O.K.\u201d The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (\u201cIt is the Russian Coca-\u00adCola,\u201d the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker.", "\u201cWeird, huh?\u201d Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or \u201cSnowden\u201d wanted to discuss it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything on the record about that book,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt told me.", "According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for \u201cTime of the Octopus,\u201d which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That\u2019s the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to \u201cEat, Pray, Love.\u201d) \u201cWe bought it because we did get good access to Ed,\u201d Stone explained. \u201cHe had to be brought along.\u201d", "During Stone\u2019s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. \u201cThey had a kind of bromance,\u201d Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and Gordon-\u00adLevitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as \u201cSasha,\u201d a nickname Kucherena had given him.", "Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many \u201crepresentatives of Hollywood,\u201d writers and filmmakers. \u201cAt some point, I just thought to myself, Why don\u2019t I try to write the book?\u201d he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. \u201cVery many people called me,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut I honestly don\u2019t remember their names now.\u201d", "The lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media\u2019s insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F.S.B., including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. \u201cI never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to say I\u2019m tied to the F.S.B., but that\u2019s complete nonsense, excuse me.\u201d", "Kucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. \u201cThe Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,\u201d he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. \u201cA person can only be open with someone he trusts,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cAnd here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts.\u201d", "He did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. \u201cI wrote an artistic book,\u201d Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t take any money from him,\u201d Kucherena said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian.\u201d", "Despite being the one to put the \u201cSnowden\u201d project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. \u201cI\u2019m very far from all that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!\u201d", "When I told Wizner that Stone said he bought Kucherena\u2019s book to gain access to Snowden, his voice climbed a few octaves again. \u201cVirtually every single other person who\u2019s met with Snowden, and there have been dozens of them, have just gone through me, and we\u2019ve hooked it up,\u201d Wizner said. He listed some names, which included the film director Doug Liman, as well as the actors Jared Leto and John Cusack. (Cusack took Snowden Cool Ranch Doritos, as well as DVDs of \u201cNetwork\u201d and \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201d)", "Wizner, who is 45, has been at the A.C.L.U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden\u2019s advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden\u2019s character and their common cause.", "It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website \u2014 news that turned out to not be true \u2014 and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena\u2019s friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden \u2014 or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie.", "Wizner\u2019s counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed \u201ca public service.\u201d President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U.S.A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden\u2019s leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing op-eds against Russia\u2019s human rights violations. \u201cI think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he\u2019s actually being critical.\u201d", "When I asked Wizner about Kucherena\u2019s book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. \u201cMaybe you should just characterize my facial expression \u2014 \u2018He smirked,\u2019\u2009\u201d Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.)", "According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena\u2019s book. \u201cThe thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had people calling for your assassination, you\u2019d be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you\u2019d be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn\u2019t register.\u201d", "Wizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena\u2019s role in Snowden\u2019s life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. \u201cIt seems like the ethical rules governing the attorney-\u00adclient relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very unusual for a lawyer in a high-\u00adprofile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood.\u201d", "Kucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. \u201cWe are on the same team!\u201d he told me. \u201cBen works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem.\u201d Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise.", "\u201cMission accomplished,\u201d Stone announced.", "We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena\u2019s dacha. The day went long. Stone\u2019s idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. \u201cEd is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,\u201d Stone said. \u201cBut I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him.\u201d Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena\u2019s property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. \u201cHe was cooperative,\u201d Stone said. \u201cHe wanted to make it work. But as an actor \u2014 he\u2019s not used to that. I mean, he\u2019s not an actor. And I don\u2019t think he became one that day.\u201d", "To make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the whistle-\u00adblower for the first time and still seemed a bit star-struck. \u201cSuddenly this little creature comes teetering in \u2014 so fragile, so lovely, such a charming, well-\u00adbehaved, beautiful little man,\u201d the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s like an old soul in a very young body. He\u2019s got fingers like violins.\u201d Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. \u201cIt\u2019s like Bono or Al Pacino,\u201d he added. \u201cThose guys are teeny-\u00adweenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else.\u201d", "Mantle shot Danny Boyle\u2019s \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201c127 Hours,\u201d but \u201cSnowden\u201d proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn\u2019t get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. \u201cThank God the Germans act like Americans,\u201d Stone said.", "The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (\u201cSasha\u201d had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that \u201cSasha\u201d would be of interest to the N.S.A., Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email \u2014 \u201cIt was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,\u201d Borman said \u2014 and kept the script on air-\u00adgapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. \u201cMaybe nobody gave a [expletive],\u201d Borman told me. \u201cOr maybe the N.S.A. is laughing at us like, \u2018Look at those idiots \u2014 of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!\u201d", "For the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. \u201cSnowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt said, before catching himself. \u201cMaking the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you\u2019re acting.\u201d", "Committed to inhabiting Snowden\u2019s robotic speech pattern, Gordon-\u00adLevitt lifted the audio from \u201cCitizenfour\u201d and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt heavy-\u00adhanded. \u201cOliver is very into making his point,\u201d the actor said, \u201cas he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, \u2018O.K., I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece.\u201d Stone found Gordon-\u00adLevitt\u2019s approach too \u201cdocumentary-\u00adish\u201d at times. \u201cI was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,\u201d Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute last-\u00adminute rewrites.", "By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn\u2019t risk leaving. \u201cTo go to L.A. would have cost us three down days,\u201d Stone told me. \u201cI knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it.\u201d Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting.", "Stone\u2019s trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried \u2014 that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn\u2019t like it. \u201cI want him to vet it,\u201d he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. \u201cO.K., my dear,\u201d Stone said, getting up to leave. \u201cSee you in New York.\u201d", "Then he disappeared for six months.", "Before Stone set out to make his film, he had met Snowden\u2019s chief biographers, Greenwald and Poitras. Stone and Greenwald became friendly, and when Greenwald\u2019s book drew interest in Hollywood before it was published, the journalist turned to Stone for advice. \u201cIn the back of my mind, I thought if he had any interest in making a film, that would be a good segue for him to say so,\u201d Greenwald told me.", "At the time, Stone wasn\u2019t interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony\u2019s bid, but Greenwald declined. \u201cI think he was a little perturbed,\u201d Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone\u2019s movie, was the only actor who didn\u2019t meet his real-life counterpart as research. \u201cI always thought that was a little weird,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility \u2014 I\u2019m not really sure.\u201d (According to Stone, Quinto didn\u2019t need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.)", "In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his film. \u201cBecause his film would be the real movie \u2014 because it\u2019s a Hollywood movie,\u201d Poitras told me. \u201cObviously I wasn\u2019t interested in doing that. To have another filmmaker ask me to delay the release of my film was \u2014 well, it was somewhat insulting.\u201d", "Stone was annoyed, but he stuck around for a few drinks. They discussed new movies, including \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d As Poitras recalls, Stone found the film too violent, while Poitras thought the brutality was appropriate given the subject matter. Stone was growing increasingly frustrated. \u201cAt some point, he reached over and had his hands around my neck,\u201d Poitras said. \u201cIt was sort of in a joking way. I think he was a little bit drunk. But it was not a particularly pleasant evening.\u201d", "According to Stone, he only offered to help Poitras get distribution. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d help her either bring out her film with our film, or in the wake of it or before it, if we could,\u201d Stone said. He didn\u2019t recall pretending to strangle Poitras. \u201cI think from talking to her, you sense she\u2019s superparanoid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I liked her,\u201d he continued. \u201cI admired her. I saw her films. I was trying to help her. If Laura is accusing me of trying to aggress her or kill her, she\u2019s crazy.\u201d", "Despite his occasional bullishness, Stone craves approval. His films tend to resemble his character: at once original, impetuous, dogmatic and stubbornly ambitious. They typically run up to three hours, and he is often hurt when they\u2019re underappreciated. Once, I was with Stone when he was handed a copy of \u201cA Child\u2019s Night Dream,\u201d the novel he wrote at 19. Stone began to recite the blurbs aloud. \u201cThe language moves in torrents, always energized ... shamanistic,\u201d Stone read, quoting The Boston Globe. \u201cI don\u2019t get many good reviews, but this is good.\u201d I said that he has gotten plenty of good reviews since then. \u201cYou should see Rotten Tomatoes,\u201d he said, referring to the movie-\u00adreview aggregator.", "Stone\u2019s torment is at least in part self-\u00adinflicted. Biopics can be a nasty business, and Stone routinely throws himself into historical narratives and the messy negotiation between fact and fiction. The haggling with historians and family estates is the reason Stone was never able to make films about Martin Luther King Jr. and Hank Williams, and it was why he had to wait for Richard M. Nixon to die to make \u201cNixon.\u201d For Stone, the real-life characters of the stories he is after have become both the obstacles and the necessary arbiters of his work. It\u2019s why he refused to make \u201cSnowden\u201d without Snowden, and why his appeals to Greenwald and Poitras were his way of getting them on board.", "If Poitras had a strong reaction to Stone\u2019s proposal, it was because she had already been hounded by Sony. After the studio optioned Greenwald\u2019s book, Poitras says Sony asked to buy her life rights \u2014 an offer she declined. Sony suggested that she come on as a consultant, but when the contract arrived, it stipulated that the studio would have access to Poitras\u2019s tapes and notebooks. \u201cSo I\u2019d already gone through that when Oliver came in trying to position himself,\u201d she said.", "Poitras is a soft-\u00adspoken, cautious woman who has spent much of the past decade on government watch lists. Her resistance to participating in various Snowden projects has less to do with her feeling territorial than with her trying to maintain some control as she has become a character in a story that is no longer hers. Poitras\u2019s radical position is that the \u201cSnowden story\u201d can really belong only to Snowden. \u201cI could have asked him for a life-rights contract in Hong Kong, but I don\u2019t believe in that as a concept,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s his story, and I hope he tells it when he\u2019s ready.\u201d", "Neither Greenwald nor Poitras ultimately object to Stone making his film. While his own movie still lingered in development, Greenwald thought Snowden\u2019s story might in fact be safer in Stone\u2019s hands than it would be elsewhere. The Sony leaks would eventually reveal that Stone\u2019s paranoia may have been justified: In emails about the purchase of Greenwald\u2019s book, an executive in Sony\u2019s government-\u00adaffairs office suggests toning down the news release, changing \u201cillegal spying\u201d to \u201cintelligence gathering\u201d and \u201cmisuse of power\u201d to \u201cactions.\u201d", "\u201cMy big worry with Hollywood and the Snowden story is that they\u2019re either going to be cowards and completely drain it of its political vitality,\u201d Greenwald told me, \u201cor that they\u2019re going to do a superbiased smear job. For all the talk about how liberal Hollywood is, the reality is that they\u2019re really close to the government. And whatever other things you might say about Oliver, I was actually relieved that someone was going to do this film where there was no danger of those things happening.\u201d", "This January, I drove to Stone\u2019s office in West Los Angeles to watch a rough cut of \u201cSnowden.\u201d Stone works out of a discreet suite in a pristine office complex. The d\u00e9cor is eclectic. There are tribal masks, Indonesian throw pillows, a Che Guevara painting and a lone potted palm tree.", "Like \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d \u201cSnowden\u201d takes place in Hong Kong, but this time the story has the eerie feeling of a familiar scene re-\u00adenacted by skilled Hollywood actors. Stone was right about Gordon-\u00adLevitt. His performance is not an interpretation so much as a direct replica of the whistle-\u00adblower\u2019s even demeanor and intonation. Quinto plays Greenwald with such intensity that he appears perpetually enraged. Melissa Leo\u2019s Poitras is in turn warm and protective, almost maternal.", "Stone came in just as the credits rolled. He was nursing a cold but was back on caffeine and asked his assistant for Bulletproof, the trendy coffee brand made with \u201cgrass-fed butter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be nutritional,\u201d Stone said. \u201cNo radicals.\u201d", "Since I last saw him, the film\u2019s release had been pushed from December 2015 to May 2016 as Stone rushed to complete it, and then once more to September 2016. The biggest challenge was pacing. Stone likes to structure his movies around a series of plot-\u00adpivoting, battlelike scenes \u2014 the concerts in \u201cThe Doors,\u201d the football games in \u201cAny Given Sunday\u201d or actual warfare in \u201cAlexander.\u201d A story in which the drama hinges on a tech specialist downloading classified documents was more subdued than he was accustomed to. \u201cCoding is not exciting,\u201d Stone said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a nerdlike behavior \u2014 it\u2019s dull on a screen.\u201d", "Stone got around the tedium of reality by turning his film into a cross between a cyberthriller and a love story, using Snowden\u2019s relationship with Mills to inject emotional stakes. Cutting between Snowden in Hong Kong and flashbacks to his past, the film speeds through Snowden\u2019s biography with the help of techno music, snappy explanations of N.S.A. programs and tricky camerawork to build in the tension of surveillance. (There are scenes filmed from the perspective of tiny phone cameras \u2014 the modern peephole \u2014 and suggestive zoom-ins on eye pupils.)", "But there are also unmistakable Stone-isms. \u201cI just don\u2019t really like bashing my country,\u201d Gordon-\u00adLevitt says to Woodley as they stroll past a Bush-\u00adera antiwar protest in front of the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s my country, too,\u201d Woodley says. \u201cAnd right now, it\u2019s got blood on its hands.\u201d", "Snowden\u2019s N.S.A. boss is unsubtly named Corbin O\u2019Brian, after the antagonist in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984.\u201d \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t want freedom,\u201d O\u2019Brian tells Snowden. \u201cThey want security.\u201d", "Snowden\u2019s many storytellers all tell a similar hero narrative. But if Greenwald\u2019s account is about journalism, Poitras\u2019s is a subtle and artful character study and Kucherena\u2019s is an attempt at the Russian novel \u2014 a man alone in a room, wrestling with his conscience \u2014 Stone\u2019s is the explicit blockbuster version, told in high gloss with big, emotional music and digestible plot points that will appeal to mass audiences. As Wizner wisely anticipated, it is the narrative most likely to cement Snowden\u2019s story in Americans\u2019 minds.", "Snowden declined to comment for this article, but Stone told me he had seen the film and liked it. At a screening at Comic-\u00adCon a few months later, Snowden would beam in via satellite to give his somewhat wary approval. \u201cIt was something that made me really nervous,\u201d he said of Stone\u2019s film. \u201cBut I think he made it work.\u201d", "As Stone intended, Snowden shows up at the end of the film. He appears in a wood-\u00adpaneled room in Kucherena\u2019s dacha, a modest, foreign-\u00adlooking space, with little to see except a vase of flowers and some curtains in the background. The Snowden who speaks is not the stoic version, but one who manages to deliver a Stone-\u00adcaliber movie line. \u201cI no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019m happy with what I\u2019ve done today.\u201d Just before the screen fades to black, Snowden is shown gazing toward a window, a faint, inscrutable smile on his face.", "By this summer, whatever anxieties there may have once been seemed to have dissipated. With the film completed, Stone would officially beat Sony\u2019s project. Open Road, the distributor he was worried about, had won an Oscar for \u201cSpotlight.\u201d After \u201cSnowden\u201d earned similar marks to that film during test screenings, everyone seemed optimistic, if a little surprised. \u201cAt first I thought there must be something wrong,\u201d said Borman, who told me that he hadn\u2019t seen such high scores in 25 years. Open Road had pushed for a fall release, placing it firmly among Oscar contenders.

Wizner was preparing to petition Obama to grant Snowden a presidential pardon in the fall, and he hoped Stone\u2019s film would help transform the public\u2019s perception of his client. Kucherena, meanwhile, had turned \u201cTime of the Octopus\u201d into a trilogy \u2014 in the sequel, the N.S.A. sends an assassin to Russia to \u201celiminate\u201d Joshua Cold. He hoped to come to the United States for the premiere of the film, in which he has a cameo as a Russian banker who encounters Snowden at a party. \u201cIf I can get a visa, why not?\u201d he said.", "In July, Stone and Wizner joined forces for an A.C.L.U. event. The evening was billed as a conversation with Wizner about surveillance and Edward Snowden, with Stone hosting at his Tudor-\u00adstyle home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.", "As several dozen West Coast supporters of the A.C.L.U. filtered into Stone\u2019s backyard, the director sat camped out on a bench by the pool, taking the party in from a distance. He boasted that he had recently cut four more minutes from the film, bringing the run time to a lean 134 minutes. I asked if he would keep finessing until the end. \u201cNo, it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it. Now I die.\u201d", "Wizner roamed around, inspecting a meditation gazebo outfitted with a large gold Buddha. After several people inquired who was playing him in the movie, the lawyer came up with a pithy reply. \u201cKevin Spacey, reprising his role as Keyser Soze,\u201d he joked. \u201cThe guy behind the guy behind the guy \u2014 hiding in plain sight.\u201d (Wizner is not a character in Stone\u2019s film.)", "That week, NPR ran an interview with a Russian security official who posited that Snowden is maybe, probably, most definitely cooperating with Russian intelligence. This inevitably set Wizner off. \u201cOf course, this is the same week that Snowden is blasting Putin on Twitter every day,\u201d Wizner said to Borman, who nodded along. The producer suggested that Snowden\u2019s critics would claim it\u2019s a cover. \u201cThat\u2019s what they say!\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThis is preapproved criticism so that it\u2019ll seem like he\u2019s free, but actually Putin is the master pulling the strings.\u201d", "Eventually, everyone moved to the den, a spacious, brightly lit room filled with family photos. Matthew Weiner, the \u201cMad Men\u201d creator, took a seat by a stack of DVDs, which included multiple seasons of his own hit TV show. Others arranged themselves along wicker chairs that lined the room\u2019s perimeter. The whole thing had the feeling of a P.T.A. meeting, but without the stale cookies.", "Wizner got up and spoke for some time about his efforts as Snowden\u2019s lawyer. As he opened the room to questions, someone asked how long Russia could be relied on to keep Snowden safe. Wizner turned the question over to Stone. \u201cOliver is the Russia expert,\u201d he said with a hint of passive-\u00adaggression. Since completing \u201cSnowden,\u201d Stone had become absorbed in his newfound interest in Russia and announced that he was making a documentary about Putin. In recent months, he had accompanied the Russian president to a theater performance and a World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. \u201cHe represents a different point of view that Americans don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Stone had told RIA Novosti, a Russian news service.", "When someone else asked about Stone\u2019s experience of making \u201cSnowden,\u201d his answer was despondent. \u201cIt was really a horrible experience in every way,\u201d he said. Everyone laughed except for Stone.", "As the guests dispersed, Wizner lingered in the foyer, admiring Stone\u2019s art collection depicting important and mostly dead men. He thought that a print of Jean-Paul Sartre looked like Steve Buscemi and that a pained-\u00adlooking Beethoven was actually Stone. On the opposite wall was a sketch of Genghis Khan, the feared Mongolian emperor.

Tech companies have been moving upward in the rankings since the start of the bull market in March 2009, but recent earnings reports have accelerated matters.

But Exxon Mobil has been cut down in size by the oil price debacle. The other is Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett\u2019s conglomerate, which the S.&P. categorizes as a financial services company \u2014 the only such company left in the Top 10 market cap list. Berkshire announced its own earnings after trading closed on Friday.

In 1957, when the S.&P. 500 was born, an ancestral version of AT&T was the most valuable company in the United States by a very wide margin, said Jeremy J.

No pure tech company ranked in the Top 10 back then, not even IBM, which soon became the dominant tech company, a position it held until Microsoft surpassed it in the mid-1990s. That was the decade of the great tech boom, culminating in the bubble that burst in March 2000. Microsoft was No. 1 in market cap at the end of 1999, and four other tech companies \u2014 Cisco Systems, Intel, IBM and America Online \u2014 were also among the Top 10 most valuable companies.

When you dig deeper into the S.&P. 500, it\u2019s clear that while the valuations of tech companies swelled to unrealistically high proportions in those bubble years, the valuations of most companies are far more modest now. In March 2000, the height of the bubble, the value of information technology companies swelled to 34.5 percent of the total market cap of the S.&P. 500. At the moment, the comparable figure is only 20.7 percent, data from the Bespoke Investment Group shows. That\u2019s not much more than the 15.7 percent share of financial companies or the 15.2 percent share of the health care sector. By contrast, finance ballooned as high as 22.3 percent at the end of 2006, in what can be seen in hindsight as a financial bubble.", "On the other hand, materials and energy companies, which together constituted almost half of the total value of the S.&P. 500 in 1957, now account for less than 10 percent of it. That reflects the collapse of energy and commodity prices over the last few years, and it may well be a temporary phenomenon. In the meantime, diversified energy companies like Exxon Mobil are investing heavily in technology, a necessity if they are to flourish.", "It\u2019s clear even to energy companies, in other words, that tech\u2019s abiding power in the marketplace is not temporary. Technology permeates every sector of the economy, even those not formally classified as high-tech. Whether companies like Amazon and Johnson & Johnson should carry tech labels is beside the point.

No one at Gillette has trouble sleeping.\u201d", "But 20 years later, management at Gillette (long since acquired by Procter & Gamble) is probably tossing and turning a little more. Gillette\u2019s scale still provides formidable advantages (wide retail distribution, superior patented technology through large R.&D. investment), and its well-known brand (reinforced through mass-media advertising) creates a strong habit in loyal customers acquired early in their lives.", "However, those advantages are plainly no longer as formidable as they were at the company\u2019s zenith. For an insurgent like Dollar Shave Club, online sales reduce the impact of Gillette\u2019s big lead in drugstore shelf space, and cloud-computing services reduce the required upfront technology investment. Targeted direct marketing on Facebook and other social channels obviates the need for a mass-media campaign, while customer reviews and word-of-mouth can spread the word. At the high end, Gillette\u2019s patented, multi-blade, vibrating razor is a tough opponent, so naturally new entrants focus on the entry level \u2014 where they can rebrand cheap, no-name blades to compete.", "Since these business tools are universally available, they plainly don\u2019t inherently confer advantage on any one player. Dollar Shave\u2019s success was driven by exceptional execution, particularly in building a brilliant marketing engine and putting out a promotional video that went viral.", "In Jet\u2019s case, the serial entrepreneur Marc Lore was able to build a large e-commerce company for a few hundred million dollars in just a couple of years by taking an innovative approach to pricing and distribution. And Walmart is plainly convinced that Jet\u2019s expertise and momentum will help it compete with Amazon. Jet\u2019s negative gross margins, which would have required large continuing investments, will disappear when combined with Walmart\u2019s purchasing and distribution scale.", "While it is hard to stay ahead solely through superior execution over an extended period, it is sometimes enough in the short term to draw a deep-pocketed buyer where there are strong, immediate synergies. Creating enormous value over the long term requires turning a tactical edge into some form of durable advantage.", "While there are plenty of extraordinary start-ups creating new markets with a path to genuine advantage, self-described \u201cdisrupters\u201d often find that the same forces that allowed them to get going initially also let in a horde of rivals. Competition drains away profit.", "This is particularly likely where the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d does not greatly change the cost structure or end-user experience. Putting a thin layer of software on a people-intensive service business, for instance, may win some immediate sales against Luddite competitors, but it is not necessarily sustainable, nor will it conjure up fat margins. New and existing competitors can often spiff up their supporting tech, too.", "As the Columbia Business School Professor Bruce C. Greenwald pointed out in his book \u201cCompetition Demystified,\u201d product differentiation on its own is not the basis for sustainable advantage. In his renowned example, \u201calmost everybody makes toasters\u201d \u2014 and if consumers one day demanded \u201ctoasters that sing when the bread is ready\u201d \u2014 soon every manufacturer would offer a \u201ccrooning toaster.\u201d", "The rise of web-fueled competition is plainly inexorable. Computers are infinitely patient and accurate in comparing prices and opportunities, and now companies can provide a complete set of services to atomize the fixed costs formerly required for market entry.", "However, despite the threat to profits, there is no cause for gloom. Superior tactical execution can still create real value, particularly where it provides ammunition for a bigger war (like Walmart\u2019s battle with Amazon). And in the long term, value is created not by disruption, but by weaving together advantages (as both Amazon and Walmart have done in different ways) that together create a barrier that is hard to storm."], "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/08/16/us/ap-us-ford-autonomous-car.html": [], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/opinion/think-tanks-and-corporate-america.html": ["To the Editor:", "For over 40 years I have been teaching courses touching on complex issues of ethics and public policy.

That\u2019s one reason Oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology, said Steve Miranda, Oracle\u2019s vice president of applications development.", "\u201cNew companies have what is called \u2018a minimum viable product\u2019 they can sell,\u201d said Mr. Miranda, a 24-year veteran at Oracle.

Soon after the NetSuite deal Thursday, Amazon announced that its cloud business had second-quarter revenue of $2.9 billion. Just the amount Amazon\u2019s cloud segment grew from the previous quarter, $320 million, was $90 million more than all NetSuite\u2019s revenue for the second quarter.", "Much of that revenue comes from selling bare-bones computing that Oracle doesn\u2019t care about. But increasingly Amazon is offering its own databases, and customers are signing on. It targets Oracle directly at its promotional events, and offers something called \u201cserverless computing,\u201d which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses \u2014 another potential threat to Oracle\u2019s profit margins.", "Oracle has built a large operation in Seattle, paying big for cloud talent from Amazon and Microsoft.

Soon, Mr. Kurian said, Oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in Oracle databases. The company has anonymized data from 1,500 companies, including three billion consumers and 400 million business profiles, representing $3 trillion in consumer purchases.", "\u201cMost of the world\u2019s data is already inside Oracle databases,\u201d said Mr. Kurian.", "That\u2019s the kind of hold on people\u2019s information that perhaps only Facebook can match.

StudyBlue offers flash cards, and it\u2019s free for Android and iOS users. It works like this: You create a set of flash cards for a topic you want to learn by typing the relevant information on each card. You can add a photo to help visualize the data, or add audio. Then the app lets you quiz yourself using them.", "The real power of StudyBlue is that you can share flash cards with classmates or teachers. Better yet, the app lets you search flash card sets uploaded by students and teachers around the world, so you can probably find a premade set that is relevant to you by looking up keywords or searching by school.", "The StudyBlue app has many features, so it may take some time to master it \u2014 and it requires setting up a free account and an internet connection to make the most of its offerings.

This app, available on iOS and Android, promises to help you understand a variety of math problems by showing the solutions and, most important, the steps to solving the problem.", "Symbolab can understand and solve algebra, trigonometry, calculus and matrix problems. Users put in problems using an intuitive, math-friendly keyboard, before pressing \u201cgo.\u201d The app takes just a few seconds to display the answer in the form of an equation that is sometimes accompanied by a graph. The keyboard tool is handy, so long as you\u2019re not using it to cheat on math homework.

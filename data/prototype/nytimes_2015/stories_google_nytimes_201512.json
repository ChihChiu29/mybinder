Over all, Target is estimated to have spent almost as much as Walmart on advertising in the first nine months of the year \u2014 $335 million versus $367 million \u2014 even though Target\u2019s sales are less than a quarter of Walmart\u2019s, according to Kantar Media.", "The longest-serving Bullseye, now 13, is a rescue dog called Nikki who recently retired from the Target circuit after a 10-year career.

(Other animal mascots pose logistical challenges, like Geoffrey the Giraffe at Toys \u201cR\u201d Us or Tony the Tiger for Kellogg\u2019s Frosted Flakes.)

Recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885, the breed gained notoriety in the United States after Pete, a bull terrier owned by President Theodore Roosevelt, nipped so many visitors\u2019 legs that he was exiled to the Roosevelt home in Long Island.", "Still, the bull terrier has been featured in several TV shows and movies, including the 1968 musical \u201cOliver!\u201d based on the Dickens novel.

By not portraying a specific product, the campaign diverged greatly from traditional retailer ads at the time, and helped differentiate Target as a chic, even whimsical retailer.", "For the next decade, Nikki did the bulk of the work as Bullseye, making appearances at store openings as far away as Hawaii, attending Target fashion shows, strutting the red carpet at Target\u2019s Oscar night events and rubbing noses with the likes of Dustin Hoffman and Clint Eastwood.

Three generations of my family, smilingly lined up on one subway car bench: my mother, my stepfather-in-law, my mother-in-law, my husband, Matt; our two sons, Teddy, then nearly 2, and Felix, 4. I snapped a photo of this multigenerational tableau en route to a visit with longtime friends last fall.", "What the frame didn\u2019t show was that in 20 minutes, Felix\u2019s eyes would start swelling shut from some kind of mysterious allergic reaction; that the day would grow unbelievably hot and humid, terribly unfit for the superhero costumes that our sons wanted to wear for Japan\u2019s version of Halloween; that we would be swarmed by mosquitoes while waiting in interminable lines for candy at a neighborhood carnival. Anxiety about a recent dengue fever outbreak would increase, and we\u2019d seek solace in Benadryl and our friends\u2019 air-conditioned home. I would forget that I ever thought of myself as an intrepid traveler.", "For the moment, though, we were optimistic.", "The idea of a family caravan to Japan first took shape last fall, when my husband and I needed to fulfill various work obligations. Rather than leave the children at Grandma\u2019s, we decided to bring the grandmothers \u2014 and one grandfather \u2014 with us.", "Multigenerational travel can be a tightrope walk, especially with two children under 5. But we were game for the undertaking, because, well, before Japan, our mothers had never really been overseas. They were each on the cusp of retirement; they didn\u2019t often take trips out of their comfort zone, aside from travel to Canada and Mexico. We wanted to show them what was possible. We wanted them to be more than FaceTime figures to their grandchildren.", "And \u2014 let\u2019s be frank \u2014 we knew we\u2019d need some babysitting help. So Matt and I used long-banked airline miles and booked tickets to Japan for the seven of us.", "And we did hope for something extra. The Japanese word amae means to depend on another\u2019s kindness. The idea was introduced in the 1970s by an influential Japanese psychiatrist named Takeo Doi, who used it to explain the strong communal relationship between people in Japanese society. Kindness creates giri, or the obligation to return the kindness. And so a relationship begins, based on the desire to be taken care of, and on the anticipation of what someone else might need.", "It turns out that amae is not a bad way to think about our triple-generation time under one roof in Tokyo. After all, traveling successfully with others \u2014 whether it\u2019s family, friend or stranger, whether it\u2019s one companion or six \u2014 is as much about keeping someone else happy as it is yourself.", "I\u2019m a different person from who I was a decade ago when I first traveled to Tokyo, a free-spirited 20-something on an international adventure to visit old college pals. I remember the newness of it all, and quirky, wonderful encounters.

Even a stop at 7-Eleven on the street took on a whole new level of excitement with novelty candies and drinks like Crunky Popjoy, Pocari Sweat and DewDew. And, of course, there was the amazing crush of pedestrians crossing at the \u201cShibuya scramble,\u201d located above the Shibuya train station and one of the busiest intersections in the world.", "There\u2019s so much to delight and confound, but given that Tokyo is home to 13.5 million people, there\u2019s also ample risk of being overwhelmed by it all. The density of commuters in the labyrinthine subway system, not to mention the language barrier, can be intimidating. Matt and I tried to put ourselves in the shoes of our young children and our parents now in their 60s, to be conscious of their comfort. We rented two houses through Airbnb in different neighborhoods \u2014 leafy Azabu Juban, near the embassy district, and quiet Omotesando, just a few blocks from the avant-garde fashion runway of Harajuku Street \u2014 and spent a week in each.", "Outside of work, our goals were modest. We framed our trip as we would any other family visit: finding parks and playgrounds, grocery shopping, looking for places frequented by locals. We did our homework by scouring Google Maps, asking friends in Japan for advice, keeping our eyes open when walking around and learning to use Japanese phrases whenever possible.", "When you travel with your parents and your children, each person\u2019s particular way of seeing the world becomes apparent. My mom, Selena, a New Yorker born in China, preferred not to go out alone, because she was afraid of getting lost.

He ranged far and wide on solo adventures, to see the motor-mouthed hawkers of Akihabara\u2019s flashy electronics district, say, or the traders at the famous Tsukiji fish market, where most of the tuna in the world is bought and sold at auction. He took pictures of everything.", "At home in Sonoma, Calif., my mother-in-law, Robin, has a little farm, complete with animal menagerie \u2014 dogs, cats, finches, ducks, chickens \u2014 and in Tokyo she showed us her eagle eye for all things nature-related. Along a wooded path in Yoyogi Koen, a lush 134-acre expanse that is Tokyo\u2019s Central Park, she corralled us to admire a praying mantis perched on a blade of grass. Matt was always guided by his sweet tooth: On his way home each day, he dipped in and out of the many candy stores and bakeries that popped up on his radar.", "In these ways, we discovered the little rhythms that allow us to know a place. For me, it was a morning run, followed by a visit to the jewel-box neighborhood kissaten, or coffeehouse \u2014 hidden in the plant-lined front courtyard of the house next door \u2014 which served meticulously prepared espresso drinks beginning at 10 a.m. Over a week\u2019s worth of visits, I learned to show up promptly, with Felix, still in his pajamas, in tow, so that we could procure a few of the hundred or so tiny, beautiful vanilla custard tarts that the dapper young owner baked each morning and sold until they were gone.", "The children had their own knack for finding things that interested them. Omotesando\u2019s narrow lanes are winding and residential, with tucked-away shops and bricked-over bike paths. One rainy morning we spotted one of the miniature Japanese garbage trucks, manned by two uniformed workers who were tidying a playground. Felix, in love with all manner of vehicles, ran up to the men, only to be gripped by a sudden bout of shyness. He managed a whispered greeting: konnichiwa. One of the men cracked a smile. Felix darted away. Teddy jumped out of the stroller to run after his big brother on a landscape of large concrete animals painted in bright colors.", "It was when my mother followed \u2014 laughing helplessly as she chased the two boys around a big blue whale in the rain-slicked park \u2014 that I caught a glimpse of what we\u2019d all schlepped some 5,000 miles across the Pacific to experience. The bubbly feeling of shared discoveries, big and small. It was more than about sightseeing in Tokyo. It was about what feeds our relationships. It was about spending quality time together, and all of the minute yet meaningful details that come along with that.", "There were the home-cooked dinners, the little gifts. A box of plastic sushi for Felix, an impossibly tiny collection of farm-animal erasers for Teddy. The Lego sets from the corner toy store. Sending our parents to a fun meal at the kaiten sushi restaurant down the street, where dishes went around and around on a conveyor belt. Fast-food spots like this are commonplace, geared toward the local lunch crowd, families and tourists, and our parents could pick what they wanted without worry. There were the bedtimes our parents took care of so we could go out without children, once for a memorable, sake-soaked dinner at an upscale Michelin-starred izakaya, a bar that serves small plates.", "Sometimes we moved in a pack. Two floors above busy Harajuku Street, my family filled nearly all the barstools at the L-shaped lunch counter of a tiny Japanese curry joint that we stumbled upon. Wedged in the narrow space behind us was the umbrella stroller that held Teddy, slumped over in exhausted, jet-lagged sleep. We\u2019d carried him up the stairs like a drunken rajah.", "We were all ravenous from our morning walk through the greenery of Yoyogi Koen, but I was acutely aware that the ticking time-bomb of the slumbering 1-year-old could interrupt our meal at any moment. Our time was limited. As the cook passed the fragrant plates of steaming katsu curry with rice and vegetables over the counter \u2014 arigatou gozaimasu! \u2014 I relaxed. Just a little. Felix began gobbling bites of his savory, curry-doused fried pork cutlet. My mother looked at the food, then smiled at me, an eager, little-kid grin I don\u2019t see often enough. The smile was infectious, traveling down the line to Matt\u2019s parents, who dug into their plates, and then, to us. This is the kind of memory that sticks to your ribs.", "Moving in a pack requires opportunities for free range. We went for long strolls through the East Gardens of the Imperial Palace, part of the original Edo Castle compound, where the boys clambered over wooden bridges and over an old stone tower foundation, and to the Meiji Shrine, a serene, grand collection of buildings and gardens dedicated to the first emperor of modern Japan and his consort.", "Connected to Yoyogi Koen, the shrine and its grounds are one of the few tranquil, forested places in a city heavy on concrete, with wide gravel trails and dense stands of oak, pine and camphor. Inside the main shrine complex, all foot traffic stopped for a solemn, white-garbed Shinto wedding procession led by priests and shrine maidens. It was also where we admired the wishing walls of hanging ema, the prayers written on hanging wooden cards and left by visitors.", "I took a wooden card and transcribed Felix\u2019s one request: \u201cMore sushi.\u201d As for me, what more could I want? I had Felix on my shoulders and my family all around.

When the celebrated Google executive took over the web\u2019s most iconic basket case in 2012, the odds were stacked against her. Turning around any company is difficult; turning around a tech company is nearly unheard-of. There\u2019s just one example everyone can think of \u2014 Apple \u2014 but that effort took nearly a decade to show results, and anyway, if your requirement for success is to be like Steve Jobs, good luck to you.", "So the fact that Yahoo\u2019s board is now considering a sale of the company\u2019s web business \u2014 after months of pressure from activist shareholders and a mass defection of executives that has left morale spiraling \u2014 is hardly a shock. The hearse has been heading down the 101 freeway to Yahoo\u2019s sunny headquarters for years. Now it\u2019s pulling into the parking lot, and Ms. Mayer just happens to be the chief executive who will greet it.", "But what is genuinely surprising is how boring Ms. Mayer\u2019s tenure has been.", "Three years ago, when Ms. Mayer first took over, she sparked excitement about the future of a company that had, by then, put everyone to sleep. Finally, Yahoo was getting an executive who seemed to understand the web, who was infectiously excited about the possibilities of new technologies and who had a pretty good track record of ushering in new things.", "At the time, Yahoo was desperately in need of a new identity. The era of the web portal \u2014 a single website to serve all your online needs \u2014 had long passed, and Ms. Mayer seemed courageous enough to shed that legacy business and start something new. Few were betting that she would succeed, but just about everyone inside and outside the company thought it would be fun to watch her try.", "What has happened is more pedestrian. Ms. Mayer has focused Yahoo\u2019s resources on creating better mobile apps and a better video-viewing experience and building an advertising business that does away with old-fashioned banner ads. Nearly a year ago, I argued that some of these efforts were bearing fruit and that investors should give Ms. Mayer more time. Since then, progress has stalled, and Yahoo\u2019s recent earnings reports have been dismal.", "Yet the initial success followed by recent sluggishness is beside the point. The larger story of Ms. Mayer\u2019s tenure at Yahoo is one of a transformation so modest it borders on stasis. Over all, Yahoo remains much the same business it was three years ago. It is a far-flung collection of news, entertainment and communications destinations supported by ads. Ms. Mayer was hired to build something novel. Instead, at best, she appears to be building a better Yahoo \u2014 with debatable results.", "A Yahoo spokeswoman declined to comment.", "What is the different company that Ms. Mayer might have built? One idea was to ditch the web portal and plunge into television. \u201cOne transformational thing that she could have done was buy Netflix,\u201d said Robert S. Peck, an analyst who follows Yahoo for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "The timing was perfect: In 2012, a visionary might have guessed that cable bundles would soon be on the wane, that people would increasingly favor on-demand entertainment and that there was an appetite for new business models in an aging part of the media. At the time, the stock market doubted Netflix\u2019s streaming future, and the company\u2019s shares were less than a tenth of their current price \u2014 in the ballpark of what Yahoo would have been able to afford. Or if Netflix wouldn\u2019t sell, Yahoo could have built its own subscription-based original programing business, an in-house competitor to Netflix.", "Since then Netflix, which has poured money into creating a series of hit TV shows, has soared, and its subscription-based model for television has been widely hailed as the future of the industry. Ms. Mayer, on the other hand, bought the blogging platform Tumblr and a few other properties, \u201cbut for whatever reason, a lot of those just haven\u2019t paid off,\u201d Mr. Peck said.", "A defender might point out that Ms. Mayer eventually jumped into Netflix-like original programming and that the project failed. In 2014, Yahoo announced two new half-hour comedies and saved \u201cCommunity,\u201d the cult-hit NBC show, from cancellation. In October, it scrapped the whole project, citing a dearth of viewers and advertisers, and took a $42 million charge on the deal.", "But Yahoo\u2019s fumbled foray into TV only highlights Ms. Mayer\u2019s strategic failure. Instead of making a single big bet that might have focused the company on something completely different and potentially groundbreaking, Ms. Mayer staked out a lot of small and midsize positions, rarely committing to anything early enough to make a difference. For Ms. Mayer, original programming was just one of dozens of products in a portfolio that remains too complex to understand.", "So, too, were other projects that could have been at the center of Yahoo\u2019s new mission. In the time that Ms. Mayer has been at the helm, Facebook has invested heavily in messaging apps that could define the future of communication. Google and Apple, anticipating the eventual decline of text-based search queries, have tried to create predictive, voice-based search engines that also catalog all the content inside apps. Pinterest is pioneering a new kind of online commerce, while Instagram, Snapchat and Vine are working on new ways to tell collective narratives through video.", "Under Ms. Mayer, Yahoo has had a hand in many similar initiatives, but it hasn\u2019t led in any of these areas. If Ms. Mayer had picked a single project on which to hang the future of Yahoo \u2014 or, even better, some other new thing that no other company was working on \u2014 she could have accomplished something transformational, finally giving Yahoo a purpose.", "None of it would have been easy. Ms. Mayer\u2019s tenure has been consumed by confrontations with investors over the continuing complexity of spinning off Yahoo\u2019s stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Any big, expensive bet-the-farm decision to focus Yahoo on a single product would have been likely to anger investors even more and would probably have lowered morale among sidelined employees. The plan that Ms. Mayer pursued instead \u2014 to do a little bit of everything slightly better than Yahoo was doing it before \u2014 was by comparison pretty safe.", "But that\u2019s the trouble: Marissa Mayer wasn\u2019t hired to do the safe thing.

Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid, fueled as much by his mastery of Twitter and Instagram as by coverage on cable news, repeatedly foiled pundits\u2019 predictions that he would be crushed by more established candidates. In a different vein, the movement that forced news outlets to begin covering police abuse was driven by an army of activists armed with smartphones. Even its name was a hashtag: #blacklivesmatter.", "Then there were the regulators, who fared little better at understanding the implications of technology. Volkswagen\u2019s disclosure that many of its diesel cars had been equipped with software intended to cheat on emissions tests highlighted the power of hidden code, a problem that researchers have warned about for years and one that could grow more pernicious as our household items continue to be transformed into Internet-connected minicomputers.", "Officials appeared similarly surprised by the unabated rise of the ride-hailing service Uber, which hires contract workers through an app and whose business model seems poised to worm its way into other industries.

That plan has spooked ride companies across the world, which inspired the other big industry news of the week \u2014 an alliance between Lyft, Uber\u2019s tiny American competitor, and GrabTaxi, Ola and Didi Kuaidi, the three largest ride-hailing companies in Asia.", "Mike, you cover these ride companies: Can this global alliance really stop Uber?", "Mike: This is a tough one. On the one hand, you have Uber, a company that will soon have raised in private capital the equivalent of repeatedly winning the largest Powerball jackpots. It seems to have no problem raising money, at increasingly unbelievable valuations. It also hasn\u2019t wasted time expanding internationally, setting up small teams in dozens of countries.", "This is problematic for a company like Lyft, which is trying not only to gain recognition as a strong alternative to Uber in the United States, but is really only just beginning to dabble in international expansion.", "The other issue here is a question of cross-border travel. Lyft\u2019s pitch, with this coalition, is that people traveling between, say, China and the United States, will be introduced to the popular ride-hailing services in each other\u2019s countries for the first time. That, in their minds, begets repeat business and new customers.", "What\u2019s unclear to me is how many international travelers use ride-hailing services. Nor would Lyft tell me how much their expansion abroad costs (if anything).", "What do you think? It may be smart to team up with incumbents instead of fighting them on their own turf, which Uber is literally spending millions every day doing.", "Farhad: I think I understand Lyft\u2019s strategic theory. If ride sharing becomes a plausible alternative to car ownership (something that both Uber and Lyft believe is happening already) then the industry might be staggeringly large just in the United States alone. So why get greedy and risk lots of money and distraction by going after international markets? By making peace with many foreign rivals, Lyft gets to concentrate on fighting Uber here \u2014 and the others get to do the same in their own countries.", "I can see the logic in this, and I even think there\u2019s a pretty good chance it could work. Lots of American tech companies have tried to conquer China and India, and almost all have failed. Uber could squander lots of money trying. And maybe, just maybe, Lyft could emerge as a strong No. 2 here. In a market valued at hundreds of billions or possibly more than a trillion dollars, that\u2019s not a bad play.", "But it\u2019s a very optimistic scenario. Here\u2019s what could happen instead: Uber creates a near-monopoly in the United States, gets a foothold in other markets, and slowly expands that position to become dominant everywhere. So, sure, it\u2019s risky and expensive, but if it works, there\u2019s a big reward. And that gets to Uber\u2019s big advantage: Operationally, so far, Uber has proved to be masterful. So while I think Lyft\u2019s defense is smart, I would bet on Uber continuing to win.", "Mike: I want to try and see what it\u2019s like to do a cross-continental trip and ride in an Ola cab using the Lyft app. Maybe if the experience isn\u2019t terrible, it\u2019ll alleviate at least a little bit of my skepticism.", "O.K., enough business.

Aside from these services, there are no apps that fundamentally change people\u2019s lives in a large scale quite yet, such as on-demand transportation, O2O [online-to-offline] services, etc., because these services require integration with infrastructure that isn\u2019t yet well developed in Africa.", "Currently, the African smartphone market has two extremes: one, luxurious brands playing at the high end with prices inaccessible by 95 percent of the population, and, two, ultralow-quality products at the bottom end which are, for all practical purposes, essentially just feature phones with a touch screen, and little to no after-sales support. The African market is also notable for not having proper consumer protection regulation in place in most countries, which makes it possible for vendors to easily take advantage of consumers.", "The opportunity for Xiaomi in Africa is enormous, i.e. to offer high-quality smartphones with fast processors, large displays and long battery life, with the goal of driving up adoption of mobile Internet services, at affordable prices and reliable after-sales service and support.", "Will Xiaomi extend what you call the ecosystem \u2014 the production of Xiaomi products as varied as  the Mi Band and the Xiaomi air purifier \u2014 outside China?", "We are already selling some of our ecosystem products outside of China.

We have to grapple with it.\u201d", "The testimony was the first time Mr. Comey, a longtime critic of the technologies that he contends are creating a \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem for law enforcement agencies, had cited a specific example of a terrorist using encrypted communications. He said he would not comment on whether similar technology was involved in the time before the Paris attacks or the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif.", "In the Texas shootings, two men armed with rifles and wearing armor opened fire near an exhibit that was showing cartoon images of the Prophet Muhammad. Depictions of the prophet are considered offensive in most interpretations of Islam. The attackers were killed by the police, and the Islamic State claimed responsibility.", "There is no indication that the F.B.I. saw that such messages were exchanged before the shootings began or recognized that one of the suspects was talking to a foreign terrorist group member \u2014 something that might have been detected even if the authorities could not read the messages themselves.", "The White House concluded recently that there was merit to the arguments of companies like Apple that it is extremely difficult to create a \u201cback door\u201d for police or intelligence agencies to read such conversations without also creating a breach that Russian, Chinese or other determined hackers could exploit.", "But Mr. Comey argued in his testimony on Wednesday that the technology companies\u2019 defense of \u201cend-to-end encryption,\u201d in which only specific users of a phone or computer hold the keys, was rooted in business decisions.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a business model question,\u201d he said. \u201cGood people have made a decision to design products and sell products where court orders are ineffective.

In fact, a cellphone belonging to one of the attackers suggested that they had communicated using unencrypted text messages.

NRG Business was for conventional wholesale energy enterprises, including coal, nuclear and gas power plants. NRG Renew was focused on developing renewable energy sources \u2014 including large-scale wind and solar farms and microgrids \u2014 for commercial customers like businesses or governments.

The new green company, which NRG could eventually take public, could attract investment from people interested in growth and clean energy who would not ordinarily invest in NRG, Mr. Crane said at the time.", "But the moves were not enough. Now, how things go forward will be up to Mr. Gutierrez, 45, who has been at the company in various roles since 2004.

The data, for example, could tell police chiefs when sending a cop to do an extra drive through a Muslim neighborhood, or making sure that the town mosque was safe overnight, would be a good idea.", "Third, Muslim Americans are right to take some precautions. Like most grave threats, hate crimes are rare. Our model suggests that, if Islamophobic sentiment stays at its current level, about one in every 10,000 Muslims will be the victim of a reported hate crime over the next year, similar to the rate of automobile fatalities and orders of magnitude higher than the chance of being a victim of terrorism.", "The human capacity for rage and anger will never disappear. But there is a huge difference between this flare-up of hatred and those from decades past. We now have rich, digital data that can help us figure out what causes hate and what may work to contain it. That might offer some hope to Muslim Americans who see a country that right now appears more prone to fury than understanding."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/magazine/rebuilding-the-middle-class-the-army-way.html": ["A few weeks ago, I was sitting in a classroom at the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pa. There were 16 students, all in their early 40s and most of them lieutenant colonels, who had been selected to spend a year in this rural, peaceful place learning how to think strategically about war. In modern business, \u2018\u2018thinking strategically\u2019\u2019 has become a clich\u00e9 entirely devoid of meaning. But in the military, its meaning remains quite precise. As one person in the class told me, as a lieutenant colonel in a tank battalion, he was engaged in tactics: making sure that his tankers and their tanks were ready to fight. As a colonel, he would be concerned with strategy: advising on which enemies those tanks should engage and how.", "For the first time in their careers, these officers were being taught to think broadly, with readings that included everything from military theory to philosophy. The professor, Stephen Gerras, who holds a Ph.D. in industrial and organizational psychology and is a retired colonel himself, created an open, almost subversive atmosphere in the class. (To enable this openness, I agreed to some ground rules: I wouldn\u2019t name any of the students in the class or quote the specific things said.) It was thrilling to witness \u2014 all these people exploring, publicly, thoughts that felt dangerous to them. It reminded me of first-\u00adyear college students, except these were middle-\u00adaged people who had commanded thousands of soldiers in battle.", "The divide between strategy and tactics \u2014 between people who design the plans of war and those who implement them \u2014 is as old as organized armies. Interestingly, as laid out in what may be the single most important book of American business history, Alfred Chandler\u2019s \u2018\u2018The Visible Hand,\u2019\u2019 this military model was copied a century ago as the model for the hierarchical American corporation. In particular, these organizations borrowed the delineation between executives tasked with strategy \u2014 the corporate equivalent of colonels and generals \u2014 and tactical workers (enlisted soldiers) and midlevel managers, who played the role of captains, majors and lieutenant colonels.", "But then came global trade, computers and the Internet, and we learned that the military-\u00adinspired corporate hierarchy didn\u2019t work so well when information needed to flow far more quickly throughout an organization and decisions had to be made with haste. Many of the structural economic challenges we face today can be explained by the decline of this organizational form. Uber, Airbnb and Google are examples of new corporate forms that scramble the roles of managers and managed, strategy and tactics. There has been a continuous onslaught, over the last 40 years, on the midlevel managers Chandler once applauded. They have been replaced by email and Excel and outsourcing. Even many traditional-\u00adseeming companies brag about their flatter, leaner, less-\u00adhierarchical style. It would be hard to find any business-\u00adschool professor or corporate executive preaching the blessings of bureaucracy.", "These shifts may make business sense, but they come at a cost. Put simply: The disappearance of middle management is a central part of the disappearance of the middle class. Without large corporations that have a place for people at many levels of skill and ability and a reasonably clear path of promotion, tens of millions of Americans are left underemployed and underpaid. For much of the 20th century, companies would employ young people with few skills and invest in them, knowing that they would most likely be paid back over the employees\u2019 long tenure. Today, the United States military is one of the few employers in America that still makes this kind of investment in a demographically broad group of people. If we wanted to find a 21st-\u00adcentury form of organization that can help rebuild the middle class, we would need it to retain at least a little something from the institution most responsible for building the American middle class in the first place.", "In the discussions at the Army War College, nobody even considered tearing down the bureaucracy. To do its job, the military needs middle managers; it needs officers who understand the strategic vision of their superiors and who can translate it into a plan for battle. But the bureaucracy could be made more agile and effective if it was better able to send information up the chain, too, encouraging senior officers to pay more heed to those middle ranks. Gerras led a discussion of the many ways the military discourages candor from below.", "The most striking example came in a moment that, at first, confused me. The students were discussing a common frustration: the intransigence of supervising officers, even when presented with evidence that they were wrong about a decision. Then, one officer said something that seemed like a bizarre non sequitur: \u2018\u2018We need to change the pensions.\u2019\u2019 Everybody \u2014 except me \u2014 began to nod and agree enthusiastically.", "I grabbed Gerras afterward and asked him what everyone was agreeing about. All officers, he explained, know that after 20 years of active service, they can retire and receive half their salary \u2014 as much as $50,000 a year \u2014 for the rest of their lives. This means many of them spend their 30s simply trying to hold on to their commissions. The military has an up-\u00ador-\u00adout system, in which officers who miss two promotions are forced to resign, and promotions are largely determined by their commanding officers\u2019 recommendations. So, we have a military in which nearly everybody in their 30s has a huge financial incentive to keep his or her boss happy, no matter how wrong that boss might be.", "The Army War College itself is an example of how the military could improve its management style. The college is designed to take some of the most valuable people in the military, remove them from active duty for nearly a year and invite them to question their organization\u2019s very nature. And it is just one of many pockets of self-\u00adcriticism. Each of the services \u2014 Air Force, Navy, Marines \u2014 has a similar college, and there are dozens of semiautonomous think tanks that write reports about how lousy the military structure often is. Gerras himself is consistently amazed that the Army pays him every year to teach critical classes and to write scathing studies. (His recent paper with Leonard Wong, on the incentives for officers to lie to their superiors, was particularly explosive.) So far, though, these various studies have had minimal impact on most of the day-\u00adto-\u00adday workings of the military. (\u2018\u2018If Iraq didn\u2019t cause us to change things, I really don\u2019t know what will,\u2019\u2019 Gerras told me.)", "The question is whether the spirit of the Army War College could become, in a sense, the spirit of the Army \u2014 that is, whether its brand of creative self-\u00adcriticism could work its way into the day-to-day management of the military as a whole. Just before Thanksgiving, the Defense Department announced \u2018\u2018Force of the Future,\u2019\u2019 its most drastic plan for self-\u00adtransformation since World War II. Some of the reforms seem so obvious that it\u2019s shocking they didn\u2019t happen before. People will get a retirement plan even if they don\u2019t stay in for 20 years. Some will be offered the chance to leave active duty for a year or two to go work and learn at Google or some other private company and then return. Also, the military hopes to design something a lot like LinkedIn, so that officers can apply for jobs and be selected for them based on their interests and abilities, not just their ranks.", "The actual usefulness of the Pentagon\u2019s grand plans remains to be seen. (It\u2019s awfully hard to do something this ambitious \u2014 much of which requires congressional approval \u2014 in the last year of a president\u2019s administration.) I certainly hope the Defense Department becomes the most effective, adaptable bureaucracy it can be. But I also want it to stop short of becoming fully flat and lean, because the private sector could use a model for becoming less so. \u2018\u2018Bureaucracy,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018hierarchy\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018middle management\u2019\u2019 may all be cursed words these days in corporate America, but they might just be necessary to nurturing a middle class."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/redecorating-androids-quick-settings-box.html": [], "https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/in-paris-negotiators-trim-a-draft-climate-agreement-climate-scientists-press-for-nuclear-energy-activists-prepare-for-failure/": ["In theory, the goal of the Paris talks over a new global climate agreement is to create a more sustainable human relationship with the climate system by curbing emissions of greenhouse gases and boosting poor countries\u2019 capacity to withstand climate shocks.", "In practice this week, the goal seems to have been trimming pages from the bulky draft text, which still brims with disputed sections set off in forests of brackets.", "On Thursday the document was down to 50 pages,.

Here\u2019s Currier\u2019s core point: ", "[W]hile the world is huddled in Paris to map out the treacherous route to decarbonization, one major industrial country has already largely decarbonized that most central of emissions sectors, [electrical] energy \u2013 namely, the host of those other 200 countries, France. But there\u2019s little celebration or even mention of its accomplishment: that is because it was achieved through the \u201cdirty and dangerous\u201d nuclear power, and France itself is now acting under a new post-Fukushima plan that would vitiate this achievement, cutting nuclear by a third unless it is reversed.", "Let\u2019s compare some data on France and its old competitor Germany, now often seen as the \u2018greenest\u2019 industrial power. France has significantly fewer deaths and illnesses than Germany (and all other countries in Europe) from air pollution, as a result of nuclear power having displaced coal and other fossil emissions, while giving it some of the cheapest European electricity at the same time. In 2050, when Germany has finally completed its \u201cEnergiewende,\u201d it should still be producing some 0.2 gigatons of CO2 a year from energy production. But France is producing just 0.35 gigatons a year now, has already been producing about this much for decades, all while creating vastly more energy than it needs, helping power its neighbors such as Italy at the same time. Indeed, France is the largest exporter of electricity in the world, in 2004 providing almost a quarter of the electricity in Europe. One statistic, even if slightly exaggerated, might joggle the mind a bit: that is, that France creates its electricity with less than one tenth the carbon emissions of Germany per kilowatt hour. An order of magnitude less carbon than Germany, after all Germany\u2019s effort to \u2018green\u2019 its energy production with renewables? And 75% of the French fleet of nuclear plants were constructed in just 7 years! With no major accidents and such a record, it should be considered among the single greatest national accomplishments to date against climate change.

After a monthlong test, I abandoned running down and up the stairs at work every hour. It was a strategy to move more, but I found it too disruptive.)", "This January I\u2019ll test another resolution \u2014 to improve my memory. Asking colleagues to remind me what we discussed last week is embarrassing and wastes time. This is my motivation to change. I suspect a reason my memory isn\u2019t as good as it used to be is that I\u2019ve left no time in my day to reflect on and review past events or decisions. Life has become a constant blur of information and commitments. That\u2019s my obstacle to overcome.", "My plan: In January, I will dedicate a portion of my commute to reflection, letting my mind mull over whatever seems important. Will this resolution work?

That field has been pretty narrow lately, with so much of the news focused on murderous violence \u2014 from Paris to Colorado Springs. So let\u2019s take note: today is #GivingTuesday, the fourth anniversary of a day that offers a glimpse of the world beyond the pathological extremes: a view of the commonplace generosity and social concerns of millions of people.", "Giving Tuesday was introduced in 2012 by the 92nd Street Y in New York in partnership with the United Nations Foundation. Speaking with friends and colleagues, Henry Timms, the executive director of the Y, had observed that many people felt a jarring sense of disconnect between the Thanksgiving holiday \u2014 a moment to reflect on one\u2019s blessings \u2014 and the frantic consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday that follows it.", "The mission of the Y, a Jewish organization founded in 1874, is to foster the well-being, education and spiritual growth of people from diverse backgrounds and to promote participation in civic life. \u201cThe job of any stewards of a great institution is to renew its values over time,\u201d said Timms. \u201cHow do we shift them for a new generation?\u201d", "As he thought about Thanksgiving, he says, he wondered whether something could be done to circle the holiday back to its core: gratitude. What if there were a day immediately after the shopping spree that was focused broadly on giving?", "People were accustomed to end-of-year and holiday fund-raising appeals linked to religious holidays or tax-deduction deadlines, of course, but this would be different. It would be a day that was only about generosity for its own sake, with this premise:", "Most giving is done privately. What if the power of social media could be harnessed to allow many individuals and communities to come together around the act of giving \u2014 and make their collective impulses and messages visible to one another?", "\u201cAfter two days good for the economy, this would be a day good for the soul,\u201d Timms said. \u201cEvery time we talked about it, eyes lit up. We realized it had a broad appeal.\u201d", "Giving Tuesday has struck a chord. In three years, it has taken off well beyond its early partners\u2019 expectations. Earlier this year, a Harris Poll found that more than one in eight Americans is familiar with it. This year more than 40,000 organizations have registered to participate, while thousands more pursue giving-themed campaigns without direct association. Last year, activities were organized in 68 countries. Online giving for the Tuesday after Thanksgiving was four times higher in 2014 than in 2011, as registered by Blackbaud, the company that processes most online philanthropic donations. From 2013 to 2014, Network for Good, another online platform for fund-raising that serves many small and medium-size nonprofits, saw a spike in donations on Giving Tuesday of 145 percent.", "How did this come about? And how did it get off the ground with just a tiny team and no marketing budget to speak of?", "During the spring and summer of 2012, Timms and Asha Curran, director of the 92nd Street Y\u2019s Center for Innovation and Social Impact, traveled around the United States to build partnerships with leaders in the nonprofit sector, philanthropy, business, media and technology. Rather than present a pre-cooked formula, however, they invited people to shape the idea. \u201cWe asked everyone two questions,\u201d recalled Timms. \u201cHow could we make this a better idea? And: What could you do with your institution?\u201d", "The approach allowed many individuals and groups to assume co-ownership of the campaign, which was crucial to its success. The United Nations Foundation, led by Kathy Calvin, helped develop the communication strategy and subsequently took the lead spreading the idea internationally. Curran recalled that Adam Hirsch, who had been the chief operating officer at the web-based media company Mashable, crafted the social media outreach and advised that the idea not be branded by the founding organizations, but rather be framed as a collaboration open to all. Matthew Bishop, a senior editor at The Economist and co-author of the book \u201cPhilanthrocapitalism,\u201d gave advice on how to build a \u201cposse\u201d of key influencers and ambassadors. Rob Reich at Stanford University\u2019s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, helped figure out how to measure the campaign\u2019s impact. Many others played important roles.", "When the campaign began that September, the organizers had 75 days to build it. Curran\u2019s team created an array of tool kits: sample press releases and tweets, guides on how to pitch to a morning show, how to use social media creatively, and how to talk with your children about giving. They organized Google hangouts with nonprofit social media experts like Beth Kanter. The goal was to make it \u201cfrictionless,\u201d said Timms.", "Some advisers had suggested waiting a year to plan more judiciously. In retrospect, Timms believes that going fast proved critical: It kept matters clear. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a complicated idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a three-phone-call rule. If anyone took more than three phone calls to get on board it wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d", "He had hoped to attract a couple of hundred partners. They got 2,500.", "Among the earliest partners was DonorsChoose.org, an organization that makes it simple for people to support public school teachers\u2019 classroom projects. In the first year, DonorsChoose.org received contributions on Giving Tuesday totaling $69,086 from 752 donors. Last year, it received $379,199 from 3,947 donors.", "Some fund-raising professionals had worried that the day would cannibalize end-of-year funding. By contrast, it appears to have opened new streams of support. \u201cIt\u2019s additive,\u201d said Caryn Stein, vice president for communications and content at Network for Good. \u201cWe actually see people give twice in a month because there are different reasons to give.\u201d", "\u201cRoughly half of the donors each year on Giving Tuesday were brand-new to our site,\u201d added Katie Bisbee, the chief marketing officer at DonorsChoose.org. She helped build support for the day by reaching out to other nonprofit groups that included Kiva, Charity: Water and Global Giving.", "DonorsChoose.org noticed an interesting gender pattern. \u201cOur donors want to be reminded to give around the holidays,\u201d said Charles Best, the organization\u2019s founder. \u201cWe found that it\u2019s especially true of our male donors. Female giving tends to be more evenly distributed; male giving concentrates on special occasions. Men need an external prompt to remind them to be philanthropic.\u201d", "Today, they\u2019ll be getting a big one: DonorsChoose.org will be featured on the home page of Google, which will be providing half the funding for all of the group\u2019s teacher-led projects that focus on students with special needs.", "", "Perhaps the biggest lesson from Giving Tuesday is how much creativity a simple idea can unleash when it is unbranded and people are encouraged to freely repurpose and remix it. Timms sees this as an example of what he calls \u201cnew power.\u201d \u201cWith old power you create something perfect, and ask people to sign on to it,\u201d he says. \u201cWith new power, you create a context for people to add their identity and sense of agency.\u201d", "Witness some of the inventions: #GivingShoesDay, Dress for Success\u2019s efforts to advance a \u2018shoe-gooder\u2019 movement; #GivingZooDay, to highlight the importance of zoos and aquariums; #GamingTuesday, to galvanize gamers in support of Save the Children; #GivingTuesdayRamadan, organized earlier this year by the Syrian Community Network in Chicago to mark the second Tuesday of the Muslim holy month, and #GivingJewsDay, from the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit, to inspire people to improve their communities.", "There are also civic-oriented campaigns like #GuelphGives, in Ontario; #BoothbayTreasures, in Maine; and #MarylandGivesMore. And you can watch the Crowdrise Giving Tower grow, explore multilingual versions (#UnDiaParaDar, #DiaDeDoar, #MardiJeDonne), or enjoy the view from the #Unselfie, to see the faces, and hopes, behind the gifts.", "At least two new platforms are being introduced for this year\u2019s day: Small Token, an app (currently for the iPhone) that allows you to treat a donation to a nonprofit as a gift to someone else; and Catapultian, a web-based service that provides a charitable savings account for tax-deductible deposits and donations.", "While stories about the day often focus on money raised, there are many forms of giving \u2014 giving time, labor, knowledge or thanks, for example. Staff members at the United Nations Development Program have marked the day in previous years by rehabilitating a school for children with disabilities in Zimbabwe, leading a community blood drive in Burundi, and donating clothing and housing appliances to people living in slums in Bangkok. Some companies participate by organizing volunteer activities for their employees. This year the group Learning to Give is running a \u201cTeachOne\u201d campaign to encourage 10,000 teachers to lead lessons in philanthropy or civic responsibility. Today, Union Settlement, in East Harlem, will be handing out 500 single ride Metrocards. In exchange, they\u2019ll ask recipients to perform three acts of kindness.", "Since 2012, the meaning of the day has evolved subtly. Of course, many companies and organizations get involved to promote their own brands or work. But increasingly, groups take the opportunity just to say thank you and participate in something that transcends their own concerns.", "\u201cMost of what we do is about one topic \u2014 girls or education or whales,\u201d said Kathy Calvin, referring to the social sector. \u201cBut this is about celebrating the larger impulse.\u201d Asha Curran added: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t consider this just a giving day, but rather an opportunity to unite people around something positive at a particularly painful time for the world.\u201d", "Robert Reich, the former secretary of labor, has observed that the story of America is dominated by four essential stories, which he calls \u201cThe Triumphant Individual,\u201d \u201cThe Benevolent Community,\u201d \u201cThe Mob at the Gates,\u201d and \u201cThe Rot at the Top.\u201d All of these stories contain elements of truth. At any moment in time, one tends to dominate. These days, it seems to be \u201cThe Mob at the Gates\u201d \u2014 the story that we are \u201ccontinuously endangered by foreign menaces.\u201d", "It\u2019s a worrisome moment. If there is one thing we know about fear, it is that it tends to bring out the worst in people. In this context, Giving Tuesday provides an important and salutary counterpoint, an opportunity to see the \u201cBenevolent Community\u201d in action \u2014 the \u201cstory of neighbors and friends who roll up their sleeves and pitch in for the common good.\u201d Giving Tuesday is like a giant barn raising among people around the globe, made visible through social media.", "Underpinning the idea is the notion that individuals and societies have the potential to change course. As with genes, what is expressed in any society is a function of what is triggered. Giving Tuesday shows the power of creating contexts that bring out the best in people, rather than the opposite. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t have more of them.", "\u201cIt\u2019s important that we have these moments,\u201d says Timms. \u201cIt matters that we demonstrate our values.

Box\u2019s revenues were soaring, but its losses were growing nearly as quickly. It was pouring vast sums into sales and marketing, it had less than a year of cash remaining, and executives did not anticipate making a profit for years.", "When Box eventually went public this past January \u2014 after raising another round of private funds to delay its I.P.O. \u2014 its stock price briefly surged but has since lost about 40 percent of its value. The company reported on Wednesday that in the third fiscal quarter, it again increased sales, and it projected slightly higher sales in 2016 than it had previously expected.", "Now, with a stock market valuation of about $1.7 billion, Box is technically in league with the \u201cunicorn\u201d private companies valued at more than a billion dollars \u2014 but compared with some of those highflying start-ups, it could easily be mistaken for a pony. Dropbox, a cloud storage competitor that remains private, was valued at about $10 billion in its last fund-raising round.", "To many in Silicon Valley, Box\u2019s inauspicious debut on the stock market, like several other recent tech offerings, serves as a cautionary tale. While floating an I.P.O. was once seen as a rite of passage in Silicon Valley, in the last few years it has become a much bemoaned annoyance to many tech founders. Companies are waiting longer to go public, and thanks to a surge of money from hedge funds and mutual funds looking to get in on the start-up scene, young companies have been given resources to stay private for years on end. Go out to the public markets before you\u2019re bulletproof, the thinking goes, and you\u2019ll get crushed. No one wants to be the next Etsy, Hortonworks or Box, all of which now trade below their I.P.O. price.", "But what if Box gets the last laugh? Despite the company\u2019s languishing stock price, it\u2019s possible that a few years from now, many in the Valley may come to look back on Box\u2019s I.P.O. as a masterly timed bit of corporate strategy \u2014 an initially painful move that ultimately rewarded investors, improved employees\u2019 financial stability, provided executives with independence from unpredictable private investors and pushed the company to adopt a more structured path toward profitability.", "We may also wonder why other unicorns didn\u2019t go public sooner. I\u2019ll float one crazy idea for a company that should jump into the stock market: the ride-hailing company Lyft.

Lyft is locked in a knockdown, drag-out fight with Uber, its aggressive, moneyed competitor. By going public first, it could rake in some funds, gain a currency of stock with which to make acquisitions, recruit employees with shares that they can actually sell and set a benchmark valuation that could even affect Uber\u2019s valuation.", "To understand why, it helps to look at the market for private tech funding and how it is affected by public valuations. Several unicorns have recently discovered that taking money from mutual funds and other large investors brings surprising public scrutiny. The mutual fund company Fidelity and others must regularly report assessments of their private-company holdings, and lately they\u2019ve calculated that start-ups like Snapchat and Dropbox are worth less than what the funds paid for them. Dropbox\u2019s valuation, in fact, may now be tied directly to Box\u2019s, since large investors look at comparable public companies to help determine the value of their private investments.", "By going public first, Box has arguably boxed in Dropbox\u2019s horizons \u2014 and if Dropbox ever goes public, it\u2019s going to have to explain why investors should pay a premium over its already public competitor.

If you\u2019re an engineer looking to work at a cloud storage company, you could go to Dropbox, where you\u2019ll receive stock options at a lofty $10 billion valuation that you\u2019ll have a hard time turning into actual money.

Mr. Kalanick, by contrast, has argued for patience.", "This gets to Lyft\u2019s opportunity.

Lyft, which is three years old, is looking to raise $500 million in a round that would value the company at $4 billion, a fraction of Uber\u2019s total.

And, as I have said before, QR codes are so lame. But who knows? I certainly won\u2019t count them out quite yet.", "Farhad: Do you know what would be truly useful? Imagine if the app didn\u2019t just help you pay at checkout, but also let you scan all your goods as you took them off the shelf \u2014 allowing you to complete your purchase from anywhere in the store, and bypass the checkout lines entirely.

An East Village location is scheduled to open next fall, and a Chicago location is planned for 2017. Eventually all the schools will extend through eighth grade.", "The trend of the micro-apartment has an analog now in the micro-school. AltSchools are small by design. The Brooklyn branch has only 30 students spanning prekindergarten through the third grade; for those spots the school received 1,200 applications. \u201cPersonalized learning\u201d involves the customization of lesson plans to address the needs of individual students, in classrooms where rates of progress and areas of interest vary; technology enhances the process through the use of software and applications that can present various exercises, assessment tools, lines of inquiry and so forth for students. But even given that, meeting every child in his or her own developmental place requires a culture and atmosphere of intimacy, a level of attention from teachers that makes it challenging to imagine the model taking hold across large urban public school systems.", "Mr. Ventilla grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Buckley, Andover and Yale, institutions whose tuitions his parents could not afford. He benefited from scholarships and has made financial aid readily available at Alt, where one quarter of the students enrolled in the network\u2019s schools receive help. The student body at the Brooklyn location, where tuition is $28,900 a year, is strikingly diverse. Mr. Ventilla\u2019s own trajectory has served him well, but he has little use for traditional education.", "His complaints are familiar and often fair: The system is antiquated; it doesn\u2019t prepare students for a rapidly changing world guided by technological innovation; we are too reliant on testing; students do too little of what is applicable later. \u201cWhen, in professional life, are you ever required to sit at a desk, in a room, for three hours filling in answers in bubbles?\u201d he asked rhetorically one afternoon, seated his Brooklyn office. There is no formal testing to speak of at AltSchool, and little in the way of homework. Mr. Ventilla believes, he said, that the thousands of hours that children invest in learning foreign languages is almost surely a waste of time, given that translation technology will soon be good enough that we will all be multilingual.

The AltSchool philosophy is progressive to the point that some might find it anarchic, either wonderfully or maddeningly so. The curriculum isn\u2019t set; it evolves out of the interests of the students. In the lower grades at the Brooklyn school, teachers observed students for the first two weeks to see what inspired them.", "\u201cWe follow a cycle of inquiry,\u201d one teacher explained. Students were interested in transportation and neighborhood infrastructure, which led to the kindergartners learning about the East River. Third graders wound up studying the brain as part of a \u201cmindfulness\u201d curriculum, as one administrator put it. Benchmarks for knowledge and learning are embedded into whatever is being studied so that, presumably, no one graduates having never heard of Napoleon.", "Part of the school\u2019s marketing strategy is to make it very user-friendly for parents \u2014 if you need to change drop-off or pick-up plans, you can, and you do it on mobile devices. School vacations can happen at the parents\u2019 discretion. If you want to take your child with you on a weeklong business trip to Hong Kong, you can \u2014 this is considered another opportunity for learning.

This is a notion markedly absent in the boot-camp model of so many of the city\u2019s charter schools, where learning can too easily be divorced from pleasure, and fear rather than joy is the operative motivator.

He and his family flew out to California to meet her family, and everyone watched as he asked her to marry him.", "Weeks later, he proposed again, when it was just the two of them walking together on the Brandeis campus. He announced he had written a poem for her. (They have a tradition of writing poems to each other. His rarely rhyme; hers always do.)", "This particular poem contained the line: \u201cWill you be my Superwoman for the rest of my life?\u201d Then he knelt down and held out a toy Superman ring, which she proudly wore until he gave her one with a diamond to replace it in October.", "Their brief, businesslike wedding ceremony took place in the afternoon on Nov. 20 at the Salam center, a religious, educational and social services facility in Sacramento, Calif. The officiant, Imam Kashif Ahmed, sat cross-legged on the floor with the couple, their fathers \u2014 Ruknuddin Shaikh and Mohammed Naeem Asghar \u2014 and a few other male relatives. They talked quietly as they reviewed the wedding contract.", "It looked more like a study group than anything else. \u201cThe imam speaks and we essentially acknowledge if we want to be with our partner,\u201d Ms. Naeem said. \u201cWe just say \u2018yes\u2019 and we are married.\u201d", "The real celebration happened the next day at the Hilton Sacramento Arden West, in a ballroom filled with 210 guests. The groom stood on a stage in a white sherwani \u2014 a long coat and pants \u2014 as the bride walked toward him in a red, heavily brocaded and embroidered wedding lehenga that was closer to a piece of jewelry than a piece of clothing.", "The bride said that although the room was full of people, she just stared straight ahead at the groom\u2019s eyes. \u201cMy entire focus and energy was on him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018You will always be my destination.\u2019\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/business/dealbook/btg-pactual-and-the-perils-of-supervoting-stock.html": ["BTG Pactual offers a case against companies issuing multiple classes of stock. The investment bank\u2019s former boss, Andr\u00e9 Esteves, who is incarcerated, has ceded voting control in a stock swap with his partners. It\u2019s a neat fix, but reveals yet another risk of supervoting stock. Investors in companies with similar structures \u2014 like Google, Moelis & Company and nearly every major media firm \u2014 should take heed.", "Mr. Esteves was arrested on Nov. 25 on suspicion of obstructing an investigation into corruption at Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s state-owned oil company, and is being kept in jail pending trial. This week he stepped down from his executive roles at BTG Pactual. Such a scandal is damaging enough for any bank, which relies on investor confidence to function. But Mr. Esteves also owned about a quarter of the company\u2019s equity, and his golden share gave him veto power over strategic decisions.", "Swapping seven senior partners\u2019 nonvoting preferred stock for Mr. Esteves\u2019 stake appears to have resolved this aspect of the scandal. A terse release put out by the company did not offer any details on the terms but did explain that he no longer controls the company and that the exchange was pursuant to its bylaws.", "That last point appears to show that BTG Pactual had at least prepared for extracting itself from its entrenched shareholder if things went awry. This form of key-man risk, though, does not get anywhere near the attention of a top employee dying or quitting the firm.", "More American firms are opting for dual-class stock. It gives Ken Moelis more than 90 percent of the vote at his mergers and acquisitions firm. Last year, Google introduced a third class of stock, which has no votes, to ensure the founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page retain absolute control. It\u2019s simply not obvious how these and other firms with multiple classes of shares will deal with unexpected situations. Bylaws to deal with them may not exist at all, may not cover all eventualities, or could be disputed.", "Supervoting stock creates a host of problems. It makes companies harder to analyze, creates a risk a firm will not be run in the best interest of all investors and encourages insiders to think of a corporation as their fief. What happens when an unexpected event \u2014 such as an accusation of crime, or mental incapacity \u2014 affects a controlling shareholder is a risk that deserves more investor attention."]}

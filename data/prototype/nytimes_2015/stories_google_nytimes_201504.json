Yet Americans are all too willing to take the bait; according to The New York Times, \u201cmost Americans are inured to being tracked online, and don\u2019t think privacy is worth $29 a month.\u201d", "In addition, the NSA is colluding with the corporations to spy on Americans. According to CNET, this agency asks tech companies to hand over their customers\u2019 data. The NSA also wiretaps on fiber-optic Internet cables to gather data about Americans\u2019 Internet usage. It also tries to justify its mass surveillance as an anti-terrorism effort that has stopped dozens of attacks. However, two U.S. Senators have debunked this claim by stating that the same terrorist plots were instead foiled by standard law enforcement. The NSA\u2019s surveillance eerily resembles that of 1984\u2019s Big Brother, who also claimed to protect people for the price of privacy. As Benjamin Franklin once stated, \u201cThose who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one.\u201d", "Indeed, it is time for America to do something about this massive digital surveillance. Currently, the U.S. government is heavily lobbied by tech corporations to avoid passing digital privacy laws. Ordinary Americans lack the wealth of CEOs, so they should rely on their strength in numbers to fight for privacy. Americans can take to the streets and organize rallies, picketing the corporations and government to grant more privacy. Street protests successfully secured racial equality in the civil rights era, so common Americans can protest to become equal with the government and corporations. The Internet is a double-edged sword; it is a vehicle for surveillance, but also a valuable tool for publicly promoting digital privacy. With millions of people condemning surveillance on social networks and blogs, the corporations and government might relent to public demand for privacy. In the meantime, though, the best way to stay discreet on the Web is to share a minimum of private details with companies.", "Americans must act immediately to defend their digital privacy \u2014 or be silenced forever by the dictatorial corporations and government.", "Sources", "Angwin, Julia.\u201cHow Much Should People Worry About the Loss of Online Privacy?\u201d The Wall Street Journal, 11 Nov. 2011.", "Bajaj, Vikas. \u201cPutting a Price on Privacy: $29.\u201d The New York Times, 19 Feb. 2015.", "Ball, James. \u201cNSA\u2019s Prism Surveillance Program: How It Works and What It Can Do.\u201d The Guardian, 8 June 2013.", "Bergen, Peter and David Sterman. \u201cDid NSA Snooping Stop \u2018Dozens\u2019 of Terrorist Attacks?\u201d CNN, 18 June 2013.", "Cosgrove, Ben. \u201cThe March on Washington: Power to the People.\u201d Time, 27 Aug. 2012.", "Dreyfuss, Benjamin and Emily Dreyfuss. \u201cWhat Is the NSA\u2019s PRISM Program?

For professionals, there are software programs like EstateWorks, which law firms use to manage estate planning and settlement. Mr. Stickel says that such products are overkill for most people. So EstateExec focuses mainly on guiding consumers, offering them an interactive way to list and track financial assets and accounts as well as individual items, like jewelry and family heirlooms.", "An important feature, Mr. Stickel said, is a tool that allows the executors the option to share online access with other family members \u2014 or a lawyer, if they choose to work with one. That helps promote transparency and fend off mistrust that can fester among family members, who may question why the process is taking so long, he said, since it\u2019s common for completing an estate to take six to 18 months.", "The tool offers a timeline, with a list of specific tasks to be accomplished. For instance, right away, you\u2019ll arrange a funeral or memorial service \u2014 not legally required, but traditionally done by the executor; locate the will; and order official copies of the death certificate, which you may need for dealing with government agencies (like the Social Security Administration), banks and the like.", "The tool also offers tips, like this advice regarding death certificates: \u201cBy far the easiest way to get these certificates is to request them via the funeral home or crematory at the time they file the original.\u201d Get at least 10 copies, it advises; if you need more later, getting them from government agencies can be difficult and time-consuming, so it is \u201cbetter to order too many than not enough.\u201d", "Rules regarding estate law vary by state. So the tool suggests steps based not only on where the deceased person lived but also on where you, the executor, live, Mr. Stickel said.", "Jonathan G. Blattmachr, a fellow of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel, who isn\u2019t affiliated with EstateExec, said such checklists could be extremely helpful to some people as a tracking system. But he noted that the site included this caveat: \u201cYou almost certainly need a lawyer if the estate is very large, the will is particularly complex or there will likely be litigation.\u201d He also notes that many professional organizations, like Actec, offer free online consumer resources.", "Mr. Stickel, who isn\u2019t a lawyer, said the tool had been reviewed by multiple lawyers. EstateExec costs $79 per estate, regardless of the amount of time it takes to settle. The tool was produced by Judy\u2019s Applications, a Silicon Valley software company.", "Here are some questions about estate executors:", "\u25a0 How do I become the executor of an estate?", "Typically, an executor is named in a will. But even so, a court \u2014 typically a probate court, but sometimes a circuit or county court \u2014 must formally appoint you executor, said Ms. Randolph, the author of \u201cThe Executor\u2019s Guide.\u201d That gives you official authority over the dead person\u2019s accounts and assets. If there\u2019s no will, or if the preferred executor is unavailable, the court will appoint someone to manage the estate. (Typically there\u2019s a priority list: spouses, followed by adult children and so on.)", "\u25a0 Do executors receive payment for their services?", "Executors are often entitled to \u201creasonable compensation\u201d for fulfilling their duties, Ms. Randolph\u2019s book notes. But often, family members don\u2019t feel comfortable taking a fee. Also, such payment is considered taxable income, so if you\u2019re inheriting money anyway, in most cases you\u2019ll be better off waiving a fee and collecting the inheritance, which is generally not subject to income tax, she notes. (One exception might be for extremely large estates subject to the federal estate tax; in that case you should be working with tax experts anyway.)", "\u25a0 Should I hire an estate lawyer?", "If you\u2019re uncertain, Ms. Randolph advises meeting with a lawyer for 30 minutes to an hour to help get a road map of your specific situation. She also suggests seeking referrals from people you know and getting more information from area senior centers. Mr. Blattmachr recommends emailing several lawyers, specifying the size of the estate. Ask what staff would handle the work, and how much they would charge."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/business/international/formal-charges-may-be-next-in-europes-google-antitrust-inquiry.html": ["BRUSSELS \u2014 As Europe\u2019s antitrust investigation of Google has dragged on without a settlement for nearly five years, the American technology giant has had some breathing room to continue its domination of Internet search on the Continent.", "That period of relative freedom for Google may soon come to an end.", "Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner overseeing antitrust issues, on Wednesday will make her first trip to Washington to participate in two antitrust conferences.

In other words: Take a leap of faith (well supported by science) that downtime will lead to a healthier perspective.", "Dr. Morton Silverman, a psychiatrist and senior science adviser to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suggested that another answer is recognizing that the doublespeak also betrays a sense of terror about the future among both students and parents.", "With the economy in flux and the income gap growing, parents don\u2019t see a clear path anymore to financial stability \u2014 even here, maybe especially here, where things move fast and competition is fierce. In addition, many of the fortunes made here have been based on creating things that destabilize traditional businesses and their workers.", "So confront the new realities, Dr. Silverman suggested, urging parents to say something like: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you which path to take or how to get there, but I will support you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to back you up.\u201d", "It\u2019s a hard message to hear in a can-do place like this.", "Walking near the train tracks where the children laid themselves down, Dr. McGee said this community, if any, should have answers.", "\u201cCan we put sensors up there?\u201d he mused quietly to me, maybe to alert the train operators that someone has climbed onto the tracks. \u201cThis is Silicon Valley.

These are the clock face, the notifications panel, apps and glances.", "Let\u2019s go over them here:", "The face is just what it sounds like, one of 10 different timepiece screens you can choose from that show the time, and, on some screens, lots of extra information, including the date, calendar entries, or the position of the sun in the sky. As with most smartwatches, the Apple Watch\u2019s screen is usually off. It turns on to show the clock face when you turn your wrist toward your face.", "If you swipe down from the clock face, you\u2019ll see the notifications panel. Think of it as you would the list of notifications on your phone \u2014 tiny missives from apps seeking to get your attention. Some notifications will also trigger alerts that will cause the watch to make a sound or to buzz its \u201ctaptic engine,\u201d the mechanism that causes the watch to tap on your wrist.", "Apps on the watch are similar to those on a phone: They\u2019re little programs that perform discrete functions. The watch comes with more than a dozen apps made by Apple, and many third-party developers, including The New York Times, have also built watch apps that are companions to their iPhone apps. The watch apps are packaged with iPhone apps; when you install them on your phone, they automatically become available for your watch.", "The final primary interface element \u2014 and the one that feels the least Apple-y, because it adds a layer of confusion without much attendant utility \u2014 is something called a glance. Glances are quick, summary views of certain apps that you can see by swiping up from the watch face. For instance, the glance for the Weather app shows you the current temperature and your location; the Calendar glance shows you your next appointment.", "If all this sounds complicated, you\u2019re right. It is slightly difficult to get the hang of the Apple Watch, at least at first. The biggest problem is figuring out which types of actions are available on which screens. For instance, if you get an email notification, you can\u2019t swipe left on the message to archive it, because that quick action is available only from the Mail app, not the notification for the Mail app \u2014 which is confusing, because the two screens are nearly identical visually. Or, if you\u2019re in the glance for the Maps app, you can\u2019t move the map around; to do that, you\u2019ve got to go to the full Maps app, which looks initially just like the glance.", "It took me at least a day to feel confident at shuttling around the different parts of the watch. Since it\u2019s a brand-new device, it stands to reason there will be a bit of a learning curve involved. Still, the Apple Watch presents an uncharacteristic first impression, one that many may find daunting.", "For several years, some techies have argued that the best way to separate us from our phones is to add some new device to our lives, preferably something attached to our bodies. This was the main justification for Google Glass, and in the last few weeks it has become one of the major arguments in favor of the Apple Watch. The theory goes like this: Because it is fixed on your wrist, and because its interface is tuned for quick interaction rather than complex tasks, a smartwatch can let you take care of digital demands faster than your phone.", "This idea is nice, but to get it to work, you\u2019ve got to decide which notifications you want to get on your watch, and which you don\u2019t. When you first set it up, the watch generally mirrors the notifications you\u2019ve set for your phone: If you now get an iPhone alert when a friend changes her Facebook profile photo, you\u2019ll get one on your Apple Watch. (The system is smart enough to alert you in just one place \u2014 it doesn\u2019t buzz your watch if you\u2019re looking at your phone.) But because the phone and the watch are such different devices, mirroring notifications between them often makes little sense.", "For instance, since there\u2019s isn\u2019t (yet) a Facebook app for the Apple Watch, notifications for Facebook on the watch are essentially useless \u2014 your wrist buzzes with a note that your friend has changed her profile photo, but when you tap the Facebook notification, nothing happens.", "Even for apps that are available for the watch, mirroring the phone\u2019s notifications is not necessarily the best decision. Do you want every email to buzz your wrist, or just those from your VIPs? How about social apps like Twitter \u2014 when should you let them ring your watch?", "I spent many hours pondering such questions, and there was a lot of fine-tuning in the notification screen on my phone. In other words, it didn\u2019t just work.", "On your wrist, the Apple Watch feels like any other watch. It isn\u2019t too big, it isn\u2019t too heavy, and it is handsomely elegant without being flashy. The shiny Milanese band was my favorite of the three I tried, even though its magnetic clasp periodically loosens up during the course of the day, requiring adjustment. Like anything you wear for the first time, you\u2019ll notice the watch in the early hours after you put it on, but you\u2019ll quickly forget it\u2019s there until you need it.", "I was surprised to discover that the Apple Watch didn\u2019t command much notice from others, either. I used it in public in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Manhattan for a week, and only a handful of people asked what it was.", "Even when I made a show of using it, like holding it up to pay for groceries at Whole Foods or to present my digital boarding pass at San Francisco International Airport, nobody really said anything.", "By the way, it worked perfectly at Whole Foods and at the security checkpoint at the airport, but there was a hitch before boarding the plane \u2014 my wrist couldn\u2019t fit under Virgin America\u2019s scanner, so, like a time traveler visiting from the olden days, I had to access the boarding pass on my phone. #Firstworldproblems.", "When Apple unveiled the watch last year, it did not specify how long the battery would last between charges. For me, the battery consistently lasted at least a full day. On a day of heavy use it got to about 10 percent of power left by bedtime. But on most days I noticed robust battery life, with 20 to 30 percent remaining on the battery bar at the end of a day, which is far better than I fare with my phone. The watch\u2019s charger, a little magnetic disc that sits on your bedside table, is excellent. The watch attaches and detaches from it with ease, so charging it nightly isn\u2019t difficult.", "Another unexpectedly nice feature was making phone calls from my wrist. It sounds dumb. It looks dumb. But when I got a call in the middle of something else \u2014 cooking, slumping on the couch \u2014 tapping my wrist and chatting was easier than searching for the phone. You don\u2019t have to hold your wrist up to your face like Dick Tracy; the microphone is powerful enough to pick up sound while you use your hands normally. In a strange way, the watch makes phone calling \u2014 which smartphones have been killing in favor of messaging \u2014 more interesting than texting, because the watch has no alphanumeric keyboard.", "You can send messages from the watch, but it\u2019s limited. One way is to dictate your message, but that isn\u2019t perfect. You can also send emoji or default responses (things like \u201cO.K.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m on the way!\u201d), but those options aren\u2019t often sufficient to get across a range of emotions.", "For similar reasons, Apple has restricted outbound email. You can triage your messages \u2014 archive them, mark them as read or unread, flag them \u2014 but you can\u2019t respond, not even with emoji or canned responses like my standard response to most emailers, \u201cThanks but no thanks, chump.\u201d I found this less than stellar: I would have loved at least a set of canned responses. In general, I found the Mail app to be something of a pain to use, and I\u2019m hoping that Apple or some third-party creates the perfect mailbox for the watch.", "There is something magical about having a computer that no one notices right there on your wrist. I first experienced this magic while at lunch with a colleague. I\u2019m usually a wreck at such meetings, because while I try to refrain from looking at my phone, my mind is constantly jonesing for the next digital hit.", "Lunch today is different. My iPhone remains hidden deep in my pocket, and to all the world I am the picture of the predigital man. It is the middle of the workday, the busiest time for digital communication. Yet with the Apple Watch on my wrist, my mind remains calm, my compulsion to check the phone suddenly at bay. After spending the last few days customizing my notification settings, my watch is a hornet\u2019s nest of activity. It buzzes every few minutes to indicate incoming email and texts, tweets or Slack messages.", "The buzzes aren\u2019t annoying. They go completely unnoticed by my colleague, while to an addict like me they\u2019re little hits of methadone \u2014 just enough contact with the digital world to whet my appetite, but not nearly as immersive, and socially disruptive, as reaching for my phone and eyeing its screen. I not only register the watch\u2019s buzzes, but several times while we\u2019re chatting, I surreptitiously check its screen. I scan some incoming messages and tweets, and even flag a couple of emails for later.", "At the end of the meal, I ask my colleague if she\u2019s noticed me checking my watch. She is surprised; she hasn\u2019t seen it.", "The Apple Watch has two ways of measuring physical activity. One way is passive: In the background, it constantly measure your steps, how often you stand up and, periodically, your heart rate. It displays these three activities ingeniously; there is a diagram depicting three rings that become fully-closed circles as you get closer to completing your daily activity goals. As you go through the day, the watch prompts you to move around more often if you start to feel slothful. Every hour, it reminds you to stand up.", "I found the prompts helpful. There\u2019s nothing revolutionary about it; I\u2019ve tried lots of activity trackers in the past, and the watch doesn\u2019t do much more than the cheapest ones. But as part of a device that you\u2019ll wear for other reasons, having a general-purpose health app is pretty handy.", "The Apple Watch can also measure more strenuous exercise. There\u2019s a dedicated app to track your runs, bike rides and other physical activity. After some initial calibration with your phone, the watch can measure your workout distance even when you leave the phone at home. I would love to tell you that the app put me through its paces, but that would be a lie. I spent most of the week as I normally do \u2014 with slight but hardly strenuous daily activity, and never quite approaching the level of an actual workout.", "The cynic might point out that even if the Apple Watch does liberate you from your phone, your escape is only illusory \u2014 you\u2019re still attached to the digital world, and you\u2019re only escaping for yet another screen. Is that really a positive direction either for you or for society? And to the extent that the watch begins to replace your phone, won\u2019t you just start spending more of your time on its tinier screen, eventually rebuffing the real world again, just like you did on your smartphone?", "Surely smartwatches aren\u2019t going to be a panacea for tech-induced antisocial behavior.", "But after a few days with the Apple Watch, I get a sense that they do more good than harm. It\u2019s not just that interactions on the watch are speedier and less socially intrusive than those on the phone. The Apple Watch also has another, hidden benefit: It is far less immersive than a phone. There just isn\u2019t that much to do on such a tiny screen, so you rarely feel yourself getting sucked in and lost.", "Consider this: The Apple Watch has no web browser. If you come upon a web link in an email message, a tweet or some other app, tapping it does nothing. This absence eliminates whole avenues of procrastination \u2014 there\u2019s no Google, Wikipedia or BuzzFeed.", "While there are some news and entertainment apps for the watch, they consume precious little time.", "And that, to me, is the biggest difference between this device and a phone.

Yet the Wall Street consensus is that Apple is still having a growth spurt. In fact, if Apple\u2019s watches, phones, laptops and other gadgets and services keep generating favorable publicity \u2014 and if its quarterly earnings report on Monday is as strong as the market expects it to be \u2014 there\u2019s a reasonable chance that Apple\u2019s value will keep swelling. Not far down the road, it might even reach the $1 trillion level that some hedge funds predict.", "But even if Apple still has some room to run, there are some early warning signs. After all, the company has already crossed a significant threshold. In February, it grew to twice the size of the next biggest company in the S.&P. 500, a rare feat of financial dominance, and one that hasn\u2019t happened since Ronald Reagan was president.", "I checked the numbers with Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. He found that the last market colossus to tower over its competitors by a two-to-one ratio was IBM, which did it in three successive years: 1983, 1984 and 1985. \u201cThat was when PCs were new,\u201d he said, \u201cand just about everyone thought IBM would rule the world.\u201d", "Now it\u2019s Apple\u2019s world. Apple is the most widely held stock in American mutual fund portfolios. IBM, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, isn\u2019t even in the running anymore. It ranks 62nd, according to a Morningstar analysis performed at my request. IBM is still an important company, but it is struggling. Investors judge it to be worth less than one-quarter of Apple\u2019s market value today. What happened to IBM \u2014 how it became this small, in comparison with Apple \u2014 is worth remembering.", "I had forgotten how imposing IBM once was. By some measures, it was vastly more important than Apple is today. Measured by market cap, for example, IBM accounted for a staggering 6.4 percent of the S.&.P. 500 in 1985, IBM\u2019s peak year \u2014 making it 2.35 times the size of the second-biggest company of its day, Exxon. Now Microsoft is the second biggest and Exxon Mobil is third, both roughly one-half the size of Apple. Exxon Mobil is followed in market cap by Google and Johnson & Johnson. (On this 45th anniversary year of Earth Day, the staying power of Exxon, from its Standard Oil days to the present, is also worth remembering.)", "Apple has an outsize influence today: After the market close on Friday, its share of the S.&.P. 500 was 4.1 percent, a formidable percentage and a huge increase from Dec. 31, when it was 3.35 percent. But its weight in the market is nothing like IBM\u2019s in the 1980s, when IBM finished seven calendar years with a market weight above 4 percent \u2014 a showing that Apple has not yet met, the data shows. At IBM\u2019s 1985 peak, its share of the S.&P. 500 was more than one and half times the size of Apple\u2019s today.", "IBM operated in a different league than Apple does now. A business machine company at its roots, IBM never aspired to pop-culture coolness, but its prestige was extraordinary. You can\u2019t measure prestige easily with numbers, but consider that in 1987, two IBM scientists based in Zurich won the Nobel Prize in Physics for a breakthrough in superconductivity. It was the second consecutive year that IBM scientists won the prize; in 1986, two of them won it for inventing an instrument known as the scanning tunneling electron microscope. All of those scientists did deep, basic research of which IBM was justly proud. Apple\u2019s research today is impressive, but it has generally been product-driven, not the kind of fundamental work that IBM did.", "With hindsight, it\u2019s clear that IBM\u2019s Olympian status was part of its problem. In the 1980s, at the height of its powers, it continued to come up with scientific breakthroughs and ultrafast computers, but its focus on its own product lines and customer service flagged. IBM \u201cna\u00efvely\u201d handed over crucial parts of the computer business to companies like Microsoft and Intel, while its own profit margins began to erode, D. Quinn Mills, a professor at the Harvard Business School, has written.", "For the most part, investors minimized those problems, if they were even aware of them. In those days of hulking mainframes, IBM was the quintessential computer company and its hegemony in the stock market seemed unstoppable.", "It\u2019s no wonder that a young Steve Jobs, the co-founder of the upstart Apple Computer company, took direct aim at IBM in a speech in San Francisco in the fall of 1983, deriding IBM as arrogant and shortsighted and predicting that it would soon be humbled. At that meeting, he unveiled a remarkable ad that would run on television during the 1984 Super Bowl. Created by the director of \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d Ridley Scott, it showed a young hammer-wielding athlete running through a vast grim room populated by serfs.

And soon after the Super Bowl, when Jobs actually introduced the first Macintosh to a rapt audience, the little personal computer continued the assault on IBM. In a cute synthesized voice, it spoke these words, which also appeared on its diminutive screen: \u201cUnaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I\u2019d like share with you a maxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe: NEVER TRUST A COMPUTER YOU CAN\u2019T LIFT.\u201d", "IBM thrived for years afterward, but just as Jobs had predicted, it turned out to be vulnerable to disruptive change, as all big companies are. For decades now, IBM has engaged in a sometimes painful transition, and as it revealed in its quarterly earnings report last week, it is still hurting: Its revenues have declined and it has endured wrenching business shifts. My colleague Steve Lohr wrote last week that IBM has been getting out of slow-growing old businesses, like personal computers, disk drives, low-end server computers and chip manufacturing \u2014 but its new initiatives in fields like data analytics, cloud computing and mobile apps for corporate customers haven\u2019t entirely succeeded yet.", "In a turnabout, IBM\u2019s mobile app strategy relies on a partnership with the current giant, its old nemesis Apple.

Marketers will then be able to adjust their ad spending accordingly \u2014 for example, moving more money into mobile advertising if that appears to be where more consumers are responding.", "The platform will also consolidate most of the ad companies that AOL has purchased in recent years, including Adap.tv, which it bought in 2013 for $405 million. AOL\u2019s platform is open, meaning advertisers are able to use the technology alongside that of competitors\u2019.", "\u201cAOL\u2019s mission has at its heart the \u2018simplification\u2019 of the digital space,\u201d Tim Armstrong, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.", "Ad companies are racing to offer marketers tools to buy ads, manage ad spending and gauge the effectiveness of online campaigns. The goal is to target consumers at the right time on the right medium.", "To that end, AOL has been steadily building up its ad technology in recent years with the goal of gaining a bigger piece of the advertising market. The research firm eMarketer, for instance, predicts that AOL will control 3.5 percent of the $27.05 billion digital display ad market in the United States this year.", "The unveiling of ONE comes two weeks before the annual NewFront presentations in New York, during which media companies try to woo advertisers with original programming and new technology. AOL\u2019s NewFront presentation is on April 28."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/technology/case-against-google-may-be-undercut-by-rapid-shifts-in-tech.html": ["The antitrust case against Google filed by European Union regulators on Wednesday will inevitably draw comparisons to the long-running prosecution of Microsoft, in which regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pursued the software giant for anticompetitive behavior.", "But Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, may not find the comparison entirely flattering. With more than a decade of hindsight, the theories supporting the case against Microsoft have all but fallen apart, and the pursuit of the company that makes Windows may suggest a reason for skepticism about this fight against Google: The tech marketplace is fluid and unpredictable. The giants that look most unbeatable today could falter in ways that may once have seemed unthinkable \u2014 and without a lot of help from the government.", "\u201cIn the Microsoft case, if they\u2019d just waited a while, the problems they thought they saw would have disappeared because technology, consumer behavior and the market demand changed enough to correct those problems,\u201d said Geoffrey A. Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law and Economics, a policy research organization that has received funding from technology companies including, in the past, Google. In a 2013 law review article comparing the antitrust pursuit against Google to the Microsoft case, Mr. Manne was more succinct: \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s market position was unassailable ... until it wasn\u2019t.\u201d", "The same, he said, could turn out to be true of Google. The rise of mobile devices and the prevalence of apps could make the traditional search engine less central. And if the regulators emerge victorious, they could end up constraining Google in a way that makes its services less useful to consumers \u2014 which would be a hollow victory indeed.", "The similarities in the cases against Microsoft and Google are striking. Microsoft once had a dominant position in the worldwide market for computer operating systems: Windows was installed on nearly 90 percent of desktop computers. Google\u2019s current position in the market for web search engines looks similarly unbeatable: The company claims nine out of every 10 searches in Europe.", "In 1999, a federal judge ruled that Microsoft had abused its operating system monopoly by pushing users into some of its other products, especially its web browser, Internet Explorer. The court found many instances of unfair competition against Intel, Apple, IBM and Netscape. Among other bits of mischief, Microsoft blocked Netscape Navigator, then the dominant browser, from getting crucial technical hooks into Windows.", "Now Google is said to have behaved in a similarly abusive way. In a 2012 report by Federal Trade Commission staff members that was recently uncovered by The Wall Street Journal, regulators found that Google increased the prominence of its services above competing \u201cvertical search engines,\u201d like those for shopping, travel and local services.", "The investigation also found that Google brazenly copied content from competitors to improve its services. For instance, the company used Amazon\u2019s product rankings to determine how to rank products in its own shopping search engine. The F.T.C. and Google later settled. Still, the European Commission\u2019s new charges echo the F.T.C.\u2019s claims.", "These actions are not necessarily as terrible as they seem. In 1999, Microsoft argued that bundling its web browser with its operating system was good for consumers who needed a way to easily get on the Internet. In retrospect, that looks defensible \u2014 today, every computer, tablet and smartphone ship with built-in browsers, because everyone believes they are an important aspect of the user experience of computers.", "Google argues, similarly, that giving people answers to shopping and travel queries on its main search results page is much more helpful than giving them a bunch of links to competing search services.", "Some observers agree. \u201cThe analogy I like to use is, complaining that Google is lifting its own vertical search engine over other vertical search engines would be like complaining that The New York Times is not carrying The Los Angeles Times\u2019s sports section,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, founder of Search Engine Land, an online publication that tracks the search industry. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect The New York Times to carry a rival sports section. But you do expect it to have a sports section. When people go to a search engine, they\u2019re looking to search across everything.\u201d", "As Google pointed out in its response to the European filing, linking to its own services has not destroyed its rivals. Google Travel, for instance, is still far less popular than competitors.", "As powerful as Microsoft looked at the time, officials missed ways in which it was vulnerable. For starters, they didn\u2019t anticipate the rise of mobile devices. The 1999 ruling against Microsoft found there were \u201cno products, nor are there likely to be any in the near future\u201d that people around the world could use as \u201csubstitutes\u201d for Windows computers. In fact, within a few years, unexpected rivals began making such substitutes. In 2007, Apple released the iPhone, and soon after, Google released the Android operating system, which Samsung, HTC, Motorola and other manufacturers used to take the smartphone global and mainstream.", "By 2009, smartphone growth began exploding while personal computer growth had peaked. While it\u2019s true that Microsoft\u2019s Windows is still the dominant desktop operating system \u2014 and, for many uses, smartphones can\u2019t substitute for desktops \u2014 Google\u2019s Android has become the most popular operating system over all, while Apple\u2019s Mac and iOS garner the overwhelming share of the profits.", "As Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, has noted, Apple, once the minority player in desktops, now makes as much in revenue as the entire PC industry \u2014 and far more than Microsoft at its supposedly unbeatable peak. Windows has also been eclipsed as the center of gravity in the tech industry. Today, the most successful start-ups aren\u2019t clamoring for Microsoft\u2019s blessing to get technical hooks into Windows; instead they are making apps for iOS first, for Android second and then, if they eventually get around to it, for Microsoft\u2019s devices.", "Google\u2019s position could similarly be upended by developments that right now look unlikely. As the analyst Ben Thompson has argued, Google makes most of its money from search ads, but the market for such direct advertising may be tapped out. The next great wave of digital advertising \u2014 a market far bigger than search spots \u2014 will come from ad budgets now reserved for TV commercials, and many observers bet that Facebook, not Google, is in the best position to get that business.", "The bigger threat for Google is that the web, the search company\u2019s favored domain, has been increasingly overrun by the world of apps. People now spend more time in apps than in web browsers on their computers and their phones. The rise of apps diminishes Google\u2019s power to determine the fate of competing services. People are starting their shopping searches in the Amazon app, for instance, rather than on Google, so Google\u2019s monkeying with shopping search prominence in its results may not matter very much.", "It is true that, through Android, Google has a prominent toehold in the mobile business, but that is far from secure. Goldman Sachs recently determined that Google makes three-quarters of its mobile revenue through advertising on Apple\u2019s devices, and only a small share from Android devices. This gives Apple a huge competitive weapon over Google; if Google were removed as the default search for the iPhone, Google\u2019s mobile revenue could tumble.", "Some scholars of the antitrust prosecution against Microsoft argue that even if regulators did not anticipate Microsoft\u2019s weaknesses, their oversight did constrain the anything-goes culture at the company, and that shift had a salutary effect on the market, eventually allowing for the rise of Apple, Google and the mobile economy. That claim is debatable; it seems just as likely, as others have argued, that it was precisely Microsoft\u2019s strength in desktops that prevented it from developing a truly novel experience on mobile computers.", "But even if one believes that regulatory oversight weakened Microsoft, Mr. Manne, of the International Center for Law and Economics, points out that the prosecution could be the reason we\u2019re here today \u2014 with Google as the monopoly power in search. \u201cIt\u2019s the paradigmatic cautionary tale,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had the rise of Google coming on the heels of the antitrust enforcement against Microsoft, and because of all this scrutiny, Microsoft was not as effective a competitor against Google as it could have been.\u201d", "Noting the potential for another giant, possibly Amazon, to gain a monopoly as a result of the charges against Google, Mr. Manne adds: \u201cI think we would see that potential again here, and that\u2019s exactly what we don\u2019t want.\u201d"], "https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/morning-agenda-financial-crisis-veteran-cautions-china/": ["FINANCIAL CRISIS VETERAN CAUTIONS CHINA | In a new book, Henry M.

Big data lenders often analyze a person\u2019s social network on LinkedIn or Facebook as one signal, among many, for hints about how reliable a payer a loan candidate is likely to be. But Vouch wants you to construct a social network of people who trust you financially \u2014 people who will, yes, vouch for you.", "The Vouch formula looks to back to a bygone era of banking when community bankers routinely asked their customers for \u201csocial character\u201d references before granting loans. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken that principle and digitized it,\u201d said Yee Lee, co-founder and chief executive of Vouch.", "It also borrows from the concept of co-signing for loans, when a relative or friend is liable for repayment if the borrower turns out to be a deadbeat.", "Founded in 2013, Vouch made its first loan last October.

They are installment loans with repayment typically stretched over 12 to 36 months.", "Borrowers build online trust networks by sending messages to friends and family members to vouch for them, and typically to commit some amount of money if the borrower does not repay. The people in the network are not asked to co-sign the loan in a traditional sense. But they are asked to explain their relationship to the person and commit an amount of money they will pay if the borrower does not repay. The commitment can be as little as $25 but has been up to $1,000 or more.", "So joining a person\u2019s vouch network is an expression of trust in that person with a dollar amount placed on it. The vouchers sign an electronic agreement to pay, if necessary, that is legally enforceable, Mr. Lee explained.", "The members of a trust network fill out online surveys, identifying themselves \u2014 which is then verified by Vouch \u2014 and they agree to have their own credit histories looked up.

It\u2019s a sizable number of trust connections, but they all come from the same address, the fraternity house at the university from which the borrower recently graduated.", "The second loan candidate is a young woman with only three people in her network. But one is her mother who is willing to vouch $1,000, and Mom has an 800 FICO score. And the other two people in her network live in Austin, Tex., and Newark., and have the same last name as the young woman.", "The 22-year-old young woman, Mr. Lee observed, would get somewhat better terms on her loan, given the strength rather than the breadth of her trust network.", "The start-up\u2019s borrowers range in age from their 20s to 50s, across a demographic spectrum, but the most common loan use so far has been to pay off high-rate credit card debt, Mr. Lee said.", "Vouch has apparently done a lot of spade work with regulators.

To date, it has raised $3.6 million from venture capital firms including IDG Ventures and Greylock Partners.", "Vouch\u2019s 22 employees bring a lot of technology and banking experience to the San Francisco start-up.

Van Herpen pays frequent visits to the European Organization for Nuclear Research, collaborates regularly with architects and sources materials from military-contracted manufacturing companies. She\u2019s currently experimenting with synthetic silks that are so light a wearer can\u2019t feel them, and has plans to work with a host of other futuristic materials as well: bio-fabricated leather grown from cow cells; shape-shifting textiles whose transformation is triggered by elements such as heat and water; light-refracting, mirror-embedded fabric that renders the wearer invisible.", "When we meet in her Amsterdam studio one afternoon in late February, I ask van Herpen, whose mild accent and owlish eyes give her an ethereal affect, whether all those serious scientists and tech types ever roll their eyes at a fashion designer\u2019s curiosity. \u201cI think that if I would make very commercial clothes, I would get that feedback,\u201d she replies. \u201cThe funny thing is that I often meet people who say, \u2018I\u2019m not interested in fashion normally, but it\u2019s interesting what you do.\u2019 I think that they realize how much work there is in fashion and that there can be an element of the art in it.\u201d", "For people who care about clothes (or anything other than email optimization and fitness tracking), the recent, dual-industry obsession with \u201cwearable technology\u201d can seem silly, if not downright sinister. So far the fetish seems to have been focused on accessories \u2014 Google Glass, the Apple Watch \u2014 that function more like slip-on life-hacking tools than genuinely useful, attractive items a person with even a rudimentary sense of aesthetics might be inclined to wear.", "Van Herpen, meanwhile, rejects the notion that the cross-pollination of fashion and technology must yield utilitarian results. In 2010, for instance, she debuted a collection (the first ever) that made use of 3D printing. The clothes looked like alien prom dresses haloed by suspended splashes of fake water. \u201cI have always had the fascination to work with materials that I cannot control, like water or air or energy,\u201d she tells me in her lilting English, sounding like Glinda the Good Witch after two semesters of art school. \u201cFor me, technology is not an inspiration and it\u2019s not a goal, it\u2019s just a tool,\u201d she continues. Van Herpen believes there is a lot of potential in wearable technology, but, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s not fashion yet.\u201d Rather than create futuristic multitasking garments (jackets that make phone calls! socks that can tell the time!), van Herpen has chosen to focus on developing innovative fabric. \u201cI think the biggest potential is in materials. I really think materials can revolutionize fashion in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m not interested in having a lot of technology on my body, so it will have to be embedded very cleverly.\u201d", "On the day I visit, van Herpen is wearing a shimmering, gunmetal-color two-piece jumpsuit bifurcated at the (breathtakingly small) waist with a lacquered black belt. Made of the same synthetic silk she used for her fall 2014 ready-to-wear collection, the inky, rippling outfit almost looks wet, like something a Goth mermaid might wear to a birthday party.", "Van Herpen\u2019s atelier is located in Westerpark, a recently gentrified neighborhood in central Amsterdam that, with its saline air and oxidized maritime vessels, feels a lot like Red Hook, Brooklyn. The building, which houses a number of other creative enterprises, along with workshops for artisanal metal workers and piano builders, offers misty, cross-canal views straight out of a Salomon van Ruysdael painting. The open-plan studio has the atmosphere of a haunted house where all the lights have been turned on: balding velvet chairs, chipped teacups, snuffed-out pillar candles and the intermittent appearance of a cat named Spin (Dutch for \u201cSpider\u201d). Throughout the afternoon, members of van Herpen\u2019s small team buzz purposefully about. A silver-haired young woman carefully measures yards upon yards of embossed leather; an equally young man sorts tissue patterns. Over the purring of sewing machines, one could hear the occasional cry of a seagull.", "Van Herpen grew up outside of Amsterdam on a renovated farm in a village so small that \u201ceven Dutch people don\u2019t know about it.\u201d She took painting lessons, played the violin and studied ballet seriously until she was 16. Her mother was a dance teacher; her father worked as an advisor to a governmental water agency. There was no television in the house \u2014 \u201cmy parents were a little bit hippie\u201d \u2014 and van Herpen didn\u2019t have a computer until she bought one herself at age 22. She studied fashion design at Artez, a prestigious art academy in Arnhem, and, after graduation, interned for Alexander McQueen in London. It was there, in the atelier of the late British legend, that van Herpen not only first gained access to expensive, esoteric materials, but was forced to perform tedious yet rewarding handwork, like meticulous beading and intricate embroidery. \u201cI realized that an idea can come from a process of making,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWhile doing handwork there, I had lots of ideas and got restless. I was dying to work for myself again. But it was really good to train myself to have that patience.\u201d In 2007, she started her own label and has shown semi-annually ever since.", "Still, she remains a designer on the fringes of commercial fashion. Though W and V have featured van Herpen\u2019s designs in editorials, her work more frequently appears in foreign editions of glossy magazines, like French and Italian Vogue. One can buy Iris van Herpen on her website, at the avant-garde e-commerce site the Corner and at a handful of exclusive boutiques, like ODD or Hotoveli in New York City. \u201cHer designs use very inventive technology applied on the most artisanal of practices. It\u2019s a strange intersection where not a lot of other people are working,\u201d says Harold Koda, curator in charge at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has one of her dresses in their permanent collection. \u201cHer role, I think, is going to be defined by the future, not by what it is right now. A lot of the more avant-garde designers are aware of her, but her influence isn\u2019t going to be felt until the technological areas she\u2019s experimenting in move beyond these sculptural designs and into more prosaic clothing.\u201d", "With her ready-to-wear line, which she debuted in 2013, van Herpen is edging, sort of, toward such clothing. She designs her couture and ready-to-wear collections simultaneously, which allows her to modify her time-consuming, labor-intensive experiments into more wearable looks: replicating a textural effect in lighter (and less expensive) materials or converting a dress into articulated separates that the wearer might actually be able to sit down to dinner in. \u201cA lot of techniques overlap,\u201d she explains. (The biggest difference is that the couture is produced in her Amsterdam atelier, while the ready-to-wear is made in Romania, Italy and Poland.) Indeed, for every Ridley Scott-ready curiosity that van Herpen sends down the catwalk, there\u2019s an equally odd but also plainly beautiful look trailing right behind: a gown like a column of mercury, a lush cropped cape that would look as good with Adidas Sambas as with a cloven-toe boot. Van Herpen\u2019s designs might get weird at times, but they\u2019re never ugly.", "The designer swishes across her brightly lit studio, leading me from dress form to dress form. Many are moulaged with folds of iridescent, seemingly gravity-defying material that, upon closer inspection, proves to be a stainless-steel mesh woven from hair-fine wires in irregular colors, fading from deep red to violet to green to brown \u2014 the product of heat applied by a torch for varying amounts of time. Modulating hues, undulating shapes: The effect is akin to some sort of interstellar cloud, a mysteriously body-hugging nebula.", "Another family of garments, created in collaboration with the Canadian architect Philip Beesley, are constructed out of three-dimensional plastic flower shapes in licorice black and look like an assembly of neglected DIY crystal kits. There are also form-fitting dresses and motorcycle jackets made from black leather and three-dimensionally woven wool, as well as a handful of peach garments striated with panels of closely pleated silk, much like the sort that made Issey Miyake famous. On the body, van Herpen\u2019s clothes appear weightless, but this is usually an illusion, the result of tricky engineering and interior architecture that remains mystifying to the viewer \u2014 and often feels satisfyingly heavy to the wearer. These are the rare clothes that look as expensive as they are.", "When I ask van Herpen who exactly wears her clothes (a question that must feel as tiresome to a fashion designer as \u201cwould I have read anything you\u2019ve written?\u201d does to a novelist) she laughs. \u201cIs there someone who buys this dress and wears it to a cocktail party?\u201d I propose. \u201cWell, a cocktail party .\u2009.\u2009.\u201d she trails off, smiling with forbearance. Though many of van Herpen\u2019s particularly high-concept pieces tend to end up in museums (including the Met and the Museum of Arts and Design), she also has a loyal cadre of clients, non-public figures, often involved in the arts, who buy, and indeed wear, her one-of-a-kind couture pieces. She describes these clients as people who \u201csee clothes in a different way.\u201d", "In her studio, studding an internal windowsill is a row of volcanic-looking lumps protruding with spines. While her fellow city-dwelling neighbors might be, and probably are, growing marijuana, van Herpen is growing shoes. She made her spring 2015 footwear by blending rubber with iron particles and then applying a magnet before the material hardened. No two pairs are alike. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of the opposite of a hand-done process,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is nature shaping your work.\u201d", "The shoes for her fall 2015 collection, which debuted at the runway show, were not dissimilar. Sheathed in what looked like black netting, the platform sandals (for lack of an even serviceable word) enveloped the bottom of the models\u2019 feet in a crystalline mass of ersatz rock candy. The models\u2019 gait was, predictably, affected; they walked at a trance-slow pace to the appropriately galactic score composed and produced by Salvador Breed, van Herpen\u2019s frequent collaborator and longtime boyfriend. Watching the models shuffle along the darkened runway, one had the sense that gravity had been sucked out of the room and a concerted effort was required to stay on Earth.", "In the hands of a different designer, these sorts of theatrics, even in the most atmospheric setting, would be cause for critique \u2014 a glaring case of form without function. But the entire presentation, which was eerily serene, seemed to prove, more so than the in-person examination of any one garment could, Koda\u2019s ratifying analysis: \u201cSome designers say they\u2019re creating clothes, not art, but Iris can\u2019t say that with a straight face,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt happens to be fashion in that she\u2019s adorning the body, but it\u2019s really a sculpture.

As is true of every set of expressive tools, digital photography creates its own forms of emphasis and registers of style. Cellphone cameras are great in low light, and so we have many more nocturnal photos.

But a book full of photographed meals, meals long consumed and forgotten, is not only poking gentle fun at our obsessive documentation of the quotidian. It is also marveling at how inexpensive photography has become. Things that would not have merited a second glance are now unquestioningly, almost automatically, recorded.

He pulled out a photo of my mother and me, age 7, that had been published in my hometown newspaper; architectural plans for an addition to my house that was never built but apparently was registered locally by the architect; an announcement about my great-grandfather\u2019s becoming editor of Amazing Stories magazine in his old age; and my brother\u2019s history as a college activist.", "I\u2019d forgotten that many of these documents existed, and there were others I\u2019d never seen or heard about. My patient knew things about me that I didn\u2019t know.", "In psychiatry, there\u2019s a long tradition of viewing any personal information about the therapist that the patient stumbles upon as \u201cgrist for the mill.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s material that can be processed in the treatment just like any other experience or dream or recollection the patient might have. (A colleague of mine once asked her psychoanalyst why his head was wrapped in gauze, only to have him reply, \u201cWhat are your fantasies as to what it might mean?\u201d She never got a straight answer.)", "But after a few minutes of listening to my patient present his findings, I was nearly overwhelmed by feelings both of exposure and of curiosity about his trove. Clearly, this was part of his intent, which would be the subject for many a future session. But I also realized that the relative anonymity of therapists, and all the mystery, power and privacy that attended it, were being swept away.", "Patients\u2019 access to huge amounts of information about therapists\u2019 lives can\u2019t help but change both members of the therapeutic dyad. It can have, for instance, a chilling effect on the therapist\u2019s work outside the office. As a psychiatrist who occasionally writes and speaks, I now have to think about the impact of these activities on prospective patients. If I write a feminist article, will I end up with only female patients?", "And what about a therapist\u2019s avocations? A friend of mine Googled her therapist and discovered that he was an accomplished singer \u2014 intensifying her already romantic and idealized transference. On a later occasion, an Internet search revealed that the therapist had participated in a gay musical event. When she asked him about it, he explained that he was not gay and had been helping out some friends, but it had been a confusing piece of information for her \u2014 and, I suspect, for him. Will he feel as free to sing at the next concert with these friends?", "The blurring of boundaries between the personal and professional can get quite creepy. A patient told me, in greater detail than I wished to know, about her Match.com date with a psychoanalyst with whom I\u2019ve had professional dealings. It was an encounter that almost certainly would not have occurred in the pre-Internet-dating era, and it will be hard ever to think of him in quite the same way.", "Googling, of course, can go in both directions. An emergency room psychiatrist tells me that it\u2019s routine to check out new E.R. patients on the Internet before they are seen \u2014 to determine, at the very least, if they have criminal records. \u201cI wonder how we survived without it,\u201d she muses. But more than legal infractions are revealed by such Internet searches; the patient may turn out to be a V.I.P. or someone with an unsavory past. E.R. psychiatrists even check YouTube for patient postings. The experience of evaluating a patient with fresh eyes and no prior assumptions may, for better and for worse, disappear.", "Patients\u2019 electronic histories follow them everywhere \u2014 and so do doctors\u2019. Patients can now, in effect, blackmail therapists by threatening to post negative reviews of them on the Internet if the doctor does not accede to their demands \u2014 whether for medication, hospitalization or special treatment. A supervising psychiatrist at a teaching hospital told me the frightening tale of a patient with a severe personality disorder seen in the E.R. by a psychiatrist who was just starting his practice. The patient threatened to place \u2014 and then actually did place \u2014 a potentially career-destroying evaluation on a physician evaluation website.", "But the impact of technology on psychotherapy is not all bad; it\u2019s even, at times, beneficial. The transparency of information can serve as an antidote to the fusty, authoritarian therapies of the recent past. For some patients, the new access to information about a therapist is liberating. They feel like Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d pulling back the curtain to reveal that the wizard is a mere mortal. Therapists, it turns out, are just folks like you and me. Their authority is not a given, but something to be earned.", "Technology can also insert into the often hermetic world of the consulting room a tonic dose of reality, an experience of how the patient actually functions outside the office. My patients arrive in my office and, like gunslingers in a saloon, unload their various electronic devices, laying them on the sofa, often two or even three, before turning them off. But there are times when the phones have to stay on: There\u2019s a sick child at home or the boss may call. Hearing in real time patients\u2019 responses to important figures in their lives gives me an unfiltered glimpse into those relationships. A man who sarcastically belittles his girlfriend to me is surprisingly tender speaking with her on his cellphone. An unhappy, self-deprecating executive is suddenly a confident and even commanding figure speaking with one of his subordinates. An aggressive lawyer becomes shy and awkward when speaking with his mother.", "IN some ways, the relentless electronic interconnectivity of our lives serves to highlight therapy\u2019s singular virtues. We are more appreciative of the strange, private dialogue that is the heart of therapy. There are precious few times and spaces left in our society in which people quietly speak to one another in a sustained, intimate conversation. The therapist\u2019s office is one of the last safe places. Secrets, reflections, fears or confusion never leave the room.", "And it is also a refuge. My patients often arrive early just to sit in the waiting room \u2014 an unusual interlude of quiet. Then there\u2019s the session itself. In some ways therapy is, more than ever, the ultimate luxury: To be the focus of a thoughtful person who is listening, caring and helping to make sense of life\u2019s chaos is something that the Internet can never provide.", "Anna Fels is a psychiatrist and faculty member at Weill Cornell Medical College."], "https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/09/are-police-too-quick-to-use-force": [], "https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/turkeys-online-censorship/": ["The Turkish government\u2019s unrelenting crackdown on free speech continues unabated.

In this patient\u2019s case, the muscle involved was the diaphragm.", "Respiratory myoclonus is quite rare, with only around 100 cases reported over the past 300 years. And while it can be seen in individuals who are otherwise healthy, the rapid jerky breaths it causes can also be a symptom of some type of neurological disease.", "The very first case of respiratory myoclonus was reported in 1723 by Antony van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch draper and amateur scientist. Van Leeuwenhoek is best known to us as one of the first men to observe the world around him through a microscope. He learned to grind lenses as a teen and went on to build more than 500 microscopes. And he used them regularly to examine his world up close. He looked at water from a nearby lake and described with amazement, and in graphic detail, many of the organisms he saw living there. He was the first to describe blood cells and sperm. He looked at the plaque on this teeth and \u201csaw with great wonder, that in the said matter there were many very little living animacules, very prettily amoving.\u201d", "These were among the first observations on living bacteria ever recorded. A year before van Leeuwenhoek\u2019s death, at the age of 91, he reported on a curious symptom of his own, with the same careful precision that characterized his observations of the world around him. He felt, he wrote, \u201ca violent movement around the large and vital organ we call the diaphragm.\u201d It was a symptom he had experienced off and on for years and which is now sometimes known as Leeuwenhoek\u2019s disease.", "How the Diagnosis Was Made:", "As Dr. John A.

Decades earlier, he had read about a patient with this kind of erratic breathing in The New England Journal of Medicine. That patient, a 66-year-old man from California, had this same erratic shallow pattern of breathing and was diagnosed with respiratory myoclonus, or Leeuwenhoek\u2019s disease. Dr. Rankin had read the article as a second year medical student, and he wasn\u2019t sure why, but that particular patient and disorder had made a deep impression on him. He felt like he had been waiting to see it ever since.", "Slow down, Dr. Rankin told himself. Don\u2019t leap to conclusions. Respiratory myoclonus was extremely rare. The odds were that she did not have this rarity. But if not that, what else could it be?", "The visible flutter in her chest could not be coming from her heart. Her pulse was much slower and more regular. If not the heart, it had to be the diaphragm that was making her chest and abdomen move together this way. The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle beneath the lungs. During inspiration, the muscle contracts, flattening down and out, causing the lungs to expand and fill with air. This contractions move the viscera down as well, causing the abdomen to expand outward with each breath. Dr. Rankin couldn\u2019t think of any other muscle that would move both chest and belly this way.", "He had read of pacemakers causing this kind of problem when the leads connecting the device to the heart get dislodged and attached themselves to the diaphragm. But this patient didn\u2019t have a pacemaker. So what else could it be? He could think of nothing. This had to be Leeuwenhoek\u2019s disease.", "From What to Why", "Where had this rare symptom come from? Was it a sign of some underlying neurological disease?", "The patient had epilepsy, and that can cause myoclonus. But she had had this seizure disorder for over 20 years and never had this. Moreover, she was taking a medication to control her seizures. The spells can be the result of subtle brain injuries \u2013 a small stroke or tumor or a chronic disease such as multiple sclerosis \u2013 but the patient had an M.R.I. of the brain recently which showed no evidence of any of these.", "If not in the brain, could it be something in the lungs? When a CT scan showed normal lungs, Dr. Rankin thought that this patient probably had, like van Leeuwenhoek, an isolated respiratory myoclonus. Although the sensation could be annoying, Dr. Rankin reassured the patient that it didn\u2019t represent a danger and that it wasn\u2019t affecting the overall function of her lungs. He gave her a muscle relaxer to take when the spells were bothersome, and sent her back to work and to follow up with Dr. Spencer Haller, the internist she had been seeing.", "He has kept an eye on her through her medical record since he figured this out five years ago, and he feels comfortable that the myoclonus was not a sign of some hidden disease. These days, though, the patient reports that her spells of funny breathing are few and far between. She can\u2019t even remember her last one.

So let\u2019s do it in public now. My view is that he\u2019s a dynamic speaker with an appealing biography who\u2019s broadly appealing to Republicans. If he can come off as more exciting than Jeb Bush or Scott Walker over the next few months, why shouldn\u2019t we think of Rubio as a co-favorite at this point?", "Nate Cohn: I think that Marco Rubio is potentially a strong candidate, but that he\u2019ll struggle to become the first choice of a large number of voters in a deeply factionalized party. Scott Walker and Jeb Bush may not be better candidates than Marco Rubio (who I think of as an above-average candidate, something like a Republican John Edwards), but their messages and biographies are perfectly suited to appeal to two of the most important constituencies in the G.O.P. \u2014 conservatives and establishment-elites, respectively \u2014 and I think Marco Rubio will struggle to carve a space for himself.", "Leonhardt: I\u2019m going to assume you mean the 2007-8 version of John Edwards, and I take your point there. I also take your point that Rubio looks boxed out from being many Republicans\u2019 first choice right now. But couldn\u2019t he change that by having a better next few months than Bush or Walker \u2014 by giving better speeches, by seeming more serious about policy, by not picking fights with conservatives (as Bush has) and by looking steadier than Walker did in the last couple of months? I guess the real question is whether Rubio can outcompete them \u2014 or needs one or both to stumble badly.", "Cohn: Rubio could outcompete them, but I\u2019m not sure I think it\u2019s likely. He\u2019s been receiving a lot of national media attention over the last four years, and he only has 6 percent of the vote to show for it, less at this stage than any winning presidential candidate of the last 35 years, except Bill Clinton.

How is that?", "Cohn: A lot of the candidates who win presidential nominations enter the race with a lot of pre-existing support \u2014 from past runs for president, from being a previous or sitting vice president. The connections earned in those prior contests or positions helped them quickly lock down support in the so-called invisible primary, but it also allowed them to start with substantial name recognition in the polls.", "I don\u2019t think Rubio\u2019s low poll numbers are a reason he can\u2019t win, but I do think they suggest that he\u2019s not some exceptional candidate who resonates strongly with the Republican rank and file. He\u2019s not a stealth candidate, and in today\u2019s digital age I think we\u2019d expect exceptional candidates to break out quickly. Obama already had 25 percent at this point eight years ago.", "Scott Walker gave one speech and suddenly found himself at 15 percent in national polls.

And I agree that Bush and Walker are more likely to be the nominee. But I can\u2019t quite let go of two facts: One, Rubio is deeply conservative and yet would make the G.O.P. look younger and less white at a time when the party would clearly benefit from that. Two, he\u2019s simply a better public speaker than Bush or Walker. (Compare each of their speeches at the 2012 convention.) As we\u2019ve seen again and again \u2014 Lincoln, the Roosevelts, Kennedy, Reagan, Bill Clinton, Obama \u2014 the ability to connect with voters through public speaking is arguably the single most important talent in politics.", "My back-of-the-envelope odds for the nomination look something like this: Bush 45 percent, Walker 30 percent, Rubio 20 percent, the field 5 percent.", "Cohn: Rubio\u2019s conservative, but he\u2019s not \u2014 to borrow from Hillary \u2014 their champion. These guys want someone who\u2019s going to fight the fight \u2014 like Scott Walker did in Wisconsin, like Ted Cruz in the shutdown \u2014 and Marco Rubio just isn\u2019t that guy. Could he connect with voters like Obama? Sure.

The obvious question now is whether prediction-market defenders (yes, you, Justin Wolfers) would argue that our odds are worse than the market odds.

Now, when people cancel their service, the company has agreed to remove their names and other personal identifiers from their rental history within a year.", "In addition to the video privacy law, Mr. Edelson\u2019s practice relies on the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which was enacted in 1991 to restrict the use of automated telemarketing, as well as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which protects the privacy of phone calls and emails.", "The penalties for each instance of breaking these laws are small, usually in the hundreds or thousands of dollars. But when they are applied to modern creations like an email service that has 425 million daily users, the potential liabilities can be comically high. One class action, in which Edelson was not involved, accused Google of violating wiretap laws by scanning messages in its Gmail email service. The suit was dismissed, but it could theoretically have been worth trillions.", "What this means is that a company\u2019s defense strategy typically involves trying to persuade a judge to throw the suit out of court on a \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d or to try to prevent lawyers from suing on behalf of a class. If the judge lets the case go forward as a class action, companies usually start thinking about settlements. And that is good news for the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers.", "\u201cIt\u2019s legal gotcha, and he tries to convince you that because there\u2019s a legal gotcha with a big number, then you should pay him instead of litigating,\u201d said Michael Rhodes, a partner at the Cooley law firm in San Francisco, who has defended clients like Sony and Facebook against Mr. Edelson\u2019s firm. \u201cThat\u2019s his business model.\u201d", "\u2018Annihilating\u2019 Damages", "Mr. Edelson grew up outside Boston and went to the University of Michigan Law School. He worked first at defense firms but hated it, so he quit to file his own cases. He started with more traditional class actions, suing companies for things like tainted cat food and toys containing lead paint. \u201cWhat I used to say at the beginning was that the only company I wouldn\u2019t sue is Dr Pepper,\u201d he said. \u201cI really like Dr Pepper.\u201d", "His first run of technology suits, in the early 2000s, included a case that accused Register.com, which sells domain names, of running advertising on web pages it had sold to the customers for their use. Since then, the world has evolved. Our ordinary daily activities \u2014 communicating, buying things, seeking out information \u2014 often require us to reveal information that in the past was never created or collected.", "The most muscular response to this corralling of data has been in Europe, where a sweeping new law nicknamed the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d has set up a process for people to have links about them removed from search engines. Average Americans, however, seem caught in a gap between the privacy they say they want and what they actually do about it. A recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that 91 percent of American adults thought they had lost control over how their personal information is used by companies. Yet they gleefully use Facebook and Twitter while showing zero appetite for paying for those services with money instead of data.", "Mr. Edelson sees himself doing the dirty, unpopular work of protecting privacy with laws that are already on the books. Several technology companies \u2014 Google, LinkedIn, Netflix \u2014 declined to discuss Mr. Edelson and his firm. If one were to compile a list of Silicon Valley\u2019s least favorite topics, privacy would be up there with wealth inequality and gender imbalance.", "Even the act of defending oneself can be unflattering. Take Google. Two years ago, in an attempt to head off a class-action lawsuit involving Gmail, the company wrote in a legal filing that people who used the service should never have expected their emails to be private, and it compared Gmail correspondence to business letters that can be viewed by assistants in an office. The company was quickly attacked by groups like Consumer Watchdog.", "\u201cA lot of privacy assurances fall away when companies like Google end up in court,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.", "When defending themselves against Mr. Edelson and his competitors, technology companies typically argue that the named plaintiffs on privacy suits do not have \u201cstanding,\u201d which is a lawyer\u2019s way of saying that you can\u2019t sue someone for damages if you didn\u2019t lose money or get hurt. That argument, which lawyers describe as the go-to defense in privacy cases, could face a big test from a 2010 suit Mr. Edelson filed against Spokeo, a search engine that, for a fee, displays everything it can find about a person.", "Mr. Edelson sued under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a 1970s law that is meant to keep credit reporting agencies from providing inaccurate information that could make it harder for consumers to borrow money or get a job.", "Mr. Edelson was not the only person with such concerns. Two years after he filed his lawsuit, Spokeo paid $800,000 to settle F.T.C. charges that it marketed its service as a background check for employers but without vetting the information or giving consumers the right to correct it, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, according to the F.T.C.", "Thomas Robins, the named plaintiff in Mr. Edelson\u2019s case, said he had searched for himself on Spokeo and found that several things, including his age, were wrong. That has him worried that a potential employer might not consider him for jobs.", "\u201cHe is not saying that has happened to him \u2014 it\u2019s just a speculative injury that could happen,\u201d said John Nadolenco, a partner at Mayer Brown in Los Angeles, who is defending Spokeo in the case. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not an injury.\u201d", "The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, ruled that Mr. Robins did have standing to sue for damages. Spokeo has appealed that decision to the United States Supreme Court and is awaiting a response.", "The company has a lot to lose if the case goes forward. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Spokeo could face damages of $1,000 a violation. That could add up to several billion dollars, which would be \u201cannihilating,\u201d Mr. Nadolenco said.", "The case is being closely watched in Silicon Valley. Companies have filed close to a dozen legal briefs in support of Spokeo. Lawyers for eBay, Facebook, Google and Yahoo filed a brief arguing that if the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule stands, those companies could be sued \u201ceven where they are not actually harmed by an alleged statutory violation, and in certain circumstances, seek class-action damages that could run into billions of dollars.\u201d", "Defending Class Actions", "Whatever happens at the Supreme Court, Mr. Edelson is unlikely to win many new fans. Class-action lawyers, like Wall Street short-sellers, tend to justify their actions with high-minded morality, but they are often reviled as glorified extortionists.", "\u201cIf we didn\u2019t allow class actions, we would be in a much worse world,\u201d said Michael Klausner, a professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cThe problem is they can also be abusive.\u201d", "Over all, class actions have generally been on the decline as courts have made it harder for lawyers to certify class actions so they can go forward, said Brian Fitzpatrick, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School who studies class-action cases.", "Also, over the last few years many companies have adopted so-called arbitration clauses in which, simply by clicking the \u201caccept terms\u201d button, users waive their rights to join class actions. The move discourages plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers because, unless they can sue on behalf of many clients at once, there is hardly any money in filing cases. \u201cIt may only be a matter of time before it is impossible for employees and consumers to file class actions,\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick said.", "Mr. Edelson seems worried about this. About three years ago, after AT&T adopted an arbitration clause, Mr. Edelson filed several dozen individual arbitrations over the course of a year. It was an expensive exercise, but forced AT&T to deal with each dispute one by one and sent a message \u201cto other companies not to put arbitration clauses in their contracts,\u201d he said.", "AT&T still has the arbitration clause.", "In defending his tactics, Mr. Edelson echoes a long-running defense of class-action law. He says he is acting like a sort of private attorney general, forcing companies to change their worst behaviors. The critical view is that lawyers like him make millions while recovering almost nothing for the people they represent.", "\u201cEveryone always has a story about getting a check from a class action for 15 cents,\u201d said Christopher Dore, an Edelson partner. Mr. Dore said he had made peace with people questioning his profession.", "\u201cThe funniest thing is you talk about it in the abstract, and people have one reaction,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then you give them specific examples, like I\u2019ll explain a case or something to them, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that\u2019s really messed up.

Along with imposing fines, regulators could force the company to make its business more transparent or to give individual countries more leeway to sell the gas to other places, like Ukraine.", "But any concerted push to alter Gazprom\u2019s business model will be seen by Moscow as a new front in what it views as the West\u2019s \u201ceconomic war\u201d against Russia, following the imposition last year of sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. The Kremlin earns significant sums from the company.", "\u201cThis will further worsen relations between Russia and the West,\u201d said Michael Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cBut one has to assume that European policy makers knew that and decided that it would ultimately give them more leverage in dealing with Moscow.\u201d", "The move by antitrust regulators was confirmed by two people with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because such decisions are confidential.

Russia has been trying to shift its focus to Asia, striking a major 30-year gas deal with China last year. But that deal is years from producing real revenues, and the price China will pay is believed to be far below the European rate.", "Any changes to Gazprom\u2019s practices would also challenge a key pillar of President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s economic and geopolitical strategy by limiting Russia\u2019s ability to set prices that favor some customers and penalize others. This, in turn, would hamper Moscow\u2019s efforts to use the promise of cheap gas to divide Europe and break its already shaky unity on Ukraine.", "\u201cThis is a huge step for European energy security,\u201d said David Goldwyn, a senior energy official in the State Department during the first Obama administration. \u201cThe days of Russia controlling the ultimate destination of its gas is coming to an end.\u201d", "A case against Gazprom would represent the second major move of late by Europe\u2019s powerful antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager.

That would give individual countries more control over whether they consume all the gas themselves or sell some of it on to other countries, including Ukraine, something Gazprom has opposed.", "The charges would just be a first step. Gazprom would then have the chance to lay out its defense, and it could even still settle the case.", "The company has proffered commercial arguments for securing long-term contracts with national utility companies and controlling pipelines to deliver the gas.

She is a Fowler, the youngest child of a family cursed long ago by Agnes Early, the Witch of Sidwell. For 200 years, \u00adevery Fowler son has been born with wings, and so Twig is forced to keep the secret of her handsome older brother, James, who is confined to the attic by day, but takes to the skies and freedom once the sun goes down. In an attempt to keep unwanted attention from James, Twig and her mother have thoroughly isolated themselves, turning down invitations and earning a reputation as snobs and eccentrics. But a series of thefts and cryptic graffiti scrawled around Sidwell have left the townspeople jumpy and wondering if the monster is more dangerous nuisance than benign tourist draw. Things are further complicated when descendants of the Witch of Sidwell return to occupy the rundown cottage next to Twig\u2019s home, and the destinies of the Fowlers and the Earlys become entangled once more. As friendship blooms between Twig and Julia Early and a romance develops between James and Julia\u2019s sister, Agate, they set out to solve the mystery of the minor crimes plaguing their town, and at the same time find a way to undo the curse so that James can live a normal life with the girl he loves.", "Hoffman has a beautiful way of throwing open a door on possibility so that the reader begins to see magic everywhere. A drought that devours every lake but one may be unfortunate weather or the work of a witch. A recipe for Pink apple pie, passed down from mother to daughter, takes on the quality of incantation.

Twig\u2019s internal landscape is illuminated with equal beauty: \u201cI just stored up my hurts,\u201d she says, \u201cas if they were a tower made of fallen stars.\u201d Her loneliness is lyrical but grounded in moments of acute honesty.", "At times, though, the enchantment wavers. The coincidences of found diaries and scraps of paper seem less fated than convenient. Deep familial rifts are healed seemingly without scars, and characters make abrupt emotional leaps that jar after the story\u2019s steady buildup.

Nepali expatriates were flying in, desperate to track down family members, and setting off down the airport access road on foot, rolling suitcases behind them.", "But outside the capital, many of the worst-hit villages in the ridges around Katmandu remain a black hole, surrounded by landslides that make them inaccessible even to the country\u2019s armed forces. The Nepali authorities on Monday began airdropping packages of tarpaulins, dry food and medicine into mountain villages, but an attempt to land helicopters was abandoned, said Brig. Gen. Jagadish Chandra Pokharel, an army spokesman.", "The government is only gradually getting a grasp of the destruction in these isolated places.

The forces have pushed up the highest mountains in the world, in the Himalayas, and have set off devastating earthquakes.", "Experts had warned of the danger to the people of Katmandu for decades. The death toll in Nepal on Saturday was practically inevitable given the tectonics, the local geology that made the shaking worse and the lax construction of buildings that could not withstand the shaking.", "Students can read the entire article, and study these diagrams and maps to learn more about the extent of the damage from the Nepal earthquake. They can also investigate previous earthquakes in Nepal, like the one in 1934, and then consider the following questions:", "Recovery Efforts", "Providing relief for the millions of Nepali people affected by the earthquake is an enormous task. In \u201cFrustration Grows in Nepal as Earthquake Relief Trickles In,\u201d Chris Buckley and Austin Ramzy report:", "Residents of Katmandu living in tent camps after Nepal\u2019s powerful earthquake said on Tuesday that their biggest worry was a lack of safe drinking water, even as they endured the latest pelting of rain.", "That and other claims of slow disaster relief have kindled growing public frustration here with the Nepalese government, which has struggled to deliver food, water, tents and other aid across this poor, mountainous country of 28 million people.", "Since the earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday, killing more than 5,000 people at the latest count, the government has instituted disaster-response plans, galvanized the army and received planeloads of aid every day from dozens of other countries.", "The government has established 16 large camps in Katmandu, and many other residents have made do by sleeping on the street or in open spaces away from damaged buildings and walls.", "But residents have complained that the help is not reaching them or is arriving too slowly, and many accuse the government of incompetence, neglect or even corruption.", "Students can read the entire article, and then research more about how international relief agencies, Internet companies like Facebook and Google, and even the fashion world are all trying to aid in the relief effort.

Ellen Barry and Nida Najar report:", "In the three days since a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal, the death toll has mounted so quickly, to more than 5,000, that most concerns other than the health and safety of its people have been put aside. Hope for finding survivors was waning, and tens of thousands of people are living in tents despite heavy rains. Reserves of clean water are running low.", "But in the meantime, in many places, the detritus of centuries-old temples and palaces has been left unguarded, diminishing chances to eventually rebuild one of the world\u2019s largest clusters of cultural heritage sites.

I have a fairly recent laptop, bought last year, running Windows 8.1. How do I tell if any of the three USB ports on there might be USB 3.0?", "A. If you do not have the manual or specifications sheet that come with the computer, there are a few other ways to check if you have the higher-speed USB port. The support area of the manufacturer\u2019s website should also have the information on your model.", "But sometimes you can tell just by looking at the USB ports along the edge of the laptop. Compared with ordinary older UBS ports, USB 3.0 ports usually have a bit of blue around or within the jack itself.

Additionally, when you have a USB 3.0 peripheral plugged into a USB 3.0 port, Windows may also show you a notification that the device is connected to a USB 3.0 port or that it is operating at SuperSpeed.", "Choosing Between Fiber or Cable", "Q. What is the difference between the Internet from the cable company and a fiber connection for home broadband service?", "A. Cable connections use coaxial cable (insulated copper wire) to send data through electrical signals. As one might guess, fiber is short for fiber optic, and fiber-optic networks are wired with cables made from thin strands of glass or plastic that use light signals to transmit messages over long distances. These cables can also be referred to as optical fiber and can carry much more data at faster speeds than traditional copper-based coaxial. (Some cable-based networks also use hybrid fiber coaxial cables, which combine the glass and copper strands to move data.)", "Because of the widespread use of cable television, which uses the same coaxial wiring, cable Internet service is usually less expensive and easier to get. Data speeds tend to be slower than with fiber networks, partly because of shared resources with other subscribers in the area. Depending on the company and your location, you might see tiered monthly plans offering download speeds of 1.5 megabits per second on the low end, to 100 megabits per second for the deluxe service.", "Fiber connections are newer, faster and often more expensive. The service can be harder to get because the networks are not as widespread as cable, and your area may not have been wired with optical fiber. If the service is available, you may also need to have extra equipment installed in your home. A variety of speed packages are also available with fiber; Verizon\u2019s FiOS service, for example, has plans starting at 25 megabits per second and go on up to 500 megabits per second; the listed speeds are for downloading and uploading data.", "Other fiber-network services are even more robust. Google Fiber and AT&T\u2019s U-verse GigaPower service claim data speeds of 1 gigabit per second (or 1,000 megabits per second), which is fast enough to download about 25 average pop songs in one second or an entire high-definition movie in 36 seconds. These gigabit networks are available in only a few cities, but are expanding slowly.", "Not to be outdone, some cable companies are adding fiber to their data networks to increase their speed and capacity.

I got to try the epitome of Karabakh cuisine: zhingyalov hats, paper-thin flatbread folded over a kaleidoscopic variety of greens, and toasted on a griddle. The cook, who is also an owner, told us there were 11 greens in all: coriander, spring onion, spinach, lamb\u2019s lettuce, beetroot leaf, dill, wild tulip leaf, three others Sonya couldn\u2019t translate and one she could translate only literally, as \u201cold person\u2019s bellybutton.\u201d The resulting battle on my taste buds ended in a surprising harmony.", "On Sunday after a stop at the market (sour \u201cfruit rollups\u201d called chir, 300 dram and highly recommended), we headed to Shushi, a partly walled hilltop city that has seen plenty of sieges in its time, most recently its capture by the Armenians in 1992, a key and still celebrated victory of the war. (The Azerbaijanis refer to the town as Shusha; I am using Armenian names here, since they are the ones travelers are most likely to encounter.) The plan was to see the town and then have Sonya\u2019s friend Sevak, who lives between Shushi and his village across Karkak Canyon, Arkateli, lead us on a hike.", "Shushi provided an image for Armond\u2019s war stories; on the drive up, we passed a memorial featuring the first Armenian tank to enter the city. We walked on Shushi\u2019s walls, which are largely intact, unlike much of the city. Though it has been repopulated by Armenians and partly rebuilt \u2014 check out the new, virtually mint-condition State Museum of Visual Arts, just 300 dram \u2014 countless traditional stone homes were destroyed in the war; their ruins dot the city. On one street, blocklong Soviet-era apartment buildings lined each side, one with the streetside wall blown out, the other decrepit but intact and inhabited.", "That\u2019s why the town\u2019s two mosques stand out. Though Armenians are Christians, the mosques used by Azerbaijani Muslims driven out a quarter-century ago are surprisingly intact and lovely. At the 19th-century Upper Mosque, we peered through grilled gates and saw an elegant vaulted brick ceiling. I found out later that the Armenians had protected and restored the mosque \u2014 which was viewed as a poignant preservation by some, a publicity stunt by others. The even more beautiful Lower Mosque is also standing but is not in as good shape.", "After sloshing through muddy, snowy roads, Sonya trying to describe how beautiful the town was in the spring, we met up with Sevak. He was an instantly likable man in his 30s with tightly cropped hair closely matching his heavy facial stubble.

After buying elements for a barbecue \u2014 meat, big ovals of matnaqash bread and vodka (plus water, my idea) \u2014 we realized we didn\u2019t have skewers. Davit simply walked over to a nearby apartment building, started shouting up to people on the balconies, and soon returned with skewers on loan from a stranger.", "The plan was to hike down into Hunot Gorge. Far below, the narrow but spirited Karkar River rushed through; across, a hill was covered by slender trees that, leafless in winter, looked like porcupine quills. Snow-capped mountains stretched to the horizon. Beautiful to look at, miserable to conduct a war in, I thought.", "I soon learned the plan was to go down to the river. \u201cAll the way down?\u201d I asked skeptically. But Sevak knew the route, which was spottily marked by blue paint splotches on trees or rocks. (It\u2019s part of what I would later learn is the Janapar Trail, which winds through back roads and villages and is almost certainly wonderful in the summer.) It was only occasionally difficult, involving brief spurts of clambering down rocks that made me wish I didn\u2019t own the world\u2019s cheapest hiking boots.", "As we walked down the final slope to the river, a surprise: an abandoned village of stone houses in various states of ruin, but not from the war. \u201cThe people left in 1930s or \u201940s,\u201d Sevak told us. \u201cTwo or three people from my village were born there.\u201d He pointed out another old house just across a stone bridge; that family, he said, harvested ice from the river in the winter and sold it throughout the year up in Shushi.", "As Sevak and Davit got a fire going, Sonya insisted on leading Goreun and me, a tired and still-skeptical pair, across the bridge and down the river\u2019s edge (and sometimes into it, hopping from stone to stone). My skepticism vanished at the end, when we found the astonishing Zontik, or \u201cUmbrella,\u201d waterfall \u2014 though to me the rock formation looked more like a bunch of giant mushrooms, drooping over a shallow cave. The rocks were covered in green moss, which split the water into tiny streams, forming a sheet of rivulets covering the entrance to the cave like a beaded curtain.", "We returned to the scent of roasting pork, which Davit doled out to us with chunks of bread and shots of vodka.

We talk about the dead brother as representing the \u201cdead\u201d parts of himself, including his depressive withdrawal from the world, and the emotionally deadened aspects of his parents, both of whom are still involved in his life. His mother, especially, has always struck him as disconnected, as if she is emotionally invested in something she has left behind.", "We all have our phantoms.

Apple\u2019s first smartphone was revolutionary not just because it did what few other phones could do, but also because it showed off the possibilities of a connected mobile computer. As the iPhone and its copycats became more powerful and ubiquitous, the mobile computer became the basis of a wide range of powerful new tech applications, from messaging to ride-sharing to payments.", "Similarly, the most exciting thing about the Apple Watch isn\u2019t the device itself, but the new tech vistas that may be opened by the first mainstream wearable computer. On-body devices have obvious uses in health care and payments. As the tech analyst Tim Bajarin has written, Apple also seems to be pushing a vision of the Watch as a general-purpose remote control for the real world, a nearly bionic way to open your hotel room, board a plane, call up an Uber or otherwise have the physical world respond to your desires nearly automatically.", "These situations suggest that the Watch may push us to new heights of collective narcissism. Yet in my week with the device, I became intrigued by the opposite possibility \u2014 that it could address some of the social angst wrought by smartphones. The Apple Watch\u2019s most ingenious feature is its \u201ctaptic engine,\u201d which alerts you to different digital notifications by silently tapping out one of several distinct patterns on your wrist. As you learn the taps over time, you will begin to register some of them almost subconsciously: incoming phone calls and alarms feel throbbing and insistent, a text feels like a gentle massage from a friendly bumblebee, and a coming calendar appointment is like the persistent pluck of a harp. After a few days, I began to get snippets of information from the digital world without having to look at the screen \u2014 or, if I had to look, I glanced for a few seconds rather than minutes.", "If such on-body messaging systems become more pervasive, wearable devices can become more than a mere flashy accessory to the phone. The Apple Watch could usher in a transformation of social norms just as profound as those we saw with its brother, the smartphone \u2014 except, amazingly, in reverse.", "For now, the dreams are hampered by the harsh realities of a new device. The Watch is not an iPhone on your wrist. It has a different set of input mechanisms \u2014 there\u2019s the digital crown, a knob used for scrolling and zooming, and a touch screen that can be pressed down harder for extra options. There is no full on-screen keyboard, so outbound messages are confined to a set of default responses, emoji and, when you\u2019re talking to other Watch users, messages that you can draw or tap.", "The Watch also relies heavily on voice dictation and the voice assistant Siri, which is more useful on your wrist than on your phone, but still just as hit-or-miss. I grew used to calling on Siri to set kitchen timers or reminders while I was cooking, or to look up the weather while I was driving. And I also grew used to her getting these requests wrong almost as often as she got them right.", "The Watch also has a completely different software design from a smartphone. Though it has a set of apps, interactions are driven more by incoming notifications as well as a summary view of some apps, known as glances. But because there isn\u2019t much room on the watch\u2019s screen for visual cues indicating where you are \u2014 in an app, a notification or a glance \u2014 in the early days, you\u2019ll often find yourself lost, and something that works in one place won\u2019t work in another.", "Finding nirvana with the watch involves adjusting your notification settings on your phone so that your wrist does not constantly buzz with information that doesn\u2019t make sense on the Watch \u2014 like Facebook status updates, messages from Snapchat, or every single email about brownies in the office kitchen. Apple\u2019s notification settings have long been unduly laborious; battling them while your hand is buzzing off the hook is an extra level of discomfort.", "Other problems: Third-party apps are mostly useless right now. The Uber app didn\u2019t load for me, the Twitter app is confusing and the app for Starwood hotels mysteriously deleted itself and then hung up on loading when I reinstalled it. In the end, though, it did let me open a room at the W Hotel in Manhattan just by touching the watch face to the door.", "I also used the Watch to pay for New York cabs and groceries at Whole Foods, and to present my boarding pass to security agents at the airport. When these encounters worked, they were magical, like having a secret key to unlock the world right on my arm. What\u2019s most thrilling about the Apple Watch, unlike other smartwatches I\u2019ve tried, is the way it invests a user with a general sense of empowerment. If Google brought all of the world\u2019s digital information to our computers, and the iPhone brought it to us everywhere, the Watch builds the digital world directly into your skin. It takes some time getting used to, but once it clicks, this is a power you can\u2019t live without.", "The New York Times announced last week that it had created \u201cone-sentence stories\u201d for the Apple Watch, so let me end this review with a note that could fit on the watch\u2019s screen: The first Apple Watch may not be for you \u2014 but someday soon, it will change your world."], "https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/star-wars-movies-will-be-available-at-digital-stores-like-amazon-and-itunes/": ["LOS ANGELES \u2013 Luke Skywalker is finally becoming one with the iPad generation: The \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies \u2013 for the first time \u2014 are being made available for purchase through digital stores like iTunes, Google Play and Amazon.", "Disney and 20th Century Fox said late Monday that the six movies \u2013 \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cReturn of the Jedi,\u201d \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back,\u201d \u201cThe Phantom Menace,\u201d \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d and \u201cRevenge of the Sith\u201d \u2014 would arrive online worldwide on April 10.

Jacobs gamely obliged, though at times she became flustered or teary. Thinking about money gives her a jolt, \u201clike you\u2019re about to get into a car accident,\u201d she later told me. There\u2019s the $3,700 for massage-\u00adschool tuition that she still owes on her credit card; the $60 a month for drugs for her anxiety and bipolar disorder, which she might skimp on again; the old debt she is paying down for her husband, a student and part-\u00adtime delivery driver for a Red\u2019s BBQ. Splurge on Walmart groceries this week or stick to the dollar store? Because bills come like clockwork and income does not, Jacobs never knows.", "Income volatility has been called America\u2019s \u201chidden inequality.\u201d The economists Karen Dynan, Douglas Elmendorf and Daniel Sichel estimated in a Brookings Institution paper that American household incomes became 30 percent more volatile between the early 1970s and the late 2000s, and that in recent years, more than one in 10 American households took in half the annual income that they did the previous year. The Federal Reserve found in 2014 that nearly a third of American households experienced significant income swings. The volatility is hardest, of course, on the poor, who don\u2019t just earn less than the better-\u00adoff but also earn their lower incomes more choppily, the money coming in irregular bursts, surging in some weeks, vanishing in others, always making a mockery of plans. Many poor people earn more each year than they spend, but on a given day, they don\u2019t have the cash to handle the expenses due. Payday loans, pawn shops, credit cards, overdraft fees and such fill the vacuum and make things worse, levying a vast toll in interest, fees and stress.", "The Federal Reserve study found that the principal cause of income volatility is irregular work hours. Employers increasingly use cutting-\u00adedge scheduling tools like Kronos to calculate the profit-\u00admaximizing head count for every hour and adjust schedules accordingly, week to week or even day to day, sometimes with scarcely any notice. Other factors contribute to growing volatility: the rise of the sharing and freelance economies, and thus the growing ranks of workers making benefits-\u00adfree livings as Uber drivers or graphic designers; the absence of paid sick leave, which can turn a single day lost to illness into a financial crisis; the way employers like Staples order employees not to exceed the number of weekly hours that would give them full-\u00adtime status and entitle them to benefits; the migration of salaried people to hourly work when hard times bring what the people in suits call \u201cright-\u00adsizing.\u201d", "Though Even is based in Oakland, it is staffed by big brains from Facebook, Google and Instagram and is funded by Silicon Valley A-\u00adlisters like Khosla Ventures.

Or, to put it in Palo Alto patois, they want to take the human disruption caused by disruption and, well, disrupt it.", "Even\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d is an app, still in beta testing, that smooths the irregular, up-\u00adand-\u00addown paychecks of hourly workers into the steady flow of a simulated salary. On good weeks, when users outearn their Even salary, the company banks the surplus into a separate, Even-\u00admanaged savings account. On bad weeks, when users fall short, they still get their salary, thanks to past surpluses or to interest-\u00adfree credit from Even. The app won\u2019t do anything for the 25 million Americans who, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have no bank account, nor will it help any of the many Americans who are simply too broke to get by even in the good weeks. Yet the Even founders have become something rare: innovators for the less fortunate in a Bay Area technology scene full of people who variously ignore America\u2019s historic level of inequality, worsen it with their real \u00adestate purchases or \u201cleverage\u201d it when they realize that the losers of the new world order they\u2019re building can at least be their Uber drivers, Instacart grocery deliverers and Homejoy toilet scrubbers.", "The company\u2019s founders believe that the stress of poverty flows more from the irregularity of income than from its dearth \u2014 from the inability to make and keep plans. Jacobs and that stress are intimately acquainted. There are the minor panic attacks she suffers, the feeling of being punched in the windpipe, when a financial matter crosses her mind. There are the full-\u00adon panic attacks that come when she skips her medicine to save money. There\u2019s her teeth-\u00adgrinding at night and a recurring unsubtle dream in which a relative is holding some money and judging her. There is the weight she puts on, and the morning body aches, when she gets the salt- and sugar-\u00adrich dollar-\u00adstore groceries instead of the pricier Walmart ones. And she sees no escape. She told Leibrock, \u201cI\u2019m pretty much working every day for the rest of my life.\u201d", "Leibrock most likely isn\u2019t, not least because she is so good at her job. \u201cRight there with you,\u201d she said.", "Jon Schlossberg, 28, came up with the idea for Even after solving what he calls \u201cthe ultimate first-\u00adworld problem\u201d: the agony of typing in a password every time you awaken your laptop. Knock to Unlock, a $3.99 app he helped develop, solved the problem using smartphones and sold \u201ca couple hundred thousand copies,\u201d he says, giving him a stretch of time last year to think. What could he solve next?", "The thing that kept coming to him was his childhood obsession with the reality-\u00adtelevision show \u201cCops,\u201d and specifically the sad subset of perps who would show up again and again. How could some people, he had always wondered, make such \u201cdumb decisions\u201d as to be arrested not once but twice by the police unit that happened to have a TV crew riding along? \u201cI didn\u2019t get it, and I wanted to,\u201d he told me. That curiosity about decision-\u00admaking fueled a boyhood fantasy of being a forensic psychologist for the F.B.I., and in fact he went on to study psychology at Skidmore. When he became interested in money in his 20s, he took a job as a product developer at Bonobos, the men\u2019s-clothing website, where he became fascinated by how tiny tweaks to the checkout process could alter customer behavior and lift sales.", "Schlossberg, now the chief executive of Even, is an improbable, almost reluctant champion of underdogs. He is a self-\u00addescribed son of privilege (\u201cI came from New England. I have good parents. I\u2019m a reasonably attractive male\u201d), and his early profile seemed to foreshadow a more conventional kind of tech-\u00adworld success: introvert; party avoider; quoter of \u201cStar Trek\u201d and \u201cBrave New World\u201d; declaimer of libertarian bro-\u00adisms, as in a blog post extolling \u201cthe importance of being ruthless.\u201d Growing up, Schlossberg was baffled and fascinated by his fellow humans. He read Dale Carnegie\u2019s \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d 15 times, he says, to learn how to relate to others. Still today, when speaking of a start-\u00adup whose ostensible purpose is humane, he has a tendency to drain the humanity from it. He says that making poor people\u2019s lives easier is merely a means to a greater end: reducing what he calls \u201ccognitive waste.\u201d", "Schlossberg might have gone the usual tech-\u00adworld way but for an academic study he read during his thinking vacation last year. Published by a team of behavioral psychologists and economists in 2013 in the journal Science, the study, \u201cPoverty Impedes Cognitive Function,\u201d sought to explain evidence of the \u201ccounterproductive behavior\u201d of poor people: being late to appointments, parenting less attentively, mismanaging money. It rejected the usual explanations \u2014 the left\u2019s structural theories, the right\u2019s theories about character \u2014 in favor of neuroscience. The 11-\u00adball juggle of poverty hampers the ability to focus on other problems, the authors proposed, \u201cjust as an air \u00adtraffic controller focusing on a potential collision course is prone to neglect other planes in the air.\u201d And merely thinking about money can throttle poor people\u2019s brains.", "The researchers tested this theory with an experiment. They approached people in a New Jersey mall and asked them a hypothetical financial question: \u201cYour car is having some trouble and requires $X to be fixed. You can pay in full, take a loan or take a chance and forgo the service at the moment.\u201d While the subjects considered the financial question, they were given unrelated, nonfinancial cognitive tests. Among those subjects randomly given a small X \u2014 say, $150 \u2014 people who reported a low income performed about as well on the nonfinancial cognitive tests as people who reported a high income. Among those randomly assigned to a larger X \u2014 say, $1,500 \u2014 the poor did much worse on the tests than the rich. The authors concluded that the mere thought of financial peril could tax poor people\u2019s smarts. The drop was equivalent to 13 I.Q. points, comparable to the effects of losing a night\u2019s sleep or becoming a chronic alcoholic.", "The study stayed with Schlossberg and led him to other research, about how poverty\u2019s stresses alter hormones and bias people toward short-\u00adterm rewards over long-\u00adterm ones. Soon he was dreaming of start-\u00adup ideas, he told me: \u201cHow could I succeed in building a company that reduces stress for poor people?\u201d", "Last summer, Schlossberg read a blog post by Quinten Farmer, an entrepreneur in New York, about a project called Stellar, which would use Bitcoin to help migrant workers send money home. Schlossberg was struck by the post: a potential co-\u00adfounder! Soon Farmer and Schlossberg were in a conference room, brainstorming.", "If Schlossberg is intense and inward, Farmer, 24, is the laid-\u00adback friend you might ask for thoughtful advice or marijuana. A more important contrast is that Farmer knows about hardship. He grew up on Whidbey Island in Washington State, his mother a homemaker, his father a mechanical engineer who provided a solid middle-\u00adclass life \u2014 until their divorce. Soon his mother was waiting tables and cleaning houses. At 15, Farmer began working to chip in, first as a dishwasher at the Oystercatcher restaurant, then as a farmhand, spending days knee-\u00addeep in dirt, cleaning garlic, the scent of which never seemed to leave him.", "Amid their brainstorming, Farmer scribbled \u201cincome volatility.\u201d He discovered the term in the 2009 book \u201cPortfolios of the Poor: How the World\u2019s Poor Live on $2 a Day,\u201d which studied families in Bangladesh, India and South Africa. But now, discussing poor people closer to home, Farmer\u2019s own experiences came back to him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just something that happens with day laborers in Bangladesh,\u201d he told Schlossberg.", "Schlossberg had never heard of income volatility. Farmer told him about choppy income and how the timing of money could be a bigger problem than the quantity.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d Schlossberg remembers saying, \u201cbut that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d", "A few thousand people will be using Even in limited release by summer\u2019s end, Schlossberg says, and it will be available to all comers by January. In the latest version of the app, new users are prompted to share their bank details. After analyzing the accounts, the app informs them of the smoothed \u201cEven pay\u201d they will receive from now on, which it refers to in the frequently-\u00adasked-\u00adquestions section as \u201cyour average paycheck.\u201d The word \u201caverage\u201d here is, as Schlossberg acknowledges, \u201ca gross oversimplification.\u201d It takes into account many factors: how long users have worked at their jobs, how widely their paychecks vary, how much they spend versus save. The app then holds back an \u201cEven cushion\u201d \u2014 a savings account it manages for the user. In the demo I saw, the app, drawing on a sample bank account, reported that \u201cif you earn less than $380, Even will automatically boost your paycheck. If you earn more than $380, Even will automatically pay back boosts and save the extra to your cushion.\u201d The F.A.Q. section also discloses that your \u201cEven pay\u201d already reflects the $3 a week you pay the company for its services.", "An annual fee of $156 might seem like a lot to shrink big paychecks and swell small ones. For a single person living on the federal poverty line, that\u2019s 1.3 percent of income. On the other hand, America\u2019s poor already spend billions each year smoothing their incomes \u2014 including $3.4 billion in fees on payday loans alone. Those loans, in which people write, say, a $350 postdated check to get $300 now, so saturate the lives of the poor that as of 2006, there were more payday lenders in Ohio than outlets of McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Wendy\u2019s combined, according to the advocacy group Policy Matters Ohio. In Oklahoma, a 2012 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that \u201cmore borrowers use at least 17 loans in a year than use just one.\u201d Because people often borrow a second time to pay off the first loan, and a third time to pay off the second, and so forth, a $300 loan easily snowballs into a $1,200 calamity. The Pentagon in 2006 found that payday loans and their cascade of debts and stress had become a threat to military readiness, and Congress soon passed a law tightly restricting loans to military personnel. Now the Obama administration is backing an effort by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to shield the rest of the population in similar ways; the heart of the bureau\u2019s proposal is a new requirement that lenders carefully verify a borrower\u2019s ability to repay.", "Schlossberg argues that Even is different from predatory lenders, because it has only one revenue stream: the $3 weekly fees, which it stops earning if a user goes too far into arrears and is suspended. He says that Even will never invest people\u2019s deposits to earn additional money and that it has no plans to make money in any other way. But investors crave only growth, and a $3 weekly fee may not satiate them. Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale who literally wrote the book on income volatility, \u201cThe Great Risk Shift\u201d (2006), says he finds Even \u201cdeeply attractive.\u201d But he worries that future investors, seeing in it the next Uber or Amazon, might pressure it to cross-\u00adsell other financial products, \u201csteering vulnerable consumers to products that weren\u2019t ideal for them.\u201d", "The company is now seeking partnerships with large employers who might offer Even to their part-\u00adtime employees as \u201ca subsidized benefit, akin to health insurance or financial wellness programs,\u201d Schlossberg says, allowing them to stabilize their incomes, if not their chaotic hours or day-\u00adcare plans. Schlossberg says this is all still up in the air, but another Even founder, Cem Kent, the son of Coca-\u00adCola\u2019s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, has taken on the task of hobnobbing some partnerships into being. In such cases, would Even still be a service devoted to helping the working poor? Or would it just be helping companies more easily and guiltlessly employ workers erratically?", "Schlossberg asks, \u201cBecause some might do bad, does that mean we should not do good?\u201d", "There are also questions about Even\u2019s own financial health. What happens when users lose jobs, start earning less or just skip out? Schlossberg says Even chooses users carefully and, with its non\u00adaverage average, has a buffer. The hope is that most users will be lending themselves money in bad weeks, not borrowing from Even.", "Lisa Servon, a professor of urban policy at the New School, has done extensive research on payday lenders, including working undercover for more than four months at such establishments in Oakland and the Bronx. I asked her about Even\u2019s prospects. She said its success would depend on its skill in distinguishing between two kinds of users: those who use \u201cpayday and overdraft and other forms of expensive credit because of income volatility\u201d and those who simply don\u2019t \u201chave enough money to make ends meet \u2014 period.\u201d Payday lenders make a fortune from those without enough money, but such users would be anathema to Even\u2019s self-insurance model. \u201cThe key for Even will be to have a good filter,\u201d Servon told me.", "In other words, for Even to thrive, it will probably need to avoid the truly needy: those who don\u2019t have enough ever, not merely right now. Picking winners also means picking \u2014 and spurning \u2014 losers. Even\u2019s purpose is hardly to change the distribution of wealth in society. It is simply to redistribute one person\u2019s own limited wealth across time. People in Silicon Valley may believe there\u2019s an app for everything. That\u2019s their hammer.

Inside is entirely different. The galleries, with high ceilings, tall windows and soft pine-plank floors, are as airy and light-flooded as the 19th-century sailmaker\u2019s lofts known to Herman Melville, who worked as a shipboard customs inspector where the Whitney now stands. Art feels at home in them, and the work in the museum\u2019s top-to-bottom inaugural show is homegrown. Culled from the permanent collection, it imaginatively mixes favorites by Edward Hopper, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Jasper Johns with objects and artists that the Whitney had all but forgotten.", "It\u2019s good to see a new museum start with history, and the show, called \u201cAmerica Is Hard to See\u201d and opening on May 1, is, on the whole, a carefully judged musing on an institutional past. That it could never have been done on the same scale at the Whitney uptown is as good a reason as any to have made a move. The new place, at the southern end of the High Line, has twice the exhibition space of the old one. Big slices of the collection can now be on full-time display, never possible before.", "Reasons for choosing the meatpacking district, blocks from Chelsea, as a destination are clear, too, but slipperier. At a time when art is literally as good as gold, the museum has, cannily it would seem, anchored itself in the mercantile center of things, in a prime neighborhood that is the precise opposite of being an artist neighborhood. Economically, Chelsea is a gated community: Artists can visit but must live elsewhere. What will the Whitney do with that? Whose friend will it be? Market or artist? It cannot be true friend to both.", "The High Line location was surely an incentive, too. Suddenly, that elevated walkway, the bizarre scene of pedestrian pacing, has a new goal: It will funnel foot-traffic straight to the museum, which will work hard to be a magnetic destination. Along with art, visitors will find an in-house bar-restaurant, a cafe, a theater-like performance space, elevators designed by Richard Artschwager that are like walking sculptures, and outdoor galleries with panoramic vistas. The new Whitney is the only major museum in this water-lapped city with fabulous river views.", "All (or some) of this newness is good, but it\u2019s useful to remember \u2014 and the museum does remind us \u2014 that the Whitney started small and off the commercial grid and was created by an artist for other artists. The creator was Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (1875-1942), a sculptor and collector who had money, social status and a rebel\u2019s appetite for American work that went against the cultural grain of her day. In offbeat Greenwich Village, she started her own museum, which also functioned as a school, a studio and a communal rec room where artists could meet, work and party. You get a vivid sense of the atmosphere in a show installed in the new museum\u2019s lobby gallery which, like the original 1931 Whitney, is free to the public. A 1916 portrait of Mrs. Whitney, painted by Robert Henri as a Venus lounging in turquoise silk pajamas, dominates the scene, but there\u2019s hubbub around her. Hopper is off in a corner sketching nudes; the museum\u2019s go-getting first director, the aptly named Juliana Force, stands, back to us, in a curatorial huddle. A delightful menagerie of sculptural animals demonstrates that the folk-and-outsider art we so value now was also valued then. And a suite of satirical drawings by Guy P\u00e8ne Du Bois, recently found in the museum\u2019s archives, reveals that the art world of nearly a century ago was every bit as silly as it is today.", "From this point, the chronological story of American modernism laid out by four Whitney curators \u2014 Donna De Salvo, Carter E. Foster, Dana Miller and Scott Rothkopf, working with Jane Panetta, Catherine Taft and Mia Curran \u2014 moves up to the eighth floor and unfolds there with European-influenced abstraction, a kind of art that Mrs. Whitney was slow to warm to. She collected some: Stuart Davis\u2019s 1927 \u201cEgg Beater No. 1\u201d was hers. But the great Marsden Hartley works that open this section, radiating the color and clamor of World War I Berlin, came to the museum after her death, as did a big composition of google-eyed swirls by the poet E. E. Cummings, one of many novelties hauled out of deep storage.", "The show is rich in them: a little Joseph Stella collage that looks like a piece of rotting meat; a carved cherry wood bust called \u201cCongolais\u201d by Nancy Elizabeth Prophet, an artist of African-American and Native American descent who was a hit in Europe and ended up a housemaid back home. A 1914 painting by the little-known James Daugherty ingeniously grafts geometric abstraction to baseball. And, in the exhibition\u2019s single loan piece, Florine Stettheimer pays tribute to Lady Liberty, who on a clear day you can spy way downtown from the cafe terrace on the eighth floor.", "Each is memorable for beauty, rarity or oddness. Together they demonstrate how truly unmappable the borders of American modernism are, a fact that the curators emphasize by avoiding fixed categories in their groupings. They shuffle painting, photography, prints and sculpture. They arrange work by theme and sensibility rather than by textbook brand. A section on the seventh floor labeled \u201cRose Castle\u201d is named for a specific assemblage by Joseph Cornell. But it is really about a dream-fed strand of American surrealism, one that embraces fantasists as different as Hopper, Man Ray, Jared French and Andrew Wyeth, while also pulling the filmmakers Maya Deren and Mary Elle Bute into its orbit.", "Elsewhere, \u201cCalder\u2019s Circus\u201d gets the center stage its popularity has earned it. But here its vaunted adorableness is wisely deflated by the unsavory company it keeps \u2014 a George Bellows slugfest hangs behind it. On another wall, Reginald Marsh\u2019s tough 10 cent dancers angle for clients, and Weegee turns opening night at the opera into a class war face-off. The big picture is of an America so addled by its appetite for entertaining distraction that it can\u2019t see its own corruption for what it is, a moral depth charge about to blow.", "The theme naturally carries over into a Pop Art selection on the sixth floor, though apart from the addition of a few surprise images here \u2014 Malcolm Bailey\u2019s 1969 painting of a slave ship is one \u2014 not much is done with it. The same is true in sections devoted to Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism. They\u2019re pretty much by the conventional book; they are O.K., but ordinary.", "Not ordinary at all are three taut installations of political art. Spread over three floors, they punctuate the show like drum beats. Why do people disparage political art on the grounds that it\u2019s doomed to look dated? Drawings and prints from the 1930s protesting antiblack violence have immediate relevance. A 1970 film by Howard Lester called \u201cOne Week in Vietnam,\u201d which flashes photographs of American soldiers killed in the war in a span of seven days, is still a punch to the gut.", "Art generated by or during the AIDS years of the 1980s and \u201990s is turning out to be more potent, not less, as time passes. And although the politics of personal identity \u2014 racial, ethnic, sexual \u2014 are now out of critical fashion, it saturates much of the most recent art in this show. In a 2013 video by Jacolby Satterwhite, and a 2014 painting by Nicole Eisenman, difference is depicted in a fresh way, as a reality beyond nailing down, beyond definition.", "Nowhere directly addressed are the Whitney\u2019s own identity issues, embedded in its very name. This isn\u2019t a museum of American art. It\u2019s a museum of North American art. The curators are well aware of this, and sometimes use the phrase \u201cart of the United States.\u201d But the exclusion remains: Latin American art, art of the Americas, is all but absent here, with the Cuban-born painter Carmen Herrera, 99, being among the outstanding exceptions. (She will have a solo show in 2016.)", "And how can it be that in a show of more than 400 American artists, there\u2019s only one Native American \u2014 Jimmie Durham (maybe two if you count Ms. Prophet)? As part of its institutional narrative, the inaugural exhibition evokes two identity-themed Whitney shows from the past, the 1993 Biennial and the 1994 \u201cBlack Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary Art.\u201d But no mention is made of one that fully carried the institution out of parochialism, Lawrence Rinder\u2019s \u201cThe American Effect: Global Perspectives in the United States, 1990-2003,\u201d which had work by artists in China, Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, Egypt, Japan and Senegal. It had faults \u2014 what out-on-a-limb project doesn\u2019t? \u2014 but if I were looking for a model to project toward the future, this would be one. So there\u2019s work ahead.", "In a real sense, the new building is the least of the Whitney\u2019s concerns. For better or possibly worse \u2014 there have already been protests over its proximity to a pipeline carrying fracked fuel \u2014 it\u2019s a done deal. If it lets art put its best foot forward and gives it an effective stage for shaping culture, it\u2019s been done well. Besides, most museums tend to turn into \u201cclassics\u201d within a generation or two. And always, it\u2019s the institutional thinking, inherently political, that matters \u2014 determining first what and who goes into the collection, then what goes into the public spaces and lastly what new, alternative eyes will be coming on board to oversee these things. With the move, the new Whitney makes a promising start. It shakes art and itself up, bracingly, at least a little. Once the opening parties are over, I want it to do much more, to become the living museum of history-in-nowness this city has been waiting for.", "Meanwhile, it gives us some of the most luminous indoor-outdoor art spaces in town in which to think about all of this."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/technology/uber-hires-a-security-chief-from-facebook.html": ["Silicon Valley is home to some of the world\u2019s brightest technical minds.

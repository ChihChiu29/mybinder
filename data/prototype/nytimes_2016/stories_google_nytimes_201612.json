Uber has previously grappled with the authorities in California over safety concerns.

There was, of course, content created by outside news media that was shared by users, but there were also reams of content \u2014 posts, images, videos \u2014 created on Facebook-only pages, and still more media created by politicians themselves. During the election, it was apparent to almost anyone with an account that Facebook was teeming with political content, much of it extremely partisan or pitched, its sourcing sometimes obvious, other times obscured, and often simply beside the point \u2014 memes or rants or theories that spoke for themselves.", "Facebook seems to have zeroed in on only one component of this ecosystem \u2014 outside websites \u2014 and within it, narrow types of bad actors. These firms are, generally speaking, paid by advertising companies independent of Facebook, which are unaware of or indifferent to their partners\u2019 sources of audience. Accordingly, Facebook\u2019s anti-hoax measures seek to regulate these sites by punishing them not just for what they do on Facebook, but for what they do outside of it.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated,\u201d Mosseri wrote. \u201cSpammers make money by masquerading as well-known news organizations and posting hoaxes that get people to visit to their sites, which are often mostly ads.\u201d The proposed solution: \u201cAnalyzing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary.\u201d", "The stated targets of Facebook\u2019s efforts are precisely defined, but its formulation of the problem implicates, to a lesser degree, much more than just \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d Consider this characterization of what makes a \u201cfake news\u201d site a bad platform citizen: It uses Facebook to capture receptive audiences by spreading lies and then converts those audiences into money by borrowing them from Facebook, luring them to an outside site larded with obnoxious ads. The site\u2019s sin of fabrication is made worse by its profit motive, which is cast here as a sort of arbitrage scheme. But an acceptable news site does more or less the same thing: It uses Facebook to capture receptive audiences by spreading not-lies and then converts those audiences into money by luring them to an outside site not-quite larded with not-as-obnoxious ads. In either case, Facebook users are being taken out of the safe confines of the platform into areas that Facebook does not and cannot control.", "In this context, this \u201cfake news\u201d problem reads less as a distinct new phenomenon than as a flaring symptom of an older, more existential anxiety that Facebook has been grappling with for years: its continued (albeit diminishing) dependence on the same outside web that it, and other platforms, have begun to replace. Facebook\u2019s plan for \u201cfake news\u201d is no doubt intended to curb certain types of misinformation. But it\u2019s also a continuation of the company\u2019s bigger and more consequential project \u2014 to capture the experiences of the web it wants and from which it can profit, but to insulate itself from the parts that it doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t. This may help solve a problem within the ecosystem of outside publishers \u2014 an ecosystem that, in the distribution machinery of Facebook, is becoming redundant, and perhaps even obsolete.", "As Facebook has grown, so have its ambitions. Its mantralike mission (to \u201cconnect the world\u201d) is rivaled among internet companies perhaps by only that of Google (to \u201corganize the world\u2019s information\u201d) in terms of sheer scope. In the run-up to Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, Mark Zuckerberg told investors that the company makes decisions \u201cnot optimizing for what\u2019s going to happen in the next year, but to set us up to really be in this world where every product experience you have is social, and that\u2019s all powered by Facebook.\u201d", "To understand what such ambition looks like in practice, consider Facebook\u2019s history. It started as an inward-facing website, closed off from both the web around it and the general public. It was a place to connect with other people, and where content was created primarily by other users: photos, wall posts, messages. This system quickly grew larger and more complex, leading to the creation, in 2006, of the news feed \u2014 a single location in which users could find updates from all of their Facebook friends, in roughly reverse-chronological order.", "When the news feed was announced, before the emergence of the modern Facebook sharing ecosystem, Facebook\u2019s operating definition of \u201cnews\u201d was pointedly friend-centric. \u201cNow, whenever you log in, you\u2019ll get the latest headlines generated by the activity of your friends and social groups,\u201d the announcement about the news feed said. This would soon change.", "In the ensuing years, as more people spent more time on Facebook, and following the addition of \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cShare\u201d functions within Facebook, the news feed grew into a personalized portal not just for personal updates but also for the cornucopia of media that existed elsewhere online: links to videos, blog posts, games and more or less anything else published on an external website, including news articles. This potent mixture accelerated Facebook\u2019s change from a place for keeping up with family and friends to a place for keeping up, additionally, with the web in general, as curated by your friends and family. Facebook\u2019s purview continued to widen as its user base grew and then acquired their first smartphones; its app became an essential lens through which hundreds of millions of people interacted with one another, with the rest of the web and, increasingly, with the world at large.", "Facebook, in other words, had become an interface for the whole web rather than just one more citizen of it. By sorting and mediating the internet, Facebook inevitably began to change it. In the previous decade, the popularity of Google influenced how websites worked, in noticeable ways: Titles and headlines were written in search-friendly formats; pages or articles would be published not just to cover the news but, more specifically, to address Google searchers\u2019 queries about the news, the canonical example being The Huffington Post\u2019s famous \u201cWhat Time Does The Super Bowl Start?\u201d Publishers built entire business models around attracting search traffic, and search-engine optimization, S.E.O., became an industry unto itself. Facebook\u2019s influence on the web \u2014 and in particular, on news publishers \u2014 was similarly profound. Publishers began taking into consideration how their headlines, and stories, might travel within Facebook. Some embraced the site as a primary source of visitors; some pursued this strategy into absurdity and exploitation.", "Facebook, for its part, paid close attention to the sorts of external content people were sharing on its platform and to the techniques used by websites to get an edge. It adapted continually. It provided greater video functionality, reducing the need to link to outside videos or embed them from YouTube. As people began posting more news, it created previews for links, with larger images and headlines and longer summaries; eventually, it created Instant Articles, allowing certain publishers (including The Times) to publish stories natively in Facebook. At the same time, it routinely sought to penalize sites it judged to be using the platform in bad faith, taking aim at \u201cclickbait,\u201d an older cousin of \u201cfake news,\u201d with a series of design and algorithm updates. As Facebook\u2019s influence over online media became unavoidably obvious, its broad approach to users and the web became clearer: If the network became a popular venue for a certain sort of content or behavior, the company generally and reasonably tried to make that behavior easier or that content more accessible. This tended to mean, however, bringing it in-house.", "To Facebook, the problem with \u201cfake news\u201d is not just the obvious damage to the discourse, but also with the harm it inflicts upon the platform. People sharing hoax stories were, presumably, happy enough with they were seeing. But the people who would then encounter those stories in their feeds were subjected to a less positive experience. They were sent outside the platform to a website where they realized they were being deceived, or where they were exposed to ads or something that felt like spam, or where they were persuaded to share something that might later make them look like a rube. These users might rightly associate these experiences not just with their friends on the platform, or with the sites peddling the bogus stories but also with the platform itself. This created, finally, an obvious issue for a company built on attention, advertising and the promotion of outside brands. From the platform\u2019s perspective, \u201cfake news\u201d is essentially a user-experience problem resulting from a lingering design issue \u2014 akin to slow-loading news websites that feature auto-playing videos and obtrusive ads.", "Increasingly, legitimacy within Facebook\u2019s ecosystem is conferred according to a participant\u2019s relationship to the platform\u2019s design. A verified user telling a lie, be it a friend from high school or the president elect, isn\u2019t breaking the rules; he is, as his checkmark suggests, who he represents himself to be. A post making false claims about a product is Facebook\u2019s problem only if that post is labeled an ad. A user video promoting a conspiracy theory becomes a problem only when it leads to the violation of community guidelines against, for example, user harassment. Facebook contains a lot more than just news, including a great deal of content that is newslike, partisan, widely shared and often misleading. Content that has been, and will be, immune from current \u201cfake news\u201d critiques and crackdowns, because it never had the opportunity to declare itself news in the first place. To publish lies as \u201cnews\u201d is to break a promise; to publish lies as \u201ccontent\u201d is not.", "That the \u201cfake news\u201d problem and its proposed solutions have been defined by Facebook as link issues \u2014 as a web issue \u2014 aligns nicely with a longer-term future in which Facebook\u2019s interface with the web is diminished.

As she interviewed at companies about board seats, she said, she found that many directors typically stuck to their own networks of acquaintances for candidates. That generally led to looking at the same people over and over again.", "As a rule of thumb, boards also want experienced members.

It has long regarded itself as a neutral place where people can freely post, read and view content, and it has said it does not want to be an arbiter of truth. But as its reach and influence have grown, it has had to confront questions about its moral obligations and ethical standards regarding what appears on the network.", "Its experiments on curtailing fake news show that Facebook recognizes it has a deepening responsibility for what is on its site. But Facebook also must tread cautiously in making changes, because it is wary of exposing itself to claims of censorship.", "\u201cWe really value giving people a voice, but we also believe we need to take responsibility for the spread of fake news on our platform,\u201d said Adam Mosseri, a Facebook vice president who is in charge of its news feed, the company\u2019s method of distributing information to its global audience.", "He said the changes \u2014 which, if successful, may be available to a wide audience \u2014 resulted from many months of internal discussion about how to handle false news articles shared on the network.", "What impact Facebook\u2019s moves will have on fake news is unclear. The issue is not confined to the social network, with a vast ecosystem of false news creators who thrive on online advertising and who can use other social media and search engines to propagate their work. Google, Twitter and message boards like 4chan and Reddit have all been criticized for being part of that chain.", "Still, Facebook has taken the most heat over fake news. The company has been under that spotlight since Nov. 8, when Donald J. Trump was elected the 45th president. Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory almost immediately led people to focus on whether Facebook had influenced the electorate, especially with the rise of hyperpartisan sites on the network and many examples of misinformation, such as a false article that claimed Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump for president that was shared nearly a million times across the site.", "Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has said he did not believe that the social network had influenced the election result, calling it \u201ca pretty crazy idea.\u201d Yet the intense scrutiny of the company on the issue has caused internal divisions and has pushed Mr. Zuckerberg to say he was trying to find ways to reduce the problem.", "In an interview, Mr. Mosseri said Facebook did not think its news feed had directly caused people to vote for a particular candidate, given that \u201cthe magnitude of fake news across Facebook is one fraction of a percent of the content across the network.\u201d", "Facebook has changed the way its news feed works before. In August, the company announced changes to marginalize what it considered \u201cclickbait,\u201d the sensational headlines that rarely live up to their promise. This year, Facebook also gave priority to content shared by friends and family, a move that shook some publishers that rely on the social network for much of their traffic. The company is also constantly fine-tuning its algorithms to serve what its users most want to see, an effort to keep its audience returning regularly.", "This time, Facebook is making it easier to flag content that may be fake. Users can report a post they dislike in their feed, but when Facebook asks for a reason, the site presents them with a list of limited and vague options, including the cryptic \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be on Facebook.\u201d In Facebook\u2019s new experiment, users will have a choice to flag the post as fake news and have the option to message the friend who originally shared the piece to tell him or her the article is false.", "If an article receives enough flags as fake, it can be directed to a coalition of groups that will fact-check it. The groups include Snopes, PolitiFact, The Associated Press, FactCheck.org and ABC News. They will check the article and can mark it as a \u201cdisputed\u201d piece, a designation that will be seen on Facebook.", "Partner organizations will not be paid, the companies said. Some characterized the fact-checking as an extension of their journalistic efforts.", "\u201cWe actually regard this as a big part of our core mission,\u201d James Goldston, the president of ABC News, said in an interview. \u201cIf that core mission isn\u2019t helping people regard the real from the fake news, I don\u2019t know what our mission is.\u201d", "Disputed articles will ultimately appear lower in the news feed. If users still decide to share such an article, they will receive a pop-up reminding them that the accuracy of the piece is in question.", "Facebook said it was casting a wide net to add more partners to its fact-checking coalition and may move outside of the United States with the initiative if early experiments go well. The company is also part of the First Draft Coalition, an effort with other technology and media companies including Twitter, Google, The New York Times and CNN, to combat the spread of fake news online.", "In another change in how the news feed works, articles that many users read but do not share will be ranked lower on people\u2019s feeds. Mr. Mosseri said a low ratio of sharing an article after it has been read could be perceived as a negative signal, one that might reflect that the article was misleading or of poor quality.", "\u201cFacebook was inevitably going to have to curate the platform much more carefully, and this seems like a reasonably transparent method of intervention,\u201d said Emily Bell, director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.", "\u201cBut the fake cat is already out of the imaginary bag,\u201d Ms. Bell added. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t try and do something about it, next time around it could have far worse consequences.\u201d", "Facebook also plans to impede the economics of spreading fake articles across the network. Fake news purveyors generally make money when people click on the false articles and are directed to third-party websites, the majority of which are filled with dozens of low-cost ads.", "Facebook will review those third-party links and check for things like whether the page is mostly filled with advertising content \u2014 a dead giveaway for spam sites \u2014 or to see whether a link masquerades as a different site, like a fake version of The New York Times. Such sites would not be eligible to display Facebook advertising on their pages.", "Articles disputed by the fact-checking coalition will also not be eligible to be inserted into Facebook ads, a tactic viral spammers have used to spread fake news quickly and gain more clicks on their websites.", "Facebook said that in these early experiments it would deal with only fake news content; it does not plan to flag opinion posts or other content that could not be easily classified. The changes will not affect satirical sites like The Onion, which often jabs at political subjects through tongue-in-cheek humor.", "Facebook must take something else into consideration: its profit. Any action taken to reduce popular content, even if it is fake news, could hurt the company\u2019s priority of keeping its users engaged on the platform. People spend an average of more than 50 minutes a day on Facebook, and the company wants that number to grow.", "Executives at Facebook stressed the overriding factor right now is not just engagement.", "\u201cI think of Facebook as a technology company, but I recognize we have a greater responsibility than just building technology that information flows through,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Thursday. \u201cWe have a responsibility to make sure Facebook has the greatest positive impact on the world.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/media/breitbart-vanguard-ads-follow-users-target-marketing.html": ["The Vanguard Group does its best to stay away from politics when advertising, going so far as to have a policy against marketing on overtly partisan websites.

The brands have attributed their appearances on the site to the automated nature of online advertising, in which a complicated system of third-party networks and agencies is used to place ads. That has cast a spotlight on how the zeal to capitalize on consumer data and advanced targeting technologies has resulted in some companies\u2019 being associated with sites they want to avoid.", "It is increasingly rare for marketers and their agencies to place ads directly on websites.

Trump warned of the threat posed by Syrian refugees. Instead, they found a national movement to aid them.", "As Syria shattered, everyday citizens, called private sponsors, were adopting the newcomers, donating their time and thousands of dollars to help guide them through their first year. The volunteers attended to the family\u2019s every need: an apartment, doctors, tips on finding a mosque and halal food. The sponsors even applied to bring other family members to Canada \u2014 and still they wanted to know what more they could do.", "The Mohammads were astonished and grateful. But over 10 months, the relationship was reshaping the family, rewriting roles and rules they had always followed. Abdullah and Eman found their marriage on new ground, the fundamental compact between them shifting. Bayan, their oldest child, was going from girl to adolescent, Middle Eastern to North American all at the same time. She was the one most likely to remember their now-obliterated life in Syria. On some days, her parents believed that she could meld her old and new identities; on others, they feared her Syrianness was being erased.", "If the family had landed in Munich or Minneapolis, they would have encountered new cultural dilemmas, too. But Canada\u2019s unusual private sponsorship system made them especially acute, because it was so intimate. The Canadians and Syrians were in and out of one another\u2019s homes for tutoring, computer lessons or celebrations. They shared parental tasks like communication with teachers, since the Mohammads spoke little English. \u201cWhat they gave us, a brother wouldn\u2019t even give to his own brother,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said.", "Still, when one sponsor took the children to a ballet performance, Bayan twirled her way home and then begged for lessons \u2014 which would involve revealing outfits that would make her parents uncomfortable. The sponsors invited the children to make gingerbread houses and sing carols. Did saying yes mean that the strict Muslim family would be celebrating a Christian holiday?", "\u201cSponsorship brings the tension between East and West so close,\u201d said Sam Nammoura, a Syrian-Canadian refugee advocate in Calgary, Alberta.", "The Mohammads had left Syria and then Jordan to safeguard their children \u2014 but once they arrived here, they were bewildered by what they found.

How much control did parents even have?", "\u201cEvery day I have this dilemma,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said. \u201cAm I letting the kids do the right thing?\u201d", "In October, Bayan craved one item above all on her wish list: to join her school\u2019s overnight trip.

The rule had governed the Mohammad family for generations, backed up by relatives, friends, an entire culture. Within months of arriving in Canada, Bayan shocked her parents by beginning to question their decisions out loud.", "\u201cShe\u2019s stronger now, here, and she tries to express herself more than in Syria,\u201d her mother explained.", "Bayan knew she had a quiet ally at the lunch table that day: Kerry McLorg, the organizer of the sponsor group. Meticulous and restrained, Ms. McLorg never wanted to push the Mohammads, and when they asked for her advice, she tended to answer with clinical distance, lest her own preferences show.", "But she knew Bayan yearned for the adventure. She and the other sponsors saw it as another step in the girl\u2019s integration into Canada. Her two children had gone on the trip years ago and still talked about the traditions \u2014 visiting a lighthouse, telling ghost stories.", "\u201cEvery kid in Toronto does this,\u201d Ms. McLorg had told Bayan\u2019s parents when they had asked. \u201cAcademically, it\u2019s not important.

He was not an immigrant who set out to adapt to a new world; he was a refugee trying to hold on to what had been ripped from him. \u201cWe\u2019re forced to be here,\u201d Mr. Mohammad said later. \u201cWe\u2019re happy, but we\u2019re forced to be here.\u201d", "He still had a shot at preserving the identity he wanted for Bayan, but he and his wife would have to be vigilant, willing to deny their daughter some of what she wanted.", "\u201cI will do this for her,\u201d he said. \u201cGod help us.\u201d", "Only one thing about Canada seemed to disconcert Bayan: its types of families she had never seen or even imagined. She was troubled by the concept of divorce, by classmates whose parents lived in separate homes. \u201cMy mom and dad, they will not do that,\u201d she declared.", "The Mohammads were from a particularly conservative village in Daraa Province. Their union was arranged by their families and governed by clear tenets. Back home, Eman Mohammad, 36, did not leave the house without asking her husband\u2019s permission. She did not socialize with men who were not relatives. Women in the village did not drive. Against the odds, and Abdullah\u2019s initial reluctance, she had worked as a nurse, one of only a few women in her circle to be employed outside the home after having children.", "Now she was far more at home in Canada than he was. She attended her first modern dance performance, thrilled by the surprise and emotion. When her husband, 36, turned down a supermarket job this summer, unsure of what kind of work he wanted, she joked that she would take it. She was determined to get certified as a nurse again, even though that would require years of language instruction and coursework.", "Meanwhile, she found new purpose: helping lead a therapy group for Syrian women coping with trauma and displacement. Standing in front of a whiteboard, she peppered her presentations with motivational statements: \u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d \u201cWhen we work, we are helping society around us, not ourselves alone.\u201d She earned about 70 Canadian dollars for each weekly session.", "Being in Canada \u201copened new doors for me that I didn\u2019t even know existed,\u201d Mrs. Mohammad said.", "Her husband, however, was having difficulty. In Syria, he co-owned a grocery store and two butcher shops, and had been the unquestioned head of the household. Now the sponsors were helping support his family, along with government subsidies. While his wife went to one of the therapy groups, he took care of Bayan and the younger children, and he had been helping in the kitchen.", "\u201cSometimes I feel weak doing these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s job.\u201d He told himself that spending more time with his children would draw them closer.", "Bayan had ambitions for her father: to learn to swim, to drive, to buy a car with six seats. \u201cI dream, like, all the time we have a big house and a pool,\u201d she said.", "But Mr. Mohammad was nowhere near finding work that could support a family of six in an expensive city, and he felt torn about whether he should continue to study English full time or just get the best job he could. \u201cI feel lost,\u201d he had said. Because his wife\u2019s language skills were better, he sometimes was left out of conversations. (The Mohammads asked not to be identified by their full surnames, because they feared reprisals against relatives still in Syria. This article uses part of their family name.)", "If Syria heals, Mr. Mohammad said, he definitely wants to go back.", "His wife countered: \u201cMy future and my kids\u2019 future is in this country.\u201d", "Then they laughed. The marriages of many Syrians who had come to Canada were far more strained, they knew, the traditional arrangements difficult to replant on new soil. Mrs. Mohammad\u2019s counseling groups were filled with women whose husbands had turned bitter at the changed circumstances. Some wives were finally reporting years of domestic abuse.", "The Mohammads tried to mitigate their differences with kindness. She found ways to telegraph respect for her husband\u2019s authority \u2014 before buying a new dress, she texted him a photo and the price for approval. For fortitude with child care duties, he turned to Islamic teachings about the value of helping one\u2019s wife. The two had long conversations about a new favorite word, \u201cflexibility.\u201d", "Even as Eman Mohammad craved opportunities for herself, she was not sure how much freedom she wanted for Bayan. In Syria, the path was restrictive but clear. If the war had never happened, she would already be wearing a head scarf and attending a girls\u2019 school. Most girls in her village married at 14 or 15, though the Mohammads would have waited until at least 18. Even if she pursued university there, she would not go on unsupervised dates, get offered a beer at a party, or live alone.", "Now that she was in Canada, her mother felt, there was no longer a map for her daughter\u2019s life. \u201cI want to try everything here,\u201d Bayan said.", "On the day of the school trip, with her classmates off on Toronto Island in a freezing rain, the family moved on to their next cultural debate.", "\u201cWhat is the meaning of Halloween?\u201d Mrs. Mohammad asked. The holiday was four days away.", "Bayan burst with answers. It was about being frightened in a fun way, she said, dressing as skeletons and ghosts. \u201cIt has to be something scary,\u201d she explained. She wanted to wear a devil costume.", "One of the sponsors had already arranged to take them trick-or-treating. But what Mrs. Mohammad had heard about the holiday made her dubious. Her children would celebrate death and horror, after they had escaped the real thing? Should she worry that her daughter wanted to dress as a symbol of evil? Did Canadians really believe in people coming back from the dead?", "Just then, Ms. McLorg arrived at the family\u2019s apartment with a giant pumpkin for the children to carve. Bayan had asked Ms. McLorg to join them for the coming trick-or-treat date, but the sponsor did not realize how Mrs. Mohammad felt.", "Ms. McLorg was trying to introduce Canadian customs without imposing on the family\u2019s own. \u201cThey should not have to change their essence in order to become Canadian,\u201d Ms. McLorg said later. In fact, the country officially encourages new arrivals to maintain their own culture.", "In the end, they all celebrated Halloween. Another sponsor hosted them for dinner and cookies: long slivers of shortbread with red icing and almond nails, meant to look like bloody fingers. Ms. McLorg arrived in a pink bunny suit. On the costume question, Bayan and her mother had reached a middle ground: a zombie princess.", "Abdullah Mohammad headed home early; Bayan pleaded to stay later. Her mother surveyed the spiderwebs and chains lacing the street, watching her children merge into the flowing highway of trick-or-treaters.", "Two weeks later, Mrs. Mohammad and her two daughters were propelled into a local Walmart by Bayan\u2019s sheer force of will. She longed for a pair of sparkly purple sneakers, and begged, nagged and nearly cried until her mother agreed.", "As they navigated the aisles, mother and daughters looked like members of two different families. Mrs. Mohammad wore her head scarf, neck-to-toe gown and shawl, while the girls were in leggings and skinny jeans.", "The question about when Bayan would start covering her head loomed over her and her parents. As they were in Canada, her mother was willing to postpone it until seventh grade.", "\u201cNo!\u201d Bayan yelled when she overheard her mother talking about it. She looked ugly with her head covered, she thought. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in grade nine \u2014 maybe,\u201d she said.", "But the next day, Bayan and her mother slipped inside a building a few blocks from their apartment, where the 10-year-old kicked off the brand-new sneakers and knelt. Her mother draped a thin scarf over her daughter\u2019s head, expertly folding, tucking and pinning until it covered her hair without a strand showing.", "This was Islamic school at the mosque, a new fixture of Bayan\u2019s Sundays. For several hours, she studied written Arabic, verses of the Quran and Islamic values with other children. It was the only activity of hers that the sponsors had not been involved in planning; that day, they were taking the rest of the family to a Santa parade, which Bayan was disappointed to miss.", "Sunday mornings were a compromise between Bayan and her parents: the single time each week, for now, that she would cover her head.", "For the main lesson that day, the teacher, Maimoonah Ali, an 18-year-old whose parents came to Canada as refugees from Eritrea, passed out colored Popsicle sticks and instructed the students to snap them. The sound of splintering wood filled the room. \u201cSometimes there are tests in life,\u201d she told the children. \u201cAnd sometimes they break us.\u201d", "Then she collected the remaining sticks into a tight bundle. One by one, the students strained and failed to break them. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really difficult to break things when they\u2019re all together, right?\u201d Ms. Ali asked. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly like us.\u201d", "But it was not clear how much the class was going to do to help secure Bayan\u2019s Syrian identity. In English, she could read at \u201cCat in the Hat\u201d level, but her Arabic reading was worse, because the war had interrupted her schooling. Bayan was supposed to repeat the verses that a classmate was saying that day, but her partner did not speak Arabic, and Bayan could barely understand her. She was the only Syrian in the school.", "Other classmates\u2019 parents came from Algeria, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Mali. Half the population of Toronto is foreign-born, a reflection of Canada\u2019s openness to immigrants. In her apartment building, Bayan has friends whose families are from Israel and China.", "When her father picked her up, she could not take off her hijab fast enough. During lunch at home, as she chatted in English, he interjected: \u201cArabic!\u201d She continued in a mix of both.", "When she talked about the stick exercise, her father gave a look of recognition. \u201cI was Bayan\u2019s age when they told me the same story,\u201d he said.", "Their childhoods seemed so disconnected from one another\u2019s. The family left Syria when Bayan was 7 or 8 \u2014 they had foundered in Jordan before coming to Canada \u2014 and her memories of the home where her family had lived for three generations were dimming.", "She could picture playing hide-and-seek with her cousins by the fountain and grapevines in the courtyard, and recall the way an adjacent garden produced enough mint for the whole neighborhood.

When Jeremy Scott literally put a smoking \u2014 O.K., not a gun, but a dress \u2014 on his Moschino runway, it proved to be the metaphor for the whole darn year. In the end, much of what we thought we knew was in question, and all we actually knew was to expect the unexpected. It came in many different shapes, and styles.", "1. Fashion shows had an identity crisis.", "After years of complaining that the twice-yearly, four-city, ready-to-wear circus made no sense, for brands or critics or consumers, some designers decided to do something about it. Burberry, Tom Ford, Thakoon and Tommy Hilfiger declared that the problem was the time lag between shows and sales (usually about six months, after which everyone is bored with the old clothes and has moved on), so they switched to a see now/sell now system. Brands in Italy and France just said no to that idea, but not before putting forth a different one: Bottega Veneta, like Gucci and Burberry, said separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s narratives made no sense, and announced that they would combine both sexes in one show.", "Meanwhile, in order to drum up more excitement on Instagram \u2014 the kind that could be parlayed into sales \u2014 Mr. Hilfiger also built an entire carnival on a pier for his collection, a show-as-show approach also adopted by Kanye West, who carted his audience to Roosevelt Island, the better to see an outdoor performance piece by Vanessa Beecroft that seemed to involve models standing like statues and then drooping in the sun. Or maybe the fainting bit wasn\u2019t part of the plan? No one knew quite what was going on, which pretty much summed up the whole experiment.", "2. Designer turnover went into hyperdrive.", "Headhunters must have had a banner year in 2016. If once upon a time the top job at a big brand was the ultimate prize for many designers \u2014 and once you got it, you didn\u2019t let go till they pried the sketch pad from your withered hands \u2014 now the average term seems to be three years or less.", "It began with rumors that the trendsetter Hedi Slimane was going to leave Saint Laurent after one three-year term, which he duly did, just as Brendan Mullane and Stefano Pilati left their posts at Brioni and Ermenegildo Zegna after stints of just over three years. Peter Copping was out at Oscar de la Renta in July, after less than two years; ditto Peter Dundas at Roberto Cavalli and Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow at DKNY.

Among the ranks of fashion\u2019s unemployed are Alber Elbaz (formerly of Lanvin); Mr. Slimane (though the fact that he sued the YSL parent company Kering, demanding it reinstate his noncompete clause, may have made him a less attractive prospect); Marco Zanini (late of Schiaparelli and Rochas); Stefano Pilati (Yves Saint Laurent and Zegna); Mr. Copping; and Mr. Dundas.", "Someone, hire these guys. Or even better, back them in creating their own brand.", "4. The fashion outsider became the ultimate insider.", "When he burst into the public eye, slapping DHL and Champion logos on T-shirts and sweatshirts (and pricing them at astronomic levels), twisting and torquing proportions and otherwise challenging the definition of \u201cgood taste,\u201d Demna Gvasalia, a.k.a. the co-founder of the design collective known as Vetements, was called a fashion \u201crevolutionary,\u201d \u201csubversive\u201d and other terms of that nature. Little surprise that the industry, which has always had a sort of masochistic bent, fell in love.", "Before you could say \u201cMartin Margiela-inspired,\u201d Mr. Gvasalia was named creative director of Balenciaga, where he made his debut last March. Then the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de la Couture, French fashion\u2019s governing body, announced that Vetements would be on the couture schedule, the most exclusive week in fashion. By November, Mr. Gvasalia was onstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London clutching two Fashion Awards: one for \u201cinternational urban luxury brand,\u201d the other as \u201cinternational ready-to-wear designer.\u201d", "Which raises the question: How do you challenge the establishment when you are the establishment?", "5. The hot new name in fashion was \u2026 Canada?", "In a year of electoral disappointments for fashion, as the industry aligned itself with losing candidates from Hillary Clinton to Matteo Renzi, there was one unexpected bright spot: Canada. The new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, seemed to symbolize modernity and cool, and the fashion world fell under their thrall. When they made their triumphant state visit to Washington, Mrs. Trudeau used the moment to showcase Canadian fashion, thus proving there was such a thing as Canadian fashion. New York, London, Milan, Paris \u2026 Toronto? It\u2019s possible.", "6. The 1980s returned. So did oversize everything.", "Short sheaths. Asymmetry. Giant sleeves. Oversize jackets and trousers. Toto, I have a feeling we\u2019re not in 2016 any more. Maybe it was Donald J. Trump and his constant evocation of the Reagan years, what with his red ties and big, boxy suits; maybe it was the usual turning of the fashion wheel, after \u201960s and \u201970s revivals. Whatever the reason, on runways from YSL to C\u00e9line, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga and Rodarte, the 1980s were back, shoulders and all. Stranger things have happened. Wait! Stranger things did happen \u2014 complete with big hair, stonewashed jeans and Winona Ryder.", "7. Rihanna took Paris (Fashion Week).", "The deaths of David Bowie and Prince, in January and April respectively, reverberated around the world, but they also put fashion in an especially thoughtful frame of mind, as the industry considered what they owed the two performers, who transformed the way designers and consumers thought about gender distinctions, sex and a need for constant reinvention. And though fashion has had an ambivalent relationship with rock stars who try to design instead of inspire from afar (see: Kanye West, Jennifer Lopez, Gwen Stefani), Rihanna proved to be an exception, vaulting from icon to power player by taking her second Fenty Puma show to Paris, the better to frame her \u201cwhat Marie Antoinette would wear if she went to the gym\u201d collection.", "Turns out we all want to be queen of the stationary bike. But she wears the crown.", "8. The end of plus sizes.", "Careful who you call \u201cplus size.\u201d The model Ashley Graham, erstwhile poster girl for the larger sector, entered the mainstream on the covers of Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimsuit issue and British Vogue, where, according to the Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, some designers refused to dress her, as it would have entailed making clothes tailored to her proportions. Ms. Shulman used her Editor\u2019s Letter to call them out (though she didn\u2019t name-and-shame).", "Similarly, Amy Schumer took to Instagram to scold Glamour for putting her on the cover of its \u201cChic at Any Size\u201d special issue, rejecting the idea that she was anything other than normal; and Leslie Jones posted on Twitter about her problems getting designers to help her with her red carpet looks for the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d premiere. Christian Siriano came to her aid, and Michelle Obama came to his, catapulting his profile up to another level. Getting on the right side of history, IMG Models then christened its male bigger-bodied division \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Brawn.", "9. Department stores struggled while specialty boutiques began to expand.", "When Macy\u2019s announced it was closing 40 stores at the beginning of the year, many \u201cThe End of the Department Store\u201d articles ensued, which were reinforced when Neiman Marcus announced job cuts later in the year after falling profits and rumors of its sale (they have since died down). Reports of retail\u2019s death are probably exaggerated, but what is certain is that their pain may be the specialty store\u2019s gain.", "Ikram, in Chicago, threw itself a star-studded 15th birthday party (Mayor Rahm Emanuel showed up, as did George Lucas). In Dallas, Forty Five Ten opened a 37,000-square-foot emporium, and Milan\u2019s destination store, 10 Corso Como, plans to open an outpost in New York. What do these stores have in common? They reflect an individual point of view. They don\u2019t try to please all of the people all of the time. Perversely, it\u2019s the new recipe for success.", "10. Melania Trump became a lightning rod.", "It is a truth universally acknowledged that all designers desperately want to dress first ladies, because of the resulting global exposure. Or at least it was. Mr. Trump\u2019s election as president, however, sent shock waves through the fashion industry, which had thrown its support behind the other candidate, and in a truly unprecedented move, designers began saying publicly that they would not dress Mrs. Trump.", "First up was Sophie Theallet, who posted a public letter explaining her position; she was cheered on by Humberto Leon, of Opening Ceremony. Then Marc Jacobs said he, too, might refrain, as did Tom Ford. Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera took the opposite tack. Fashion, like the nation, is divided; we\u2019ll see how things turn out come the new year and the new administration. But even this sure thing is not so sure any more.", "1. Bomber jackets became the fashion hula hoop.", "Can you call a development underway for years the biggest style trend of 2016? You probably can if it is a bomber jacket. Building on the success of the \u201csouvenir\u201d jackets that designers \u2014 Alessandro Michele at Gucci, Kim Jones at Louis Vuitton \u2014 put forth in recent seasons, the bomber was not only a ubiquitous men\u2019s wear default in 2016, but also one of those magical Google trends.", "A 500 percent year-on-year increase in Google searches involving the term \u201cbomber jacket\u201d was probably goosed along by celebrities like David Beckham and Pharrell Williams, who wore them almost to the exclusion of any other form of outerwear. And men had plenty to choose from. Designers and labels, from G-Star and Adidas to Gucci, Visvim, Vuitton and Rick Owens, all produced versions of a waist-length jacket originally created by Air Force technicians to keep fighter pilots comfortable in frigid, cramped cockpits.", "No less practical for the earthbound, the bomber turned out to be the biggest selling silhouette last year for designers like Todd Snyder, one of the earliest adopters of the trend.", "\u201cMen\u2019s wear is always about that third piece,\u201d Mr. Snyder, an American, said. \u201cYou have the jacket and the trousers, and the bomber is the third piece you can layer on and wear with anything.\u201d", "2. Diversity on men\u2019s wear runways and in editorial castings put the women\u2019s wear sector to shame.", "If men\u2019s wear has traditionally been a backwater of fashion, following more than leading trends in thought and design, there is one way in which that is clearly no longer the case: diversity. Despite decades of cultural breast-beating, panel discussions and industry initiatives, tokenism in women\u2019s fashion remains. It is the uncommon women\u2019s wear runway whose racial composition bears much resemblance to that on the streets outside the shows.", "Yet, quietly and steadily (and motivated, it must be said, in large part by the buying power of previously neglected groups), men\u2019s wear has opened up to a wider view of what constitutes the consumer base and, for that matter, humanity.", "For this the credit goes largely to a small number of designers, agents and casting directors determined to expand opportunity while also mirroring what the writer Grace Paley once termed the \u201cgorgeous chromatic dispersion\u201d of our city and world. (The effort was most successful during New York Fashion Week: Men\u2019s.) A decade ago models like Hussein Abdulrahman, Adonis Bosso, Fernando Cabral, Abiah Hostvedt, Sang Woo Kim, or Michael Shockley may have been rare runway sightings. Now they are big-earning members of a gifted pack.", "3. Gosha Rubchinskiy used social media to hack the fashion system.", "There is much to marvel about in Gosha Rubchinskiy, the Russian designer and photographer (and former hairdresser) whose cultlike ascendance can be attributed to his blocky Constructivist graphics, to the shrewdness of his styling inspired by Moscow skate rats and street boys, and to the substantial support and marketing savvy of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, which distributes his brand.", "Yet Mr. Rubchinskiy\u2019s slickest accomplishment may be how stealthily he exploits social media to win over an army of boys to his fashion cause. Consider the casting for his June show at the Pitti Uomo men\u2019s wear trade fair in Florence, Italy. So overwhelming was early response to an Instagram call for model applicants that it crashed an assistant\u2019s email account.", "It says a lot about the vaunted democratization of fashion that, by the time Mr. Rubchinskiy staged a show of clothes suitable for a Soviet-era starveling and held it in a defunct Fascist-era cigarette factory, he had recruited underage kids from all points of the globe: rabbit-pale teenagers right out of a Dennis Cooper novel and hailing from, among other places, Copenhagen; Moscow; Yorkshire, England; and Santa Ana, Calif.", "4. Arnold Palmer\u2019s death proved that old school did it best.", "Though one may think there is little left to add to the universal encomiums that came after the death in September of the telegenic sportsman known as the King of Golf, the obituaries tended to omit an important point. With his taut, muscular frame, his narrow waist, sturdy forearms and easy athletic grace, Palmer, who died at 87, was in certain ways as notable for nonchalant assurance of his personal style as for his game.", "\u201cObviously, he had the blessing of an insanely athletic body,\u201d John Jannuzzi, the United States deputy lead for Twitter Moments (who, as a digital editor at GQ once advised readers on six style moves to steal from Palmer), said of the golfer. \u201cBut his clothes were in constant harmony, perfectly well fit and classic, polished, nothing ever too loud or crazy.\u201d", "Of equal importance is that, in the innocent days of Palmer\u2019s early successes, athletes hadn\u2019t yet become corporate sandwich boards. Palmer was instrumental in changing that, but never mind. \u201cHe was not second-guessing what he was wearing,\u201d Mr. Jannuzzi said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what a lot of guys are still after, knowing what works for them and owning their own style.\u201d", "5. Demna Gvsalia manned up.", "It remains to be seen whether any but the most fashion obsessed (or John Waters \u2014 possibly the same thing) would be caught dead in one of the suits Demna Gvsalia offered in his Balenciaga debut, a first-ever men\u2019s wear show for that storied house. With proportions alternating between Frankenstein (or David Byrne in Talking Heads) shapes and frock coats tight as tourniquets, the clothes risked being outright ludicrous.", "Unquestionably they flouted comfort or ease. Yet, in rethinking the suit\u2019s silhouette, Mr. Gvsalia was also experimenting with the architecture of gender at a time when it is increasingly seen as something the psychoanalytic theorist Adrienne Harris terms a \u201csoft assembly.\u201d There was nothing soft about Mr. Gvsalia\u2019s constructions. At Balenciaga, he took masculinity and gave it some spine.", "6. Rick Owens had a vision.", "Hasn\u2019t the time come for a full-scale Rick Owens museum retrospective? Aren\u2019t we overdue for a curatorial assessment of the clothes, furniture, store design, architecture, photographic imagery and soft-sculptural men\u2019s wear conjured by this driven, intuitive, musclebound and aesthetically off-kilter Californian? Imagine a series of museum galleries inspired by the Brutalist hulk in Paris that Mr. Owens calls home (and where his wife, Michele Lamy, keeps bees on the rooftop), filled with the slumping, folded and armoring garments Mr. Owens showed in a dystopian show titled \u201cMastodon.\u201d", "Add his $200,000 ton-weight marble bed, stag stools and alchemy chairs. Throw in the wax likenesses Mr. Owens commissioned from the experts at Madame Tussauds in 2006 for Pitti Uomo and that depicted the designer naked and urinating on the floor. Put up some text panels with Owens maxims like this one, from a 2011 Rizzoli monograph: \u201cI would lay a black glittering turd on the white landscape of conformity.\u201d In truth he already has.", "7. Patches stuck around.", "For a moment, the trend for patches \u2014 like so many other elements of modern dress, they originated in military uniforms \u2014 seemed to have peaked in 2016 and was headed for the style boneyard, there to rest alongside flat-forms and microbags. But then Donatella Versace came along with a fine fall men\u2019s wear collection that included, among the ice-blue winter woolens and space-themed suits, a jumpsuit that looked to have patch acne. Right then you knew embroidered madness was here to stay.", "8. Bill Cunningham\u2019s corner became a frozen zone.", "On June 25, Mr. Cunningham, the beloved street photographer, died. Very soon thereafter, New York City announced it would rename one of his favorite perches Bill Cunningham Corner. It was there on a curb at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street near the Louis Vuitton flagship that he installed himself regularly for decades and \u201cturned our sidewalks into runways and New Yorkers into models,\u201d as Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement in July.", "Just over four months later, Mr. Trump was elected president, and the stretch of Fifth Avenue near his Trump Tower residence became a heavily guarded and barricaded security zone. All four points of the intersection bristle with fencing and Jersey barriers. Secret Service details and New York City police officers keep pedestrians moving along. It is one of countless postelection ironies that, were Mr. Cunningham still with us, he would not be welcome on Bill Cunningham Corner anymore."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/business/dealbook/elizabeth-warren-whitney-tilson.html": ["Senator Elizabeth Warren, furious about President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s appointments of finance industry insiders, took to Facebook a little over a week ago to fire off a message to her nearly 2.5 million followers.", "She took aim at an individual she described as a \u201chedge fund billionaire\u201d who is \u201cthrilled by Donald Trump\u2019s economic team of Wall Street insiders.\u201d", "The hedge fund manager she condemned was Whitney Tilson, who runs Kase Capital. Ms. Warren \u2014 the fiery Massachusetts Democrat who is known for her stern mistrust of Wall Street \u2014 called him out by saying, \u201cTilson knows that, despite all the stunts and rhetoric, Donald Trump isn\u2019t going to change the economic system.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThe next four years are going to be a bonanza for the Whitney Tilsons of the world.\u201d", "There\u2019s one rather glaring problem with Ms. Warren\u2019s attack: Mr. Tilson happens to be one of the few financial executives who publicly fought Mr. Trump\u2019s election and supported Hillary Clinton. A lifelong Democrat who was involved in helping to start Teach for America, Mr. Tilson also happened to be one of the rare Wall Street executives who had donated to Ms. Warren and actively sought new regulations for the industry. Recently, he gave Mrs. Clinton $1,000 so he could see Ms. Warren speak at a campaign fund-raiser. (He\u2019s also far, far from a billionaire.)", "\u201cI\u2019ve donated money to her, attended her events, and did everything in my power to stop Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Tilson told me, talking about Ms. Warren and expressing dismay that he somehow became the target of her derision. \u201cIn addition, I agree with her 100 percent that large swaths of the financial industry have run amok and prey on vulnerable Americans, and thus strong regulation, including a muscular Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is sorely needed,\u201d he said.", "Ms. Warren appears to be suffering from the same affliction that Mr. Trump\u2019s critics accuse of him: a knee-jerk, fact-free reaction to something she had read in the news.", "In this case, Ms. Warren seems to have come across a Bloomberg News article that includes some quotations from Mr. Tilson. But she didn\u2019t read to the bottom or dismissed it before firing off her zingers.", "In the article, Mr. Tilson had said, \u201cI think Donald Trump conned them,\u201d in reference to voters. \u201cI worried that he was going to do crazy things that would blow the system up. So the fact that he\u2019s appointing people from within the system is a good thing.\u201d (He even said he took \u201cglee\u201d in voters\u2019 anger over that.)", "The part Ms. Warren may have missed toward the bottom was this: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Dodd-Frank, I think banking should be boring,\u201d he was quoted as saying, where he was also identified as a Clinton supporter. \u201cI worry about Wall Street returning to being a casino.\u201d", "In fairness, depending on how you look at the situation, it is possible some readers and supporters of Ms. Warren will give her kudos for criticizing one of her own well-heeled donors. \u201cShe can\u2019t be bought,\u201d might be a generous way to consider the situation. But even a quick Google search of Mr. Tilson\u2019s involvement in the recent political discourse over financial reform would reveal what he clearly meant by his quotation: that he was nervous about Mr. Trump appointing reckless and uninformed people to guide financial policy and that he was heartened that he had not.", "As Ms. Warren has made clear, she abhors the idea of anyone who has worked in the financial industry working in government on policy that could affect the economy and Wall Street. This column has covered what I\u2019ve described as her misguided view.", "That\u2019s not to say any administration wouldn\u2019t benefit from bringing in some outsiders who could offer new and different perspectives, but that can\u2019t be a qualifying measure.

The remainder of the award money will be split among the other 1,012 scientists on the team.", "In a return to the way it originally was, the regular Breakthrough prize this year is going to a trio of theorists who have made serious advances in string theory, the alleged but still unproven theory of everything, and what it might mean for black holes and the universe. They are Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa from Harvard, and Joseph Polchinski of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.", "According to string theory, all the forces and particles of nature are composed of tiny little wriggling strings. In 1995, Dr. Polchinski showed that the theory also contains objects of two dimensions or more, called \u201cbranes,\u201d short for membranes. This led to a whole new branch of cosmology, in which branes could be island universes floating in an extra-dimensional space like leaves in a fish tank, colliding and otherwise interacting with each other through a higher dimension.", "In a celebrated calculation in 1996, Dr. Strominger and Dr. Vafa used string theory to compute the information content, or entropy, of a black hole. Their result verified a prediction made by Stephen Hawking using more approximate methods that black holes would leak radiation and eventually explode.", "In a career spanning four decades, Jean Bourgain, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., has published, on average, 10 papers a year, tackling some of the hardest problems in a range of mathematical fields.", "Some recent work includes a \u201cdecoupling theorem\u201d \u2014 a sort of very abstract generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applied to oscillating waves like light or radio waves. While Pythagoras merely showed how the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle are related to the longer hypotenuse, the decoupling theorem proven by Dr. Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter of Indiana University shows similar relationships in the superposition of waves.", "Stephen J. Elledge, 60, is a professor of genetics and medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher. He received the breakthrough prize for research explaining how \u201ccells sense and respond to damage in their DNA and providing insights into the development and treatment of cancer.\u201d", "Dr. Elledge has described DNA as being constantly under attack but having the ability \u2014 he calls it a sort of chemical intelligence \u2014 to monitor its own integrity and activate various defense mechanisms.", "His research interests range far and wide. In 2015, he and his team reported that they had developed a test that, using less than a drop of blood, could reveal nearly every virus a person had ever been exposed to. Other scientists saw vast potential in the test, suggesting it could be used to track patterns of disease across populations and to learn more about how viruses, and the body\u2019s immune response to them, contribute to chronic diseases and cancer.", "Last year, Dr. Elledge won another major prize: the Lasker Award, which is often described as the American Nobel.", "Harry F. Noller helped unravel the structure of ribosomes and identify the importance of RNA to their mechanics. Ribosomes are like factories that assemble proteins within a cell. They look like a tangled mess of rubber bands and coiled wires. But by decoding their twists and folds, scientists can better understand how the genetic code gets translated.", "Dr. Noller is a biochemist and director of the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He and his colleagues used X-ray crystallography to obtain the first image of the ribosome\u2019s molecular structure. His work also helped show that ribosomes are ribozymes, a type of RNA molecule that can facilitate chemical reactions. In this case, the ribozymes stitch amino acids together to build proteins.", "Roeland Nusse, professor of developmental biology at Stanford University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, helped discover the first Wnt gene in 1982. The gene is part of the larger Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in the development of embryos, stem cells, bone growth and the progression of cancer. It is also critical for cell-to-cell communication in adults and developing embryos.", "The Wnt signaling pathway is found in every branch of the animal kingdom. It is involved in things as diverse as setting off breast cancer in mice and helping orchestrate the body plan of fruit flies. It has become an important part in many aspects of biology because the molecular cascade it sets off affects the growth of the entire ecosystem of the body.", "Dr. Huda Zoghbi, a professor of neurology at Baylor College of Medicine, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and director of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, discovered that a mutation to a gene known as SCA1 causes Spinocerebellar ataxia, a neurodegenerative disorder. It can rob people of their control over their hands, legs and speech. An estimated 150,000 people in the United States currently suffer from the disease. There is no known cure and it ultimately is fatal.", "But insight into its inner workings may provide a way to combat its progression. Dr. Zoghbi\u2019s findings have helped provide the groundwork to fighting the disease.", "Dr. Zoghbi also helped uncover the culprit behind another neurodegenerative disease, Rett syndrome. This crippling condition mostly affects young girls and is often fatal. There are fewer than 1,000 cases a year in the United States. Her team searched for the cause behind the malady for 16 years, eventually identifying it as a mutation in the gene MECP2. By identifying the gene, she also found that it plays a part in other neurological disorders, providing a starting point to fighting the diseases.", "Yoshinori Ohsumi, a cell biologist and honorary professor from the Institute of Innovative Research at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan, helped pioneer our understanding of how cells recycle themselves \u2014 known as autophagy \u2014 through his research with yeast in the 1990s.", "Organelles, proteins and other molecules inside the cell are constantly becoming damaged or worn out, especially as the cell divides. If too much rubbish builds up, it can become toxic and kill the cell. Autophagy is also a tool that the cell uses to refuel itself if it is starving.", "During autophagy, the cell produces internal garbage bags called autophagosomes that capture waste. The autophagosomes are sealed by a double membrane that keeps in the junk. They then fuse with organelles called lysosomes, which carry enzymes that help dissolve whatever is inside.", "Researchers think that failures in autophagy could contribute to Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also think it could help us better understand the process of aging.", "This year, Dr. Ohsumi won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for illuminating the importance of cell cannibalism.", "In addition to the big $3 million prizes, there were six $100,000 New Horizons prizes \u2013 half in physics and half in mathematics.

O.K., on with the news!", "This week was a bit slow after the holiday break, so I want to highlight one thing that happened before Thanksgiving. I wrote a story about how Facebook has developed a kind of censorship tool for news feed content, something that could potentially help the network get back into China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy behind the United States.", "We don\u2019t know if that tool will ever get out the door \u2014 especially now that it\u2019s been thrust into the spotlight \u2014 but it\u2019s fascinating that Facebook is even considering it a possibility. That\u2019s a far cry from where Google stood with China just a few years ago.", "Farhad: I spent some time thinking about your story over the holiday. (Yeah, I\u2019m a lot of fun.) Lots of critics of Facebook connected Facebook\u2019s apparent willingness to censor content in China with the other big Facebook story in recent weeks \u2014 the hand-wringing over whether it did enough to police fake news (most of which was pro-Trump) on the site in the run-up to the presidential election. The hot take was, \u201cOh look, Facebook can delete stuff when China asks, but it won\u2019t take action when American elections are at stake.\u201d", "That seemed odd to me. If you worry about Facebook and its potential Chinese partners deciding which stories people in China can see and which they can\u2019t, shouldn\u2019t you also worry about their taking a greater role in deciding which news is true and false in America?", "Mike: Short answer: Yes, totally. We can\u2019t have it both ways. But please continue.", "Farhad: Since the election, I\u2019ve become more skeptical that there are many good ways for Facebook to respond to the problem of fake news (and I\u2019m not even sure it was a big problem; the numbers on this have been dodgy, in part because Facebook hasn\u2019t released many). I found myself agreeing with much of what Jessica Lessin, founder of the tech news site The Information, wrote in the Times\u2019 Op-Ed section this week. Yes, Lessin has some connections to Mark Zuckerberg, but I think she raises a substantive point: Facebook already has a lot of power over the news business. Why are we clamoring for it to exercise even more power?", "Mike: It\u2019s a good point, but I do think there\u2019s room to compromise. Clearly, false information seems like an easy thing to ax outright, which I imagine Facebook will try to do in the near future. It\u2019ll probably stay away from the gray-area stuff.", "In lighter news, CNN announced that it bought Beme, the social media start-up founded by Casey Neistat, a YouTube superstar. Beme, an app that basically let you snap raw video of yourself in the world and share it with friends, was not a breakout success, in part because it had to fight against tough competitors like Snapchat. But CNN\u2019s hope is that Casey and his team can figure out how to use the idea of \u201cauthentic sharing\u201d to capture new millennial audiences who have never been addicted to cable news.", "I\u2019m a millennial, and I can\u2019t really imagine what the news consumption of the future will look like, outside of say, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. What say you, Mr. Gen Y?", "Farhad: I think CNN is smart to hire talented media makers of the future. But I think Snap\u2019s Spectacles \u2014 sunglasses that can record video clips \u2014 are the wave of tomorrow. I tried them out and I couldn\u2019t stop raving about them.

Now, in a time where we may have to face an openly hostile administration in the course of doing our jobs, journalists are equipping themselves with the tools they need to keep themselves safe, which I think is a great thing.", "Let me hear your take on this, fellow lowlife.", "Farhad: Yeah, it\u2019s great that journalists, activists and others who may be targeted by an overpowerful executive branch are looking to do more to protect their communications. This could be a long-term legacy of President Trump \u2014 he could be the guy who finally gets everyone in Washington to use secure channels, as opposed to, say, not bothering to turn on two-factor authentication for their Gmail accounts.", "But for the historical record, it\u2019s worth noting that it\u2019s not just Trump who\u2019s been at war with journalism. So has President Obama. The Obama administration has mounted a more aggressive fight against leakers than any recent president. Obama has also failed to disclose much information under Freedom of Information Act requests.

and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles.", "\u2605 \u2018ALLIED\u2019 (R, 2:04) The latest film from Robert Zemeckis (\u201cBack to the Future,\u201d \u201cCast Away\u201d) is an elegant, old-school romantic thriller set in London and Casablanca during World War II, with an unusually stiff Brad Pitt and a characteristically magnetic Marion Cotillard as spies in love. Not a great work of film art, but a superior and satisfying example of cinematic craft. (A. O. Scott)", "\u2018ALMOST CHRISTMAS\u2019 (PG-13, 1:52) A flimsy story line doesn\u2019t much matter to this warmhearted and often spectacularly funny holiday comedy-drama. Mo\u2019nique and Danny Glover lead an appealing and energetic cast. (Glenn Kenny)", "\u2605 \u2018AQUARIUS\u2019 (No rating, 2:22, in Portuguese) Sonia Braga plays Clara, a retired Brazilian music critic facing eviction from the apartment where she has lived for decades. The director, Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho (himself a former critic), turns her plight into a humane, sexy meditation on art, aging and life and also a biting critique of the corruption and materialism that threaten Brazil\u2019s cultural identity. (Scott)", "\u2605 \u2018ARRIVAL\u2019 (PG-13, 1:56) Amy Adams plays a linguist who tries to communicate with aliens who have landed on Earth. Beautifully directed by Denis Villeneuve, the movie is more hopeful than many in this genre \u2014 here, the best solutions don\u2019t materialize in a gun sight. (Manohla Dargis)", "\u2018BAD SANTA 2\u2019 (R, 1:32) Even the profanity has lost its zing in this cut-rate retread, which mostly prompts admiration for how far the original ran with one joke. (Ben Kenigsberg)", "\u2605 \u2018THE BEATLES: EIGHT DAYS A WEEK\u2019 (No rating, 1:39) Sure, you\u2019ve seen endless clips of the Beatles in the early years, the Fab Four being cheeky, the fans screaming their lungs out. But this documentary by Ron Howard will make you smile at Beatlemania all over again, despite being a bit hagiographic. The focus is on those wild, wonderful years when the band was playing live concerts and riding the fame monster with aplomb. That the group not only survived the hysteria but also went on to make even better music in its studio period is worth savoring all over again. (Neil Genzlinger)", "\u2605 \u2018BEST WORST THING THAT EVER COULD HAVE HAPPENED\u2019 (No rating, 1:35) Because the 1981 Broadway show \u201cMerrily We Roll Along\u201d was a musical about the ravages of time on friendship and youthful ideals, the documentary tells parallel stories, one fictional, the other real, of disappointment and disillusion that give the film a double shot of poignancy. The original cast members, from a show that closed after only 16 performances, recovered their equilibrium, put on a brave face and went on with their lives. (Stephen Holden)", "\u2018BILLY LYNN\u2019S LONG HALFTIME WALK\u2019 (R, 1:52) Ang Lee\u2019s adaptation of the novel by Ben Fountain is an earnest, thoughtful exploration of the twin theaters of the Iraq war and American commercial pop culture. It lacks the book\u2019s satirical crackle, but a handful of sharp performances break through the stagings, notably Kristen Stewart\u2019s (as the title character\u2019s sister) and Garrett Hedlund\u2019s (as one of his commanding officers). (Scott)", "\u2018THE BIRTH OF A NATION\u2019 (R, 2:00) The director Nate Parker\u2019s film about Nat Turner, who led a bloody slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831, is an ambitious attempt to bring history to the screen. Mr. Parker, who also stars, relies a little too heavily on genre conventions and Hollywood revenge clich\u00e9s, muddying the film\u2019s political impact. But the movie also has a blunt emotional force, and glimmers of insight into the awful realities of 19th-century American slavery. (Scott)", "\u2605 \u2018BLEED FOR THIS\u2019 (R, 1:56) It is not an overstatement to call the comeback story of the Rhode Island boxer Vinnie Pazienza \u2014 the \u201cPazmanian Devil\u201d \u2014 incredible. This movie, directed by Ben Younger and starring Miles Teller, does that story justice. (Kenny)", "\u2018BOBBY SANDS: 66 DAYS\u2019 (No rating, 1:45) The film is a sober, evenhanded recapitulation of Sands\u2019s imprisonment and death in a hunger strike that places his sacrifice in a historical context. Although much of the film consists of excerpts from Sands\u2019s prison diary, read by Martin McCann, it is not an intimate journal. (Holden)", "\u2018CERTAIN WOMEN\u2019 (R, 1:47) Three stories by Maile Meloy, gracefully adapted by Kelly Reichardt, who respects the reticence of the characters and the emptiness of the Western landscape. Laura Dern plays a lawyer dealing with a difficult client. Michelle Williams is a woman dealing with a difficult family. And in the film\u2019s most perfect and haunting vignette, Kristen Stewart is a night-school teacher who becomes the focus of an intense student crush. (Scott)", "\u2605 \u2018DEAR ZINDAGI\u2019 (No rating, 2:35, in Hindi) This second feature from Gauri Shinde (\u201cEnglish Vinglish,\u201d from 2012) is a sharply observed drama about a cinematographer (the rising Bollywood star Alia Bhatt) whose strained romantic relationships drive her to seek the counsel of a laid-back psychologist (the Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, exuding a winning ease). This is a movie that drop quotations from the likes of Faulkner and Einstein in their sessions and elsewhere, but rarely feels platitudinous. And, refreshingly, it is the Bhatt character\u2019s filmmaking, not her marriage prospects, that prove her salvation. Her ultimate project, like Ms. Shinde\u2019s insightful movie, is a resounding victory. (Andy Webster)", "\u2605 \u2018DOCTOR STRANGE\u2019 (PG-13, 1:55) Benedict Cumberbatch has a lot of fun as the title character in Marvel\u2019s latest, which is so visually transfixing and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand. Scott Derrickson directed. (Dargis)", "\u2018THE EAGLE HUNTRESS\u2019 (G, 1:27) A lovely, inspiring documentary about a 13-year-old girl in Kazakhstan who defies tradition and captures and trains a golden eagle. (Scott)", "\u2605 \u2018THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN\u2019 (R, 1:44) To call \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen\u201d one of the best films about high-school kids in 25 years isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s a masterpiece. Even in its raw honesty, it barely begins to approach Marielle Heller\u2019s far tougher, more realistic \u201cThe Diary of a Teenage Girl\u201d (2015), whose sexually curious 15-year-old title character entices her mother\u2019s boyfriend into a clandestine affair. (Holden)", "\u2605 \u2018ELLE\u2019 (R, 2:10) Paul Verhoeven\u2019s captivating, vexing scramble of genre codes and emotional signals is above all a platform for the staggering talent of Isabelle Huppert, whose character survives a brutal sexual assault and refuses to react in any of the expected ways. (Scott)", "\u2018FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM\u2019 (PG-13, 2:13) Directed by David Yates, this splashy footnote to J. K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter screen series shifts the action to 1926 New York, where dark forces cut swaths of destruction alongside Model T\u2019s. It\u2019s fun, if forgettable (and I miss the kids). (Dargis)", "\u2605 \u2018GIMME DANGER\u2019 (R, 1:48) The spine of this documentary is an in-depth interview with Iggy Pop, 69, who tells his story in a deep, almost feral growl. Occasionally, his face lights up with a demonic grin, and you glimpse the soul of a proudly unrepentant wild man who, even more than Frank Sinatra, did it his way, and lived to tell the tale.

(Kenigsberg)", "\u2018MISS SLOANE\u2019 (R, 2:12) Jessica Chastain plays a hard-boiled lobbyist in a political thriller that is more a character study than a coherent drama.

It is a great deal more than that, but it is also exactly that. Directed by Barry Jenkins and based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney, the movie treats its characters with an empathy that feels radical, and renders their lives with an aesthetic care that is exquisite and exciting. (Scott)", "\u2018NOCTURNAL ANIMALS\u2019 (R, 1:57) Amy Adams stars in this harsh cautionary tale about love, vengeance and the divide between life and art.

(Dargis)", "\u2605 \u2018QUEEN OF KATWE\u2019 (PG, 2:04) An irresistible underdog sport movie, based on the true story of Phiona Mutesi (Madina Nalwanga, in her first film role), a chess prodigy from a poor section of Kampala, Uganda. The director, Mira Nair, infuses a familiar genre with a vibrant and complex sense of place. Lupita Nyong\u2019o (as Phiona\u2019s mother) and David Oyelowo (as her coach) are excellent, as ever.

Next year, it said, all of that energy will come from wind farms and solar panels.", "The online giant said on Tuesday that all of its data centers around the world will be entirely powered with renewable energy sources sometime next year.", "This is not to say that Google computers will consume nothing but wind and solar power. Like almost any company, Google gets power from a power company, which operates an energy grid typically supplied by a number of sources, including hydroelectric dams, natural gas, coal and wind power.", "What Google has done over the last decade, with relatively little fanfare, is participate in a number of large-scale deals with renewable producers, typically guaranteeing to buy the energy they produce with their wind turbines and solar cells. With those guarantees, wind companies can obtain bank financing to build more turbines.", "The power created by the renewables is plugged into the utility grid, so that Google\u2019s usage presents no net consumption of fossil fuels and the pool of electricity gets a relatively larger share of renewable sources.", "\u201cWe are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world,\u201d said Joe Kava, Google\u2019s senior vice president of technical infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the economy, good for business and good for our shareholders.\u201d", "Unlike carbon-based power, Mr. Kava said, wind supply prices do not fluctuate, enabling Google to plan better. In addition, the more renewable energy it buys, the cheaper those sources get. In some places, like Chile, Google said, renewables have at times become cheaper than fossil fuels.", "Whether Google is the largest buyer of renewables would be difficult to verify, as many industries do not release data on how much energy they consume. There is no doubt, however, that Google\u2019s large computer complexes, along with similar global operations by Amazon and Microsoft, are among the world\u2019s fastest-growing new consumers of electricity.", "Google hopes that success in working with large wind farms, like the 50,000-acre facility in Minco, Okla., which supplies Google\u2019s large data center in Pryor, Okla., will spur development of the industry. NextEra Energy, which owns the wind farm, has about 115 wind farms in the United States and Canada.", "About 25 percent of United States electricity goes to businesses, and companies like Google are now about 2 percentage points of that. Dominion Virginia Power, located in a state with perhaps the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centers, last year had a demand increase from those customers of 9 percent, while overall demand was nearly flat, according to Dominion.", "Google operates eight different businesses, including internet search engines, YouTube and Gmail, each of which has over 1 billion customers.

That is enough for two 140,000-person towns. \u201cFor one company to be doing this is a very big deal. It means other companies of a similar scale will feel pressure to move.\u201d", "It moves the needle on costs to have a big consumer, Mr. Koomey added, since a larger market tends to allow for economies of scale and more innovation. \u201cEvery time you double production, you reduce the cost of solar by about 20 percent. Wind goes down 10 to 12 percent,\u201d he said.", "Facebook has entered into similar deals with wind producers. Last week, Amazon reiterated its long-term commitment to power its machines entirely with renewable energy, though for 2016 it expects to be above about 40 percent of its goal. It has announced five more solar projects.", "Microsoft says it has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2014, but much of this comes from the purchase of carbon offsets, which are investments in things like tree planting or renewables projects meant to compensate for the fossil fuels a company consumes. The company hopes to have half of its electric power supplied from wind, solar and hydroelectric sources by 2018. Its data centers currently use about 3.3 million megawatt-hours of power a year.", "Google has long championed uses of alternative energy. In 2007, it patented an idea for a floating data center that would be powered by waves. It was never built. Less fanciful, but so far equally fruitless, have been schemes to source lots of geothermal power, or capture the high-velocity winds of the stratosphere with large kites. It also takes pride in the energy efficiency of its data centers.", "Critics note that while Google might be adding wind and solar to the world\u2019s power grid, overall it is still dependent on fossil fuels, since sun and wind power are intermittent, while demand for things like YouTube cat videos is continual.", "\u201cIn my mind it\u2019s a P.R. gimmick,\u201d said Chris Warren, vice president of communications at the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank in Washington supported largely by donations from individuals and companies in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIf they think they can actually support themselves with wind and solar panels, they should connect them directly to their data centers.\u201d", "Next year\u2019s goal will be 95 percent accomplished with wind turbines around the world, Mr. Kava said, and Google\u2019s support for the industry could keep prices dropping, particularly relative to things like coal. \u201cWe\u2019re technology-agnostic, but we\u2019re not price-agnostic,\u201d he said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/world/canada/canada-today-energy-project-clash-christmas-tree-scorn-and-rules-on-marijuana.html": ["The expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline is not the only energy mega-project attracting protests in British Columbia.

And not only that, he seemed proud of it.", "Bannon\u2019s quotation owes its force to the word \u201cplatform\u201d \u2014 in this usage, a scarce and valuable stage from which to broadcast. The platform\u2019s owner controls access and decides what gets play. To provide a platform is to share power, to convey legitimacy and to amplify voices. A movement\u2019s tactic is to gain access to platforms, and to use them to grow. The statement was reproduced constantly, eventually prompting a vague disavowal by Trump himself. \u201cIt\u2019s not a group I want to energize,\u201d he told The New York Times in November, of the alt-right. \u201cAnd if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.\u201d Later, at a bipartisan election post-mortem panel in December, the Clinton campaign\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, recast the claim as an accusation: \u201cIf providing a platform for white supremacists makes me a brilliant tactician, I am proud to have lost.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the Trump campaign manager, responded incredulously, saying, \u201cDo you think I ran a campaign where white supremacists had a platform?\u201d Palmieri replied without hesitation: \u201cIt did, Kellyanne. It did.\u201d", "If these discussions were about litigating the past, their operating definition of what a platform is and does seemed to be stuck in the past as well. In computing, the word carries a different meaning. A platform is a system that enables other systems: A machine provides a platform for software; the software provides a platform for other software; that software might provide a platform for yet more software; and so on. The iPhone platform lets outside parties build and market apps like Uber; the Uber platform lets outside parties sign up to drive other Uber users for money.", "Two days after the election, on the other side of the country, Mark Zuckerberg was using this definition of platform as a shield. Facebook had been taken to task by the media for the preponderance of unreliable information distributed on the site, which some believed might have influenced the outcome of the election. Zuckerberg dismissed that notion as \u201ca pretty crazy idea.\u201d Facebook thinks of itself, first and foremost, as a platform for human interaction; it purports to be open to everyone and to favor no one. In a Facebook note posted shortly thereafter, he treated the agnostic quality of his social-media platform as self-evident. \u201cOur goal is to give every person a voice,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSometimes when people use their voice, though, they say things that seem wrong, and they support people you disagree with.\u201d", "Somewhere between media and social media \u2014 between familiar ideas about politics and the news and the ones that underpin the world we live in today \u2014 platforms changed from responsibilities into abdications of responsibility. Claiming to provide a platform, in Silicon Valley, doesn\u2019t demand defense. It is the defense. Platforms don\u2019t cause problems; people do.", "The closest thing the new world of platforms has to a foundational text is a business book called \u201cInvisible Engines,\u201d published in 2006, which examined and tried to define a nascent form of business: one that doesn\u2019t just sell a good or service, but instead creates value by spawning entire ecosystems and economies. Nintendo and Sega, for example, allowed game developers to create and sell games that ran on their machines; smartphones let software companies connect with customers through app stores; eBay connects merchants and sellers, creating transactions but selling nothing itself. The book makes the prescient case that platforms will come to redefine our economy.", "\u201cThe platform\u2019s value is not necessarily what it does,\u201d says Andrei Hagiu, a visiting associate professor at M.I.T. and one of the book\u2019s authors, \u201cbut what it enables.\u201d And what it enables can be enormous. It would be difficult to overstate the zeal that exists for platform companies in Silicon Valley. They represent staggering opportunities, the chance to create or remake entire industries and to preside over them indefinitely, with maximum control and minimum participation or liability. Airbnb has created a marketplace that overlaps substantially with the hotel business, but the properties it rents to users are owned by other users. (The company recently filed a federal lawsuit challenging a New York law that could result in fines against Airbnb for illegally listed properties; it agreed to drop the suit on the condition that fines be levied only against people listing property, not the company itself.) Uber created a sort of marketplace for transportation but doesn\u2019t own its vehicles nor \u2014 it claims, over and over, in courts all across the globe \u2014 does it employ its drivers.", "But the platform economies that are most developed and that have captured the most people \u2014 the ones that transact on attention, advertising and communication \u2014 are not immediately recognizable to their users as marketplaces. Facebook is not primarily understood among its billion and a half users as an attention brokerage, but that\u2019s exactly what it is: a middleman between users and other users; between advertisers and users; between developers and users; between publishers and advertisers and their viewers and readers.", "Participants successfully contribute to the broader marketplace by inducing other participants to engage more; beyond shares and followers, success is rewarded off-platform, with the conversion of attention into relationships, into advertising on websites, into sales or into influence and political power. Social platforms are the most extreme and advanced expression of what may be the defining corporate strategy of our time.", "And so it\u2019s valuable to listen to how they talk about themselves. In a comment under his post about the election, Zuckerberg reiterated, with force, what he sees as the nature of Facebook. \u201cI find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\u201d he wrote, explaining that the company also works on aerospace technology and business software. It\u2019s a platform that aspires to \u201cconnect the world\u201d but that must not be credited with changing it in the process.", "This line of thinking could not feel more distant from some of the alarming experiences social-media platforms foster. Reddit users terrorized by the openly bigoted and aggressive communities that have congregated there are not comforted by an appeal to economic principles. The virtues of an open platform are lost on the victim of a spontaneous Twitter mob, inspired anonymously or, as the case may be, by the president-elect of the United States. Understanding that the widespread belief in disinformation may have been an unforeseen externality of Facebook\u2019s design is more interesting than helpful, especially as Facebook says it will look to the wisdom of the crowd for solutions to its problems.", "In seeking and depending on minimum liability, platforms leave gaping voids. For an example of how such a void can be filled, and exploited, look no further than the Breitbart of the 2016 election. It is a site that frequently flaunts its success on social-media platforms and appears amenable to the prevailing winds of change. \u201cBreitbart Ranked #1 for Most Shared Facebook Content on Presidential Debate Day,\u201d read one headline. \u201cMedia Firms Lose Control of News as Tech Platforms Rise,\u201d read another from June.

The site wrote aggressively about frail allegations that Facebook had censored conservative content in its trending-topic module. (Facebook subsequently fired the team responsible for moderating it.) It describes attempts at Twitter moderation as censorship and has characterized the company\u2019s recent account bans as a \u201cpurge.\u201d", "Many media companies mistakenly imagine Facebook is some sort of partner \u2014 a larger entity that exists on the same spectrum. But Breitbart behaves as though it knows this isn\u2019t true. In practice, it has embraced its role as a platform citizen, one more subservient content peddler among many.

Eventually one brave soul stepped up, I sent a couple emails, and was put in touch with a very pleasant Amazon rep who commended me for my doggedness in confirming the non-holiday content of \u201cZombie Lake.\u201d As this column closes, however, I still await confirmation of my surmise that the presence of the movie was a result of, as plausibility suggests, a glitch in the Amazon search algorithm.

Instead he appears fleetingly, eyes bloodshot, emotionless, speaking only the few words from the kidnapper\u2019s script as he falsely confesses to killing Majid Nassar.", "Instead, the show opts to spend too much time with its ridiculous C Story about the paternity test. While Jason\u2019s entire life is being ripped apart by blackmail, the camera keeps cutting back to a father and son deciding whether or not to open an envelope. But while the paternity results themselves are hardly worth discussing, the thread does redeem itself in part by engaging in another worthy exploration of the relationship between president and press. Seth Wright thinks he killed the story by cozying up to the reporter Lisa Jordan and offering her a different morsel, but she has principles: \u201cThe president\u2019s relationship with the truth means something,\u201d she tells him, in a thinly veiled subtweet.", "In another era of American politics, the show might have had to prove its daring by taking a stand on some hot-button political issue.

Such arguments are particularly poignant now, but from a narrative perspective, the whole subplot feels manufactured.

Once you managed to convince her you weren\u2019t some oddly dressed wizard, and that what you withdrew from your pocket wasn\u2019t a black-arts amulet but merely a tiny computer more powerful than the one that guided Apollo missions, Google Maps would almost certainly seem to her a persuasive example of \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d In a very real sense, it is. It can do things any map-literate human can manage, like get you from your hotel to the airport \u2014 though it can do so much more quickly and reliably. It can also do things that humans simply and obviously cannot: It can evaluate the traffic, plan the best route and reorient itself when you take the wrong exit.", "Practically nobody today, however, would bestow upon Google Maps the honorific \u201cA.I.,\u201d so sentimental and sparing are we in our use of the word \u201cintelligence.\u201d Artificial intelligence, we believe, must be something that distinguishes HAL from whatever it is a loom or wheelbarrow can do. The minute we can automate a task, we downgrade the relevant skill involved to one of mere mechanism. Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d are thus constantly receding.", "When he has an opportunity to make careful distinctions, Pichai differentiates between the current applications of A.I. and the ultimate goal of \u201cartificial general intelligence.\u201d Artificial general intelligence will not involve dutiful adherence to explicit instructions, but instead will demonstrate a facility with the implicit, the interpretive. It will be a general tool, designed for general purposes in a general context. Pichai believes his company\u2019s future depends on something like this. Imagine if you could tell Google Maps, \u201cI\u2019d like to go to the airport, but I need to stop off on the way to buy a present for my nephew.\u201d A more generally intelligent version of that service \u2014 a ubiquitous assistant, of the sort that Scarlett Johansson memorably disembodied three years ago in the Spike Jonze film \u201cHer\u201d\u2014 would know all sorts of things that, say, a close friend or an earnest intern might know: your nephew\u2019s age, and how much you ordinarily like to spend on gifts for children, and where to find an open store. But a truly intelligent Maps could also conceivably know all sorts of things a close friend wouldn\u2019t, like what has only recently come into fashion among preschoolers in your nephew\u2019s school \u2014 or more important, what its users actually want. If an intelligent machine were able to discern some intricate if murky regularity in data about what we have done in the past, it might be able to extrapolate about our subsequent desires, even if we don\u2019t entirely know them ourselves.", "The new wave of A.I.-enhanced assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Facebook\u2019s M, Amazon\u2019s Echo \u2014 are all creatures of machine learning, built with similar intentions. The corporate dreams for machine learning, however, aren\u2019t exhausted by the goal of consumer clairvoyance. A medical-imaging subsidiary of Samsung announced this year that its new ultrasound devices could detect breast cancer.

It\u2019s an uncommon story in many ways, not least of all because it defies many of the Silicon Valley stereotypes we\u2019ve grown accustomed to. It does not feature people who think that everything will be unrecognizably different tomorrow or the next day because of some restless tinkerer in his garage. It is neither a story about people who think technology will solve all our problems nor one about people who think technology is ineluctably bound to create apocalyptic new ones. It is not about disruption, at least not in the way that word tends to be used.", "It is, in fact, three overlapping stories that converge in Google Translate\u2019s successful metamorphosis to A.I. \u2014 a technical story, an institutional story and a story about the evolution of ideas. The technical story is about one team on one product at one company, and the process by which they refined, tested and introduced a brand-new version of an old product in only about a quarter of the time anyone, themselves included, might reasonably have expected. The institutional story is about the employees of a small but influential artificial-intelligence group within that company, and the process by which their intuitive faith in some old, unproven and broadly unpalatable notions about computing upended every other company within a large radius. The story of ideas is about the cognitive scientists, psychologists and wayward engineers who long toiled in obscurity, and the process by which their ostensibly irrational convictions ultimately inspired a paradigm shift in our understanding not only of technology but also, in theory, of consciousness itself.", "The first story, the story of Google Translate, takes place in Mountain View over nine months, and it explains the transformation of machine translation. The second story, the story of Google Brain and its many competitors, takes place in Silicon Valley over five years, and it explains the transformation of that entire community. The third story, the story of deep learning, takes place in a variety of far-flung laboratories \u2014 in Scotland, Switzerland, Japan and most of all Canada \u2014 over seven decades, and it might very well contribute to the revision of our self-image as first and foremost beings who think.", "All three are stories about artificial intelligence. The seven-decade story is about what we might conceivably expect or want from it. The five-year story is about what it might do in the near future. The nine-month story is about what it can do right this minute. These three stories are themselves just proof of concept. All of this is only the beginning.", "Jeff Dean, though his title is senior fellow, is the de facto head of Google Brain. Dean is a sinewy, energy-efficient man with a long, narrow face, deep-set eyes and an earnest, soapbox-derby sort of enthusiasm. The son of a medical anthropologist and a public-health epidemiologist, Dean grew up all over the world \u2014 Minnesota, Hawaii, Boston, Arkansas, Geneva, Uganda, Somalia, Atlanta \u2014 and, while in high school and college, wrote software used by the World Health Organization. He has been with Google since 1999, as employee 25ish, and has had a hand in the core software systems beneath nearly every significant undertaking since then. A beloved artifact of company culture is Jeff Dean Facts, written in the style of the Chuck Norris Facts meme: \u201cJeff Dean\u2019s PIN is the last four digits of pi.\u201d \u201cWhen Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he saw a missed call from Jeff Dean.\u201d \u201cJeff Dean got promoted to Level 11 in a system where the maximum level is 10.\u201d (This last one is, in fact, true.)", "One day in early 2011, Dean walked into one of the Google campus\u2019s \u201cmicrokitchens\u201d \u2014 the \u201cGoogley\u201d word for the shared break spaces on most floors of the Mountain View complex\u2019s buildings \u2014 and ran into Andrew Ng, a young Stanford computer-science professor who was working for the company as a consultant. Ng told him about Project Marvin, an internal effort (named after the celebrated A.I. pioneer Marvin Minsky) he had recently helped establish to experiment with \u201cneural networks,\u201d pliant digital lattices based loosely on the architecture of the brain. Dean himself had worked on a primitive version of the technology as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in 1990, during one of the method\u2019s brief windows of mainstream acceptability. Now, over the previous five years, the number of academics working on neural networks had begun to grow again, from a handful to a few dozen. Ng told Dean that Project Marvin, which was being underwritten by Google\u2019s secretive X lab, had already achieved some promising results.", "Dean was intrigued enough to lend his \u201c20 percent\u201d \u2014 the portion of work hours every Google employee is expected to contribute to programs outside his or her core job \u2014 to the project. Pretty soon, he suggested to Ng that they bring in another colleague with a neuroscience background, Greg Corrado. (In graduate school, Corrado was taught briefly about the technology, but strictly as a historical curiosity. \u201cIt was good I was paying attention in class that day,\u201d he joked to me.) In late spring they brought in one of Ng\u2019s best graduate students, Quoc Le, as the project\u2019s first intern. By then, a number of the Google engineers had taken to referring to Project Marvin by another name: Google Brain.", "Since the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d was first coined, at a kind of constitutional convention of the mind at Dartmouth in the summer of 1956, a majority of researchers have long thought the best approach to creating A.I. would be to write a very big, comprehensive program that laid out both the rules of logical reasoning and sufficient knowledge of the world. If you wanted to translate from English to Japanese, for example, you would program into the computer all of the grammatical rules of English, and then the entirety of definitions contained in the Oxford English Dictionary, and then all of the grammatical rules of Japanese, as well as all of the words in the Japanese dictionary, and only after all of that feed it a sentence in a source language and ask it to tabulate a corresponding sentence in the target language. You would give the machine a language map that was, as Borges would have had it, the size of the territory. This perspective is usually called \u201csymbolic A.I.\u201d \u2014 because its definition of cognition is based on symbolic logic \u2014 or, disparagingly, \u201cgood old-fashioned A.I.\u201d", "There are two main problems with the old-fashioned approach. The first is that it\u2019s awfully time-consuming on the human end. The second is that it only really works in domains where rules and definitions are very clear: in mathematics, for example, or chess. Translation, however, is an example of a field where this approach fails horribly, because words cannot be reduced to their dictionary definitions, and because languages tend to have as many exceptions as they have rules. More often than not, a system like this is liable to translate \u201cminister of agriculture\u201d as \u201cpriest of farming.\u201d Still, for math and chess it worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d better than math and chess.", "There were, however, limits to what this system could do. In the 1980s, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon pointed out that it was easy to get computers to do adult things but nearly impossible to get them to do things a 1-year-old could do, like hold a ball or identify a cat. By the 1990s, despite punishing advancements in computer chess, we still weren\u2019t remotely close to artificial general intelligence.", "There has always been another vision for A.I. \u2014 a dissenting view \u2014 in which the computers would learn from the ground up (from data) rather than from the top down (from rules). This notion dates to the early 1940s, when it occurred to researchers that the best model for flexible automated intelligence was the brain itself. A brain, after all, is just a bunch of widgets, called neurons, that either pass along an electrical charge to their neighbors or don\u2019t. What\u2019s important are less the individual neurons themselves than the manifold connections among them. This structure, in its simplicity, has afforded the brain a wealth of adaptive advantages. The brain can operate in circumstances in which information is poor or missing; it can withstand significant damage without total loss of control; it can store a huge amount of knowledge in a very efficient way; it can isolate distinct patterns but retain the messiness necessary to handle ambiguity.", "There was no reason you couldn\u2019t try to mimic this structure in electronic form, and in 1943 it was shown that arrangements of simple artificial neurons could carry out basic logical functions. They could also, at least in theory, learn the way we do. With life experience, depending on a particular person\u2019s trials and errors, the synaptic connections among pairs of neurons get stronger or weaker. An artificial neural network could do something similar, by gradually altering, on a guided trial-and-error basis, the numerical relationships among artificial neurons. It wouldn\u2019t need to be preprogrammed with fixed rules. It would, instead, rewire itself to reflect patterns in the data it absorbed.", "This attitude toward artificial intelligence was evolutionary rather than creationist. If you wanted a flexible mechanism, you wanted one that could adapt to its environment. If you wanted something that could adapt, you didn\u2019t want to begin with the indoctrination of the rules of chess. You wanted to begin with very basic abilities \u2014 sensory perception and motor control \u2014 in the hope that advanced skills would emerge organically. Humans don\u2019t learn to understand language by memorizing dictionaries and grammar books, so why should we possibly expect our computers to do so?", "Google Brain was the first major commercial institution to invest in the possibilities embodied by this way of thinking about A.I. Dean, Corrado and Ng began their work as a part-time, collaborative experiment, but they made immediate progress. They took architectural inspiration for their models from recent theoretical outlines \u2014 as well as ideas that had been on the shelf since the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 and drew upon both the company\u2019s peerless reserves of data and its massive computing infrastructure. They instructed the networks on enormous banks of \u201clabeled\u201d data \u2014 speech files with correct transcriptions, for example \u2014 and the computers improved their responses to better match reality.", "\u201cThe portion of evolution in which animals developed eyes was a big development,\u201d Dean told me one day, with customary understatement. We were sitting, as usual, in a whiteboarded meeting room, on which he had drawn a crowded, snaking timeline of Google Brain and its relation to inflection points in the recent history of neural networks. \u201cNow computers have eyes. We can build them around the capabilities that now exist to understand photos. Robots will be drastically transformed. They\u2019ll be able to operate in an unknown environment, on much different problems.\u201d These capacities they were building may have seemed primitive, but their implications were profound.", "In its first year or so of existence, Brain\u2019s experiments in the development of a machine with the talents of a 1-year-old had, as Dean said, worked to great effect. Its speech-recognition team swapped out part of their old system for a neural network and encountered, in pretty much one fell swoop, the best quality improvements anyone had seen in 20 years. Their system\u2019s object-recognition abilities improved by an order of magnitude. This was not because Brain\u2019s personnel had generated a sheaf of outrageous new ideas in just a year. It was because Google had finally devoted the resources \u2014 in computers and, increasingly, personnel \u2014 to fill in outlines that had been around for a long time.", "A great preponderance of these extant and neglected notions had been proposed or refined by a peripatetic English polymath named Geoffrey Hinton. In the second year of Brain\u2019s existence, Hinton was recruited to Brain as Andrew Ng left. (Ng now leads the 1,300-person A.I. team at Baidu.) Hinton wanted to leave his post at the University of Toronto for only three months, so for arcane contractual reasons he had to be hired as an intern. At intern training, the orientation leader would say something like, \u201cType in your LDAP\u201d \u2014 a user login \u2014 and he would flag a helper to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s an LDAP?\u201d All the smart 25-year-olds in attendance, who had only ever known deep learning as the sine qua non of artificial intelligence, snickered: \u201cWho is that old guy? Why doesn\u2019t he get it?\u201d", "\u201cAt lunchtime,\u201d Hinton said, \u201csomeone in the queue yelled: \u2018Professor Hinton! I took your course! What are you doing here?\u2019 After that, it was all right.\u201d", "A few months later, Hinton and two of his students demonstrated truly astonishing gains in a big image-recognition contest, run by an open-source collective called ImageNet, that asks computers not only to identify a monkey but also to distinguish between spider monkeys and howler monkeys, and among God knows how many different breeds of cat. Google soon approached Hinton and his students with an offer. They accepted. \u201cI thought they were interested in our I.P.,\u201d he said. \u201cTurns out they were interested in us.\u201d", "Hinton comes from one of those old British families emblazoned like the Darwins at eccentric angles across the intellectual landscape, where regardless of titular preoccupation a person is expected to make sideline contributions to minor problems in astronomy or fluid dynamics. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, whose foundational work in symbolic logic underpins the computer; another great-great-grandfather was a celebrated surgeon, his father a venturesome entomologist, his father\u2019s cousin a Los Alamos researcher; the list goes on. He trained at Cambridge and Edinburgh, then taught at Carnegie Mellon before he ended up at Toronto, where he still spends half his time. (His work has long been supported by the largess of the Canadian government.) I visited him in his office at Google there. He has tousled yellowed-pewter hair combed forward in a mature Noel Gallagher style and wore a baggy striped dress shirt that persisted in coming untucked, and oval eyeglasses that slid down to the tip of a prominent nose. He speaks with a driving if shambolic wit, and says things like, \u201cComputers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.\u201d", "Hinton had been working on neural networks since his undergraduate days at Cambridge in the late 1960s, and he is seen as the intellectual primogenitor of the contemporary field. For most of that time, whenever he spoke about machine learning, people looked at him as though he were talking about the Ptolemaic spheres or bloodletting by leeches. Neural networks were taken as a disproven folly, largely on the basis of one overhyped project: the Perceptron, an artificial neural network that Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychologist, developed in the late 1950s. The New York Times reported that the machine\u2019s sponsor, the United States Navy, expected it would \u201cbe able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\u201d It went on to do approximately none of those things. Marvin Minsky, the dean of artificial intelligence in America, had worked on neural networks for his 1954 Princeton thesis, but he\u2019d since grown tired of the inflated claims that Rosenblatt \u2014 who was a contemporary at Bronx Science \u2014 made for the neural paradigm. (He was also competing for Defense Department funding.) Along with an M.I.T. colleague, Minsky published a book that proved that there were painfully simple problems the Perceptron could never solve.", "Minsky\u2019s criticism of the Perceptron extended only to networks of one \u201clayer,\u201d i.e., one layer of artificial neurons between what\u2019s fed to the machine and what you expect from it \u2014 and later in life, he expounded ideas very similar to contemporary deep learning. But Hinton already knew at the time that complex tasks could be carried out if you had recourse to multiple layers. The simplest description of a neural network is that it\u2019s a machine that makes classifications or predictions based on its ability to discover patterns in data. With one layer, you could find only simple patterns; with more than one, you could look for patterns of patterns. Take the case of image recognition, which tends to rely on a contraption called a \u201cconvolutional neural net.\u201d (These were elaborated in a seminal 1998 paper whose lead author, a Frenchman named Yann LeCun, did his postdoctoral research in Toronto under Hinton and now directs a huge A.I. endeavor at Facebook.) The first layer of the network learns to identify the very basic visual trope of an \u201cedge,\u201d meaning a nothing (an off-pixel) followed by a something (an on-pixel) or vice versa. Each successive layer of the network looks for a pattern in the previous layer. A pattern of edges might be a circle or a rectangle. A pattern of circles or rectangles might be a face. And so on. This more or less parallels the way information is put together in increasingly abstract ways as it travels from the photoreceptors in the retina back and up through the visual cortex. At each conceptual step, detail that isn\u2019t immediately relevant is thrown away. If several edges and circles come together to make a face, you don\u2019t care exactly where the face is found in the visual field; you just care that it\u2019s a face.", "The issue with multilayered, \u201cdeep\u201d neural networks was that the trial-and-error part got extraordinarily complicated. In a single layer, it\u2019s easy. Imagine that you\u2019re playing with a child. You tell the child, \u201cPick up the green ball and put it into Box A.\u201d The child picks up a green ball and puts it into Box B. You say, \u201cTry again to put the green ball in Box A.\u201d The child tries Box A. Bravo.", "Now imagine you tell the child, \u201cPick up a green ball, go through the door marked 3 and put the green ball into Box A.\u201d The child takes a red ball, goes through the door marked 2 and puts the red ball into Box B. How do you begin to correct the child? You cannot just repeat your initial instructions, because the child does not know at which point he went wrong. In real life, you might start by holding up the red ball and the green ball and saying, \u201cRed ball, green ball.\u201d The whole point of machine learning, however, is to avoid that kind of explicit mentoring. Hinton and a few others went on to invent a solution (or rather, reinvent an older one) to this layered-error problem, over the halting course of the late 1970s and 1980s, and interest among computer scientists in neural networks was briefly revived. \u201cPeople got very excited about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we oversold it.\u201d Computer scientists quickly went back to thinking that people like Hinton were weirdos and mystics.", "These ideas remained popular, however, among philosophers and psychologists, who called it \u201cconnectionism\u201d or \u201cparallel distributed processing.\u201d \u201cThis idea,\u201d Hinton told me, \u201cof a few people keeping a torch burning, it\u2019s a nice myth. It was true within artificial intelligence. But within psychology lots of people believed in the approach but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Neither could Hinton, despite the generosity of the Canadian government. \u201cThere just wasn\u2019t enough computer power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, \u2018Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work.\u2019\u2009It wasn\u2019t a very persuasive argument.\u201d", "When Pichai said that Google would henceforth be \u201cA.I. first,\u201d he was not just making a claim about his company\u2019s business strategy; he was throwing in his company\u2019s lot with this long-unworkable idea. Pichai\u2019s allocation of resources ensured that people like Dean could ensure that people like Hinton would have, at long last, enough computers and enough data to make a persuasive argument. An average brain has something on the order of 100 billion neurons. Each neuron is connected to up to 10,000 other neurons, which means that the number of synapses is between 100 trillion and 1,000 trillion. For a simple artificial neural network of the sort proposed in the 1940s, the attempt to even try to replicate this was unimaginable. We\u2019re still far from the construction of a network of that size, but Google Brain\u2019s investment allowed for the creation of artificial neural networks comparable to the brains of mice.", "To understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A.I. rest on the idea that they\u2019re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn\u2019t how they work. All they\u2019re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities \u2014 basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones \u2014 and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we\u2019re feeding them is biased in the first place.", "If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.)", "Imagine you want to program a cat-recognizer on the old symbolic-A.I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of \u201ccat.\u201d You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If(legs=4) and if(ears=pointy) and if(whiskers=yes) and if(tail=yes) and if(expression=supercilious), then(cat=yes). But what if you showed this cat-recognizer a Scottish Fold, a heart-rending breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy doubled-over ears? Our symbolic A.I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, \u201cNot cat.\u201d It is hyperliteral, or \u201cbrittle.\u201d Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity.", "Now imagine that instead of hard-wiring the machine with a set of rules for classification stored in one location of the computer\u2019s memory, you try the same thing on a neural network. There is no special place that can hold the definition of \u201ccat.\u201d There is just a giant blob of interconnected switches, like forks in a path. On one side of the blob, you present the inputs (the pictures); on the other side, you present the corresponding outputs (the labels). Then you just tell it to work out for itself, via the individual calibration of all of these interconnected switches, whatever path the data should take so that the inputs are mapped to the correct outputs. The training is the process by which a labyrinthine series of elaborate tunnels are excavated through the blob, tunnels that connect any given input to its proper output. The more training data you have, the greater the number and intricacy of the tunnels that can be dug. Once the training is complete, the middle of the blob has enough tunnels that it can make reliable predictions about how to handle data it has never seen before. This is called \u201csupervised learning.\u201d", "The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal \u201cvoters,\u201d each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, \u201cIs this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?\u201d All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: \u201cA dog?\u201d", "You say: \u201cNo, maestro, it\u2019s a cat. Try again.\u201d", "Now the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind \u201ccat\u201d and which didn\u2019t. The ones that got \u201ccat\u201d right get their votes counted double next time \u2014 at least when they\u2019re voting for \u201ccat.\u201d They have to prove independently whether they\u2019re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What\u2019s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it\u2019s a dog; but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it\u2019s a cat; and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it\u2019s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, \u201cOdds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling \u2018cats.\u2019\u2009\u201d The more \u201cvoters\u201d you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately.", "Part of the reason there was so much resistance to these ideas in computer-science departments is that because the output is just a prediction based on patterns of patterns, it\u2019s not going to be perfect, and the machine will never be able to define for you what, exactly, a cat is. It just knows them when it sees them. This wooliness, however, is the point. The neuronal \u201cvoters\u201d will recognize a happy cat dozing in the sun and an angry cat glaring out from the shadows of an untidy litter box, as long as they have been exposed to millions of diverse cat scenes. You just need lots and lots of the voters \u2014 in order to make sure that some part of your network picks up on even very weak regularities, on Scottish Folds with droopy ears, for example \u2014 and enough labeled data to make sure your network has seen the widest possible variance in phenomena.", "It is important to note, however, that the fact that neural networks are probabilistic in nature means that they\u2019re not suitable for all tasks. It\u2019s no great tragedy if they mislabel 1 percent of cats as dogs, or send you to the wrong movie on occasion, but in something like a self-driving car we all want greater assurances. This isn\u2019t the only caveat. Supervised learning is a trial-and-error process based on labeled data. The machines might be doing the learning, but there remains a strong human element in the initial categorization of the inputs. If your data had a picture of a man and a woman in suits that someone had labeled \u201cwoman with her boss,\u201d that relationship would be encoded into all future pattern recognition. Labeled data is thus fallible the way that human labelers are fallible. If a machine was asked to identify creditworthy candidates for loans, it might use data like felony convictions, but if felony convictions were unfair in the first place \u2014 if they were based on, say, discriminatory drug laws \u2014 then the loan recommendations would perforce also be fallible.", "Image-recognition networks like our cat-identifier are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans \u2014 picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there\u2019s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google\u2019s image-recognition software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of \u201cdumbbell\u201d but the concept of \u201cdumbbell+arm,\u201d because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy.", "Over the course of its first year or two, Brain\u2019s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a 1-year-old were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X\u2019s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language.", "The first step in that direction was the cat paper, which made Brain famous.", "What the cat paper demonstrated was that a neural network with more than a billion \u201csynaptic\u201d connections \u2014 a hundred times larger than any publicized neural network to that point, yet still many orders of magnitude smaller than our brains \u2014 could observe raw, unlabeled data and pick out for itself a high-order human concept. The Brain researchers had shown the network millions of still frames from YouTube videos, and out of the welter of the pure sensorium the network had isolated a stable pattern any toddler or chipmunk would recognize without a moment\u2019s hesitation as the face of a cat. The machine had not been programmed with the foreknowledge of a cat; it reached directly into the world and seized the idea for itself. (The researchers discovered this with the neural-network equivalent of something like an M.R.I., which showed them that a ghostly cat face caused the artificial neurons to \u201cvote\u201d with the greatest collective enthusiasm.) Most machine learning to that point had been limited by the quantities of labeled data. The cat paper showed that machines could also deal with raw unlabeled data, perhaps even data of which humans had no established foreknowledge. This seemed like a major advance not only in cat-recognition studies but also in overall artificial intelligence.", "The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and soft-spoken, with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be?", "\u201cBut actually,\u201d he told me in a whispery deadpan, \u201cit\u2019s very hard.\u201d", "He left the rice paddies on a scholarship to a university in Canberra, Australia, where he worked on A.I. tasks like computer vision. The dominant method of the time, which involved feeding the machine definitions for things like edges, felt to him like cheating. Le didn\u2019t know then, or knew only dimly, that there were at least a few dozen computer scientists elsewhere in the world who couldn\u2019t help imagining, as he did, that machines could learn from scratch. In 2006, Le took a position at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in the medieval German university town of T\u00fcbingen. In a reading group there, he encountered two new papers by Geoffrey Hinton. People who entered the discipline during the long diaspora all have conversion stories, and when Le read those papers, he felt the scales fall away from his eyes.", "\u201cThere was a big debate,\u201d he told me. \u201cA very big debate.\u201d We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow, high-ceilinged space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he\u2019d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a big debate.\u201d", "He remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, \u201cThis is the future.\u201d It was, he said, an \u201cunpopular decision at the time.\u201d A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn\u2019t quite understand Le\u2019s decision. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked Le in an email.", "\u201cI didn\u2019t have a good answer back then,\u201d Le said. \u201cI was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity.\u201d He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton\u2019s ideas. \u201cBy the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen.\u201d", "What happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work \u2014 an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn\u2019t specify what it should or shouldn\u2019t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: \u201cJust kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained.\u201d It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to \u201csummarize\u201d the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data \u2014 like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers \u2014 the machine couldn\u2019t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to saber-tooth tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le\u2019s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically \u201cchose\u201d to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn\u2019t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of furniture-animal compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat.", "Le didn\u2019t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years.", "In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s suite. It unsettled incoming V.I.P.s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn\u2019t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google\u2019s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov\u2019s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn\u2019t help myself and began to ask, \u201cIs he ... ?\u201d Le nodded. \u201cAt Facebook,\u201d he replied.)", "They spent this period trying to come up with neural-network architectures that could accommodate not only simple photo classifications, which were static, but also complex structures that unfolded over time, like language or music. Many of these were first proposed in the 1990s, and Le and his colleagues went back to those long-ignored contributions to see what they could glean. They knew that once you established a facility with basic linguistic prediction, you could then go on to do all sorts of other intelligent things \u2014 like predict a suitable reply to an email, for example, or predict the flow of a sensible conversation. You could sidle up to the sort of prowess that would, from the outside at least, look a lot like thinking.", "The hundred or so current members of Brain \u2014 it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina \u2014 came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered two-story eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company\u2019s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used; a Rock Band setup I never saw used; and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.)", "When I began spending time at Brain\u2019s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with Post-it notes that said things like \u201cJesse, 6/27.\u201d Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street.", "Brain\u2019s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a \u201csuccess disaster\u201d \u2014 a situation in which the company\u2019s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a two-slide presentation.", "\u201cIf everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,\u201d he told them, \u201cthis is how many machines we\u2019ll need.\u201d They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint.", "\u201cThat,\u201d he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, \u201csounded scary. You\u2019d have to\u201d \u2014 he hesitated to imagine the consequences \u2014 \u201cbuild new buildings.\u201d", "There was, however, another option: just design, mass-produce and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T.P.U.s, or \u201ctensor processing units,\u201d and their value proposition \u2014 counterintuitively \u2014 is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12.246 times 54.392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it\u2019s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. \u201cNormally,\u201d Dean said, \u201cspecial-purpose hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this special-purpose hardware for a lot of other things.\u201d", "Just as the chip-design process was nearly complete, Le and two colleagues finally demonstrated that neural networks might be configured to handle the structure of language. He drew upon an idea, called \u201cword embeddings,\u201d that had been around for more than 10 years. When you summarize images, you can divine a picture of what each stage of the summary looks like \u2014 an edge, a circle, etc. When you summarize language in a similar way, you essentially produce multidimensional maps of the distances, based on common usage, between one word and every single other word in the language. The machine is not \u201canalyzing\u201d the data the way that we might, with linguistic rules that identify some of them as nouns and others as verbs. Instead, it is shifting and twisting and warping the words around in the map. In two dimensions, you cannot make this map useful. You want, for example, \u201ccat\u201d to be in the rough vicinity of \u201cdog,\u201d but you also want \u201ccat\u201d to be near \u201ctail\u201d and near \u201csupercilious\u201d and near \u201cmeme,\u201d because you want to try to capture all of the different relationships \u2014 both strong and weak \u2014 that the word \u201ccat\u201d has to other words. It can be related to all these other words simultaneously only if it is related to each of them in a different dimension. You can\u2019t easily make a 160,000-dimensional map, but it turns out you can represent a language pretty well in a mere thousand or so dimensions \u2014 in other words, a universe in which each word is designated by a list of a thousand numbers. Le gave me a good-natured hard time for my continual requests for a mental picture of these maps. \u201cGideon,\u201d he would say, with the blunt regular demurral of Bartleby, \u201cI do not generally like trying to visualize thousand-dimensional vectors in three-dimensional space.\u201d", "Still, certain dimensions in the space, it turned out, did seem to represent legible human categories, like gender or relative size. If you took the thousand numbers that meant \u201cking\u201d and literally just subtracted the thousand numbers that meant \u201cqueen,\u201d you got the same numerical result as if you subtracted the numbers for \u201cwoman\u201d from the numbers for \u201cman.\u201d And if you took the entire space of the English language and the entire space of French, you could, at least in theory, train a network to learn how to take a sentence in one space and propose an equivalent in the other. You just had to give it millions and millions of English sentences as inputs on one side and their desired French outputs on the other, and over time it would recognize the relevant patterns in words the way that an image classifier recognized the relevant patterns in pixels. You could then give it a sentence in English and ask it to predict the best French analogue.", "The major difference between words and pixels, however, is that all of the pixels in an image are there at once, whereas words appear in a progression over time. You needed a way for the network to \u201chold in mind\u201d the progression of a chronological sequence \u2014 the complete pathway from the first word to the last. In a period of about a week, in September 2014, three papers came out \u2014 one by Le and two others by academics in Canada and Germany \u2014 that at last provided all the theoretical tools necessary to do this sort of thing. That research allowed for open-ended projects like Brain\u2019s Magenta, an investigation into how machines might generate art and music. It also cleared the way toward an instrumental task like machine translation. Hinton told me he thought at the time that this follow-up work would take at least five more years.", "Le\u2019s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is \u2014 it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le\u2019s model didn\u2019t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words.", "Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn\u2019t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. \u201cYou think,\u201d Schuster says, \u201cto translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you\u2019re done, but it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d", "Schuster is a taut, focused, ageless being with a tanned, piston-shaped head, narrow shoulders, long camo cargo shorts tied below the knee and neon-green Nike Flyknits. He looks as if he woke up in the lotus position, reached for his small, rimless, elliptical glasses, accepted calories in the form of a modest portion of preserved acorn and completed a relaxed desert decathlon on the way to the office; in reality, he told me, it\u2019s only an 18-mile bike ride each way. Schuster grew up in Duisburg, in the former West Germany\u2019s blast-furnace district, and studied electrical engineering before moving to Kyoto to work on early neural networks. In the 1990s, he ran experiments with a neural-networking machine as big as a conference room; it cost millions of dollars and had to be trained for weeks to do something you could now do on your desktop in less than an hour. He published a paper in 1997 that was barely cited for a decade and a half; this year it has been cited around 150 times. He is not humorless, but he does often wear an expression of some asperity, which I took as his signature combination of German restraint and Japanese restraint.", "The issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le\u2019s code was custom-written, and it wasn\u2019t compatible with the new open-source machine-learning platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le\u2019s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn\u2019t always make heads or tails of what they had done.", "As Schuster put it, \u201cSome of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn\u2019t know themselves why they worked.\u201d", "This February, Google\u2019s research organization \u2014 the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the forward-looking and the unclassifiable \u2014 convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google\u2019s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of \u201clightning talks,\u201d quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in cross-departmental \u201cfacilitated discussions.\u201d The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell Labs-ish exchanges that kept a mature company prolific.", "At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, \u201cWe ambushed him.\u201d", "\u201cO.K.,\u201d Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. \u201cWe have something to tell you.\u201d", "They told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate \u2014 the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years \u2014 with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of post-processing rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called \u201cphrase-based statistical machine translation,\u201d because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn\u2019t know what the last one was. This is why Translate\u2019s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain\u2019s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context \u2014 and something akin to meaning.", "The stakes may have seemed low: Translate generates minimal revenue, and it probably always will. For most Anglophone users, even a radical upgrade in the service\u2019s performance would hardly be hailed as anything more than an expected incremental bump. But there was a case to be made that human-quality machine translation is not only a short-term necessity but also a development very likely, in the long term, to prove transformational. In the immediate future, it\u2019s vital to the company\u2019s business strategy. Google estimates that 50 percent of the internet is in English, which perhaps 20 percent of the world\u2019s population speaks. If Google was going to compete in China \u2014 where a majority of market share in search-engine traffic belonged to its competitor Baidu \u2014 or India, decent machine translation would be an indispensable part of the infrastructure. Baidu itself had published a pathbreaking paper about the possibility of neural machine translation in July 2015.", "And in the more distant, speculative future, machine translation was perhaps the first step toward a general computational facility with human language. This would represent a major inflection point \u2014 perhaps the major inflection point \u2014 in the development of something that felt like true artificial intelligence.", "Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a fast-approaching horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work \u2014 not in a lab but at production scale \u2014 for years, to little avail.", "Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years.", "Dean thought otherwise. \u201cWe can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it.\u201d One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn\u2019t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like \u201cif we put our minds to it.\u201d", "Hughes was sure the conversion wasn\u2019t going to happen any time soon, but he didn\u2019t personally care to be the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s prepare for 2016,\u201d he went back and told his team. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can\u2019t deliver speed.\u201d", "A month later, they were finally able to run a side-by-side experiment to compare Schuster\u2019s new system with Hughes\u2019s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for English-French, but Hughes advised him to try something else. \u201cEnglish-French,\u201d he said, \u201cis so good that the improvement won\u2019t be obvious.\u201d", "It was a challenge Schuster couldn\u2019t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for English-French were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good; an improvement of two was considered outstanding.", "The neural system, on the English-French language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points.", "Hughes told Schuster\u2019s team they hadn\u2019t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years.", "To be sure this wasn\u2019t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a side-by-side comparison. The user-perception scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0.4 \u2014 roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development.", "In mid-March, Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately.", "Until then, the neural-translation team had been only three people \u2014 Schuster, Wu and Chen \u2014 but with Hughes\u2019s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster\u2019s command on Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster\u2019s case there was no ambiguity.", "The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. \u201cThis story is a lot about uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty throughout the whole process,\u201d Schuster told me at one point. \u201cThe software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like\u201d \u2014 he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders \u2014 \u201cswimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far.\u201d He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s a goal somewhere, and maybe it\u2019s there.\u201d", "Most of Google\u2019s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely high-resolution oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night.", "\u201cThe view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far.\u201d", "The theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and drawn-out, but the attempt to turn it into a viable product \u2014 the part that academic scientists might dismiss as \u201cmere\u201d engineering \u2014 was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google\u2019s billions of words of training \u201creading\u201d were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English \u201cwords.\u201d But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160,000.", "Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don\u2019t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences; they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: \u201cThe neural-translation system is learning everything it can. It\u2019s like a toddler. \u2018Oh, Daddy says that word when he\u2019s mad!\u2019\u2009\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201d", "More than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn\u2019t notice. In February, the translation of a 10-word sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn\u2019t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn\u2019t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a high-traffic language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn\u2019t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor\u2019s service.", "Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn\u2019t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, \u201cThere must be something we don\u2019t know to make it fast enough, but I don\u2019t know what it could be.\u201d", "He did know, though, that they needed more computers \u2014 \u201cG.P.U.s,\u201d graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks \u2014 for training.", "Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. \u201cShould we ask for a thousand G.P.U.s?\u201d", "Schuster said, \u201cWhy not 2,000?\u201d", "Ten days later, they had the additional 2,000 processors.", "By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people \u2014 some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. \u201cPeople were almost yelling,\u201d Schuster said.", "By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a \u201cword-piece model,\u201d a \u201ccoverage penalty,\u201d \u201clength normalization.\u201d Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox \u2014 that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort \u2014 was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1,024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for?", "\u201cWe did hundreds of experiments,\u201d Schuster told me, \u201cuntil we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You\u2019re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I\u2019m done? You never know you\u2019re done. The machine-learning mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That\u2019s the very painful nature of this whole system. It\u2019s hard for some people. It\u2019s a little bit an art \u2014 where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse.\u201d", "By May, the Brain team understood that the only way they were ever going to make the system fast enough to implement as a product was if they could run it on T.P.U.s, the special-purpose chips that Dean had called for. As Chen put it: \u201cWe did not even know if the code would work. But we did know that without T.P.U.s, it definitely wasn\u2019t going to work.\u201d He remembers going to Dean one on one to plead, \u201cPlease reserve something for us.\u201d Dean had reserved them. The T.P.U.s, however, didn\u2019t work right out of the box. Wu spent two months sitting next to someone from the hardware team in an attempt to figure out why. They weren\u2019t just debugging the model; they were debugging the chip. The neural-translation project would be proof of concept for the whole infrastructural investment.", "One Wednesday in June, the meeting in Quartz Lake began with murmurs about a Baidu paper that had recently appeared on the discipline\u2019s chief online forum. Schuster brought the room to order. \u201cYes, Baidu came out with a paper. It feels like someone looking through our shoulder \u2014 similar architecture, similar results.\u201d The company\u2019s BLEU scores were essentially what Google achieved in its internal tests in February and March. Le didn\u2019t seem ruffled; his conclusion seemed to be that it was a sign Google was on the right track. \u201cIt is very similar to our system,\u201d he said with quiet approval.", "The Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: \u201cLaunching is more important than publishing. People say, \u2018Oh, I did something first,\u2019 but who cares, in the end?\u201d", "This did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn\u2019t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a new system yet,\u201d he told me at 5:36 p.m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out Chinese-to-English to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. \u201cWe want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it\u2019s exploding on Twitter: \u2018Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got?\u2019\u2009\u201d", "The only two reliable measures of time in the seasonless Silicon Valley are the rotations of seasonal fruit in the microkitchens \u2014 from the pluots of midsummer to the Asian pears and Fuyu persimmons of early fall \u2014 and the zigzag of technological progress. On an almost uncomfortably warm Monday afternoon in late September, the team\u2019s paper was at last released. It had an almost comical 31 authors. The next day, the members of Brain and Translate gathered to throw themselves a little celebratory reception in the Translate microkitchen. The rooms in the Brain building, perhaps in homage to the long winters of their diaspora, are named after Alaskan locales; the Translate building\u2019s theme is Hawaiian.", "The Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small lei-garlanded thatched-hut service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an ill-defended tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased.", "Google\u2019s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company\u2019s Chinese-English test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu\u2019s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. \u201cIf you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!\u201d (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.)", "When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects.", "Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been last-minute problems, and then last-last-minute problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird punctuation-related bug in the system. But everything was resolved \u2014 or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a \u201ccollaboration between groups that spoke different languages.\u201d", "Their neural-translation project, he continued, represented a \u201cstep function forward\u201d \u2014 that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic demi-flute of expensive-looking Champagne.", "\u201cTo communication,\u201d he said, \u201cand cooperation!\u201d", "The engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause.", "Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum.", "What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: \u201cDo the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people.\u201d", "Everyone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn\u2019t.", "Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle\u2019s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon \u201cabsolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers.\u201d Should the unlucky prisoner be said to \u201cunderstand\u201d Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that \u201cthe appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds.\u201d", "For the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don\u2019t assume that \u201cconsciousness\u201d is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute \u2014 what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the \u201cghost in the machine.\u201d They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call \u201cconsciousness\u201d has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we\u2019re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation; so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind; it\u2019s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, \u201cIt\u2019s not about what a machine \u2018knows\u2019 or \u2018understands\u2019 but what it \u2018does,\u2019 and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 what it doesn\u2019t do yet.\u201d", "Where you come down on \u201cknowing\u201d versus \u201cdoing\u201d has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper\u2019s media reception. \u201cDid you see the first press?\u201d he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A.I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS\u2019. Over the final weeks of the paper\u2019s composition, the team had struggled with this; Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was \u201cIt\u2019s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans.\u201d He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren\u2019t about replacing people but helping them.", "And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human \u201cinsight,\u201d you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle\u2019s antagonists, you can\u2019t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M.I.T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He pooh-poohed the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn\u2019t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s causing the cancer.", "Then again, can the radiologist?", "Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight \u2014 the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive pattern-matching than logical analysis. They\u2019re not telling you what caused the cancer; they\u2019re just telling you it\u2019s there.", "Once you\u2019ve built a robust pattern-matching apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous radio-controlled car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans \u2014 and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once \u2014 unfairly, it ought to be emphasized \u2014 associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We\u2019re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We\u2019re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines.", "The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it\u2019s institution-building \u2014 and the consolidation of power \u2014 on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns; it has residents; it has \u201cninja\u201d classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of high-end pastries, and places for baby-clothes donations, and two-story climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation \u2014 for they\u2019re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine \u2014 have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities.", "But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation; once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more.", "Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names \u2014 of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean\u2019s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres.", "Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed.

The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House\u2019s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions, a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks.", "The low-key approach of the F.B.I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee\u2019s network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D.

They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn\u2019t publish any of it.", "The Russians had not gone away, of course. \u201cThey were just a lot more stealthy,\u201d said Kevin Mandia, a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye \u2014 and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems.", "The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia\u2019s war with Georgia.", "But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.", "But in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201cEach time, they eventually met with some form of success,\u201d Michael Sulmeyer, a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project, wrote recently in a soon-to-be published paper for the Carnegie Endowment.", "The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic \u201ccommand and control\u201d messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.", "Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia\u2019s cooperation in negotiations over Syria.", "\u201cWe\u2019d have all these circular meetings,\u201d one senior State Department official said, \u201cin which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "So the Russians escalated again \u2014 breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as \u201cdoxing\u201d in the cyberworld.", "It was a brazen change in tactics, moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014, they broadcast an intercepted phone call between Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a little-known American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine, then in political turmoil.", "They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the steal-and-leak strategy. The Open Society Foundation, run by George Soros, was a major target, and when its documents were released, some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members.", "Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot.", "The attacks \u201cwere not fully integrated military operations,\u201d Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.", "The day before the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call.", "With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.\u2019s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.\u2019s computers.", "\u201cNot sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,\u201d said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. \u201cThe D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.\u201d", "No one knew just how bad the breach was \u2014 but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken. A secret committee was immediately created, including Ms. Dacey, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Brown and Michael Sussmann, a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the Department of Justice who now works at Perkins Coie, the Washington law firm that handles D.N.C. political matters.", "\u201cThree most important questions,\u201d Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. \u201c1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?\u201d", "Mr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out \u2014 an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them.", "\u201cYou only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said. \u201cIf the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.\u201d", "The D.N.C. immediately hired CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, to scan its computers, identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch. Within a day, CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia, Mr. Sussmann said.", "The work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.", "Those are CrowdStrike\u2019s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear \u2014 the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for \u201cadvanced persistent threat\u201d \u2014 may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer.", "It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, \u201cexfiltrate\u201d documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes.", "\u201cOnce they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,\u201d said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager.", "Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up \u2014 first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta\u2019s email.", "Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations.", "That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,\u201d he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone.", "To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents.", "In the six weeks after CrowdStrike\u2019s arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives.", "Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak.", "All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.\u2019s chief executive.", "\u201cThis was not a bump in the road \u2014 bumps in the road happen all the time,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cTwo different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.\u201d", "The D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau\u2019s first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick \u201cattribution\u201d formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage.", "\u201cYou have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. \u201cWe need to tell the American public that. And soon.\u201d", "In mid-June, on Mr. Sussmann\u2019s advice, D.N.C. leaders decided to take a bold step. Concerned that word of the hacking might leak, they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the news that the committee had been attacked. That way, they figured, they could get ahead of the story, win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by Russian hackers and refocus on the campaign.", "But the very next day, a new, deeply unsettling shock awaited them. Someone calling himself Guccifer 2.0 appeared on the web, claiming to be the D.N.C. hacker \u2014 and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides.", "\u201cAnd it\u2019s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,\u201d he wrote. Then something more ominous: \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.\u201d", "It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee\u2019s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns.", "Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.\u2019s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a \u201clone hacker\u201d and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers \u201csophisticated.\u201d", "But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter.", "\u201cSurprisingly, he answered right away,\u201d Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. \u201cI asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.\u201d", "That gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well \u2014 and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be.", "Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2.0 had been edited by someone calling himself, in Russian, Felix Edmundovich \u2014 an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky. Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian, generated by what was clearly a Russian-language version of Word.", "When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor\u2019s tone and manner changed. \u201cAt first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.\u201d", "Computer experts drew the same conclusion about DCLeaks.com, a site that sprang up in June, claiming to be the work of \u201chacktivists\u201d but posting more stolen documents. It, too, seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably, the website was registered in April, suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole.", "In addition to what Guccifer 2.0 published on his site, he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications. The steady flow of Guccifer 2.0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6, 12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland, Guccifer released the D.N.C.\u2019s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives, it was insider gold.", "Then WikiLeaks, a far more established outlet, began to publish the hacked material \u2014 just as Guccifer 2.0 had promised. On July 22, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped out 44,053 D.N.C. emails with 17,761 attachments. Some of the messages made clear that some D.N.C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger, Mr. Sanders.", "That was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party\u2019s stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside.", "Mr. Trump, by now the Republican nominee, expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent, and he began to use Twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the WikiLeaks releases. On July 25, he sent out a lighthearted tweet: \u201cThe new joke in town,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that Russia leaked the disastrous D.N.C. e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\u201d", "But WikiLeaks was far from finished. On Oct. 7, a month before the election, the site began the serial publication of thousands of private emails to and from Mr. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager.", "The same day, the United States formally accused the Russian government of being behind the hackings, in a joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Trump suffered his worst blow to date, with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women.", "The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden\u2019s complaint that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s instincts were \u201csuboptimal.\u201d", "\u201cI was just mortified,\u201d Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. \u201cI put my hands over my head and said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.\u2019\u201d Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails.", "Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. \u201cIf you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.\u201d", "The Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming.", "But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming.", "Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin\u2019s government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling.", "In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks\u2019 source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (\u201cFalse. But what is this? Junior high?\u201d) or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. \u201cWikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,\u201d he wrote.", "Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were \u201cintended to interfere with the U.S. election process.\u201d", "\u201cThis is false,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.\u201d", "But asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. \u201cAmericans extensively engaged with our publications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAccording to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.\u201d", "Though Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks\u2019 best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.", "Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy \u2014 political campaigns and independent media \u2014 to his own ends. The media\u2019s appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web.", "\u201cWhat was really surprising to me?\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cI could not believe that reporters were covering it.\u201d", "Inside the White House, as Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea.", "In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim.", "In that case, embarrassing emails had also been released. But the real damage was done to Sony\u2019s own systems: More than 70 percent of its computers melted down when a particularly virulent form of malware was released. Within weeks, intelligence agencies traced the attack back to the North and its leadership. Mr. Obama called North Korea out in public, and issued some not-very-effective sanctions. The Chinese even cooperated, briefly cutting off the North\u2019s internet connections.", "As the first Situation Room meetings on the Russian hacking began in July, \u201cit was clear that Russia was going to be a much more complicated case,\u201d said one participant. The Russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of American politics, and they were masters of \u201ckompromat,\u201d their term for compromising information.", "But a formal \u201cattribution report\u201d still had not been forwarded to the president.", "\u201cIt took forever,\u201d one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system.", "In August a group that called itself the \u201cShadow Brokers\u201d published a set of software tools that looked like what the N.S.A. uses to break into foreign computer networks and install \u201cimplants,\u201d malware that can be used for surveillance or attack. The code came from the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N.S.A., a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar.", "The assumption \u2014 still unproved \u2014 was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in \u201cThe Godfather\u201d where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.", "The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes.", "While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia\u2019s oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options.", "But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president.", "In a series of \u201cdeputies meetings\u201d run by Avril Haines, the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the C.I.A., several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into Mr. Putin\u2019s hands.", "\u201cIf we went to Defcon 4,\u201d one frequent participant in Ms. Haines\u2019s meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, \u201cwe would be saying to the public that we didn\u2019t have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\u201d", "Even something seemingly straightforward \u2014 using the president\u2019s executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers \u2014 seemed too risky.", "\u201cNo one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,\u201d said another participant in the classified meeting. \u201cAny retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.\u201d", "Instead, when Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation\u2019s voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently \u2014 one that turned out not to be an issue \u2014 was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was \u201crigged\u201d and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy.", "Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election \u2014 and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage.", "Ms. Brazile even reached out to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urging him twice in private conversations and in a letter to join her in condemning the attacks \u2014 an offer he declined to take up.", "\u201cWe just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.\u201d", "But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.", "Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America\u2019s own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. \u201cFrankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,\u201d he told reporters.", "But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia\u2019s role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president\u2019s appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony.", "The reference in the statement to hackings on \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by \u201chuman and technical\u201d sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States\u2019 implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country\u2019s role.", "But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified.", "A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate \u201cat the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.\u201d", "Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could \u201cfundamentally alter the election,\u201d he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.", "\u201cHope not,\u201d Mr. Biden responded.", "Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has \u201cgot to be overt. It needs to be seen.\u201d", "A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see it, it\u2019s not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.\u201d", "The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.", "As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking \u2014 the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin\u2019s motive.", "Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump?", "In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals.", "What seems clear is that Russian hacking, given its success, is not going to stop. Two weeks ago, the German intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, warned that Russia might target elections in Germany next year. \u201cThe perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such,\u201d Mr. Kahl said. Now, he added, \u201cEurope is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance, and Germany to a particularly great extent.\u201d", "But Russia has by no means forgotten its American target.

For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets, you can make huge enlargements. Mind you, it\u2019s a particular aesthetic, one that\u2019s most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial, shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape, a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints; or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while, engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white, but now you can find them in color, too.", "One of the easiest ways to order them online is through Parabo Press, which is run by Photojojo, an online photography gear shop, and Zoomin, a photo printing service in Asia.

I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white, and they came out, to my surprise, beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful, careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch.", "Parabo Press is a breeze to use: It\u2019s clean and easy to read, your options are straightforward, and there are no annoying upsells.

The site\u2019s fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls, glass, ceilings, tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco, concrete blocks, brick, unfinished wood, canvas or freshly painted walls).

The grain shows through your photos, which, thematically speaking, seems to make sense for certain subjects, like nature photos taken at, say, the beach or in a park.

I sent the photo to PhotoBarn, a family business that makes its products by hand in a \u201cbarn/warehouse\u201d in Tennessee. The result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas, which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings. The wood was smooth and thick, and the image was crisp with a slight sheen \u2014 a perfect complement to the steel of Tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers.", "For the most part the site is intuitive, though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start. PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas, burlap, and other wood products, like ornaments.

They\u2019re cluttered with too much text and fine print, and they offer so many options \u2014 Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned? \u2014 that if you don\u2019t have a goal in mind before you go in, you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan, how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also, note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead, be sure to select that option (if it\u2019s offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware, too, that it\u2019s not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries, so it can take weeks to get your images back.", "For affordable bulk scans, ScanMyPhotos.com is an old standby (you can read David Pogue\u2019s review on nytimes.com). The company will scan about 1,800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine, Calif.; the cost of sending the photo box to you, as well as the shipping of the box to ScanMyPhotos and back to you again is included in the price. That\u2019s one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around. Other companies charge for shipping photo boxes. I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes, a higher dpi is preferable. ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi. A thumb drive is an additional $15.95 a box.", "To find the best all-around place to scan photos and film, the Wirecutter, a consumer review site owned by The New York Times, researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders.

The company, based in Minneapolis, Minn., offered \u201cthe best combination of price, quality, and turnaround time of any service we tested,\u201d Wirecutter said. I was planning to try the service however, according to the Memories Renewed site, demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months.

Personally, I don\u2019t want machines around my home collecting dust (and fast becoming outdated). So I decided to try the new PhotoScan app by Google Photos. It\u2019s free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone.", "First things first: These are not professional-quality scans.

However if, like me, you have a bunch of travel photos \u2014 landscapes, food, monuments \u2014 that you\u2019re keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when, you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150.", "By and large, PhotoScan is simple and quick, with almost no learning curve. If you try it, just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: Don\u2019t tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said, this is unlikely to be your solution if you want top-notch prints or have thousands of photos to scan.", "Once you get the hang of PhotoScan, using it becomes a repetitive, vaguely Zen-like activity. That is, unless the app crashes, which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed, it took only the tap of a finger to begin again.

Just before I went on a trip to Hawaii last year, I thought it would be fun to get a GoPro camera to record some pool stunts. But when I searched Amazon.com, I noticed a ton of generic \u201caction cameras\u201d that carried many of the same specs as the GoPros, at a steep discount on price. I ended up buying an SJCAM for $75, about half the price of the cheapest GoPro I could find. And you know what? It worked pretty well.", "This is the mixed blessing of cheaper manufacturing. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s much easier to be a hardware start-up than it ever was before, because the Shenzhen ecosystem gives you all the components you need,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, referring to the manufacturing hub Shenzhen, in southern China. \u201cBut that same ecosystem is available to everybody else, too, so setting yourself apart is really tough.\u201d", "You might point out that the SJCAM I purchased lacked some of the finer qualities of a GoPro. Its software wasn\u2019t great, and it didn\u2019t offer customer support. If I were an extreme sports enthusiast, I might have cared about those deficiencies. For years, after all, GoPro managed to do very well among its niche audience of people who ride bikes in the snow while drinking Mountain Dew, or whatever it is you do when you\u2019re Xtreme. Other manufacturers tapped other niches \u2014 there are gadgets for running, hiking, walking and several other sports.", "But Mr. Dawson noted that eventually these companies reach the limit of their natural niche. Every sports enthusiast already has a GoPro \u2014 and that\u2019s when trouble begins. Because I\u2019m more of an extreme Twitter enthusiast than extreme sports guy, and because for me every gadget is essentially just an accessory to my smartphone, the cheaper knockoffs are usually fine for my purposes. This is likely to be the case for you, too.", "There is something sad about this. The gadget marketplace is the great laboratory of new tech. Gadget start-ups feed the entire tech ecosystem with new ideas. It\u2019s thanks to Pebble that we first saw the latent demand for smartwatches, and thanks to GoPro we realized that people really wanted to take videos of themselves doing underwater handstands. Would we ever have had the iPod if a bunch of start-ups in the late 1990s hadn\u2019t braved legal trouble to create portable MP3 players?", "Now gadget riches for start-ups are no longer a regular mix of the tech business.

Partly, it seems, the Chinese corporate tourists are beguiled by the Valley\u2019s dreamlike promises of changing the world and growing filthy rich almost overnight. Nothing too surprising there; in fact, not too different from the Hollywood fare so heavily consumed around the world.", "There\u2019s more to it than that, however. As Mr. Mozur writes, China has many accomplished technology companies, but they struggle with Confucian and Communist traditions of respecting order, consensus and seniority. Their American counterparts, raised on stories of pioneers on the frontier, thrive in a supposed ethos of \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d", "That\u2019s actually a pretty common spirit in places like Shenzhen, where small manufacturers ceaselessly tweak and copy designs, throwing stuff out to the world in hopes it will be a hit. More productively, China has actually exceeded the United States in its creation and use of new mobile technologies.", "Those are the exceptions, and for the most part Chinese tech is pretty slow-moving, particularly in the more government-sponsored areas, like semiconductors.

Many are also watching for how government surveillance may grow under Donald J. Trump, who has chosen Mike Pompeo, who advocates greater surveillance, to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.", "Signal is one of many encrypted messaging services, but it stands out for its uncompromising security and ease of use. The chat service retains virtually no information from users, including messages and address books, on its servers.

It lacks some features of other messaging apps, like the ability to send stickers. And during my tests, the service had some glitches. But adding Signal to your folder of messaging apps is a must in an era when technology companies are collecting more personal information and government surveillance may expand.", "Some people have already cottoned on to this. Signal experienced a 400 percent jump in daily downloads since Mr. Trump won the election, according to Moxie Marlinspike, who founded Open Whisper Systems, the nonprofit that developed Signal. To Mr. Marlinspike, the surge in downloads reflects anxiety among Americans about the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency for personal privacy.", "\u201cTrump has threatened a lot of people and he\u2019s about to be in control of the most pervasive and least accountable surveillance infrastructure in the world,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cA lot of people are justifiably concerned about that.\u201d", "Signal offers end-to-end encryption, meaning a message is scrambled so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient when it is sent from your device, and it remains so when it passes through the app\u2019s server and reaches the recipient.", "When you initiate a conversation with someone on Signal, you and the recipient exchange so-called cryptographic keys. Only the person who receives your message holds the key to decrypt and read it. That means that if a government agency had a wiretapping order for your Signal messages, Open Whisper Systems would not have the key to decipher the messages and would be unable to comply.", "Signal\u2019s technology sets the standard for other messaging services, with its protocol being an open-source system that other companies can freely use. WhatsApp, Facebook\u2019s Messenger and Google embedded Signal\u2019s encrypted messaging system into their own apps this year.", "Even so, security researchers said they preferred Signal over other messaging apps because it was more thorough in protecting users\u2019 privacy. The only information Signal stores about users in its database is the last time someone connected to its server and when a person signed up for Signal. Other messaging apps maintain pieces of personal data on their servers.", "By contrast, while WhatsApp enables Signal\u2019s full encryption by default in messages, there are caveats. WhatsApp may retain some so-called meta data on conversations, including the phone numbers used in an exchange and the times that the messages were sent, according to the company\u2019s privacy policy. WhatsApp also regularly accesses your phone number and contacts list, so the app can provide an up-to-date list of your contacts who use its service to make it easier to message them.", "Google Allo, Google\u2019s new messaging app that leverages artificial intelligence, does not enable Signal\u2019s end-to-end encryption in all its messages by default. Google offers full encrypted messaging only in so-called Incognito sessions, a private mode that must be turned on manually. When you\u2019re not chatting in Incognito mode, Google stores your Allo messages on its server.", "Similarly, Facebook\u2019s Messenger enables end-to-end encryption inside a private chat mode called Secret Conversations. But by default, normal Messenger chats lack that encryption.", "Even though Signal doesn\u2019t record your information, the app still works across devices, like a desktop computer and a mobile device. Messages and contacts\u2019 data are stored directly on users\u2019 devices and synchronized between them.", "Let\u2019s say you already use Signal on your iPhone and want to use it to chat on a Mac (Signal is available as a web app for Google\u2019s Chrome browser for desktop computers). To link the desktop app with your iPhone, you would use the iPhone\u2019s camera to scan a bar code on the Mac web app, which links the two devices together. Then, to get your contacts list and conversations to appear on the Mac, the Mac app pulls your contacts list and messages directly from the iPhone via an encrypted channel, according to Mr. Marlinspike.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit more work, from our perspective,\u201d Mr. Marlinspike said. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than storing all this stuff on a server.\u201d", "Signal occasionally runs into glitches, such as when it comes to synchronizing data between computers and smartphones. In my tests, there were several occasions when Signal messages that were sent or received on my smartphone did not immediately show up inside the desktop app \u2014 though the messages eventually synchronized minutes later.", "Mr. Marlinspike, who is also the former head of security at Twitter, says he encourages people to report bugs so the group can continue to improve the service.", "Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a time; I could not, for instance, use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad. Mr. Marlinspike said it would support multiple mobile devices eventually.", "One last caveat is that Signal isn\u2019t as fun to use as apps like Facebook Messenger, which lets you send stickers and animated GIFs to add color and personality to conversations. Open Whisper Systems said it planned to add these features, noting that GIFs are already supported in the Android version of Signal.", "Still, this is a trivial issue. I\u2019d choose stronger privacy over sending stickers and animations any day.", "There is no logical reason to skip using Signal. The app is free for Android and iOS, and for computers it is a free add-on for the Google Chrome browser. Plus, it\u2019s easy to install and so architecturally secure that you can have the confidence to say whatever you want without fear of being spied on.", "Another benefit is that Open Whisper Systems is a nonprofit that relies on donations and grants, not a business that might eventually have an incentive to share your information with third parties like advertisers.", "That\u2019s not to say Signal should be your only messaging app. You could use it exclusively for sensitive matters, like work-related conversations. Then for casual chats like making plans with friends and loved ones, you could switch to more \u201cfun\u201d apps like Facebook Messenger and send all the stickers you want.", "Probably the biggest thing missing from Signal will be many of your friends. The app isn\u2019t as popular among consumers as other mainstream messaging apps, so hanging out on Signal can feel lonely.

If you squinted, you could mistake it for an Apple Store. That was the point. The exhibit, which Mozilla helped produce, lured people in with the visual language of high-tech consumption. But instead of housing cool new devices, each display contained an artifact or a piece of art intended to school and shock visitors on how much (or little) we know about privacy and data security.", "There was an interactive demonstration on a widely used program called \u201cChurchix,\u201d a facial-recognition tool licensed to churches that records and logs the identities of people entering the premises.

A piece by Mimi Onuoha, \u201cThe Library of Missing Data Sets,\u201d showed a filing cabinet packed with information not readily available online, under headings like \u201cNumber of Mosques Surveilled by F.B.I.\u201d and \u201cN.S.F.W.

My favorite display was a fitness band tied to a metronome, exactly the kind you would use to practice music. Called an UnFitbit, the low-fi hack was intended to help clever individuals goose their daily fitness scores. It seemed cute, the idea that you might want to cheat on how many steps you took in a day, but the display had a darker interpretation: It anticipated a future when insurance rates and health benefits might be tied to such rankings.", "To move through the Glass Room, as the exhibition was called, was to be reminded of the many ways we unwittingly submit ourselves and one another to unnecessary surveillance, with devastating consequences. \u201cA few years ago, everything here would be a \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 episode, but it is real,\u201d says Marek Tuszynski, a founder of the Tactical Technology Collective, which also does privacy and digital rights advocacy work.

Artists\u2019 obsessions with technology are not new, but in the late aughts, the work tended to focus on the possibility of the medium, treating technology like a new tool rather than a sociopolitical framework. Browser hacks scrambled web pages, turning them into distorted images, and Facebook-oriented projects treated the platform\u2019s design as Dadaist.", "\u201cIt was that early millennial era, when the 20-somethings were defining their generation by its use of technology and social media without raising questions about privacy, data or corporate power,\u201d says Joanne McNeil, an artist and a writer who often tackles topics relating to the intersection of art and technology. Her theory is that because many artists \u2014 all of us, really \u2014 were so captivated by the initial promise of the internet, they were blinded to its potential problems. \u201cI think because it was so much a networking tool \u2014 they were friending curators, other artists \u2014 Facebook seemed necessary, rather than an institution to distract or antagonize.\u201d", "In the earlier part of this decade, I myself fell prey to a similar infatuation. Technology impressed me so much that I didn\u2019t consider its implications. I remember once driving in 2007 out to Pacifica State Beach in California and spotting a billboard that advertised a free business directory from Google. Later that day, during a slow spell at the restaurant where I waitressed, I tried it. You dialed GOOG-411, and an automated service located the number you needed \u2014 a hotel, a home, a nail salon \u2014 and dialed it for you. It\u2019s hard to explain how impressive this was back then. Before smartphones and unlimited data plans became ubiquitous, GOOG-411 was an ingenious life saver, especially because it was free (its alternative, dialing 411, sometimes cost $2 or more per request). Google engineers were also using the service to help build a library of human sounds, in order to refine the company\u2019s speech-recognition system. Helping to build a robot seemed unbelievably cool at the time. But that was nearly 10 years ago, before I knew about all the ways in which seemingly innocuous data collection can turn insidious, how programs not so different from that directory have given rise to predictive policing, algorithmic biases and unthinkable privacy breaches.", "Each day, it seems, we now learn about some new way our supposedly locked-down information is being leaked \u2014 as happened recently at Yahoo, which lost control of millions of passwords. Terms of agreement are updated with disturbing details in the fine print. The maker of the note-taking application Evernote, for example, recently sent out a notice to its millions of users that its engineers would be looking at their data to improve its services. Although there was a way to opt out, the company warned that doing so could compromise future services. The outcry against the change forced the company to reconsider.", "Artists now seem to be tangling with and reflecting these dark undertones in their work.

Friends of mine who attended Art Basel in Miami posted photographs of works like the \u201cSocial Security Cameras\u201d by Fidia Falaschetti, a series of security cameras whose outer casings had been replaced with the candy-colored logos of companies like Twitter, Google, Snapchat and Instagram. The cameras were a chilling reflection of our documentation-obsessed times, how our need for validation usurps our desire for privacy and the protection of personal information. Also at Basel was the work of a Shanghai artist who uses the handle Aaajiao, who installed a machine that printed out lists of websites blocked by China\u2019s firewall, reflecting the limits of the online experience in the country.", "And the New Jersey-based artist Sondra Perry recently had an incredible show in the Kitchen, a Chelsea performance space, called \u201cResident Evil\u201d that mixed video-game perspectives with bodycam and news footage that pushed visitors to think about how black bodies survive despite the threats posed by surveillance. Perry told an interviewer that she was invested in understanding how the power structures that govern the internet \u2014 which has essentially become a group of corporations \u2014 was shaping our sense of self and autonomy. \u201cWhen we think that we are trying to express ourselves, and we\u2019re being individuals,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re being individuals within a frame that is primarily to collect our data and sell us stuff.\u201d", "Artists have long urged cultural introspection by creating work that forces awareness of our current political and economic landscape.

I wondered as I continued the interview, with police officers in body armor holding rifles right outside the window, should I crouch down under the table or keep talking? (Ultimately, I called the weekend editor in our Washington Bureau and wrote a breaking news story on the incident.)", "The doorstopper-size history books we read make it seem like much of what happens as the pages turn is a matter of fate. It all had to happen that way, right? My impression is quite different. History, as this story once again illustrates, is marked by a lot of happenstance \u2014 small but consequential acts that ricochet out into the world, writing the narrative in real time as the events unfold."]}

Plato, not the most liberal of men, suggested that the work of storytellers should be carefully examined \u201cand what they do well we must pass and what not, reject.\u201d His purpose was to moralize literature; others, over the centuries, have offered equally noble motives. Ibn Khaldun, the great Arab historian, reported that in the seventh century, when Muslim soldiers invaded Persia, they discovered an extraordinary number of books; wishing to carry them off as loot, they asked Omar bin al-Khattab, second caliph of the Muslims, for permission. Omar\u2019s answer became legendary and was applied to other book destructions: \u201cThrow them in the river! If they hold a guide to the Truth, God has given us a better guide in the Holy Quran. And if they hold nothing but lies, may God rid us of them.\u201d In our own time, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, forced Google and Twitter to remove content objected to by his government or risk blackouts, arguing that \u201cthese regulations do not impose any censorship at all on the Internet. . . . On the contrary, they make it safer and freer.\u201d Morality, truth, civilized society, freedom: All these have been invoked to defend what most people would understand as censorship.", "But what exactly is censorship? This is the question with which Robert Darnton, the foremost historian of the book and the art of reading, begins his enthralling new volume, \u201cCensors at Work.\u201d \u201cRather than starting with a definition and then looking for examples that conform to it,\u201d Darnton writes, \u201cI have proceeded by interrogating censors themselves.\u201d The censors Darnton has interrogated belong to three very different historical settings: the Old Regime in France, British rule in India and the Communist state that existed under the name of the German Democratic Republic from 1949 to 1990. Darnton spoke with the German censors in the flesh, and with the ghosts of the French and British ones through the vast archives they left behind. Thankfully for Darnton, thankfully for his readers, the one incontrovertible fact about censors is that they love paperwork.", "Most historians of censorship, like Fernando B\u00e1ez in his excellent \u201cA Universal History of the Destruction of Books,\u201d assume that the censor\u2019s task has always been to forbid and destroy. Darnton shows that this is not the case. The first period he explores is also that with which he is most familiar, having written numerous books on 18th-century France. He begins by looking at a book printed in Paris in 1722 that carries the \u201capprobation and privilege of the king.\u201d These approbations, as Darnton notes, qualify as censorship because they were \u201cdelivered by royal censors.\u201d", "But rather than what modern readers would expect from a censoring hand, they are something closer to our present-day blurbs. One of these censors, a professor at the Sorbonne, notes: \u201cI had pleasure in reading it; it is full of fascinating things.\u201d Another, a theologian, remarks with obvious delight that a book inspired \u201cthat sweet but avid curiosity that makes us want to continue further.\u201d As Darnton makes clear, censorship under the Bourbon monarchy was not a system of limitations; it was a way of channeling the power of print through the figure of the king and his representatives, asserting royal authority over everything, even the word. Royal censors were not mainly on the outlook for subversive voices: instead, they worked like copy editors, concerned with matters of style, grammar, readability and originality of thought, even going so far as correcting spelling and redoing math. A book approved by the king should not be badly written.", "In the 1750s, the term \u201cbureaucracy\u201d appeared in France to describe the increased reliance of the system on a complex hierarchy of clerks. Bureaucracy both simplified and complicated the job of the censor by requiring the participation of all kinds of other actors in the process of filtering and allotting or denying privileges to books. Darnton traces this system through a web that included not only authors, printers and booksellers, but also peddlers, smugglers and warehouse keepers. As becomes evident, censorship was not a problem that concerned only the intellectuals.", "During the second period explored by Darnton, that of British rule in India, Darnton says, \u201cin principle, the press was free but the state imposed severe sanctions whenever it felt threatened.\u201d He relates the case of a certain James Long, an Anglo-Irish missionary in Bengal, who attempted \u201cto survey everything printed in Bengali between April 1857 and April 1858\u201d in order to help the newly established Indian Civil Service track what was being written. If censorship in 18th-\u00adcentury France manifested itself primarily as a sort of literary criticism, in British India the main impulse seems to have been an obsessive ethnographic curiosity. Long appears to have been driven by an interest in all aspects of the \u201cother\u201d culture \u2014 philology, folklore, religion and Hindu philosophy \u2014 rather than by any concern with seditious plotting against British rule.", "But Long\u2019s interest in Bengali literature led to his downfall. In 1861, he arranged for the publication in English of a melodrama about the oppression of native workers by British planters that he thought might interest the public back home. The planters accused him of libel; Long was found guilty, fined a thousand rupees and sentenced to a month in prison. British law in India upheld freedom of speech, so the authorities needed to employ other means of controlling the spread of possibly subversive voices. The laws against libel and sedition became the British Empire\u2019s censorship tools in the subcontinent.", "In investigating the 40-odd-year rule of Communists in East Germany, Darnton was able to meet censors in person: a man and a woman who worked for the state and had never before met an American. They disliked the word \u201ccensorship.\u201d What they did, they explained, was \u201cplanning,\u201d since in a socialist system literature was \u201cplanned\u201d like everything else. Darnton shows how, behind their bureaucratic activities, lay a complicated tangle of motives \u2014 ideological ones certainly, but also tactical politics and personal revenge. So ingrained was the German censors\u2019 notion of duty to this system that even after the dissolution of the Communist state, they continued to report for work.", "This last example of censorship is, of the three chosen by Darnton, the one that comes closest to the popular understanding of the term. On Nov. 25, 1988, the East German novelist Christoph Hein delivered a daring speech at a congress of the Authors Union in Berlin, urging the abolition of censorship. \u201cThe printing-authorization procedure,\u201d Hein said, \u201csupervision by the state, or to put it briefly and no less clearly, the censorship of publishing houses and books, of publishers and authors, is outmoded, useless, paradoxical, hostile to humanity, hostile to the people, illegal and punishable.\u201d Hein\u2019s words are, in their essence, true at any time in the embattled history of censorship, even today. Considering electronic censorship in China and the unrestricted surveillance of the American National Security Agency, Darnton asks: \u201cHas modern technology produced a new kind of power, which has led to an imbalance between the role of the state and the rights of its citizens?\u201d", "As Darnton clearly shows, the labors of censors affect not only books and their makers, but vast sections of society. There are two possible ways of looking at censorship, he says: a narrow one, concentrating exclusively on the censors\u2019 strategies, and another, more generous one that considers literature \u201cas a cultural system embedded in a social order.\u201d It\u2019s obvious which of the two Darnton believes is the most important.", "CENSORS AT WORK\nHow States Shaped Literature\nBy Robert Darnton\nIllustrated. 316 pp. W.

While the work\u2019s pursuit of newness \u2014 moving parts, mirrored surfaces and glowing lights \u2014 wears thin, the seamless pairing of exhibition and architecture is perfect.

It also suggests that both artists have long been hidden in plain sight: Krasner as the spouse of an art celebrity, Lewis as a black artist whose paintings were more formal than political. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

The evidence is there in this magnificently complex show of art from parts of the Middle East, or as the Met prefers to call it, the Near East, that now include Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. The exchange of materials, ideas and beliefs traced in shipwreck-salvaged objects here speak of a world as globally networked as our own. The wars depicted in Assyrian relief panels are as horrific as those being fought on the same turf today.

Working in Prague for the Holy Roman emperor Rudolf II, Bartholomeus Spranger (1546-1611) painted and drew Mannerist-style allegories involving nude and nearly nude gods and goddesses athletically entwined in anatomically improbable positions. His images were copied by expert engravers and disseminated in immense quantities throughout Europe. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

Concentrating on the four horsemen of the Cubist apocalypse (Braque, Gris, L\u00e9ger and Picasso), it outlines the style\u2019s heady transformation of art while giving the museum a foundation in modernism commensurate with its holdings in other eras.

They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art. What they share is a love for processes and materials and a candid way with the human touch.

The 40-minute movie is an instance of institutional critique, an art genre that tries to expose and subvert the workings of the capitalist art market. Specifically, it\u2019s about the scandalous trade in furniture produced for Chandigarh, the utopian city in northern India designed by Le Corbusier and his team and built between 1951 and 1965.

But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

It includes her underappreciated works on paper alongside sculptural tableaus that combine woodcarving and assemblage (for instance, \u201cThe Family,\u201d a funky nativity scene from 1969 that is dominated by a neon-haloed, heavily bedazzled Virgin). It could have done more, however, to explore her Latin American folk-art influences and Venezuelan roots, which deserve at least as much scrutiny as her ties to American Pop art. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, 212-831-7272, elmuseo.org.

With her vision of a museum connected to various networks and marketplaces, Mrs. Webb affirmed craft \u2014 or \u201cmaking,\u201d or whatever you call it \u2014 as a deeply social activity and a source of economic self-empowerment. 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org.

But in the years around 1940, he must have felt he was living a nightmare. He and his wife of more than four decades separated. He underwent debilitating surgery for cancer. During World War II, he fled south to Nice, only to have that city threatened with bombardment. Through everything, he worked on.

In each case, however, the pieces are by Ms. Sturtevant herself, who spent much of a long career adopting and adapting the art and styles of others to create a body of work entirely her own, one which raises questions about the value of art, about the hows and whys of producing it, and about the degrees to which quasi-replication can be an exercise in flattery, parody, objectivity, originality and love. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

Except for a large picture of his wife, Edith, in a colorful striped dress, Schiele\u2019s works on canvas are dark and turgid. But his drawings are nimble and nuanced.

At just 20 works or so, it\u2019s not exactly comprehensive. It is, however, thoroughly immersive. The installation, in the Rubin\u2019s skylit top-floor galleries, evokes the structure of an Indian temple with a combination of large and small spaces; it has an open central area of paintings, intimate nooks for sculpture and a \u201csanctum\u201d of watercolors.

Philip Johnson and John Burgee were proposing a suave 4.2 million-square-foot ensemble of four skyscrapers that would help \u201cclean up\u201d the surrounding urban squalor, and they favored an open square at the center of their project. The Municipal Art Society protested the proposal by asking for alternatives to replace the Times Tower. The dispute proved a turning point in New York\u2019s urban history and, more broadly, in American architectural history, as the postmodernism of the Johnson towers gave way to a highly eclectic, free-for-all postmodernism devoid of his mansards or triumphal arches. 39 Battery Place, Lower Manhattan, 212-968-1961, skyscraper.org.

He has analyzed different genres of photography and literally dissected cameras and photographed their components. He resumes that project here, with photographs of bisected camera lenses; a professional show rooster depicted in its trained pose; and a half-submerged cooking pan that riffs on cheery product advertisements.

Their making requires labor, capital and a market for distribution. The money might come from foundations, Kickstarter campaigns or retail sales or advertising revenue. The commerce between artist and public is brokered by the traditional culture industry (publishing houses, television networks, record labels and movie studios) and also by disruptive upstarts like Amazon, Netflix, Google and iTunes.

All the news you need about class divisions in Paris and London later in that century can be found in the pages of Balzac, Dickens and Zola. The history of European painting from the Renaissance to World War I is, in large measure, the history of power, wealth and social status. In the 20th century, film, theater and television tell the same story, as comedy, tragedy, thriller and farce. Class consciousness in Depression-era Hollywood ranged from tuxedoed and mink-coated swells in Manhattan penthouses to strikers on the picket line. Postwar Broadway was the kingdom of Willy Loman and Stanley Kowalski, and as television became a fixture of middle-class homes, it chronicled the struggles and aspirations of families \u2014 the Kramdens, the Conners, the Jeffersons, the Simpsons \u2014 trying to achieve or maintain middle-class status.", "And now?

My intention was to conduct a bit of unscientific research, and also to advance a discussion about what art has done and should do at this moment of political impasse, racial tension and economic crisis, which at once resembles earlier such moments and has its own particular character. My questions were simple and far from new. The social responsibility of art has been a topic for debate since the ancients.

When you map a route, you can tap the green location symbol at your starting point and share your location with a friend, spouse or colleague using Glympse, a location-sharing service.", "That\u2019s a nice trick, because when you share your location, people can then track your progress to or from a meeting or location, and know if you\u2019ll be arriving on time.

The navigation interface is big and driver-friendly, unlike Apple Maps, which is littered with small buttons to tap. Speaking of driver-friendly, Nokia\u2019s maps can also warn you about speed limits on various roads.", "I found its navigation accurate and its database of local businesses seemed even more complete than Google Maps.

Lionsgate keeps costs down by taking full advantage of low-cost media like YouTube, by making certain advertising decisions without relying on expensive market research studies and even by shooting its own pictures to save on photography.", "Big studios like Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox release more big-budget movies than Lionsgate does, which is one reason they maintain much larger domestic promotional departments.

Mr. Badshah was soon spending so much time on the logistics of dividing his companies that he felt he was neglecting his customers.", "This was critical at a time when Socedo was moving from being a free product to one that cost $100 to $1,000 a month.

Because Mr. Badshah had personal relationships with his Uptown Treehouse customers, his departure meant that his Uptown team \u201cneeded to work incredibly hard,\u201d he said, to fill the roles he had been playing and to retain clients. The agency landscape is competitive, Mr. Badshah noted, \u201cand our team was very young.\u201d This meant \u201clots of hiring challenges as well as an increase in overhead expenses and a decrease in margins,\u201d he said. Some clients moved away.", "Eventually though, Mr. Bianchi found the right people and developed new offerings for customers who are looking for event and audience marketing through social media.

After President Obama\u2019s video was released, Comcast, the biggest of them all, said that it agreed with almost everything the president called for.", "Alas, the key word in the previous sentence is \u201calmost.\u201d In his video remarks, President Obama was surprisingly specific about what he hoped Wheeler and the F.C.C. would do: apply Title II of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to the I.S.P.s like Comcast, AT&T, Verizon and Time Warner Cable. Title II would reclassify these companies as akin to public utilities \u2014 like the old telephone company \u2014 and would regulate them as such.", "Although the president insisted that many of the more onerous parts of Title II \u2014 like price regulation \u2014 could be held in abeyance, the I.S.P.s dread the thought of being regulated under Title II. They would prefer to be regulated under another part of the Telecommunications Act, section 706, which calls for a lighter touch.", "Then there is the question of what, exactly, net neutrality entails. Does it include only \u201cthe last mile\u201d \u2014 that is, the relationship between the I.S.P. and the Internet user? Or does it also include \u201cinterconnection\u201d \u2014 the point at which a content company like Netflix joins the I.S.P.\u2019s network and begins its journey to the customer? Currently, Netflix pays a fee to four big I.S.P.s to gain uncongested access to their networks. Not surprisingly, Netflix says that net neutrality means it shouldn\u2019t have to pay this fee. Comcast and its I.S.P. brethren disagree.", "One reason federal net neutrality rules have been so difficult to achieve is that in the past, when the F.C.C. has tried to regulate the I.S.P.s without using a Title II designation, it has had its head handed to it in the courts. The courts have essentially ruled that without that classification, the F.C.C. lacks the authority to apply rules that would ensure net neutrality.", "Thus it was that a few weeks ago, The Wall Street Journal published a story reporting that Wheeler had a compromise idea: use Title II to regulate the back end \u2014 the point where Netflix accesses Comcast\u2019s network \u2014 and use section 706 for the front end, where the consumer is. It is generally assumed that the F.C.C. leaked Wheeler\u2019s \u201chybrid\u201d idea as a trial balloon.", "The balloon, however, was quickly burst. Net neutrality advocates didn\u2019t think it went far enough, while the I.S.P.s thought it went too far. At which point, the president decided to weigh in. Wheeler may or may not take the president\u2019s suggestion \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have to, as the F.C.C. is an independent agency \u2014 but, at a minimum, new net neutrality rules, which the agency has been trying to accomplish for a half-dozen years, will be delayed again. And whatever the F.C.C. decides, there will surely be a new round of lawsuits. Sigh.", "Net neutrality is demonstrably a good thing, and it needs to be enshrined in law, not just done in good faith as it is now. The real problem is with the law itself: It was never meant to regulate broadband. Title II is too blunt an instrument, while section 706 doesn\u2019t give the F.C.C. enough authority. That\u2019s why the agency has seemed to be dancing on the head of a pin as it tries to come up with net neutrality rules that will pass muster.", "Of course, there is another way to accomplish net neutrality.

Microsoft is second with about a 10 percent share.", "But there are indications that a pricing war and more focus from competitors could dig into Amazon\u2019s lead. There are even concerns that the unit\u2019s revenue growth has stalled in recent quarters.", "What makes Amazon unique in the fight to own the computing cloud is what it\u2019s not \u2014 a traditional tech company with a long history of providing products and services to business customers. Finding a way to deliver services over the Internet that behave like databases and other traditional software products will be critical to keeping its lead because older tech companies like Microsoft are already capable of doing it.", "Amazon Web Services is banking on help from its customers to make its ambitions work. \u201cNinety percent of our development is deep, sophisticated corporate users telling us what to build next,\u201d said Adam Selipsky, the unit\u2019s vice president for products.", "On Wednesday, the unit announced that in 2014 it had released 442 new products for its global network of computers and software, a 60 percent rise from all of 2013. It later raised that number to 449, including faster ways to write and publish software.", "The lower number \u201cwas so this morning,\u201d said James Hamilton, the enthusiastic executive who oversees the development of A.W.S. \u201cThis is a different world,\u201d said Mr. Hamilton, a veteran of decades in companies like IBM and Microsoft before he joined the unit in 2008. \u201cThe speed is unbelievably different. We don\u2019t slow down as we get bigger.\u201d", "But the unit could face challenges in its efforts. It has already had to deal with embarrassing system failures and changed its policies to suit national governments. Moreover, its parent company, Amazon, has returned less in profits in its 17-year life as a public company than cloud competitors like Google and Microsoft earn in a single quarter. If Wall Street grows tired of Amazon\u2019s continued losses, it could also pinch A.W.S.", "Amazon is not the only big tech company trying to lure businesses to the cloud. Microsoft, Google and IBM are all trying to get business customers to rent their cloud services rather than buy software, servers and networking gear.", "Just a few years ago, public clouds like Amazon\u2019s were considered experimental turf for tech start-ups. Today, companies like Johnson & Johnson, Intuit and General Electric are among the unit\u2019s customers. In the past year, A.W.S. says, the amount of data it stores has grown 137 percent. It sells twice as much of its basic computing as a year ago.", "And analysts believe the pace is picking up across the handful of big tech companies providing cloud services. \u201cTwo years ago, public clouds were maybe 2 percent of all computing workloads,\u201d said Lydia Leong, a senior analyst at Gartner. \u201cNow they are more than 10 percent. By 2018, it will be more than 50 percent.\u201d", "In addition to parading mainstream companies across the stage at its conference, Amazon released a type of database aimed straight at the core business of Oracle, the world\u2019s largest database company.

Although A.W.S. is known mostly for selling basic computing services, he said that future products would include sophisticated software around managing user behavior, software for compliance in regulated industries like finance and migration of existing software running on corporate computers to the cloud.", "By running the customers\u2019 software within their own data centers and listening closely to their needs, cloud companies learn more quickly about customer behavior, figuring out which incremental improvement they can immediately deploy across their networks. And then they can turn around and give those customers exactly what they want.", "At least, that\u2019s what the cloud tech companies like to argue.", "\u201cThe cloud is cheaper, but that isn\u2019t really what is driving companies into it,\u201d said Greg De\nMichillie, the director of Google\u2019s cloud business for corporations. \u201cThey want to be more experimental, faster, data driven.

The result is our top 10 list for every state, which readers have been devouring over the last 24 hours.", "We\u2019re really pleased by the reaction, because it matches our own.

The upper Midwest likes its cookie salad and Snickers salad. The Mountain West, and especially the Mormon West, likes its frog eye salad, which contains no frog but much marshmallow. Delaware likes its pretzel salad.", "We also learned that Jewish apple cake isn\u2019t Jewish.

Now, it has been hit been hit yet again by President Obama\u2019s endorsement of net neutrality. Comcast may have buyer\u2019s remorse, but it may find that ironically, the only way out is to have the F.C.C. block this deal. M.&A. makes strange bedfellows indeed.", "In February, the parties announced a strategic combination of the two companies, with Comcast buying Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion. Comcast was a white knight, outbidding Charter Communications, which had made a hostile bid for Time Warner Cable.", "The F.C.C. has to approve the transaction. To do so, the agency must find that the merger is in the public interest. The F.C.C. can also reject the deal, or it can impose conditions like requiring asset sales or requiring Comcast to share its broadband.", "For many consumers and other interest groups, including competitors, this F.C.C. approval requirement is the waterloo of cable and broadband access. They are out to stop the deal on the grounds that it will make the combined company \u201ca veritable gatekeeper over vast swaths of the nation\u2019s telecommunications industry\u201d as Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, wrote in a letter to the F.C.C. opposing the deal.", "The basis of Mr. Franken\u2019s argument is that the combined entity would control about 35 percent of the wired broadband market, based on Comcast\u2019s figures. Already, the F.C.C. has received more than four million comments (more than the average number of people who watch the Kardashians these days).", "Time Warner Cable and Comcast dispute these arguments by relying on a point made by David L. Cohen, executive vice president and chief diversity officer for Comcast. He said that the two companies \u201cdo not compete for customers in any market and no customer will lose any choice.\u201d Instead, the combined company would be in a better position to square off against the real big competitors like Google, Facebook and their ilk.", "This F.C.C. battle all comes down to whether bigger in and of itself is a problem, and President Obama\u2019s statements only add to the troubles for this deal. Potentially, the F.C.C. could require that the two companies agree to a form of net neutrality as part of the needed regulatory clearance.", "There are two moving parts. The first is whether Comcast wants to complete the deal at all in light of the net neutrality issue. If not, can Comcast get out of the transaction if the F.C.C. approves the deal but then separately adopts a net neutrality rule in a way that would hurt cable and other broadband companies?", "If the F.C.C. adopts Mr. Obama\u2019s view, then Comcast (and other broadband and Internet service providers) could not charge content providers like Netflix an extra fee for fast-lane access to consumers, meaning billions in lost profits for the industry.", "Comcast said in its acquisition agreement that it would do several things to show the F.C.C. that the deal was in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the public. First, Comcast agreed it would divest up to 3 million subscribers to avoid antitrust issues.", "More important, Time Warner Cable got Comcast to agree to do anything that the F.C.C. has ordered in the last 12 years in connection with the approval of other cable systems. The parties estimate that there have been 25 comparable transactions in the past 12 years, and so that gives Time Warner some room to push Comcast based on prior F.C.C. actions.", "The 12-year mark is also important in light of the fact that a group of 30 law professors and economists submitted their own letter, arguing that this combination is similar to the AT&T/MediaOne transaction in 2000. In that case, the Justice Department prevented the merging parties from combining broadband assets that, like the current transaction, would have given them a dominant position in the national market for broadband distribution of content. But that was 14 years ago, allowing it to escape the merger clause.", "The problem is that there is pressure on the F.C.C. to simply halt this transaction. The F.C.C. could demand that Comcast agree to net neutrality as a condition for its approval, but the F.C.C. has never asked for this in any previous cable mergers.", "It means that if the F.C.C. blocks the deal or requires merged Comcast-Time Warner Cable to agree to a net neutrality rule in exchange for approval, Comcast might be able to walk. The parties also deliberately did not include a termination fee in the deal, meaning not only could Comcast walk away, it could do so without paying a dime.", "If the F.C.C. does not act to reject the deal outright or require net neutrality as condition to this deal, then Comcast\u2019s options are limited in terms of fighting any net neutrality rules that would be imposed on all companies.", "This seems like a small difference \u2013 having the F.C.C. impose something on the deal itself rather than on all companies \u2013 but in this case, Comcast would not have a clear out. Instead, Comcast\u2019s best option in this circumstance would be to try to argue that the net neutrality plan was a \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d that did not require it to complete the Time Warner Cable acquisition.", "The material adverse change, or MAC clause, in the agreement states that Comcast is not required to close the merger if something changes to negatively affect Time Warner Cable\u2019s business or results. In this case, having the F.C.C. adopt a net neutrality rule could qualify.", "But just because President Obama says he wants net neutrality doesn\u2019t mean it will happen. The F.C.C. is an independent agency, and it could certainly do something different or refuse to adopt the rule. There needs to be an actual event here, not just the threat of it, to justify a MAC claim.", "Even if the net neutrality plan were a certainty, the acquisition agreement exempts from the MAC any changes in law. However, there is an exception to this exception, and if the change in law had \u201ca materially disproportionate effect\u201d on Time Warner Cable in relation to other companies in the industry, then the clause would be triggered. In plain English, this means that Comcast can only invoke the MAC clause if there is harm to Time Warner Cable that is over and above what other companies generally experience and that harm has an adverse effect.", "Proving the adverse effect in court is hard. A MAC claim has to be long term and significantly impact the company.", "There is no hard and fast rule, but you would need to see Time Warner Cable have a 5 to 10 percent hit to its earnings to begin the analysis and find an adverse effect. Then, you would subtract the general earnings drop for the rest of the industry. And there may not be disproportionate impact if the stock prices of the cable and Internet companies fell largely in tandem.", "Thus, if Comcast does want to get out of the deal based on a MAC claim, it will have a tough time doing so, though the potential of a claim like this may give Comcast leverage to renegotiate the price if the F.C.C. adopts a net neutrality rule.", "If it has buyer\u2019s remorse, Comcast\u2019s best strategy is to wait and see what the F.C.C. imposes on the deal as a condition for approval or whether it tries to outright block the transaction. This means that, despite President Obama\u2019s talk, we are back where we were before \u2013 waiting for the F.C.C. to act."], "https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/11/10/daily-clip-report-59/": ["Good morning.

Not only was their architecture imaginative, so were the ideas behind it: that design could shape civic life; that art and architecture were inseparable; that while Europe and the United States were the cultural powers of the day, South America had a shot at tomorrow. The momentum broke down when a rash of right-wing military coups swept the continent. But the link between art and architecture remained firm and continues to. That\u2019s the subject of this subtle, buoyant think-piece of a show of contemporary work, which extends to an open-air pavilion designed by Terence Gower, set in the lush garden of the Andrew Freedman home across from the museum. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.

Much is tepid and didactic, but some things are amusing. Nobutaka Aozaki makes portraits of people using a black marker to add their distinctive features to the yellow smiley face on plastic shopping bags. In a triptych of video self-portraits that she made in an airplane lavatory, Nina Katchadourian lip-syncs to a Bee Gees song. A video by William Lamson in which at certain points he appears to be standing on the calm surface of the Delaware River has a transcendentalist vibe. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

It examines its subject from several fruitful angles, including unflattering ones, interspersed with excellent labels, relevant objects of art and especially design, clips from famous films and videos both didactic and artistic.

While the work\u2019s pursuit of newness \u2014 moving parts, mirrored surfaces and glowing lights \u2014 wears thin, the seamless pairing of exhibition and architecture is perfect.

It also suggests that both artists have long been hidden in plain sight: Krasner as the spouse of an art celebrity, Lewis as a black artist whose paintings were more formal than political. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

It shows us how Rubinstein adapted Cubism, Surrealism and other avant-garde art and design movements for her personal brand, highlighting new and different standards of beauty and exhorting women to control their own images through makeup and grooming. Mixing biography, business, art, fashion and d\u00e9cor, it recreates rooms from Rubinstein\u2019s salons and reassembles parts of her diverse collection, which included African, pre-Columbian and Oceanic artworks. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

The evidence is there in this magnificently complex show of art from parts of the Middle East, or as the Met prefers to call it, the Near East, that now include Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey. The exchange of materials, ideas and beliefs traced in shipwreck-salvaged objects here speak of a world as globally networked as our own. The wars depicted in Assyrian relief panels are as horrific as those being fought on the same turf today.

Concentrating on the four horsemen of the Cubist apocalypse (Braque, Gris, L\u00e9ger and Picasso), it outlines the style\u2019s heady transformation of art while giving the museum a foundation in modernism commensurate with its holdings in other eras.

They represent a marvelous variety of styles and influences, including Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, classic Chinese traditions and European folk art. What they share is a love for processes and materials and a candid way with the human touch. Most intriguing of all is a curiously clunky small vase by Paul Gauguin, who might have been the George Ohr of European ceramics if he\u2019d stuck with it. 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

The 40-minute movie is an instance of institutional critique, an art genre that tries to expose and subvert the workings of the capitalist art market. Specifically, it\u2019s about the scandalous trade in furniture produced for Chandigarh, the utopian city in northern India designed by Le Corbusier and his team and built between 1951 and 1965.

But even they would probably acknowledge that his early mural \u201cAmerica Today\u201d is the best of its kind, a raucous, cartwheeling, wide-angle look at 1920s America that set the standard for the Works Progress Administration\u2019s mural program and has remained a New York City treasure. Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

It includes her underappreciated works on paper alongside sculptural tableaus that combine woodcarving and assemblage (for instance, \u201cThe Family,\u201d a funky nativity scene from 1969 that is dominated by a neon-haloed, heavily bedazzled Virgin). It could have done more, however, to explore her Latin American folk-art influences and Venezuelan roots, which deserve at least as much scrutiny as her ties to American Pop art. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, 212-831-7272, elmuseo.org.

With her vision of a museum connected to various networks and marketplaces, Mrs. Webb affirmed craft \u2014 or \u201cmaking,\u201d or whatever you call it \u2014 as a deeply social activity and a source of economic self-empowerment. 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 212-299-7777, madmuseum.org.

But in the years around 1940, he must have felt he was living a nightmare. He and his wife of more than four decades separated. He underwent debilitating surgery for cancer. During World War II, he fled south to Nice, only to have that city threatened with bombardment. Through everything, he worked on.

At just 20 works or so, it\u2019s not exactly comprehensive. It is, however, thoroughly immersive. The installation, in the Rubin\u2019s skylit top-floor galleries, evokes the structure of an Indian temple with a combination of large and small spaces; it has an open central area of paintings, intimate nooks for sculpture and a \u201csanctum\u201d of watercolors.

Carl Andre was one of Minimalism\u2019s founders. This career survey of his low-to-the-ground modular sculptures looks terrific in Dia\u2019s sonorous, sunlight-washed spaces.

This spicy, tightly edited midcareer survey starts with her sardonically funny, Ashcan-style pictures of Amazons in revolt from that time. It then moves through the continuously experimental painting and sculpture she has done since, work in which the very definition of portraiture and history painting are exploded.

As GPS and Uber imperil this tradition, is there an argument for learning as an end in itself?", "At 10 past 6 on a January morning a couple of winters ago, a 35-year-old man named Matt McCabe stepped out of his house in the town of Kenley, England, got on his Piaggio X8 motor scooter, and started driving north. McCabe\u2019s destination was Stour Road, a small street in a desolate patch of East London, 20 miles from his suburban home. He began his journey by following the A23, a major thruway connecting London with its southern outskirts, whose origins are thought to be ancient: For several miles the road follows the straight line of the Roman causeway that stretched from London to Brighton. McCabe exited the A23 in the South London neighborhood of Streatham and made his way through the streets, arriving, about 20 minutes after he set out, at an intersection officially called Windrush Square but still referred to by locals, and on most maps, as Brixton Oval. There, McCabe faced a decision: how to plot his route across the River Thames. Should he proceed more or less straight north and take London Bridge, or bear right into Coldharbour Lane and head for \u201cthe pipe,\u201d the Rotherhithe Tunnel, which snakes under the Thames two miles downriver?", "\u201cAt first I thought I\u2019d go for London Bridge,\u201d McCabe said later. \u201cGo straight up Brixton Road to Kennington Park Road and then work my line over. I knew that I could make my life a lot easier, to not have to waste brainpower thinking about little roads \u2014 doing left-rights, left-rights. And then once I\u2019d get over London Bridge, it\u2019d be a quick trip: I\u2019d work it up to Bethnal Green Road, Old Ford Road, and boom-boom-boom, I\u2019m there. It\u2019s a no-brainer. But no. I was thinking about the traffic, about everyone going to the City at that hour of the morning. I thought, \u2018What can I do to skirt central London?\u2019 That was my key decision point. I didn\u2019t want to sit in the traffic lights. So I decided to take Coldharbour Lane and head for the pipe.\u201d", "McCabe turned east on Coldharbour Lane, wending through the neighborhoods of Peckham and Bermondsey before reaching the tunnel. He emerged on the far side of the Thames in Limehouse, and from there his three-mile-long trip followed a zigzagging path northeast. \u201cI came out of the tunnel and went forward into Yorkshire Road,\u201d he told me. \u201cI went right into Salmon Lane. Left into Rhodeswell Road, right into Turners Road. I went right into St. Paul\u2019s Way, left into Burdett Road, right into Mile End Road. Left Tredegar Square. I went right Morgan Street, left Coborn Road, right into Tredegar Road. That gave me a forward into Wick Lane, a right into Monier Road, right into Smeed Road \u2014 and we\u2019re there. Left into Stour Road.\u201d", "We were there, on Stour Road. It was a cold day, with temperatures hovering just above freezing, and snow in the forecast. For McCabe, on his bike, the wind chill made it feel considerably colder. He was dressed for the weather: a thermal shirt, a sweater, an insulated raincoat, Gore-Tex pants pulled over his jeans, gloves, work boots, a knit cap under his motorcycle helmet. McCabe is a tall man, about 6-foot-2, and he is solidly built, like a central defender on a soccer team. He\u2019s handsome, with a wide smile and blond hair. He speaks in short sentences, snappy and definitive, especially when talking about London. We were in Hackney Wick, an industrial area adjacent to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, where the 2012 Olympic Games were held. Stour Road sits in a particularly remote corner of the neighborhood \u2014 a few wind-lashed streets, lined with warehouses, hemmed in by canals and a highway flyover.", "\u201cThey call this area Fish Island,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a fisherman, but many of the roads here are named for fishes \u2014 freshwater fishes, I believe. So just here you\u2019ve got Bream Street.\u201d He gestured down a road where a lumberyard was set back behind a corrugated metal fence. \u201cFollow that to the end, you\u2019ll come to Dace Road. You\u2019ve got Roach Road. All names of fishes.\u201d", "McCabe had spent the last three years of his life thinking about London\u2019s roads and landmarks, and how to navigate between them. In the process, he had logged more than 50,000 miles on motorbike and on foot, the equivalent of two circumnavigations of the Earth, nearly all within inner London\u2019s dozen boroughs and the City of London financial district. He was studying to be a London taxi driver, devoting himself full-time to the challenge that would earn him a cabbie\u2019s \u201cgreen badge\u201d and put him behind the wheel of one of the city\u2019s famous boxy black taxis.", "Actually, \u201cchallenge\u201d isn\u2019t quite the word for the trial a London cabbie endures to gain his qualification. It has been called the hardest test, of any kind, in the world. Its rigors have been likened to those required to earn a degree in law or medicine. It is without question a unique intellectual, psychological and physical ordeal, demanding unnumbered thousands of hours of immersive study, as would-be cabbies undertake the task of committing to memory the entirety of London, and demonstrating that mastery through a progressively more difficult sequence of oral examinations \u2014 a process which, on average, takes four years to complete, and for some, much longer than that. The guidebook issued to prospective cabbies by London Taxi and Private Hire (LTPH), which oversees the test, summarizes the task like this:", "To achieve the required standard to be licensed as an \u201cAll London\u201d taxi driver you will need a thorough knowledge, primarily, of the area within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross. You will need to know: all the streets; housing estates; parks and open spaces; government offices and departments; financial and commercial centres; diplomatic premises; town halls; registry offices; hospitals; places of worship; sports stadiums and leisure centres; airline offices; stations; hotels; clubs; theatres; cinemas; museums; art galleries; schools; colleges and universities; police stations and headquarters buildings; civil, criminal and coroner\u2019s courts; prisons; and places of interest to tourists. In fact, anywhere a taxi passenger might ask to be taken.", "If anything, this description understates the case. The six-mile radius from Charing Cross, the putative center-point of London marked by an equestrian statue of King Charles I, takes in some 25,000 streets. London cabbies need to know all of those streets, and how to drive them \u2014 the direction they run, which are one-way, which are dead ends, where to enter and exit traffic circles, and so on. But cabbies also need to know everything on the streets. Examiners may ask a would-be cabbie to identify the location of any restaurant in London. Any pub, any shop, any landmark, no matter how small or obscure \u2014 all are fair game. Test-takers have been asked to name the whereabouts of flower stands, of laundromats, of commemorative plaques. One taxi driver told me that he was asked the location of a statue, just a foot tall, depicting two mice sharing a piece of cheese. It\u2019s on the facade of a building in Philpot Lane, on the corner of Eastcheap, not far from London Bridge.", "If you go to LTPH headquarters, where the examinations are conducted, you will behold a grim bureaucratic scene, not much different than the one you might find in an office devoted to tax audits: nervous test-takers, dressed in suits, shuffling into one-on-one sessions with stone-faced examiners. But for more than a century, since the first green badge was issued to a hackney cabman piloting a horse-drawn carriage, the test has been known by a name that carries a whiff of the occult: the Knowledge of London.", "The origins of the Knowledge are unclear \u2014 lost in the murk of Victorian municipal history. Some trace the test\u2019s creation to the Great Exhibition of 1851, when London\u2019s Crystal Palace played host to hundreds of thousands of visitors. These tourists, the story goes, inundated the city with complaints about the ineptitude of its cabmen, prompting authorities to institute a more demanding licensing process. The tale may be apocryphal, but it is certain that the Knowledge was in place by 1884: City records for that year contain a reference to 1,931 applicants for the \u201cexamination as to the \u2018knowledge\u2019 [of]\u2026principal streets and squares and public buildings.\u201d", "In 2014, in any case, the Knowledge is steeped in regimens and rituals that have been around as long as anyone can remember. Taxi-driver candidates \u2014 known as Knowledge boys and, increasingly today, Knowledge girls \u2014 are issued a copy of the so-called \u201cBlue Book.\u201d This guidebook contains a list of 320 \u201cruns,\u201d trips from Point A to Point B: Manor House Station to Gibson Square, Jubilee Gardens to Royal London Hospital, Dryburgh Road to Vicarage Crescent, etc. The candidate embarks on the Knowledge by making these runs \u2014 that is, by physically going to Manor House Station and finding the shortest route that can be legally driven to Gibson Square, and then doing the same thing 319 more times, for the other Blue Book runs.", "But the Knowledge is not simply a matter of way-finding. The key is a process called \u201cpointing,\u201d studying the stuff on the streets: all those places \u201ca taxi passenger might ask to be taken.\u201d Knowledge boys have developed a system of pointing that some call \u201csatelliting,\u201d whereby the candidate travels in a quarter-mile radius around a run\u2019s starting and finishing points, poking around, identifying landmarks, making notes. By this method, the theory goes, a Knowledge student can commit to memory not just the streets but the streetscape \u2014 the curve of the road, the pharmacy on the corner, the mice nibbling on cheese in the architrave.", "Decades ago, most Knowledge boys did their runs on bicycles. Now, nearly all test-takers buy or lease motorbikes. In 2014, there are thousands of men and women plying the city\u2019s streets on two wheels, at all hours, in all weather, doing runs and gathering points. It\u2019s a ubiquitous London sight: a Knowledge boy on a bike, with a map or notepad strapped to his Plexiglas windscreen. When the candidate has completed his 320 Blue Book runs \u2014 and his accompanying 640 quarter-mile radii point-gathering expeditions \u2014 he will have covered the whole of central London. At which time he takes a brief written exam, proceeds to the first stage of the oral examination process, and the test begins in earnest.", "The testing takes place at the LTPH office in a series of \u201cappearances,\u201d face-to-face encounters between Knowledge candidate and examiner. The test-taker is asked to \u201ccall a run\u201d: to identify the location of two points and to fluidly recite the shortest route between the points, naming all the streets along the way. A Knowledge boy is first given 56 days between appearances to study; then, as he progresses, 28 days, and 21. The questions, meanwhile, get harder, with candidates asked to locate more obscure points and to recite longer, more byzantine journeys across London\u2019s byways. Each appearance consists of four runs, and each run is scored according to an elaborate numerical system. Your total score earns you a letter grade, from AA to D. (AA\u2019s are exceedingly rare; D\u2019s aren\u2019t.) Candidates who acquire too many bad grades are bumped backward \u2014 \u201cred-lined\u201d from appearances every 28 days back to every 56 days, or from 21s to 28s. There is no such thing as \u201cfailing\u201d the Knowledge. You can either quit, or persevere and pass: proceed all the way through to the end of your 21-day appearances, gaining sufficient points to earn your \u201creq\u201d \u2014 to meet the \u201crequired standard,\u201d and complete the test.", "For Matt McCabe, that goal was within spitting distance. He was \u201con 21s, on six points,\u201d making appearances just three weeks apart, with six points on his tally, and only six more needed \u2014 just two solid appearances, perhaps, away from getting his req.", "It was a pointing mission that brought McCabe to Fish Island that morning in January. He\u2019d visited the neighborhood before, but had heard that a new point had come up in a candidate\u2019s appearance a couple of days earlier. So he\u2019d returned to take another look at the area \u2014 in particular, at H. Forman & Son, a wholesale fishmonger on Stour Road.", "\u201cForman\u2019s is quite famous,\u201d McCabe said. He was standing outside the H. Forman & Son warehouse, a shedlike structure the size of a small airplane hanger. \u201cThey supply fish to the top restaurants in London. But now they\u2019ve opened their own restaurant.\u201d McCabe scrutinized the menu posted on a wall outside the building. He took a note on a small pad: \u201cChef: Lloyd Hardwick.\u201d Hardwick, McCabe discovered by checking Google, had been the executive chef at the sleek restaurant on the top floor of the Tate Modern museum. \u201cYou have to look into these things. You know, the examiner could turn around and say, \u2018Name me two Angela Hartnett restaurants,\u2019 or \u2018Name me four Gordon Ramsay restaurants.\u2019 \u201d McCabe showed me a sign indicating that the restaurant also housed an art gallery. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to note that. Instead of Formans restaurant, the examiner might give you Forman\u2019s Smokehouse Gallery. That could be enough to throw you off.\u201d", "McCabe said: \u201cThis is an up-and-coming area. It looks like nothing, you know \u2014 but you put a bit of paint on the brickworks, smarten the place up, and all of a sudden it becomes a spot for little boutique stores or the up-and-coming D.J.s. You\u2019ve got warehouse conversions; you\u2019ll see guys coming out of the buildings in the morning \u2014 suit-and-tie, briefcase. If you\u2019re driving a cab, you could pick someone up in the City at the end of the day heading back this way.\u201d", "McCabe had spent his entire professional life in the building trade. He\u2019d worked alongside his father, an electrical engineer, and then as the owner of his own small firm specializing in roof maintenance, steel work and asbestos removal. He liked the work, but it was grueling \u2014 15-hour days, seven days a week \u2014 and the \u00a350,000 ($80,000) he took home wasn\u2019t enough, to his mind, to justify the sacrifices. A job as a taxi driver seemed an attractive alternative. London cabbies are self-employed businessmen who set their own schedules. The metered fares of taxis are high, and drivers keep what they earn. The overhead \u2014 the cost of gas and of owning or leasing a taxi \u2014 can be steep, but cabbies who put in the hours can make a good living. There are no official statistics, but drivers themselves will tell you that London cabbies can earn around \u00a365,000 per year, about $100,000, while maintaining an enviably flexible schedule. As a cabbie, McCabe figured, he could work seven, 10, 15 days straight \u2014 and then take four days off to spend time with his wife Katie, a hairdresser, and their children, Archie, 4, and Lulu, 3. He sold his engineering outfit and devoted himself full-time to the Knowledge, living off the savings he\u2019d gained from the sale of his business.", "It was now 37 months since he\u2019d paid the \u00a3525 enrollment fee to sign on for the test and appearances. \u201cThe closer you get, the wearier you are, and the worse you want it,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying all this baggage. Your stress. Worrying about your savings.\u201d McCabe said that he\u2019d spent in excess of \u00a3200,000 on the Knowledge, if you factored in his loss of earnings from not working. \u201cI want to be out working again before my kids are at the age where someone will ask: \u2018What does your daddy do?\u2019 Right now, they know me as Daddy who drives a motorbike and is always looking at a map. They don\u2019t know me from my past, when I had a business and guys working for me. You want your life back.\u201d", "The Knowledge is notorious for snatching away lives, and for putting minds in a vise grip. \u201cEverything becomes about the Knowledge,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cMy wife will be talking to me about plans or the kids, and it\u2019s not even registering what she\u2019s saying. Because all I\u2019m thinking is, \u2018I can\u2019t turn right into that road in Hammersmith, can I?\u2019 If you read the paper, or watch the news or a film, you\u2019re looking at the background. \u2018Oh, I know that road there.\u2019 \u201d", "McCabe said that he dreamed about the Knowledge: sometimes exhilarating visions of zooming through London streets, more frequently nightmares about unfamiliar roads or disastrous LTPH appearances. Often, McCabe would wake in the middle of the night and hurry downstairs to study the map. In his dining room, there were three maps: two jumbo London street plans \u2014 one laminated on the dinner table and one tacked to the wall \u2014 and an enlarged view of the W1 postcode, the bustling zone which stretches south from Marylebone to Piccadilly and east to Soho. McCabe had ledgers he\u2019d filled with jottings on topics like \u201cSmall and Awkward Squares.\u201d There were also flashcards that McCabe had made up, listing a point on one side (\u201cTooting Mosque, SW17\u201d) with information about its location and navigation on the other (\u201cGatton Road, one way, access via Fishponds Road\u201d). McCabe stacked the cards in piles of 300; he had 40,000 in all. His home, he said, had become a library of the Knowledge.", "But book-learning gets you only so far. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out on the bike,\u201d McCabe said. When he was doing Blue Book runs, McCabe would ride the streets all night, leaving when his wife got home from work at 9 p.m. and returning at 4 in the morning. Pointing, McCabe told me, can be \u201cvery cold, very lonely, very dangerous.\u201d One night, McCabe was out pointing on his motorbike when a driver slammed into him from behind. McCabe went over the roof of the car, but suffered just a few scrapes and bruises. The bike was totaled. \u201cI\u2019m stationary in the filter lane, and the car just came around the bend and hit me,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThis was on a road called Pound Lane. Right across from the fire station at the corner of Harlesden Road.\u201d", "As McCabe progressed through the Knowledge, his pointing technique had become more refined. \u201cAt the beginning you might go to the Savoy Hotel on the Strand,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a famous point; everyone knows it. But you start to think: What\u2019s a more obscure point on the Strand? So you\u2019ll pick up the Coal Hole Public House a few doors along. You start looking at George Court and find a little bar called Retro, a gay bar that plays \u201980s music. You start thinking about the bits and pieces. I\u2019m at the stage now where I\u2019m looking at a new bar that just opened \u2014 inside a cinema. I\u2019m picking up handbag shops, bowling alleys. You learn to kind of savor them little gems.\u201d", "It is tempting to interpret the Knowledge as a uniquely British institution: an expression of the national passion for order and competence, and a democratization of what P. G. Wodehouse winkingly called the feudal spirit, putting an army of hyperefficient Jeeveses on the road, ready to be flagged down by any passing Bertie Wooster. But the Knowledge is less a product of the English character than of the torturous London landscape. To be in London is, at least half the time, to have no idea where the hell you are. Every London journey, even the most banal, holds the threat of taking an epic turn: The guy headed to the corner newsagent makes a left where he should have gone right, blunders into an unfamiliar road, and suddenly he is Odysseus adrift on the Acheron. The problem is one of both enormity and density. From the time that London first began to spread beyond the walls surrounding the Roman city, it kept sprawling outward, absorbing villages, enlarging the spider-web snarl of little roads, multiplying the maze. Take a look sometime at a London street map. What a mess: It is a preposterously complex tangle of veins and capillaries, the cardiovascular system of a monster.", "All metropolises are quirky, but in most of them efforts have been made to mitigate the idiosyncrasies, to make the cities legible, navigable, beautiful. In Manhattan and Chicago, planners tamed chaos with gridded street schemes; Baron Haussmann obliterated twisty medieval Paris with his sweeping grands boulevards, transforming the city into a linked chain of vistas, plazas and parks. London, though, makes no sense. It was the capital city of the greatest empire in history, yet it doesn\u2019t look or feel imperial. There are miles of monotonous ugliness, disrupted not by splendor, but by gentility \u2014 the pretty whitewashed homes and stately squares in the well-heeled districts of West and North London. St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral sits at the back of a small semicircular plaza that is pinned-in by the office towers and bendy streets of the financial district. It is difficult to get a decent view of the most beautiful building in town.", "The genius behind St. Paul\u2019s, the architect Christopher Wren, nearly became London\u2019s Haussmann. Just days after the catastrophic Great Fire of 1666, Wren produced a plan to rebuild London as an Italian-style city, with wide boulevards that terminated in piazzas and raised stone quays. But the plan never gained traction. The explanation usually given is economic: If Chicago is an expression of American pragmatism, and Paris an ode to symmetry, then London is a monument to English mercantilism and love of private property, to the power of the bourgeois freeholders and shopkeepers, who clung too tightly to their little patches of land to permit the clearing of space for Wren\u2019s plan. In London, lucre trumps grandeur.", "The result is a town that bewilders even its lifelong residents. Londoners, writes Peter Ackroyd, are \u201ca population lost in [their] own city.\u201d London\u2019s labyrinthine roadways are a symbol \u2014 and, perhaps, a cause \u2014 of the fatalism that hangs like a pea-soup fog over the Londoner\u2019s consciousness. Facing the dizzying infinitude of streets, your mind turns darkly to thoughts of finitude: to the time that is flying, the minutes you are running late for your doctor\u2019s appointment, the hours ticking by, never to be retrieved, on the proverbial Big Clock, the one even bigger than Big Ben. You can see it every day in Primrose Hill and Clapham, in Golders Green and Kentish Town, in Deptford and Dalston. A nervous man, an anxious woman, scanning the horizon for a recognizable landmark, searching for a street sign, silently wondering \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \u2014 a geographical question that grades gloomily into an existential one.", "Which is where the Knowledge comes in. It is a weird city\u2019s weird solution to the riddle of itself, a municipal training program whose graduates are both transit workers and Gnostics: chauffeurs taught by the government to know the unknowable.", "If you follow your London A-Z Street Atlas halfway up Caledonian Road, in Islington, you\u2019ll find Knowledge Point, the largest of London\u2019s 10 schools dedicated to the test. The school occupies a nondescript two-story building, but you can\u2019t miss it: At all hours of the day, Knowledge boys\u2019 motorbikes line the sidewalk out front. For several years in the 1990s, there was something else parked alongside the bikes: the steed of a mounted Metropolitan Police officer, who did the Knowledge on horseback, after, and during, his working hours.", "The school offers specialized lectures on dozens of topics: \u201cHotels Outside Central London,\u201d \u201cSouth West London Turnarounds,\u201d \u201cBarracks & Military Establishments,\u201d \u201cLambeth & Waterloo.\u201d Pupils pick up trade secrets, the aides-m\u00e9moires and acronyms that have been passed between generations of Knowledge boys. There\u2019s \u201cCat Eats Well Then Shares Her Beef Gravy,\u201d a mnemonic denoting a path north from the Aldwych \u2014 the crescent-shaped road that loops above the Strand \u2014 along a sequence of one-way streets: Catherine, Exeter, Wellington, Tavistock, Southampton, Henrietta, Bedford, Garrick. To access C.A.B. \u2014 the Chelsea, Albert, and Battersea bridges \u2014 you take C.O.B.: respectively, Chelsea Bridge Road, Oakley Street and Beaufort Street. A series of streets running north to south through Soho \u2014 Greek, Frith, Dean, Wardour \u2014 are Good For Dirty Women.", "But the majority of a student\u2019s time at Knowledge Point is spent in two cramped rooms on the school\u2019s ground floor, where maps are arranged on flat tables and angled easels. These rooms are devoted to \u201ccalling-over\u201d: sitting with a partner, taking turns reciting runs, in an effort to replicate the conditions of oral examinations at the LTPH office. Anytime you step into Knowledge Point you will find students, faces pinched in concentration, calling-over runs in the specialized jargon mandated by Knowledge examiners. A skilled caller \u2014 a \u201cwoosher,\u201d in Knowledge slang \u2014 can sound like a slam poet or a rapper, whipping off street names and turnings in a pleasing syncopated rhythm as he races through London streets in his mind\u2019s eye: Leave on the right Lillie Road, left Eardley Crescent, left Warwick Road, forward Holland Road, comply Holland Circus, leave by Uxbridge Road, forward and right Shepherd\u2019s Bush Green. More often, what you will hear at Knowledge Point is the sound of strain: groans, hems and haws, cursing.", "Matt McCabe had been coming to Knowledge Point since he started on the test. A stickler for routine, he arrived each morning at 8:45. When the doors opened at 9, he would sit down across a table from his call-over partner, Steven Vine. I met McCabe and Vine at Knowledge Point one morning and watched them call-over. They spent hours switching off, settling into a patter of run-calling punctuated by mumbled expletives and other exclamations: \u201cgood pull\u201d (when you correctly identify a tricky point), \u201cbad drop\u201d (when you forget a point or road that you should know), \u201cnice line\u201d (when your call sketches a nice straight path across the map).", "To call-over effectively is to find a golden mean between geography and geometry. The aim is not just to navigate cleanly, naming the right roads, but to make the shortest and most elegant line between points. While McCabe called-over a run, Vine followed along, tracing his partner\u2019s route with a marker on the laminated map. When McCabe finished, he and Vine stretched a ball-bearing chain over the map to assess the straightness of his call. This practice is known as \u201ccottoning the run,\u201d a phrase that dates to the days when Knowledge boys would use lengths of cotton twine to measure their runs. \u201cThey have a saying, \u2018Don\u2019t let the cotton strangle you,\u2019 \u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder: Don\u2019t get too tied up in having the perfect line. You\u2019re always trying to calculate: \u2018Which one would look the prettiest on the map?\u2019 But sometimes you just gotta let it flow.\u201d", "The London landscape throws up constant impediments to the ideal of traveling in a straight line: parks, railway yards, one-way streets. The Thames presents another challenge. Because the area below the river is referred to as South London, most people assume that the dozen central London bridges spanning the water stretch north-to-south. In fact, the Thames\u2019s flow is meandering; in places, the river crossings run along the opposite axis. (A Knowledge boy mnemonic instructs: \u201cEast to West, Lambeth or Westminster Bridge is best.\u201d) At Knowledge Point, McCabe leaned over the map and pointed to the King\u2019s Road in Chelsea. \u201cIf you were going from here, say, all the way out to Canary Wharf, you might cross the river twice to make it the shortest line. So you might run it across Westminster Bridge and bring yourself back across Tower Bridge. That will be a straight line, because you\u2019re understanding the bends in the river.\u201d", "At his late stage of the test process, McCabe found himself facing a novel problem: too much Knowledge. \u201cLondon now feels very small. At the beginning, you would be standing in Piccadilly and someone says to you, \u2018Take me to Kilburn,\u2019 and you would say: \u2018Oh my God, that feels miles away.\u2019 Now, I can take you endless amounts of ways. And that\u2019s the dilemma you\u2019ve got now: you see too many options.\u201d", "Seeing, for a Knowledge candidate, is everything \u2014 at its heart, the Knowledge is an elaborate exercise in visualization. When McCabe called-over, he closed his eyes and toggled between views: picturing the city at street level, the roads rolling out in front of him as if in a movie, then pulling the camera back to take in the bird\u2019s eye perspective, scanning the London map. Knowledge boys speak of a Eureka moment when, after months or years of doggedly assembling the London puzzle, the fuzziness recedes and the city snaps into focus, the great morass of streets suddenly appearing as an intelligible whole. McCabe was startled not just by that macroview, but by the minute details he was able to retain. \u201cI can pull a tiny little art studio just from the color of the door, and where it\u2019s got a lamppost outside. Your brain just remembers silly things, you know?\u201d", "The brains of London taxi drivers have attracted scholarly attention. Eleanor Maguire, a neuroscientist at University College London, has spent 15 years studying cabbies and Knowledge boys. She has discovered that the posterior hippocampus, the area of the brain known to be important for memory, is bigger in London taxi drivers than in most people, and that a successful Knowledge candidate\u2019s posterior hippocampus enlarges as he progresses through the test. Maguire\u2019s work demonstrates that the brain is capable of structural change even in adulthood. The studies also provide a scientific explanation for the experiences of Knowledge students, the majority of whom have never pursued higher education and profess shock at the amount of information they are able to assimilate and retain.", "Historically, taxi driving has been a white working-class industry, dominated by East Londoners: first, the Irish, and later, cockneys and Jews. For a century at least, the London black taxi has been a vehicle of upward mobility, steering a path into the middle class. Today\u2019s Knowledge candidates include a new generation of London strivers. At Knowledge Point, there are nearly as many black and brown faces bent over maps as white ones, and in the clamor of voices calling runs you hear a variety of accents \u2014 South Asian, West African, Caribbean \u2014 mingling with the broad vowels and glottal stops of Estuary English.", "The students are united by shared suffering, and by a common adversary. For a Knowledge boy, the LTPH examiners have a kind of mythic status, inspiring a mixture of fear, resentment and awe. Appearances are highly ritualized. Candidates heed longstanding Knowledge traditions, wearing suits and ties to appearances and addressing the examiners formally. McCabe said: \u201cIt\u2019s: \u2018Yes, sir, three bags full, sir.\u2019 You can sit in there and before you\u2019ve even done anything, you\u2019ve said \u2018sir\u2019 15 times.\u201d", "Examiners insist that the formality is important, designed to inculcate a professional code and to prepare future cabbies for the ornery London public. But there is also humor, of a sort, in the testing room. For generations, Knowledge examiners have seized on the poetry of London nomenclature to craft cheeky runs: Snowman House to the ICE Train, Hamlet Gardens to the Globe Theatre, the Eye (the giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the Thames) to the Nose (a tiny sculpture, reputedly modeled on Lord Nelson\u2019s nose, embedded in Admiralty Arch). One examiner, Tony Swire, likes to quiz candidates about their lives and use that information to concoct runs, off the top of his head, that flaunt his own vast London Knowledge. When Swire learned that Matt McCabe\u2019s wife was a hairdresser and that his children were named Archie and Lulu, he gave McCabe a run from the Mayfair salon of celebrity hairstylist John Frieda, the ex-husband of Scottish pop singer Lulu, to Archie Street, a tiny dead-end road in Bermondsey.", "At Knowledge Point, McCabe explained the quirks of various examiners. There was Mr. Gunning, who favors runs with difficult strictures: He likes to impose road closures, or to ask candidates to do runs while steering clear of streets with traffic lights. Ms. Gerald, one of two women examiners, specializes in runs with lots of novel points. \u201cThere\u2019s another examiner, Mr. Hall,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tricky one. They have a nickname for him. Everyone calls him the Smiling Assassin.\u201d", "David Hall is, in fact, quick with a smile. He\u2019s 53 years old and bald-headed. He wears rimless glasses and dark suits and ties. I met him one afternoon at the LTPH office. He was sitting at the desk where he conducts examinations, with a large London map and various notes spread out in front of him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t so bad in here, is it?\u201d he said. He nodded slightly towards the area down the hall where Knowledge candidates wait to be called in for appearances. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe everything you hear.\u201d", "Hall knows what it\u2019s like to sit on the other side of the examiner\u2019s desk. Like all examiners, he is a cabbie, a Knowledge graduate with many years of taxi-driving on his CV. He left school at age 16, and got a job in the confectionery department at Harrods before becoming an electronics engineer. At age 27, he decided to try for a career as a cabbie. Hall had a keen sense of direction and had always loved maps. He passed the Knowledge in less than two years.", "Hall became an examiner in 2008, and soon developed the reputation that earned him the Smiling Assassin moniker: He was a kind man, with a warm, welcoming manner, who asked very difficult runs. It is common knowledge among test-takers that Hall supports Crystal Palace, the football team based in South East London, and that he lives somewhere nearby. He is known, and feared, for giving vexing South London runs. Matt McCabe had Hall in two appearances, when he was on his 28s. McCabe said: \u201cHe\u2019s fair, but very hard. He\u2019ll take you from Kensington or Chelsea and he\u2019ll get you to run it down to Peckham or to Dulwich. He\u2019ll put you in the dilemma: Do I take Vauxhall Bridge or Battersea Bridge? He\u2019s very technical. And he\u2019s very into South London.\u201d", "Hall is also known for doing his homework. Examiners have to burnish their own Knowledge to keep a step ahead of examinees, reviewing road closures and traffic patterns, and, in their spare time, hitting the streets to pick up new points. Hall is a dedicated pointer. When I told a Knowledge boy that I was planning to interview Mr. Hall, he said: \u201cI heard he went out pointing on Christmas Day.\u201d", "One afternoon, I met Hall outside Palestra House, the office tower in Southwark that houses LTPH. He was carrying a digital voice recorder and a clipboard with notes and maps, which he\u2019d drawn himself. We walked north, crossing the Millennium Bridge, which links the South Bank of the Thames with the City of London, and then turned east, following the thrumming traffic along Queen Victoria Street. At a corner, Hall started scribbling notes. \u201cYou have to work out: How do the roads go? Is Queen Victoria Street curving there? Is Friday Street going north? At the end of Friday Street \u2014 yep, you\u2019ve got a forced left with a blue arrow. A Knowledge candidate needs to take a mental picture of the road or the arrow there.\u201d Hall drew an arrow on his map, indicating the forced left.", "Just west of the intersection, on the north side of Queen Victoria Street, stood an elegant old church, with a spire that jutted above the surrounding buildings. Hall said: \u201cThat\u2019s St. Nicholas Cole Abbey. It\u2019s a Wren church. In fact, the church predated Wren by several centuries, but it was destroyed in the Great Fire, and Wren rebuilt it. That\u2019s a point I\u2019ll ask occasionally\u2014 I have done before. I\u2019m very fond of City of London churches.\u201d", "It is said that the Knowledge is as much about learning history as learning your way around. After completing the Knowledge, Hall undertook a years-long course of study to earn the \u201cblue badge\u201d of an official London tour guide. While Hall strolled around the City pointing \u2014 logging road works and making notes about new restaurants and bars \u2014 he led me on an impromptu walking tour: more Wren churches, medieval livery companies and guild halls marked with elaborate coats of arms, the Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers, the Innholders Hall, a carved likeness of Winston Churchill\u2019s face in the center of a clock above the doorway of an office building. Toward evening, we made our way back along Queen Victoria Street, passing a massive three-acre building site, the future home of Bloomberg L.P.\u2019s European headquarters. The construction project had revealed further remains of the Temple of Mithras, a Roman ruin first discovered in 1954. The temple once stood on the banks of the Walbrook, a now-buried river that brought fresh water to Roman Londinium. Hall said: \u201cIn the religion practiced here, they used to have seven ordeals. If you were a Roman soldier, one of the ordeals was to put you over a fire pit. If you could withstand that particular ordeal, you went to the next stage in that religion.\u201d", "Hall said: \u201cThe thing about London is, it\u2019s forever changing. The old city is preserved, of course, but there\u2019s always a new city coming forth. There really is no end to the Knowledge. It\u2019s infinite.\u201d", "The test-takers of a century ago who tottered their way to the Knowledge on bicycles earned a heady reward: not just a green badge, but something close to a guaranteed living. Today\u2019s Knowledge candidates are banking on that pattern holding, but history seems to be veering in a different direction. These days, a person can walk into the LTPH office and, with relatively minimal effort, acquire a license to drive one of London\u2019s nearly 60,000 minicabs, a fleet that vastly outnumbers the approximately 25,000 black taxis. Minicab drivers do not have to demonstrate familiarity with London; an applicant is merely required to pass a background check and take a \u201ctopographical test.\u201d Minicabs can also offer cheaper fares than taxis, whose metered pricing schemes are strictly regulated.", "For years, the black taxi industry has decried minicabs as an inferior service that poaches business rightfully belonging to Knowledge graduates. But many consumer advocates regard minicabs as a welcome corrective \u2014 a reasonably priced alternative to black taxis, whose hefty fares are beyond the reach of most Londoners. (A 2013 survey by the travel website TripAdvisor deemed London\u2019s taxis the world\u2019s most expensive, with an average cost per trip of \u00a327, about $43.)", "In theory, there are rules in place that offer advantages to traditional London cabbies: Theirs are the only rides that can legally be hailed on the street. But times are changing, and curbside hailing may soon be as quaint a relic of old London as the clubman striding through Mayfair in his bowler hat and boutonniere. Recently, the London taxi trade has been roiled by the rise of Uber, the smartphone app-based ride-sharing company. On June 11, thousands of drivers staged a one-hour-long \u201cstrike,\u201d gridlocking streets to protest what they view as Uber\u2019s illegal evasion of London\u2019s metering laws. The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, a black-cab advocacy group, has brought a series of lawsuits against Uber drivers. But at the demonstration, the cabbies\u2019 anger was directed less at Uber, per se, than at Transport for London and Boris Johnson, London\u2019s mayor, whom taxi drivers regard as a zealous deregulator, friendly to big business at their expense. (At the rally, cabbies held placards that read: \u201cUber: Under Boris Exempt from Regulation.\u201d)", "In his public statements on the matter, the mayor has walked a fine line. \u201cLondon\u2019s black-cab trade is crucial to the fabric of the city,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere must, however, be a place for new technology to work in harmony with the black cab, and we shouldn\u2019t unnecessarily restrict new ideas that are of genuine benefit to Londoners.\u201d Others are less hedging. In July, Forbes ran an editorial by staff writer John Tamny, extolling Uber as a \u201cdisrupter\u201d of the taxi business and casting London\u2019s cabbies as pass\u00e9: \u201cJust as automation, free trade and general economic progress have allowed us to shed previously important skills such as sewing, farming, and yes, addition/subtraction, so does it allow us \u2014 indeed, it requires us \u2014 to shed once-relevant knowledge. . . . As for London, the GPS has, much to the chagrin of some cabdrivers with telegraphic memory, rendered their knowledge of one of the world\u2019s great cities largely irrelevant.\u201d", "Taxi drivers counter such claims by pointing out that black cabs have triumphed in staged races against cars using GPS, or as the British call it, Sat-Nav. Cabbies contend that in dense and dynamic urban terrain like London\u2019s, the brain of a cabbie is a superior navigation tool \u2014 that Sat-Nav doesn\u2019t know about the construction that has sprung up on Regent Street, and that a driver who is hailed in heavily-trafficked Piccadilly Circus doesn\u2019t have time to enter an address and wait for his dashboard-mounted robot to tell him where to steer his car.", "Such arguments may hold for a while. But given the pace of technological refinement, how long will it be before the development of a Sat-Nav algorithm that works better than the most ingenious cabbie, before a voice-activated GPS, or a driverless car, can zip a passenger from Piccadilly to Putney more efficiently than any Knowledge graduate? Ultimately, the case to make for the Knowledge may not be practical-economic (the Knowledge works better than Sat-Nav), or moral-political (the little man must be protected against rapacious global capitalism), but philosophical, spiritual, sentimental: The Knowledge should be maintained because it is good for London\u2019s soul, and for the souls of Londoners. The Knowledge stands for, well, knowledge \u2014 for the Enlightenment ideal of encyclopedic learning, for the humanist notion that diligent intellectual endeavor is ennobling, an end in itself. To support the Knowledge is to make the unfashionable argument that expertise cannot be reduced to data, that there\u2019s something dystopian, or at least depressing, about the outsourcing of humanity\u2019s hard-won erudition to gizmos, even to portable handheld gizmos that themselves are miracles of human imagination and ingenuity. London\u2019s taxi driver test enshrines knowledge as \u2014 to use the au courant term \u2014 an artisanal commodity, a thing that\u2019s local and homespun, thriving ideally in the individual hippocampus, not the digital hivemind.", "You could also call the Knowledge the greatest tribute a city has ever paid to itself, a love letter more ardent than \u201cI \u2764 N.Y.\u201d or anything else a Chamber of Commerce might cook up. The Knowledge says that London is Holy Writ, a great mystery to be pored over, and that a corps of municipal Talmudists must be delegated to that task. To the extent that the mystifying clich\u00e9s hold \u2014 that taxi drivers are London\u2019s singers of songlines and fonts of folk wisdom, carrying not just the secrets of London navigation but the deep history of the city and its streets \u2014 the disappearance of the Knowledge would be an assault on civic memory, a blow, if you will, to historic preservation. Smartphone apps and Google Maps may ensure that Londoners will never again be lost in their own city, but if the Knowledge disappears, will something of London itself be lost \u2014 will some essence of the place vanish along with all those guys on mopeds, learning the town\u2019s roads and plumbing its depths?", "Like most cabbies and Knowledge boys, Matt McCabe worries about the future of the taxi business. But in January 2013, he had more pressing concerns. A few days after his visit to Fish Island, McCabe went on an appearance and scored a B, leaving him with 10 points, just two shy of his goal. Barring a calamity, a brain-freeze, it seemed a foregone conclusion that his next appearance would be his last.", "Three weeks later, on a Friday, McCabe rose, as usual, early, with his children, and went through a routine he\u2019d established over many months. He made sure he was cleanly shaven, that his shoes were polished, his suit pristine. He took the train into London, disembarked at London Bridge station, and walked to the LTPH office at a measured pace, trying to keep his heart-rate steady. He arrived with time to spare and took his seat in the waiting area with a dozen or so other Knowledge candidates.", "At around 2 p.m., McCabe\u2019s name was called, and he was ushered into the office of a man he\u2019d never met before. David O\u2019Connor is a veteran examiner with a reputation as a hard marker. McCabe knew that O\u2019Connor liked to test whether candidates had been getting around on the bike, and liked to give runs that worked the center of the map.", "McCabe sat down and breezed through his first three runs. He was nervous, but his calls, he thought, were solid. Surely it was a done deed now? For the session\u2019s final run, O\u2019Connor asked McCabe to take him from the Sun and Doves to Emirates Stadium. McCabe closed his eyes. He could see the Sun and Doves: It was a pub on the corner of Coldharbour Lane and Caldecot Road, down in Camberwell. Of course he knew Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal, the Premier League football team. McCabe said: \u201cSun and Doves, Coldharbour Lane. Emirates Stadium, it\u2019s Drayton Park. That\u2019s the North Bank entrance.\u201d O\u2019Connor nodded: the Knowledge boy had identified the points correctly. McCabe closed his eyes again, to make sure he saw the line clearly. Then he called the run:", "Leave on the right, Coldharbour Lane\nLeft into Denmark Hill\nForward Camberwell Road\nForward Walworth Road\nComply Elephant and Castle\nLeave by Newington Causeway\nForward Borough High Street\nForward over London Bridge\nForward into King William Street\nForward Lombard Street\nForward Bank Junction\nForward Prince\u2019s Street\nForward Moorgate\nForward Finsbury Pavement\nForward Finsbury Square\nForward City Road\nComply Old Street roundabout\nLeave by City Road continued\nRight Provost Street\nRight Vestry Street\nLeft into East Road\nForward New North Road\nForward Canonbury Road\nComply Highbury Corner\nLeave by Holloway Road\nRight Drayton Park\nSet down on the left", "It was a nearly seven-mile-long journey, due north, from Camberwell to Holloway, in Islington, north-central London. When McCabe finished the call, he and O\u2019Connor sat in silence for what seemed to McCabe an eternity. Finally, O\u2019Connor stood up and extended his hand. He said: \u201cWell done, Matt. Welcome to the club. I\u2019m pleased to say that you\u2019re now one of London\u2019s finest.\u201d It was the first time in the more than three years McCabe had been coming to LTPH that an examiner had called him by his first name.", "\u201cIt was an emotional moment,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt was hard to hold back the tears. Three years of complete financial stress, family stress \u2014 studying for 13 hours a day, seven days a week. Suddenly, the whole thing was very casual. It was quite, you know, \u2018Sit back, relax, loosen your tie.\u2019 And then Mr. O\u2019Connor was telling me what to expect doing the job. He was giving me his inside knowledge after being a London cabbie for, like, 20-odd years.\u201d McCabe went home to his family. He and his wife, Katie, ordered take-out from a Thai restaurant, put on loud music, and danced around the house with their children. When the kids went to bed, the McCabes drank a few beers and dismantled the Knowledge library: stored the flashcards and pages of notes, took the maps off the wall. Katie, McCabe said, \u201ccried for about two days solid.\u201d", "McCabe has been driving a taxi for just over a year and a half. He is still new at the job, relatively speaking; in London cabbie lingo, he\u2019s a \u201cButter Boy\u201d \u2014 but a boy, a recent Knowledge graduate. He has the leanings of a traditionalist, though. Many cabbies today are opting for new minivan-style Mercedes taxis, or cabs decorated with \u201cfull wrap-liveries,\u201d advertisements in eye-popping hues. McCabe owns a TX4 Elegance, a car with the classic London black cab look. \u201cI like the iconic shape,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, if you\u2019re gonna be a London cabbie, that\u2019s what you should be driving.\u201d", "In June, McCabe took part in the demonstration against Uber. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be the best in the world, and trying to stay competitive as well. And, you know, the way Uber seems to operate in London \u2014 when it\u2019s quiet, they do the work for next to nothing, when it\u2019s busy, the rates are three times dearer than a London cab.\u201d For now, McCabe is making a good living. \u201cThe rewards are there. You have to do the hours. I mean, a normal day for me is a 12-hour day.\u201d", "He said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done is a trade. A minicab driver, an Uber driver \u2014 they won\u2019t do the undertaking I done. They won\u2019t put in the three years.\u201d", "\u201cI had a gentleman in the cab recently,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cHe told me that a couple of nights earlier he\u2019d been eating in a restaurant in Chelsea, and the Uber car turned up. He said, \u2018We want to go to Wapping.\u2019 And the driver said, \u2018Where\u2019s Wapping? Is it in London?\u2019 And it\u2019s, like, a massive borough. He\u2019s never heard of it! So, I picked this guy up. He said, \u2018Wapping.\u2019 I went, \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Kennet Street.\u2019 I went, \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 He got in the back, and we were off. And he told me, \u2018That\u2019s why I\u2019m reverting back to London cabs.\u2019 \u201d", "McCabe said, \u201cThe moment a person tells me at the window where they want to go, we\u2019re going. There\u2019s no mucking about. I want to get you from A to B as quickly as possible. Because as nice as the person may be, I want to get them in and out. So I can get the next person in the back of the cab, and I\u2019m earning more money.\u201d", "McCabe is still doing the Knowledge, after a fashion. He\u2019s embarked on the three-year course to become a licensed London historian \u2014 an official tour guide, like David Hall. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated with the quirky little bits of London history,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cThe famous lamps at the Savoy. The secret tunnels that link up to St. James\u2019s Palace.\u201d", "When he\u2019s in his cab, McCabe keeps his eyes peeled for another London curiosity: the Knowledge examiners, his erstwhile tormentors, now colleagues, who may be out driving their own taxis, or gathering new points. Each workday, McCabe makes his way into the city\u2019s center via South London, guiding his taxi through the streets that have flummoxed many a Knowledge boy attempting to call one of Mr. Hall\u2019s runs.

But beyond that, as James Stimson, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, argues in his book \u201cTides of Consent,\u201d the questions asked in exit polls are rarely useful for understanding why someone voted the way that they did. \u201cWhat we observe,\u201d he argues, \u201care mainly post hoc rationalizations.\u201d", "Consider one example. John McCain won more than 90 percent of the vote in Wisconsin in 2008 among voters who said having \u201cthe right experience\u201d was the most important trait in a candidate. It might seem from this statistic that Mr. McCain dominated among voters who were looking for an experienced candidate.", "However, it\u2019s just as plausible that voters who chose Mr. McCain for other reasons (such as party loyalty) were echoing one of his campaign\u2019s primary themes back at pollsters. Why would McCain voters choose \u201cbring[ing] about needed change\u201d as the most important candidate trait to them? Change was one of Barack Obama\u2019s main themes in that election; choosing it would make little sense. (Not surprisingly, Mr. Obama dominated among those who chose \u201cchange\u201d as the most important trait.) In cases like this, exit polls can\u2019t distinguish between the factors that determine people\u2019s votes and rationales they construct after the fact.", "Another problem is that people\u2019s reports about their intentions or motivations may not correspond to the factors that have the most influence on the outcome, especially in the most important districts or states. In 2010, for example, Democrats actually won the House vote among exit poll respondents who said health care was the most important issue to them \u2014 a finding that might seem to suggest that the issue helped the party.", "However, research I conducted with the political scientists Eric McGhee, John Sides, Seth Masket and Steven Greene found that votes for the Affordable Care Act were uniquely damaging to the electoral fortunes of Democrats in 2010 and may have cost them control of the House. Its effects appeared to be concentrated among members in competitive districts \u2013 precisely the legislators who were most vulnerable to defeat.", "Finally, people may simply not be honest about their actions or aware of the factors that influence them. For instance, one analyst concluded that \u201crace was not a decisive factor\u201d in the 2008 election because Mr. Obama led Mr. McCain by a similar margin among those exit poll respondents who said race was an important factor in their vote and those who said it was not. In fact, the best estimate (constructed from anonymized Google search data by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a Times contributor) suggests that racial animus cost Mr. Obama approximately four percentage points of the national vote in 2008 (and in 2012 as well).", "What data, then, should we use instead? The best approach we have in empirical social science is to examine this election \u2014 along with past ones \u2014 and see what factors are the best predictors of outcomes we care about like vote shares and seats in Congress. It\u2019s the same method used early in an election cycle by Leo and other forecasting models that make predictions based on the so-called fundamentals.

Now installed at the Met in a reconstruction of its original setting (a boardroom at the New School for Social Research), it captivates with period details (from the cut of a flapper gown to the mechanics of a blast furnace) and timely signs of socioeconomic and environmental distress (exhausted coal miners and hands reaching for coffee and bread). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.

The Municipal Art Society protested the proposal by asking for alternatives to replace the Times Tower. The dispute proved a turning point in New York\u2019s urban history and, more broadly, in American architectural history, as the postmodernism of the Johnson towers gave way to a highly eclectic, free-for-all postmodernism devoid of his mansards or triumphal arches. 39 Battery Place, Lower Manhattan, 212-968-1961, skyscraper.org.

The first banner ads \u2014 those long rectangular ads at the top of a web page \u2014 looked innocent enough; a half-dozen spots for a variety of large companies, including AT&T, Volvo and Zima, they made their debut on HotWired, the web offshoot of Wired Magazine, on Oct. 27, 1994. People who took part in their creation say the first banners were a resounding success, garnering adulation from readers and advertisers.", "But their success birthed a monster that went on to swallow the web whole and has created two decades of havoc. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a prank that was played by the technology industry on the media industry 20 years ago,\u201d said Chris Dixon, a technology investor at the firm Andreessen Horowitz who has long lamented the reach and permanence of the banner ad.", "These days, finally, the banner ad is in decline. That is because the web, the medium in which it has thrived, is also in decline. Today we live in a mobile, social world, spending most of our time online using apps that load faster and are much prettier and more useful than websites.

More than that, banner ads perverted the content itself. Because they are so ineffective, banner ads are sold at low prices for high volume, which means to make any money from them, sites need to pull in major traffic. This business model instilled the idea that page views were a paramount goal of the web, thus spawning millions of low-rent, me-too sites bent on getting your click.", "Finally, there is privacy. Behind just about every banner ad is a vast infrastructure designed to track your movements across the web to improve the effectiveness of ads that, according to several studies, most of us never view anyway.", "The history of the banner ad is a cautionary tale for today\u2019s hot start-ups. It is a story of what happens when you try to monetize an invention too quickly, before it has gained a wide enough foothold with an audience to create a sustainable, symbiotic business model.", "It also illustrates the snowballing dangers of new technology: Once an innovation becomes marginally accepted, its early success can quickly mushroom into dominance, even if pretty much everyone agrees that it is no good.", "\u201cSome of us keep trying to say that we weren\u2019t really serious about putting these teeth-whitening ads next to your beautiful news stories,\u201d Mr. Dixon said. \u201cWe keep trying to say that we should try something else.

So advertising became the only option, and the banner ad was a natural shape to fill early browsers.", "Mr. Anker said that after the first ads ran, he closely watched other sites to see if they would adopt banners. Within a few months, most rivals did. Soon banners became not just a format accepted by advertisers, but something closer to a technical standard.", "In Silicon Valley, a new \u201cad tech\u201d sector emerged to track, serve and measure the effectiveness of ads.

There were exceptions \u2014 the text ads that Google placed beside search results became a blockbuster business \u2014 but most sites had no choice but to finance themselves with banners, even long after it became clear that banners were only marginally effective. Advertisers were forced to make banners in standard sizes and formats because that was what most websites were running; sites chose to run such banners because that was what most advertisers were paying for.", "Even entrepreneurs who understood the dangers of banners gave in to them.

The ads are hardly perfect. Many critics, myself included, have warned that they pose a danger of erasing the distinction between sponsored and unsponsored messages online.", "And regardless of the rise of native ads, many in the ad world say that banners will stick around.", "But if native ads do become the de facto standard of online advertising, they will be a major improvement over banner ads. Both technologically and aesthetically, they do not sit apart from the content with which they appear. This makes them far less annoying to users. An ad for Levi\u2019s on Instagram looks just as pretty as a photo from your friends.

He has not provided details about a new approach, but legal experts say it is based on several ideas that law professors, technology companies and public interest groups have been debating since the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January struck down the commission\u2019s previous rules, which the court said improperly applied telecommunications regulations to broadband service. The most straightforward solution would be to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service and issue rules that prohibit phone and cable companies from giving preference to some Internet content.", "Broadband providers will, of course, fight reclassification tooth and nail. They say they can be trusted to treat all data fairly. But companies like Verizon and AT&T have previously said, in court hearings and public statements, that they do want to strike deals with businesses like Google to deliver their content faster to consumers.", "To avoid that political battle, Mr. Wheeler and his staff appear to be considering a hybrid approach that would regulate high-speed Internet service in two parts, as described in an April letter to the commission from Tejas Narechania and Tim Wu of Columbia Law School. A broadband carrier would be providing a lightly regulated information service when a consumer uses its network to send, say, emails or requests to Netflix for movies. But when a content provider like Netflix sends data to the consumer, that transmission would be classified as a telecommunications service, subject to far stricter regulatory oversight.", "This still leaves lots of unanswered questions. For example, would a hybrid approach leave consumers with fewer protections than businesses like Netflix and YouTube would have? Would exemptions from the rules be granted to broadband companies for particular services, like video gaming? And would any new rules apply to agreements like Netflix\u2019s recent deals to pay Comcast, Verizon and AT&T to directly connect its streaming movie system to their networks?", "A hybrid approach, if done right, could be promising. Ultimately, how well it would protect an open Internet and consumers would depend on the commission\u2019s being willing to issue rules that limit the power of the broadband giants."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/gift-from-ballmer-will-expand-computer-science-faculty-at-harvard/": [], "https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/when-a-teacher-is-arrested-for-child-pornography-students-will-talk/": ["\u201cCan I ask a question about Mr. W?\u201d 10-year-old Brennan asks, and my stomach takes a roller-coaster dip.

Twenty percent of companies that are supposed to comply with the law, meanwhile, still don\u2019t offer paternity leave, according to the 2014 National Study of Employers by the Families and Work Institute.

Though men who want to be more involved fathers are probably more likely to take leave in the first place, she found that even after controlling for fathers\u2019 commitment levels, those who took significant leaves were more likely to do hands-on child care later.", "In her study with Ms. Nepomnyaschy, which analyzed 10,000 children in the United States, they found that fathers who took two or more weeks of leave were significantly more likely to do tasks like diapering, feeding, dressing and bathing later on. Fathers who took less than two weeks, however, were often no more likely to be involved than those who took none at all.", "The biggest beneficiaries of all this diaper-changing by fathers, perhaps, are mothers.", "One of the clearest ways to bolster women\u2019s participation in the labor force, economists say, is to involve men more at home, for the simple reason that women are more able to work outside the home when they are not doing all the child care.

A majority of women take the full four months of maternity leave.", "At Ernst & Young, about 95 percent of employees who have babies take some amount of time. But 90 percent of new fathers at the firm still take only two to three weeks, not six. Most mothers get three months, and nearly all take the entire time.

The study found that when a man\u2019s co-workers took paternity leave, it increased the chance that he would take it by 11 percentage points \u2014 and that if his brother took it, by 15 points. Co-workers might share information about costs and benefits, like how their bosses reacted to paternity leave, and the effect snowballs over time as the information spreads.", "Public policy can also shift cultural norms over time.

The secret of his homosexuality was revealed when he was arrested on indecency charges in 1952, caught up in a Cold War climate of homophobia and political paranoia and subjected to the pseudoscientific cruelty of the British judicial system.", "All of this is a lot for a single movie to take in, and \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d directed by Morten Tyldum from a script by Graham Moore, prunes and compresses a narrative laid out most comprehensively in Andrew Hodges\u2019s scrupulous and enthralling 1983 biography. The film interweaves three decisive periods in Turing\u2019s life, using his interrogation by a Manchester detective (Rory Kinnear) as a framing device. Turing tells the investigator \u2014 who thinks he is after a Soviet spy rather than a gay man \u2014 about what he did during the war. Later, there are flashbacks to Turing\u2019s school days, where he discovered the joys of cryptography and fell in love with a slightly older boy named Christopher Morcom.", "The adult Turing is played by Benedict Cumberbatch (his younger self is Alex Lawther), expanding his repertoire of socially awkward intellectual prodigies, real and fictional. What has made Mr. Cumberbatch so effective as Sherlock Holmes and Julian Assange \u2014 and what makes his Alan Turing one of the year\u2019s finest pieces of screen acting \u2014 is his curious ability to suggest cold detachment and acute sensitivity at the same time. If he did not exist, 21st-century popular culture would have to invent him: a sentient robot, an empathetic space alien, a warm-blooded salamander with crazy sex appeal.", "His Turing, whom the film seems to place somewhere on the autism spectrum, is as socially awkward as he is intellectually agile. He can perceive patterns invisible to others but also finds himself stranded in the desert of the literal. Jokes fly over his head, sarcasm does not register, and when one of his colleagues says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get some lunch,\u201d Turing hears a trivial statement of fact rather than a friendly invitation.", "\u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d derives some easy amusement from the friction between this \u201codd duck\u201d and the prevailing culture of his native pond. The film\u2019s notion of Britain \u2014 not inaccurate, but also not hugely insightful \u2014 is as a land of understatement, indirection and steadfast obedience to norms of behavior that seem, to a fiercely logical mind like Turing\u2019s, arbitrary and incomprehensible. At Bletchley Park, the country estate where teams of linguists and mathematicians are working under military supervision to break Enigma, he is seen as stubborn and arrogant.

Turing\u2019s sexuality is mystified and marginalized, treated as an abstraction and a plot point. There is no sense that, between his chaste, intense and brief passion for Christopher and the anonymous encounter that led indirectly to his arrest, love, sex or romance played any significant part in Turing\u2019s life at all. Mr. Hodges\u2019s biography, threaded with quotations from Walt Whitman, gives eloquent and sensitive testimony to the contrary. For their part, the filmmakers, though willing to treat Turing as a victim of bigotry and repression, also nudge him back toward the closet, imposing a discretion that is at once self-protective and self-congratulatory. It\u2019s not that we need to see him having sex \u2014 the PG-13 rating must be protected, I guess \u2014 but that a vital aspect of his identity and experience deserves more than a whisper and a wink.", "The film\u2019s sexual politics may be musty and retrograde, but in other respects, it is very much a document of the present.

It is thrilling and strange to hear the words \u201cdigital computer\u201d uttered a half-century before any such thing existed, and when Turing says \u201cthink differently,\u201d it is impossible not to hear a grammatically fastidious premonition of the once-ubiquitous Apple advertising slogan.

It not only provides an origin myth for the digital age, but it also projects the ideology of the present back into the past. Turing, an eccentric visionary stuck in an organization that is bureaucratic, hierarchical and wedded to tradition, is an apostle of innovation. Commander Denniston lectures him about the importance of \u201corder, discipline and chain of command\u201d for the war effort, but the solving of Enigma decisively rebuts this old-fashioned notion. The strategic acumen of generals and the tactical valor of soldiers is incidental. What won the war was data, and the heroes were the tech guys (and the one woman) who worked late, snacked freely, fiddled with crossword puzzles and geeked out over a piece of hardware that looked like a giant toy. Hut 8 at Bletchley Park serves as a prototype for the corporate campuses of Apple, Google and Facebook.", "Just a few years ago, this film might have felt radical and counterintuitive, like a daring, inspired leap from one era to another, or an excavation of the hidden history of the present.

For example, in Paris at Le M\u00e9ridien \u00c9toile near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, rooms at Christmastime are $149 a night on Travelzoo.com and include an upgrade and a 20 percent discount on food. In Rome, at the Berg Luxury Hotel, near the Via Veneto, you can book a room on Travelzoo through Christmas Day for $126 a night for two-night stays (or $113 a night for three nights or more). Rates include an upgrade, daily breakfast for two, a bottle of wine and discounts at the bar.", "\u201cThe big secret for both Thanksgiving and Christmas is it is absolutely true that airfare is more expensive but hotels are a lot cheaper,\u201d said Sarah Gavin, a senior editor at Expedia.", "Travelers who waited until December last year to book a hotel room saved about $60 a night compared with those who booked a room in August through October, according to research by Hipmunk.com.", "Alas, flights to Europe from the United States are not as affordable.

You have to factor in incidentals like the cost of checking bags. And multiple stops, which can make flights cheaper, may also ruin a trip because you\u2019re gambling with winter weather. Opt for southern connection points: Dallas, not Chicago. And be sure to leave plenty of time to make a connecting flight; in certain airports you may have to go through security upon landing.", "To see if the first leg of your flight is likely to arrive on time, check FlightAware, which lists performance history. \u201cYou can see flights on-time over a four-month period,\u201d Mr. Hobica said.", "Airfares and hotel room rates are typically lower during the week. And fly early, when many families are home sleeping. \u201cTake the 5:30 or 6 a.m. flight,\u201d Ms. Gavin said, \u201cbecause so many people are traveling with kids. You can get much better deals on those flights than a 9 or 10 a.m. departure.\u201d", "You can also get a deal by flying on a holiday. On Thanksgiving, fares can be 30 percent below average for domestic flights and 15 percent below average for international flights, according to research from Kayak.com.

Here they are, in case you want to think along with me: Vance Bell, O3, Vius, Prager Microsystems, 8-11 and Hypno. One caveat: Most of these companies\u2019 sites looked different a year ago, and several wouldn\u2019t make my list in their current form.", "I used each site\u2019s contact page to get in touch. Some of them were brief, and some had long sequences of questions I found annoying. In each case, if I could, I included a link to my request for proposal. It took me most of an afternoon to submit to all of the sites.", "Because we sell conference tables \u2014 an expensive, customized product \u2014 to people who find us using search, I was eager to see how these web designers responded to my inquiry and how their responses would compare with our own sales methods. The first thing I noticed was that after I hit \u201csend,\u201d I got a boilerplate email from every company acknowledging the submission. And then? Nothing.", "In my own operation, we try to respond to incoming emails with a phone call from a salesman within one minute of receipt. Yep, one minute or less. We\u2019ve learned that this is our best chance to catch buyers while they are focused on shopping and before they get distracted. It also demonstrates that we want to be easy to work with.", "None of the design firms got back to me that fast. But the first to respond, 8-11, did so by email within two hours of my submission. In fact, three people from that firm emailed me separately and invited me to call. I responded by email and set up a call for noon the next day.", "More responses arrived the next morning. The owner of Prager Microsystems called and set up a meeting for that afternoon. An O3 salesman sent an email saying his company would not be a good fit and recommending another firm (I looked at that firm\u2019s work and found cheap, boilerplate sites). The owner of Vius sent an email apologizing for not responding the previous day and scheduled a visit to our shop for the following week. Vance Bell sent me an email saying he would review my proposal and get back to me. I never heard from him again. I never heard anything from Hypno.", "My first real interaction was with 8-11. The company put three people on a conference call but let the sales guy do the talking. It was like listening to an auctioneer: an uninterrupted stream of buzzwords that went on for 20 minutes. Somewhere in the verbiage was a description of their process and their ability to work with multiple platforms. After that, while the salesman was catching his breath, the owner came on and asked whether I\u2019d be interested in coming downtown to see their offices. I demurred and asked whether they would like to come see me. Not really. But they said they would submit a proposal within the next 10 days. I said I\u2019d be happy to review it.", "An hour later, the owner of Prager Microsystems was sitting in my office. We started talking about the project, and his questions and comments were directly related to the issues I\u2019d listed in my proposal. He seemed very familiar with Google AdWords, as well as with search-engine optimization. And he brought up a number of issues I had not considered, such as the technical aspects of transferring links from my old site to my new one. He also zeroed in on a problem we have with our current campaign, the difficulty of figuring out which of our AdWords ads lead to the phone calls we receive. He had a solution in mind.", "In all, I found him impressive. First, because he showed up, and quickly. Even in this Internet age, there\u2019s a lot to be said for meeting someone face to face, and it\u2019s nice when someone arranges their schedule to suit my convenience. Second, we seemed to have a lot in common. He\u2019s a smart guy who started his own business, and he was directly involved with making sure that it succeeded. We concluded our meeting with his promise to submit a proposal.", "My meeting with Vius, the following week, was also positive. The owner came to see me, accompanied by his head designer. He also came off as smart and committed. They had a good portfolio, and they were very familiar with my proposal. My concern was that they seemed to have had little experience managing an AdWords campaign, and they proposed bringing in another contractor to do that part of the job.", "This didn\u2019t excite me. I\u2019d prefer that the AdWords campaign and the website design work together, and I feel it will be easier to accomplish if both requirements are addressed simultaneously by a single creative team. It seemed to me this would eliminate coordination and blame issues. In all other respects, though, Vius was solid. They promised to send a proposal and come back to review it within a week.", "So now I had two strong candidates, and one that was weaker but still in the hunt. And a week later, I had proposals from two of them. The firm 8-11 sent its first. It was long and complicated and expensive, and it broke down their pricing into several scenarios. For the basic website design, it wanted $25,925. For a content management system built on a Drupal platform, it wanted an additional $4,970. Project management added $3,090. And if I wanted a responsive site, it would be another $8,925. Total cost: $42,910.", "Prager\u2019s proposal came the next day. It listed only two prices: $26,500 to build the site, including responsive design and a WordPress content management system. Link migration and project management was included. The second number listed was for continuing monthly management of my AdWords campaign, along with ongoing split-testing of site pages and S.E.O. That would cost $2,500 a month.", "Both 8-11 and Prager pressed me for a decision, but I waited to hear from Vius, which took another week to send a proposal. Its pricing was the lowest: build site, migrate links and test it for $21,900. For another $3,950, it offered to run continual multivariate tests on particular pages for three months. There was no mention of AdWords.", "After reviewing the proposals, I chose Prager. I\u2019m currently spending about $10,000 a month on AdWords, and I wanted a developer who could transition seamlessly into running my campaign. I was also most comfortable with Prager\u2019s owner as a working partner, although the Vius guys were very nice as well, and I\u2019m sure they would have done a good job. But they didn\u2019t offer the full scope of services I wanted. And 8-11? Way too expensive. And the company didn\u2019t convince me that Drupal was the best platform for my site.", "I signed Prager\u2019s proposal and paid a deposit on Oct. 2, 2013. More than a year has passed since then, and I\u2019m only just now starting my site. What took so long? I\u2019ll tell you in my next post.", "Paul Downs founded Paul Downs Cabinetmakers in 1986.

He said the search engines were aware that \u201cphony\u201d locksmiths clog their listings, and, in fact, the search companies benefit from their inclusion because these listings force Baldino\u2019s and other legitimate locksmiths to pay for ads to help their businesses appear higher in search results.", "In May, Mr. Baldino sued Google, Yellowbook and Ziplocal in federal court in Virginia. He has since filed a second amended complaint, and the defendants have filed motions to dismiss the case. The most recent complaint alleges that the defendants have violated various federal and state laws, including the Lanham Act, which deals with false advertising, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which relates to organized criminal activity.", "The RICO claims are rooted in the assertion that the defendants profit from knowingly listing unlicensed locksmiths.

In response, the association hired a retired detective to direct investigations, changed its member-application process to require licensed locksmiths to undergo a federal background check, formed a committee to process complaints and notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Additionally, in 2008, the Federal Trade Commission issued a consumer alert regarding locksmiths.", "The motions to dismiss filed by Yellowbook and Ziplocal also contend that the federal case brought by Baldino\u2019s is barred by previous state court litigation with Yellowbook in Maryland and with Ziplocal in Virginia. In those previous lawsuits, Yellowbook and Ziplocal sued Baldino\u2019s for nonpayment of advertising fees. In both cases, Baldino\u2019s made counterclaims related to the defendants\u2019 publication of listings for unlicensed locksmiths.", "After a trial in the Maryland case, judgment was entered against Baldino\u2019s on all of its counterclaims (Baldino\u2019s is appealing). In the Virginia case, Baldino\u2019s and Ziplocal entered into an agreement in February 2012 under which Baldino\u2019s paid the $15,053 in advertising fees that it owed and Ziplocal agreed to make a good-faith effort to remove listings for unlicensed locksmiths. In late 2013, Baldino\u2019s sued Ziplocal, claiming that it had not kept its end of the bargain. After a trial on that matter, the court found in favor of Ziplocal.", "There seem to be few, if any, other lawsuits that address the precise issues Baldino\u2019s has raised.

Did they make mistakes they now regret? No such self-reflection is to be found here.

Near the end, as it rapidly loses focus and coherence, the authors write about the need for self-starters who take the initiative in fixing problems.

Many of the missing passwords would prove to be relatively secure \u2014 the \u201cJHx6fT!9\u201d type that the company\u2019s I.T. department implored everyone to choose. To crack those, the Microsoft technicians performed \u201cbrute force\u201d attacks, using fast computers to begin with \u201ca\u201d then work through every possible letter and number combination before ending at \u201cZZZZZZZ.\u201d But even with the fastest computers, brute-force attacks, working through trillions of combinations, could take days. Wall Street was not going to wait.", "Microsoft\u2019s technicians, Lutnick recalled, knew that they needed to take advantage of two facts: Many people use the same password for multiple accounts, and these passwords are typically personalized. The technicians explained that for their algorithms to work best, they needed large amounts of trivia about the owner of each missing password, the kinds of things that were too specific, too personal and too idiosyncratic for companies to keep on file. \u201cIt\u2019s the details that make people distinct, that make them individuals,\u201d Lutnick said. He soon found himself on the phone, desperately trying to compartmentalize his own agony while calling the spouses, parents and siblings of his former colleagues to console them \u2014 and to ask them, ever so gently, whether they knew their loved ones\u2019 passwords. Most often they did not, which meant that Lutnick had to begin working his way through a checklist that had been provided to him by the Microsoft technicians. \u201cWhat is your wedding anniversary? Tell me again where he went for undergrad? You guys have a dog, don\u2019t you? What\u2019s her name? You have two children. Can you give me their birth dates?\u201d", "\u201cRemember, this was less than 24 hours after the towers had fallen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fire department was still referring to it as a search-and-rescue mission.\u201d Families had not accepted their losses. Lutnick said he never referred to anyone as being dead, just \u201cnot available right now.\u201d He framed his questions to be an affirmation of that person\u2019s importance to the company, he said. Conversations oscillated between sudden bawling and agonizing silences. \u201cAwful,\u201d he said. Sometimes it took more than an hour to work through the checklist, but Lutnick said he made sure he was never the one to hang up first.", "In the end, Microsoft\u2019s technicians got what they needed. The firm was back in operation within two days. The same human sentimentality that made Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s passwords \u201cweak,\u201d ultimately proved to be its saving grace.", "SEVERAL YEARS AGO I began asking my friends and family to tell me their passwords. I had come to believe that these tiny personalized codes get a bum rap. Yes, I understand why passwords are universally despised: the strains they put on our memory, the endless demand to update them, their sheer number. I hate them, too. But there is more to passwords than their annoyance. In our authorship of them, in the fact that we construct them so that we (and only we) will remember them, they take on secret lives. Many of our passwords are suffused with pathos, mischief, sometimes even poetry. Often they have rich back stories. A motivational mantra, a swipe at the boss, a hidden shrine to a lost love, an inside joke with ourselves, a defining emotional scar \u2014 these keepsake passwords, as I came to call them, are like tchotchkes of our inner lives. They derive from anything: Scripture, horoscopes, nicknames, lyrics, book passages. Like a tattoo on a private part of the body, they tend to be intimate, compact and expressive.", "Perhaps my biggest surprise has been how willing, eager actually, people are to openly discuss their keepsakes. The friends I queried forwarded my request, and before long I started receiving passwords from complete strangers. There was the former prisoner whose password includes what used to be his inmate identification number (\u201ca reminder not to go back\u201d); the fallen-away Catholic whose passwords incorporate the Virgin Mary (\u201cit\u2019s secretly calming\u201d); the childless 45-year-old whose password is the name of the baby boy she lost in utero (\u201cmy way of trying to keep him alive, I guess\u201d).", "Sometimes the passwords were playful. Several people said they used \u201cincorrect\u201d for theirs so that when they forgot it, the software automatically prompted them with the right one (\u201cyour password is incorrect\u201d). Nicole Perlroth, The New York Times\u2019s cybersecurity reporter, told me about the awkward conversation she had not long ago, when, locked out of her account, she was asked by the newspaper\u2019s tech-support staff to disclose her password: a three-digit code plus an unpublishable epithet \u2014 a reference to a funny exchange she overheard years earlier between a store clerk and a thief.", "Often, though, these disclosures had an emotional edge to them. One woman described the jarring realization that her sister\u2019s name was the basis for all of their mother\u2019s passwords. Another, Becky FitzSimons, recalled needling her husband, Will, after their wedding in 2013 because he was still using the digits of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s birthday for his debit-card PIN. \u201cI\u2019m not a jealous person,\u201d FitzSimons said. \u201cBut he changed it to my birthday the next day.\u201d", "Standing at the park watching my 11-year-old son climb on the jungle gym, I struck up a conversation with a woman walking her dog, and I told her about my keepsakes idea. Like most people, she did not want her name used in my article, because she said her vignette was too personal; she also feared being hacked. But she proceeded to tell me that several months after her son committed suicide, she found his password written on a piece of paper at his desk: \u201cLambda1969.\u201d Only then, after some Internet searching, did she realize he had been gay. (Lambda is the Greek lowercase \u201cl,\u201d which some historians say stands in gay culture for liberation. The number, \u201c1969,\u201d she explained, referred to the year of the Stonewall Riots \u2014 the protests that followed a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.)", "Some keepsakes were striking for their ingenuity. Like spring-loaded contraptions, they folded big thoughts down into tidy little ciphers. After being inspired by Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s book, \u201cLean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,\u201d Cortni Kerr, a running partner of mine, began using \u201cWw$$do13,\u201d which stood for \u201cWhat would Sheryl Sandberg do\u201d plus \u201c13\u201d for the year (2013) of the password\u2019s creation. \u201cTnsitTpsif\u201d was the password of another friend, a computer scientist who loves wordplay. It stands for \u201cThe next sentence is true. The previous sentence is false,\u201d which in philosophy is called a liar\u2019s paradox. For my friend, it was a playful reference to the knots that language can tie. When I described keepsake passwords to Paul Saffo, who teaches engineering at Stanford and writes often about the future of technology, he coined the term \u201ccrypto haiku.\u201d", "Rachel Malis, 29, a friend\u2019s former housemate, heard about my password fixations and emailed hers to me: \u201cOdessa,\u201d the Ukrainian city of her father\u2019s birth. It seemed unremarkable to me. But she said there was more to it. So I suggested we meet for coffee. We sat for an hour while Malis nursed a latte and explained what gave her password its power for her.", "\u201cOdessa,\u201d she said, referred not just to her lineage but also to a transformative trip she took there in 2008 with her father. In a sense, it was a place that had always separated them \u2014 it embodied a language, a regime and a past that she could never share. Her father fled Ukraine in 1980 when he was 28, and he vowed never to return. Even in America, old habits, like his KGB-induced skepticism of the police lingered. Malis said that during her childhood in Trumbull, Conn., near New Haven, he would close the living-room blinds whenever he wanted to discuss anything \u201csensitive,\u201d like summer travel plans or family finances. The city loomed large in her father\u2019s consciousness when Malis was growing up. She once asked why there was no fleck of green anywhere in their house \u2014 not in the wallpaper, pictures, dishes, throw rugs \u2014 and her mother explained that it was because the color reminded him of painful early years spent in the army.", "On that trip back, Malis paid for her father\u2019s plane ticket and arranged their accommodations, and they were both surprised to find him just as lost as she was in the streets of Odessa. Her laconic father was more talkative, though, in his native tongue. He was strangely calm visiting his father\u2019s grave but became choked up when he showed her the tracks where he caught the train that whisked him out of the city one panicked night so long ago. Above all, Malis said, typing \u201cOdessa\u201d every time she logged in to her computer was a reminder of the true epiphany she carried home: that getting closer to something \u2014 her father, this city \u2014 didn\u2019t make it smaller or more manageable. \u201cIt actually just brought their complexity and nuance more into focus,\u201d she said.", "At least as interesting as the amount of thought Malis had packed into this one six-letter word was the fact that she was telling me it all. I confessed to her that I loved \u201cOdessa\u201d as a password. At the same time, I worried that her office\u2019s techies might not share my affection, given that their first rule is to avoid choosing passwords with personal significance. Malis pointed out that we break that rule precisely because secure passwords are so much harder to remember. Our brains are prone to mooring new memories to old ones, she said. I added that I thought the behavior spoke to something deeper, something almost Cartesian. Humans like, even need, to imbue things with meaning, I suggested. We\u2019re prone to organizing symbols into language.", "Malis gave me an inquisitive look. So I continued: We try to make the best of our circumstances, converting our shackles into art, I said. Amid all that is ephemeral, we strive for permanence, in this case ignoring instructions to make passwords disposable, opting instead to preserve our special ones. These very tendencies are what distinguish us as a species.", "These special passwords are a bit like origami, I suggested: small and often impromptu acts of creativity, sometimes found in the most banal of places. Malis seemed to agree. She nodded, shook my hand and left.", "ASKING STRANGERS ABOUT their passwords is a touchy proposition. Push too hard, and you come off as a prospective hacker. Go too easy, and people just rant about how much they hate passwords. Still, it\u2019s not every day that you stumble across a conversation topic that teaches you new things about people you\u2019ve known for years.", "I discovered, for example, that my father \u2014 a recently retired federal judge and generally a pretty serious guy \u2014 derived his passwords from a closeted love for goofy, novelty songs from the late \u201950s and early \u201960s (\u201cThe Purple People Eater,\u201d \u201cMonster Mash\u201d).", "The \u201c4622\u201d that my wife uses in her passwords was not just the address of her own father\u2019s childhood home but also a reminder of his fragility and strength. Apparently when the former 270-pound football standout, a scholarship athlete and the pride of his working-class neighborhood in west Tulsa, was a small boy, he had to sing his home address (\u201c4622 South 28th West Avenue\u201d) in one full breath rather than try to say it normally; otherwise, his debilitating stutter would trip him up.", "My young son revealed that his password was \u201cphilosophy,\u201d because, he said, several years earlier, when he created it, he took secret pride in knowing the meaning of a concept that big. The disclosure had an interesting echo for me, because one of my first childhood passwords was a play on \u201contogeny recapitulates phylogeny,\u201d an evolutionary theory from a high-school biology class that I found especially captivating. (The hypothesis, now unfashionable, posits that the physical or intellectual development of each individual passes through stages similar to the developmental stages of that individual\u2019s species or civilization.)", "I asked Andy Miah, a professor of science communication and digital media at the University of Salford in England, for his thoughts on passwords, and he offered an anthropological outlook. Keepsake passwords, he suggested, ritualize a daily encounter with personal memories that often have no place else to be recalled. We engage with them more frequently and more actively than we do, say, with the framed photo on our desk. \u201cYou lose that ritual,\u201d Miah said, \u201cyou lose an intimacy with yourself.\u201d", "For some people, these rituals are motivational. Fiona Moriarty, a competitive runner, told me that she often used \u201c16:59\u201d \u2014 her target time for the 5,000 meters in track. Mauricio Estrella, a designer who emailed me from Shanghai, described how his passwords function like homemade versions of popular apps like Narrato or 1 Second Everyday, which automatically provide its user with a daily reminder to pause and reflect momentarily on personal ambitions or values. To help quell his anger at his ex-wife soon after their divorce, Estrella had reset his password to \u201cForgive@h3r.\u201d \u201cIt worked,\u201d he said. Because his office computer demanded that he change his password every 30 days, he moved on to other goals: \u201cQuit@smoking4ever\u201d (successful); \u201cSave4trip@thailand\u201d (successful); \u201cEat2@day\u201d (\u201cit never worked, I\u2019m still fat,\u201d Estrella wrote); \u201cFacetime2mom@sunday\u201d (\u201cit worked,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve started talking with my mom every week now\u201d).", "Keepsakes also memorialize loss or mark painful turning points. Leslye Davis, the New York Times reporter who produced the video series that accompanies this article online, said that \u201cstroke911\u201d was her original Facebook password because she happened to create her page on the same day that her cousin had a stroke. My friend Monica Vendituoli\u2019s keepsake was \u201cswim2659nomore\u201d \u2014 a reference to a career-ending shoulder injury in 2008 that prevented her from hitting the 26.59-second qualifying time in the 50-yard freestyle she needed for a championship meet in high school. But the effect of typing this password had shifted over the years, she added. What started as a mourning ritual, she said, was now more a reminder of how \u201ctime heals all.\u201d", "THESE PERSONAL TRIBUTES vary widely, I found. Stuck on a tarmac last year, I sat next to a chatty man who, judging by his expensive watch and suit, seemed to have done well for himself. We made small talk about our jobs, and eventually I told him about my interest in passwords. After a long, silent look out the window, he turned to me and said that he typically uses \u201c1060\u201d in his passwords. This was his SAT score, he explained. He liked reminding himself of it, he said, because he took a certain private satisfaction in how far he had come in life in spite of his mediocre showing on the standardized test.", "I got an email from a college student, Megan Welch, 21, who described having been trapped several years earlier in a relationship with a physically abusive boyfriend. She recounted how he routinely spied on her email. When she tried to change her password, he always either guessed or got her to tell him the new one. \u201cI was so predictable,\u201d she said. After finally deciding to break up with him, she used for her new password the date of her decision, plus the word \u201cfreedom\u201d \u2014 a deviation, she said, from the cutesy words that had been her norm. In being uncharacteristic, her password became unhackable; it was at once a break from her former self and a commemoration of that break.", "Keepsake passwords are so universal that they are now part of the fabric of pop culture. I noticed, for instance, that on Showtime\u2019s \u201cDexter,\u201d the main character (a blood-spatter analyst for the police by day, vigilante serial killer by night) forgot his work computer\u2019s password. He was soon visited by the ghost of his adoptive father, Harry, who killed himself after witnessing Dexter\u2019s violent tendencies. The visit reminded Dexter of his password (\u201cHarry\u201d) and the viewer of the longevity and depth of his personal torment.", "Googling for more examples, I came across Jack Donaghy, Alec Baldwin\u2019s character on the NBC sitcom \u201c30 Rock.\u201d He convinced himself that a high-school crush still had feelings for him after he learned that her voice-mail code, \u201c55287,\u201d stood for \u201cKlaus,\u201d the name Jack used in the high-school German class they took together. I found George Costanza from \u201cSeinfeld\u201d nearly driving his girlfriend mad, and maybe even killing a guy, by refusing to share his A.T.M. password, \u201cBosco,\u201d a reference to George\u2019s weakness for the chocolate syrup.", "But perhaps the most bizarre one I found was Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s A.T.M. code \u2014 \u201cJor-El.\u201d On the simplest level \u2014 as the episode explained \u2014 this was the name of Superman\u2019s Kryptonian father. It served as a nod to the fictional Jerry\u2019s love of the comic-book character. But in digging a bit further, I found that the real-life Jerry\u2019s father was of Eastern European-Jewish descent, and his first name was Kalman, a.k.a. Kal. This is why one of the actor\u2019s two sons, born long after the episode was made, has Kal as his middle name. Though most people know Superman as Clark Kent, his Kryptonian name is Kal-El. What Jerry hid in his PIN looped between fact and fiction, past and present; and comic book, sitcom and real life.", "I loved the Seinfeld password story because it was so convoluted that in retelling it I could barely follow it myself. Its circularity inspired a certain awe in me \u2014 the way you might feel when you first see an optical illusion by Escher. That got me thinking about the intricate and self-referential patterns famously described in Douglas R. Hofstadter\u2019s 1979 classic \u201cG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.\u201d The book is a beautiful and personal musing on how we mold both language and our sense of self from the inanimate material around us.", "I wondered if there might be some (modest) parallel between what I saw in keepsakes and the elaborate loops in music, math and art that he described in his book. Like a fractal running through human psychology, maybe we have a tendency not just to create keepsakes but to create ones with self-referential loops in them.", "So I called Hofstadter to get his take. He was reserved but intrigued. I suggested that many of these passwords seem to be quiet celebrations of things we hold dear. Hofstadter concurred. His primary password, he said, was the same one he has used since 1975, when he was a visiting scholar at Stanford. It consisted of a sentimental date from his past coupled with a word problem.", "\u201cMight there be something deeper at work in these password habits and in the self-referential loops you studied?\u201d I asked.", "Some of these patterns we discover, Hofstadter said, others we create. But above all, \u201cwe oppose randomness,\u201d he said. \u201cKeepsake passwords are part of that.\u201d", "The Internet is a confessional place. With so little privacy, passwords may soon be tomorrow\u2019s eight-track player, quaintly described to our grandchildren. Ten years ago, Bill Gates announced during a tech-security conference in San Francisco that \u201cpeople are going to rely less and less\u201d on passwords, because they cannot \u201cmeet the challenge\u201d of keeping critical information secure. In recent years, there has been a push for machines to identify us not by passwords but by things we possess, like tokens and key cards, or by scanning our eyes, voices or fingerprints. This year, for example, Google purchased SlickLogin, a start-up that verifies IDs using sound waves. iPhones have come equipped with fingerprint scanners for more than a year now. And yet passwords continue to proliferate, to metastasize. Every day more objects \u2014 thermostats, car consoles, home alarm systems \u2014 are designed to be wired into the Internet and thus password protected. Because big data is big money, even free websites now make you register to view virtually anything of importance so that companies can track potential customers. Five years ago, people averaged about 21 passwords. Now that number is 81, according to LastPass, a company that makes password-storage software.", "Partly this push is being fueled by a growing and shared hatred of passwords. The digital era is nothing if not overwhelming. The unrelenting flood of information. The constant troubleshooting. We only just master one new device before it becomes outmoded. These frustrations are channeled into tantrums over forgotten passwords.", "There is scarcely a more modern sense of anomie than that of being caught in the purgatory where, having forgotten a password, we\u2019re asked personal trivia questions about ourselves that we can\u2019t seem to answer correctly. The almost-weekly stream of news stories about major security breaches makes it tough not to feel as if privacy on the Internet is unattainable.", "It\u2019s enough to make the conscientious objectors seem sane. These are the many people I interviewed who said they had given up on the whole notion of online security, opting instead to adopt intentionally insecure passwords.", "Digital nudists of sorts, these people throw all discretion to the wind, leaving themselves naked to hackers and identity thieves; they are protected only by the hope that they might disappear in the crowd. Their humble acts of rebellion seem to suggest that maybe the reason people were so willing to tell me their keepsakes was that it offered a small, private catharsis from the pent-up pressure that we all feel to police our online security.", "IN DECEMBER 2009, an Eastern European hacker trolling the Internet for vulnerable targets stumbled across the mother lode: a database of 32 million passwords for a company called RockYou that runs a network of online games. Several weeks later, the hacker published the database, which remains among the largest such archives ever released.", "The digital nudists were well represented. At least one of every 10 users chose a name or a name plus a year for his password. Two of every thousand passwords were the word \u201cpassword.\u201d But the RockYou breach had bigger lessons to offer. Most password research is focused on security, rather than on psychology or anthropology. Few modern activities, however, are more universal than creating a password. Rich, poor, young, old, virtually all of us are confronted daily by some kind of registration-demanding technology: wire transfers, prepaid cellphones, online banking, email, calling cards. The RockYou database could show how, when and why words gather weight \u2014 existential, personal weight.", "This is partly why, for the past several years, a small team of computer scientists at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology has studied the RockYou database for lexical patterns. Among their more interesting finds: \u201cLove\u201d was by far the most common verb among the passwords \u2014 about twice as common as conjugations of the verb \u201cto be\u201d and roughly 12 times as common as conjugations of the verb \u201cto hate.\u201d By far the most popular adjectives used in the database\u2019s passwords were \u201csexy,\u201d \u201chot\u201d and \u201cpink.\u201d Men\u2019s names were about four times as likely as women\u2019s names to appear as the object of passwords that start with \u201cI love.\u201d", "Christopher Collins, one of the group\u2019s lead researchers, explained that affection even appears in disguised forms. What at first looked like a disproportionately frequent use of the word \u201cteam,\u201d for instance, turned out to be versions of the Spanish words \u201cte amo,\u201d or \u201cI love you,\u201d Collins said. The number \u201c14344\u201d appeared unusually often, and the researchers at first figured that it referred to a date: March 14, 1944. After consulting the urban dictionary, they soon found out that the number actually is popular code for \u201cI love you very much.\u201d (Count the letters in each word.)", "In my own conversations, I, too, noticed that love (familial, unrequited, Platonic, failed) seemed to be a common source of inspiration for keepsakes. Perhaps my favorite of these anecdotes came from Maria T. Allen, who wrote that in 1993, when she was 22, she used for her password a combination of the name of her summer crush, J. D., with an autumn month and the name of a mythological female deity (she wouldn\u2019t tell me which) to whom he had compared her when they first met. The fling ended, and they went their separate ways. But the password endured. Eleven years later, out of the blue, Allen received a message through Classmates.com from J. D. himself. They dated for several years, then decided to marry. Before the wedding, J. D. asked Maria if she had ever thought of him during that interim decade. \u201cAbout every time I logged in to my Yahoo account,\u201d she replied, before recounting to him her secret. He had the password inscribed on the inside of his wedding ring.", "Granted, passwords harbor humanity\u2019s darker side too. Joseph Bonneau, 30, who was among the first computer scientists to study RockYou\u2019s archive, said he was amazed that tens of thousands of people would choose to introduce messages like \u201ckillmeplease,\u201d \u201cmyfamilyhatesme\u201d and \u201cerinisaslut\u201d \u2014 not to mention a slew of obscenities and racial slurs \u2014 into their lives multiple times a day.", "In studying the database, Bonneau\u2019s focus was not on the meaning of passwords but their security. And the further he dug into it, he said, the more he worried about the fate of privacy as so much of life moves online. \u201cWhat the database made clear,\u201d he said, \u201cwas that humans really are the weak link when it comes to data security.\u201d", "But precisely what made passwords so flawed is also what Bonneau said he found uplifting. \u201cPeople take a nonnatural requirement imposed on them, like memorizing a password,\u201d he said, \u201cand make it a meaningful human experience.\u201d", "I later recounted Bonneau\u2019s comment to Collins, who agreed. \u201cWe don\u2019t just make it a meaningful experience,\u201d he said. \u201cStatistically speaking, at least based on the data, it\u2019s most often an affectionate experience.\u201d", "THERE IS SOMETHING mildly destructive about collecting people\u2019s keepsakes. Observers disturb the things we measure. But with passwords, or other secrets, we ruin them in their very discussion. Virtually all the people who revealed their passwords to me said they planned to stop using them. And yet they divulged them all the same.", "Over the course of a half-hour, Hossein Bidgoli, a management information systems professor at California State University, Bakersfield, and editor of The Internet Encyclopedia, told me about the many dangers of using personal information in passwords. He fell silent, however, when I asked him whether he thought keepsakes were a bad thing.", "Then he began to tell me about his life. He grew up in a small town near Tehran, he said, where he lived until he left Iran in 1976 to pursue his doctoral studies. He described his high school, which was named Karkhaneh, and the roses and rhododendron at a nearby plantation where he and his parents used to picnic. He recalled the distinct taste of the freshly made olive oil that his father, an engineer, used to bring home from the olive-processing plant where he worked.", "\u201cWhat you\u2019re calling keepsake passwords,\u201d Bidgoli said, \u201cmine is \u2018Karkhaneh.\u2019 \u201d", "Translated from Farsi, the word means \u201cthe place where people work,\u201d he said. But for him, the name conjured a past happiness, time spent with his parents and the place that shaped his work ethic and his ethnic identity. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty memory,\u201d he said, sotto voce.", "I wondered why someone so concerned about security would be willing to tell me his password. I figured it might just be an extension of the oversharing culture that the Internet has created.

If Apple and others create tablets that are more serious laptop replacements, perhaps with detachable keyboards and mice, the case for paying for a premium version of Office could get weaker.", "Mr. Case, Microsoft\u2019s vice president of Office marketing, said the company was walking a fine line by making Office free on mobile, but he expected the impact would be positive for the company.", "\u201cThis is not a small change,\u201d he said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/technology/personaltech/picking-your-cars-computerized-brain.html": ["EVEN with their high-tech gadgets and computerized machinery, most cars still do a pretty poor job of providing helpful information about things like mechanical problems and fuel use \u2014 and of connecting to the devices we use the most, our phones.", "Improvements are on the horizon.

Its app is available only for iOS, so Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry users are out of luck.", "It\u2019s also bare-bones and often puts the burden on the user to figure out what to do \u2014 even when installing the device. There are no instructions on where to find your OBD-II port, for example \u2014 and how many people are familiar with that?", "By contrast, Automatic\u2019s app shows you a diagram of common locations of the port in vehicles, putting emphasis on the three likeliest options.", "And when my Mojio device failed to connect to my phone, there was no indication of how I might try to reconnect or why it failed.", "The Mojio app interface is a little clunky, too. The app tries to organize every event on your calendar into a \u201ctrip,\u201d even if it\u2019s a birthday or something without a location. And for navigation, you must switch to the Google Maps app.", "Worse, Mojio is downright distracting while you\u2019re driving. The app requires you to look at it, to some extent, while you\u2019re moving; otherwise you won\u2019t see things like pop-ups that direct you to parking. Moreover, the directions are tiny, the parking signs aren\u2019t tappable and looking at them for any length of time could cause swerving or worse.", "And although Mojio offers some neat features, paying $5 a month seems like a stretch, considering that other apps can do most of its tricks (other than telling me if my car is being towed). Google Now can tell me where I\u2019m parked, Glympse can let people know I\u2019m on my way home, and several apps can help me find parking nearby.", "Sure, those apps are not organized into one interface as they are with Mojio, but those apps are free, not $60 a year.", "Automatic keeps it simpler: The device costs $99 and focuses primarily on improving things like fuel economy, tracking driving habits and providing car diagnostics \u2014 with no monthly fee. Setup is straightforward and took just a few seconds, and its app is available for Android and iOS.", "In terms of the data it provides, Automatic is a little like a wearable activity tracker. There\u2019s information that\u2019s interesting to look at, like how far a trip was and how much gas you used. But unless you drive for a living or are focused on minimizing your fuel use, it\u2019s not always obvious what to do with all that information.", "You also get a driver score for good behavior, like avoiding speeding, rapid acceleration and hard braking. That sounds like a buzz kill for those who like to drive for sport, but it\u2019s helpful if there\u2019s a teenager in the house or if you\u2019ve had a lot of speeding tickets. And both Mojio and Automatic would come in handy if you had a mechanical problem and needed a quick diagnosis.", "Automatic also offers some free features that make it attractive to parents.

I\u2019d be reading this book on magic, and I\u2019d find a new trick, so I\u2019d just knock on my parents\u2019 door, wake them up at 2 a.m. My dad was like, \u201cThis kid needs an audience.\u201d So he called local nursing homes, and he was like, \u201cHey, you guys want a free magic show?\u201d And then I thought I was getting pretty good, and I was like, \u201cI want to start making some money.\u201d By the time I was 12, I was doing five birthday parties a weekend.

It\u2019s the guy in the tuxedo, with the flame in his hand, the guy with the slicked-back hair. And that has been the public\u2019s perception of magic, which is unfortunate, because there\u2019s so much good magic out there. It\u2019s just that people have this perception: \u201cOh there\u2019s going to be some awkward guy asking you to pull his finger, and I\u2019ll pass, thank you.\u201d", "In the age of Google and instant debunking, has magic become a tougher sell?", "I do think it is harder to get people to believe. You watch any trick on YouTube, and you scroll down in the comments, and you will find discussions on how it works, which is really unfortunate, because in some ways it\u2019s made magic about the trick. So I think that the approach to magic has to be different. Which is why in my thing, I do it very tongue in cheek. I\u2019m a comedian first, I\u2019m a performer first, and magic is going to be the theme of this performance.

They were among the most pointed in a campaign by intelligence services in Britain and the United States against pressure to rein in their digital surveillance after disclosures by the American former contractor Edward J. Snowden.", "Mr. Hannigan\u2019s statements were among the most critical of American technology firms by the head of a major intelligence agency; the accusation went beyond what United States officials have said about Apple, Google and others that are now moving toward sophisticated encryption of more and more data on phones and email systems.", "But the companies, saying they are responding to demand from their users, show no signs of backing down. Recently the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, said governments that want data should deal with the users of the technology, not with the providers of the hardware and services. Brad Smith, the general counsel of Microsoft Corporation, told a Harvard Law School symposium on Tuesday that, if anything, companies like his \u201cwill move to strengthen encryption,\u201d and require governments to get court orders if they want data.", "Mr. Hannigan, in an opinion article on Tuesday in The Financial Times, singled out the Islamic State, the radical group also known as ISIS and ISIL, as one \u201cwhose members have grown up on the Internet\u201d and are \u201cexploiting the power of the web to create a jihadi threat with near-global reach.\u201d", "In a speech two weeks ago, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, said that the \u201cpost-Snowden pendulum\u201d had \u201cgone too far.\u201d On Monday, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, took a less confrontational approach, telling students and faculty members at Stanford University that \u201ca fundamentally strong Internet is in the best interest of the U.S.\u201d", "Increasingly encrypted products and services are \u201ca challenge,\u201d Admiral Rogers said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d", "But he also pushed for better sharing of data between the intelligence community and private technology companies. Moves to set up a formal information-sharing system have stalled in Congress in the face of objections from the private sector.", "\u201cIt is unrealistic to expect the private sector to withstand the actions of nation-states,\u201d Admiral Rogers said. \u201cI think it is also unrealistic to expect the government to deal with this all by itself. \u201d", "Technology companies, which harvest customer data for commercial uses, reacted cautiously on Tuesday, generally seeking to avoid any role that would make them agents of government intelligence-gathering. \u201cIt\u2019s such a slippery slope with these types of requests,\u201d said Stefan Weitz, director of search at Microsoft. \u201cIf you say yes to one request, more will inevitably start to come in. At what point do you stop?\u201d", "Technology companies do cooperate with governments in some ways. In Britain, government agencies have regular contact with Google and its YouTube subsidiary, and can get expedited responses when they raise concerns about terror recruitment videos or images of beheadings, often resulting in quick action to take down the content in question.", "But Mr. Hannigan\u2019s comments, calling for \u201ca new deal between democratic governments and the technology companies in the area of protecting our citizens,\u201d seemed to urge a further review of the balance between civil liberties and national security.

A snorkeler? No, it was a hawksbill turtle, which seemed as surprised to see me as I was to see it, though not as delighted. The turtle gulped some air, flexed its fin feet, as graceful in the water as the brown pelicans passing nearby were in the air, and effortlessly angled through the green water toward the sea grass 10 feet below.", "I was floating off Culebra, a 12-square-mile island in a corner of the Caribbean that was quiet even in mid-January, with news of the polar vortex reaching us like word from a distant, far less habitable planet. During the 80-degree days, my family and I had a choice of a half-dozen spectacular beaches, often sharing a mile-long stretch of sand with a handful of people or with no one at all. During the cool, breezy nights, from our rented house, we could see in the distance the lights of massive cruise ships approaching the nearby island of St. Thomas. We felt fortunate that we were instead taking in this low-key, slow-speed island, 17 miles off the northeast coast of Puerto Rico.", "As off-the-beaten-track as it seems, I found the island the easy way: In search of a place to belatedly celebrate our daughter\u2019s 30th birthday, I idly went to Google for \u201cbest beaches\u201d and discovered several top-10 lists that included Playa Flamenco on Culebra, which I had never heard of on a few earlier trips to the Caribbean. It was easy to get to: a direct flight to San Juan, followed by a quick trip by ferry or small plane out to the island. Its reputation among travelers looking for a quiet escape seemed to be growing, with additional flights added this year. It was relatively undeveloped, because of its modest size and because tourism gained a toehold only after local protests ended its use as a weapons testing ground by the United States Navy in 1975.", "Some historians believe Columbus stopped by Culebra on his second voyage in 1493, and local lore says it was long a hide-out for pirates preying on the Caribbean trade. In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt created the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge on part of Culebra and some of the tiny out islands that surround it. In recent years, lodging options have steadily expanded, including a campground adjoining Flamenco Beach, a growing number of small hotels and guesthouses and a large selection of rental houses.", "With a few clicks, we found a list of two- and three-bedroom houses for rent for about $200 a day, though strict controls on development near the beaches meant few were close to the water. We chose one in the hilly interior that boasted a view of Culebrita, an uninhabited island just to the east topped by an old lighthouse, and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands beyond. It sat atop a rise amid tamarind and acacia trees, in a surprisingly arid landscape, with a deck that offered spectacular stars on clear nights.", "We had been warned that we would need to rent a fairly rugged car to get around \u2014 even to climb the dirt driveway to the house \u2014 so the real estate agents suggested Jerry Beaubien of Jerry\u2019s Jeeps, who cheerfully offered a deal on a well-used model. He scribbled highlights on an island map and told us about the customers who had returned annually for 21 years \u2014 renting the very same vehicle every time they came. Even with an increase in first-time visitors, he said, Culebra remained a peaceful spot where few drivers bothered to lock their cars and his biggest problem was renters who lost their keys in the surf.", "The rusty Jeep we rented proved its mettle on the island\u2019s roads, on which we quickly memorized the locations of the most daunting potholes, and especially on the roads to the beaches, which could be astonishingly steep and, on unpaved stretches, impressively rutted.", "But the payoff of our journey was evident once we set foot on those beaches. Justifiably famous is Playa Flamenco, a curving mile of white sand and turquoise water that draws the biggest crowds and has the only commercial development: a half-dozen kiosks selling mango smoothies, rice-and-beans burritos and all manner of seafood, from conch salad to skewers of shark. One island resident called it \u201ccompromised,\u201d since vanloads of day-trippers come over on the ferry, but even Flamenco is unspoiled by East Coast seashore standards.", "We tried a new beach, sometimes two, each day. Zoni Beach, on the windy north side, was great for wave-jumping in the white-sand shallows, then retreating to the shade of bushes and small trees to read. Playa Larga, also on the windward side, had bathtub-like sandy depressions in the shallow shelf of an old reef. Tamarindo and Melones had fantastic snorkeling, and we quickly learned the best patches for turtle watching, gazing at the electric blues and yellows of tropical fish, and exploring otherworldly forests of coral resembling giant brains and reindeer antlers. Several shops on the island\u2019s only town (known on maps as Dewey for a long-gone naval commander, a name that appears rarely used) rent snorkel gear and stable ocean kayaks for reasonable rates.", "The hilly terrain offered striking views of the island\u2019s large sheltered bay and the ocean around every turn, flawed only by the dozens of signs that oddly informed us in Spanish that we were entering or leaving the tsunami danger zone. No tsunami has done any damage in Culebra in modern history; it looked as if an enterprising sign-sales\u00adman had captured the government\u2019s attention.", "We stopped in at the little Culebra history museum, open only on weekends, and ended up spending well over an hour, watching a documentary in which old-timers recalled the days before electricity, the annual invasions of as many as 7,000 sailors (on an island whose permanent population even today is about 2,000), munitions accidents that maimed and killed islanders, and the successful campaign to oust the Navy. The residual effects persist more than four decades later; while we were there, a Navy team closed Flamenco for a day while it disarmed a bomb that had surfaced from the sand. (Culebra may be the only spot on American territory where the occasional car displays a \u201cNixon\u201d bumper sticker, in gratitude for President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s decision to end the annual military shelling.)", "No one will visit Culebra for the night life, but a half-dozen restaurants scattered around the little town offered excellent seafood and Puerto Rican specialties. Dinghy Dock had tables right on the water, with herds of three-foot tarpon lingering dockside for fish heads tossed from customers, and beautiful fishing bats swooping at the water after dusk. The lobster risotto at El Eden was especially memorable, as was the goat stew at Susie\u2019s. Both were open only a few days a week, and we soon learned to call first. The laid-back Culebra attitude toward commerce was summed up by the sign painted on a gift kiosk that we never saw in operation: \u201cOpen some days,\u201d it read, \u201cclosed on others.\u201d", "On our last day, the wind died down enough to let us paddle rented kayaks a mile or so through choppy seas to Cayo Luis Pe\u00f1a, a hilly little island to the southwest that is part of the wildlife refuge. Following the advice of Ken Ellis of the Culebra Bike Shop, who rents all kinds of other things as well, we checked out the snorkeling in a couple of quiet coves, collected sea glass and hollow coconut shells on the beach, ate a picnic lunch and then crossed back to Culebra, paddling from beach to beach with a couple more snorkeling stops. A final push home into the wind, with big swells crashing against the kayaks\u2019 bows and squalls of wind you could see dappling the water ahead, left us happily worn out. Back at the house, over cold beers on the deck, as the Culebrita lighthouse began to blink in the gathering darkness, we schemed aloud about how soon we might be able to return."]}

An early Facebook engineer tells Mr. Vance, \u201cThe best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.\u201d The author quotes the venture capitalist Peter Thiel: \u201cWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.\u201d", "If Silicon Valley was holding out for a hero after Steve Jobs\u2019s death, a disrupter in chief, it has found a brawny one in Mr. Musk. This South African-born entrepreneur, inventor and engineer is the animating force behind companies (Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity) that have made startling advances in non-indoor-cat arenas: electric cars, space exploration and solar energy. He is all of 43.", "Mr. Musk is about as close as we have, circa 2015, to early industrial titans like Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Along with his swagger, he totes surprise, style and wit. Tesla\u2019s Model S sedan was not only Motor Trend\u2019s car of the year in 2013 \u2014 the first non-internal-combustion engine vehicle to win that award \u2014 but it also has a sound system that, in a homage to the film \u201cSpinal Tap,\u201d you can turn up to 11.", "\u201cElon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future\u201d isn\u2019t the first biography we\u2019ve had of Mr. Musk, nor will it be the last. But it is easily the richest to date. It\u2019s also the first one Mr. Musk has cooperated with, though he had no control, the author says, over its contents. Mr. Vance is a technology writer for Bloomberg Businessweek. He won over Mr. Musk, who initially declined to be interviewed, impressing him with his diligence after he had interviewed some 200 people.", "The result is a book that is smart, light on its feet and possesses a crunchy thoroughness. Mr. Vance can occasionally veer toward hagiography and the diction of news releases. After noting that Mr. Musk\u2019s grand vision is to colonize Mars, for example, Mr. Vance writes:", "\u201cHe\u2019s the possessed genius on the grandest quest anyone has ever concocted. He\u2019s less a C.E.O. chasing riches than a general marshaling troops to secure victory. Where Mark Zuckerberg wants to help you share baby photos, Musk wants to ... well ... save the human race from self-imposed or accidental annihilation.\u201d As the Beast from \u201cX-Men\u201d likes to remark, Oh my stars and garters.", "Mostly, though, Mr. Vance curbs his enthusiasm and delivers a well-calibrated portrait of Mr. Musk, so that we comprehend both his friends and his enemies. It\u2019s a book with many ancillary pleasures. Mr. Vance brings us up to date on the states of green energy and space launches. He also veers away from his subject just often enough, offering profiles of the frequently brilliant people who work alongside Mr. Musk.", "Bits from this biography have already made Internet gossip ripples. According to Mr. Vance, Mr. Musk berated a male employee who missed a Tesla event to be present for the birth of his child. (Mr. Musk has denied this.) Either way, he does not come off like Alan Alda. He has been married three times \u2014 twice to the same woman \u2014 and, while thinking about fitting a new relationship into his schedule, he asks: \u201cHow much time does a woman want a week? Maybe 10 hours?\u201d", "Other eye-popping details, not all of them previously reported, are flecked atop this book like sea salt. His five children don\u2019t merely have nannies but have had a nanny manager. He worries that Google is building a fleet of robots that may accidentally destroy mankind. He rents castles and sumo wrestlers for his parties. At one of them, a knife thrower aimed at a balloon between the blindfolded Mr. Musk\u2019s legs.", "The best thing Mr. Vance does in this book, though, is tell Mr. Musk\u2019s story simply and well. It\u2019s the story of an intelligent man, for sure. But more so it is the story of a determined one. Mr. Musk\u2019s work ethic has always been intense. One observer says about him early on, \u201cWe all worked 20 hour days, and he worked 23 hours.\u201d", "Mr. Musk was born in 1971 and grew up in Pretoria. His father was an engineer; his mother, whose family had roots in the United States and Canada, was a model and dietitian. There are indications his father was brutal, and that Mr. Musk is a tortured soul trying to make up for a wrecked childhood. But no one will speak specifically about any such events.", "He attended college in Canada before graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and moving to the West Coast. His first start-up, a company that provided maps and business directories, was bought by Compaq Computer and made Mr. Musk $22 million. His interest in online banking led to his part in the creation of PayPal. When it was sold to eBay, he walked away with roughly $250 million, the author says, enough to bankroll his interests in space and green technology.", "Mr. Musk got started in space exploration by first learning all he could about it, sometimes reading Soviet-era rocket manuals. There were many failures, and several near-bankruptcies, along the way to making SpaceX what it is today, notably one of only two private companies to have docked with the International Space Station.", "Mr. Vance tells the stories of both SpaceX and Tesla with intricacy and insight, often stuffing the technological details, for those who are interested, into long footnotes. We come less close to Mr. Musk himself. Though the author interviewed him for several dozen hours, he remains a remote and somewhat chilly figure, a perfectionist not unlike Mr. Jobs, often given to confrontation and fits of rage.", "What does come through is a sense of legitimate wonder at what humans can accomplish when they aim high, and aim weird. The animosity and jealousy some feel toward Mr. Musk\u2019s achievements put me in mind of a great line from the HBO show \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d in which the tech chief executive Gavin Belson comments, \u201cI don\u2019t know about you people, but I don\u2019t want to live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do.\u201d", "ELON MUSK\nTesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future\nBy Ashlee Vance\n392 pages.

The film, scheduled for release on June 3, is bound to evoke an era when DVD sales were a cash cow, YouTube was for amateurs and the movie business was a more dominant cultural force. Television, social media and sports have stolen much of the industry\u2019s glitter. And the freewheeling days at the top talent agencies have largely disappeared, with the two largest shops \u2014 William Morris Endeavor and Creative Artists Agency, or W.M.E. and C.A.A. \u2014 now controlled by private equity firms focused on the bottom line.", "\u201cIt\u2019s harder now,\u201d said Douglas Ellin, the creator of the HBO show, who also wrote and directed the movie.", "Warner Bros., HBO\u2019s sister unit at Time Warner, will soon find out whether there is enough skulduggery left in these parts for a big-screen comeback. \u201cEntourage\u201d brings back the movie star Vincent Chase, played by Adrian Grenier and inspired by Mark Wahlberg, who is reunited with his crew in what might be their last romp through the canyons, clubs and glass-walled conference rooms once ruled by Ari Gold, played by Jeremy Piven.", "Mr. Gold is the consummate power agent, a fictional rendering of a Hollywood archetype personified through the years by the likes of Lew Wasserman, Michael Ovitz and now Ariel Z. Emanuel. Mr. Ellin based Mr. Gold (somewhat) on Mr. Emanuel, the co-chief executive, with Patrick Whitesell, of what has become W.M.E./I.M.G., an entertainment and sports conglomerate now majority-owned by Silver Lake Partners. (Silver Lake\u2019s rival, TPG, controls C.A.A., which has also pushed aggressively into sports.)", "\u201cEntourage,\u201d the TV series, was born into a very different environment. In 2004, at least seven major talent agencies clustered in the heart of Beverly Hills, all within walking distance of a favorite lunch spot, The Grill. Today, the agencies have merged or scattered, budgets have been tightened and the business is focused on much more than movie stars and their foibles. The business has shifted from when the show had its debut and Mr. Chase and his pals arrived in a growling yellow Hummer. HBO has moved on to \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d a comic series about Northern California\u2019s tech culture, where trendsetters ride the Google bus to work. (And in a possibly bad omen for the film, Viacom partly blamed \u201cEntourage\u201d reruns\u2019 falling short of expectations when it took a $785 million write-down last month.)", "Warner Bros. has paid close attention to the cultural shift.", "\u201cSadly, all good parties must come to an end,\u201d says the voice-over in an unusually wistful trailer that finds Mr. Chase woefully over budget on a film he is directing for Mr. Gold \u2014 now a studio chief, and not a happy one. He finds his power usurped by a nasty money man, played by Billy Bob Thornton.", "\u201cEntourage,\u201d the film, may be something of an elegy for the movie business. Before the final credits roll, Mr. Gold may wash his hands of Hollywood altogether, people briefed on its plot hint. (\u201cThere may be something even larger for him,\u201d acknowledged Mr. Ellin, who declined to elaborate.)", "All of that is in keeping with the spirit of the HBO show, which never hid from the warts, blemishes and personal and business failures of its characters. Mr. Chase wound up in drug rehab, as his career rose and fell. Mr. Gold was kicked out of one agency, founded another, and lost his wife, at least temporarily, to the celebrity chef Bobby Flay before the eighth season wrapped in 2011.", "Calling Mr. Flay his sworn enemy, Mr. Gold said \u201cit will be agent meets fist\u201d for anyone who dared to dine at or recommend a Flay restaurant. (Mr. Flay is currently having real-life marital woes of his own.)", "Mr. Emanuel, who represents Mr. Wahlberg, is still an agent. But in the real world, he and Mr. Whitesell now spend less time wrapped in the antic lives of their movie clients and more on the corporate complexities that came with their $2.4 billion deal last year to merge W.M.E. Entertainment \u2014 which had been formed by the merger of their Endeavor agency and William Morris \u2014 with I.M.G., a sports powerhouse based in New York.", "A spokesman said Mr. Emanuel was declining interviews touching on the \u201cEntourage\u201d film, but Mr. Ellin said he had watched the new film several times. \u201cAri loves it; he was with me in the editing room,\u201d said Mr. Ellin.", "In real life, the agencies\u2019 corporate structures have brought corporate behavior, which has posed a challenge for Mr. Ellin, who had to work a little harder to find the fun in chronicling it.", "\u201cYou need to act a little bit more businesslike, a little more Wall Street,\u201d said Gavin Polone, who was once an agent at International Creative Management and the United Talent Agency and now produces for film and television.", "A veteran of the glory days, Mr. Polone was fired twice from agency jobs, but he sued and wrangled a $6 million settlement from the second of those incidents. \u201cIf you\u2019re a young agent now, you\u2019re not going to make the kind of money I was making when I was 28 years old,\u201d he said in an interview last month.", "The competition between agencies still occasionally erupts into Ari Gold-like corporate combat. United Talent recently raided more than 10 agents and dozens of clients from the much larger C.A.A. That agency responded with a conspiracy lawsuit that might have become grist for an \u201cEntourage\u201d subplot in its early days.", "But that drama was more an exception than the rule. And Mr. Emanuel \u2014 focused on stable profits, not settling old scores \u2014 mostly stayed out of the fray (though W.M.E. taunted C.A.A. by sending framed \u201cCAAN\u2019T\u201d posters to the defectors).", "Tom Strickler, Mr. Emanuel\u2019s partner in founding the agency Endeavor, is now the chairman of the Extera Public Schools charter school group.

While independent researchers said the study was important for its scope and size, they noted several significant limitations.", "After analyzing how 10.1 million of the most partisan American users on Facebook navigated the site over a six-month period last year, researchers found that people\u2019s networks of friends and the stories they see are in fact skewed toward their ideological preferences. But that effect is more limited than the worst case some theorists had predicted, in which people would see almost no information from the other side.", "On average, about 23 percent of users\u2019 friends are of an opposing political affiliation, according to the study. An average of almost 29 percent of the news stories displayed by Facebook\u2019s News Feed also appear to present views that conflict with the user\u2019s own ideology.", "In addition, researchers said that individuals\u2019 choices about which stories to click on had a larger effect than Facebook\u2019s filtering mechanism in determining whether people encountered news that conflicted with their professed ideology.", "\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve been able to quantify these effects,\u201d said Eytan Bakshy, a data scientist at Facebook who led the study. He said that he began the work in 2012 out of an interest in the way social networks shape how the public gets news. \u201cYou would think that if there was an echo chamber, you would not be exposed to any conflicting information,\u201d he added, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the case here.\u201d", "Facebook\u2019s findings run counter to a longstanding worry about the potential for digital filtering systems to shape our world. For Facebook, the focus is on the algorithm that the company uses to decide which posts people see, and which they do not, in its News Feed.", "Eli Pariser, chief executive of the viral content website Upworthy, labeled this effect the \u201cFilter Bubble.\u201d Some Facebook users have said they unfollow those who post content with which they disagree. And with political discussions being increasingly pitched in the run-up to next year\u2019s presidential election, in which the Internet will be used as a primary campaign tool, the problem appeared to be getting worse.", "\u201cThis shows that the effects that I wrote about exist and are significant, but they\u2019re smaller than I would have guessed,\u201d Mr. Pariser said in an interview about Facebook\u2019s study.", "Natalie Jomini Stroud, a professor of communications studies at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the study, said the results were \u201can important corrective\u201d to the conventional wisdom.", "The study adds to others that debate whether the Internet creates an echo chamber. A Pew Research Center report last year found that media outlets people name as prime information sources about politics and news are strongly correlated with their political views. Another study last year published as a working paper in the National Bureau of Economic Research analyzed Twitter usage during the 2012 election and found social media often exposed users only to opinions that match their own.", "Dr. Stroud and other researchers note that Facebook\u2019s study has limitations. It arrived at 10.1 million users by screening only for Americans older than 18 who log on to Facebook at least four out of seven days of the week, and who interacted with at least one news link during the second half of 2014. Importantly, all self-identified as liberal or conservative in their profiles. Most Facebook users do not post their political views, and Dr. Stroud cautioned those users might be more or less accepting of conflicting political views.", "Criticism of the study was swift. In an article responding to the study, Zeynep Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said, \u201cPeople who self-identify their politics are almost certainly going to behave quite differently, on average, than people who do not.\u201d She added, \u201cThe study is still interesting, and important, but it is not a study that can generalize to Facebook users.\u201d", "Facebook\u2019s researchers said studying those who self-report their politics was the most technically feasible way to determine users\u2019 political affiliations, and trying to infer those from other methods would have led to greater uncertainty.", "The findings are convenient for Facebook. With more than 1.3 billion users, the social network is effectively the world\u2019s most widely read daily newspaper. About 30 percent of American adults get their news from Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. But its editorial decisions are drafted with little transparency using the News Feed algorithm. Facebook could use the study\u2019s results to show that the algorithm is not ruining national discourse.", "Facebook said its researchers had wide latitude to pursue their research interests and to present whatever they found. The results were reviewed before publication in Science, with the journal selecting an anonymous panel of scholars unaffiliated with Facebook. Science does not disclose the identity of experts and warns reviewers to declare any financial ties that might be perceived as a conflict of interest with the study being reviewed.", "Facebook also noted that this study was substantively different from one that caused an outcry last year, in which the company\u2019s scientists altered the number of positive and negative posts that some people saw to examine the effects on mood. This study did not involve an experiment that changed users\u2019 experience of Facebook; researchers analyzed how people use Facebook as it stands today.", "For Facebook\u2019s study, researchers first determined the point of view of a given article by looking at whether liberals or conservatives had shared it most. They found unsurprising partisan attitudes about some news sources, with Fox News stories shared mainly by conservatives and Huffington Post articles shared by liberals.", "Then they measured how often feeds of users, whose identifying details had been taken out, displayed stories that conflicted with their professed ideologies, and how often they clicked on those stories.", "Some academics said Facebook was always tweaking the News Feed and could easily make changes that would create a more sealed echo chamber.", "\u201cA small effect today might become a large effect tomorrow,\u201d David Lazer, a political scientist at Northeastern University who studies social networks, wrote in a commentary on the Facebook study also published in Science. \u201cThe deliberative sky is not yet falling, but the skies are not completely clear either.\u201d", "The study \u2014 also written by Solomon Messing and Lada Adamic, who are data scientists at Facebook \u2014 presented other findings on how people of different political persuasions use the world\u2019s largest social network.", "One is that liberals live in a more tightly sealed echo chamber than conservatives, though conservatives were more selective about what they click on when they see ideologically challenging views.", "About 22 percent of the news stories that Facebook presents to liberals is of a conservative bent, while 33 percent of the stories shown to conservatives presents a liberal point of view. The difference, researchers said, is that liberal users are connected to fewer friends who share views from the other side.", "But liberals were only 6 percent less likely to click on ideologically challenging articles instead of ideologically consistent articles that appeared in their feed. Conservatives were 17 percent less likely to click, meaning they appeared more reluctant to indulge opposing views.", "The study also raised \u2014 but did not answer \u2014 the question of what happens after people click on an article with an opposing view: Are they being persuaded by its arguments, or are they dismissing it out of hand?", "\u201cPeople who are really into politics expose themselves to everything,\u201d said Diana C.

It could have moved as much as six more meters, but it got stuck and not enough energy dissipated. This situation is very similar to the Kathmandu earthquake of 1833 that had a violent sequel in 1835. Yes, there could be another earthquake, but it could happen tomorrow, in a year, in a decade or beyond. If you evacuated for the next big one, you might have to wait a long while to return. Another earthquake could happen out in western Nepal. In a far less violent scenario, the Indian plate could gently creep or slide under the Eurasian plate, or an earthquake could take place deep inside the Indian plate. Or the stuck plate could push and raise the Mahabharat mountains just south of Kathmandu.", "With my introduction to creep (and all the other options), my fear level dropped from a nine to a five out of 10. I am where I am. I live where I live. I can only control certain parts of my life. Yes, I have my nervous hypervigilant moments, and it will take a while before I wear sandals again. I live in a country above a stuck tectonic plate. I cannot control that.", "\u201cWe are reading a book but have reached only Page 32 out of 65,\u201d explained Professor Bilham, who with colleagues is laying GPS monitoring stations where the earthquake got stuck. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen, but it is such an exciting seismological time.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/upshot/how-facebooks-experiment-changes-the-news-and-how-it-doesnt.html": ["Facebook\u2019s new plan to host news publications\u2019 stories directly is not only about page views, advertising revenue or the number of seconds it takes for an article to load.

(For now, these articles can be viewed on an iPhone running the Facebook app.)", "Everyone involved recognizes that shift is already well underway. The front page of a newspaper and the cover of a magazine lost their dominance long ago. Web home pages are following suit. Increasingly, the articles, videos, photographs and graphics that media organizations publish are stand-alone fragments that readers happen upon one at a time, often on social media. It is similar to what happened to musicians when iTunes started selling individual songs instead of albums.", "But news reports, like albums before them, have not been created that way. One of the services that editors bring to readers has been to use their news judgment, considering a huge range of factors, when they decide how articles fit together and where they show up. The news judgment of The New York Times is distinct from that of The New York Post, and for generations readers appreciated that distinction.", "\u201cIn an analog world, you had to think of a newspaper as a collection of stories,\u201d said Edward Kim, chief executive of SimpleReach, which provides publishers and marketers with online metrics. \u201cThat\u2019s how it was packaged and distributed and sold.\u201d", "\u201cIn digital, every story becomes unbundled from each other, so if you\u2019re not thinking of each story as living on its own, it\u2019s tying yourself back to an analog era,\u201d Mr. Kim said.", "Traditional editors have had no choice but to give up some of their control.

But \u201cNetflix\u2019s role is definitely an important piece of the puzzle.\u201d", "From Netflix\u2019s point of view, the fact that its views have gained traction with regulators is merely a recognition that its corporate philosophy, which it says has always been to put consumer interests first, coincides with sound public policy. It has opposed mergers like Comcast-Time Warner Cable and sought conditions in others that it feels pose a threat to broadband competition and innovation and to an open Internet.", "\u201cThese broadband issues galvanized many \u2014 more than four million Americans, various companies and consumers groups \u2014 who all stressed the importance of a free and open Internet,\u201d Corie Wright, director of public policy at Netflix, which is based in Los Gatos, Calif., told me this week. \u201cTo the extent the F.C.C. and Justice Department\u2019s decisions reflect a strong focus on Internet consumers, that\u2019s an encouraging sign of good policy-making.\u201d", "Netflix points out that its competitors also benefit from an unfettered Internet. So do other streaming services like Hulu and Amazon, as well as industry stalwarts like HBO and CBS that have started their own so-called over-the-top offerings. Verizon, which this month struck a deal to buy AOL, is also poised to introduce its own Internet television offering.", "But Netflix, for better or worse, has become the symbol for net neutrality, which has become a key issue in how regulators analyze proposed cable and telecom mergers.", "Of course, government antitrust and communications policy is supposed to benefit consumers, not any individual company or group of companies. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say Netflix has gotten something of a free pass,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law. \u201cThis open Internet principle that\u2019s in ascendance is certainly good for Netflix. It\u2019s harder to say it\u2019s good for consumers.\u201d", "A pivotal moment in the net neutrality struggle came last year when Netflix agreed to pay Comcast so-called interconnection fees, a deal that Netflix\u2019s Mr. Hastings last month called a \u201cdeal with the devil.\u201d (While Comcast has drawn the brunt of Mr. Hastings\u2019s ire, Netflix also reached similar interconnection deals with every other major Internet service provider.)", "But securing payment from Netflix for fast and more reliable access may have been a Pyrrhic victory for Comcast and the other the broadband providers. Until then the notion of net neutrality had been something of an abstraction. But when Netflix subscribers found their programs constantly interrupted for \u201cbuffering\u201d (an interruption to download more data), the ability of Internet providers to play favorites seemed all too real. Once Netflix started paying fees to Comcast, its customers suddenly found their service improved substantially.", "A Comcast spokeswoman declined to comment. But Comcast has offered a different narrative, asserting that Cogent Communications, an intermediary that lacked adequate data capacity, caused Netflix\u2019s problems. Once Netflix paid Comcast\u2019s interconnection fee and connected directly to Comcast\u2019s network, the bottleneck largely vanished.", "Still, Netflix\u2019s experience with Comcast became Exhibit A with the F.C.C. when Netflix opposed the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. \u201cThe combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers,\u201d Netflix said in a letter to shareholders opposing the merger.", "It probably didn\u2019t hurt Netflix\u2019s case that just about everyone in Washington watches the hit Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and Comcast is the dominant Internet provider there.

The fees Netflix so fiercely opposes are analogous to those found in many industries, such as credit cards, where both consumers and merchants pay the credit card companies. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say if these fees are good or bad for consumers,\u201d Professor Hemphill said.", "But Netflix has aggressively pushed the argument that interconnection fees are different because the gatekeepers have too much power and an incentive to abuse it. If regulators continue to sympathize with Netflix\u2019s position, AT&T may have to make at least some of the concessions in its proposed $48 billion takeover of DirecTV. Netflix isn\u2019t opposing the merger outright, but in a letter this month, and in meetings with F.C.C. officials, it has raised concerns similar to those in the Comcast merger: that a combined AT&T-DirecTV has an incentive to protect its existing cable program bundles by imposing data caps or usage fees that disadvantage Netflix and other streaming services using its broadband network.", "And now there\u2019s Charter\u2019s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Even if Netflix doesn\u2019t come out as forcefully against the merger as it did with the Comcast deal, its position will surely reverberate during the government\u2019s review.", "This week, Charter seemed already to be anticipating Netflix\u2019s likely objections and pledged fealty to the notion of net neutrality. \u201cWe have no plans to block, throttle or engage in paid prioritization because our customers demand an open Internet,\u201d Mr. Rutledge said in a conference call announcing the deal.", "But if regulators apply the same reasoning they appeared to have used in analyzing the Comcast bid, that may not be enough.", "It\u2019s true that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable wouldn\u2019t be nearly as large, giving it about 30 percent of the high-speed broadband market, nor does it own a content provider like NBCUniversal. But viewed as a national market, Internet service is already highly concentrated, with only a few major competitors. Arguing the proposition that combining three of them into one is in consumers\u2019 interest may be tough given that the Obama administration has publicly complained about the lack of broadband competition.", "Senator Al Franken, the Minnesota Democrat who strongly opposed the Comcast deal, has already sent letters to the Justice Department and F.C.C. saying, \u201cAny deal of this size and scope warrants scrutiny.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/politics/marco-rubio-campaigns-on-his-immigrant-story-cautiously.html": ["ANKENY, Iowa \u2014 At a recent ice cream social here, Jim Hallihan liked what he heard from Senator Marco Rubio.", "He praised the Florida senator\u2019s youthful optimism and his eloquent testimony to the opportunities America offered.", "But there was something larger that drew Mr. Hallihan, a former Iowa State basketball coach, to Mr. Rubio, 43, the son of poor Cuban immigrants.", "\u201cThe day of the older white guy is kind of out,\u201d said Mr. Hallihan, a 70-year-old white guy.", "As Mr. Rubio has introduced himself to curious, and overwhelmingly Caucasian, Republican audiences from Iowa to New Hampshire, he has vaulted to the front ranks of the early pack of likely presidential candidates, partly because of his natural political talent.

Bush used the phrase in a nomination speech, in 1992, although his opponent, Bill Clinton, proclaimed himself its champion: \u201cI am a product of that middle class, and when I am president, you will be forgotten no more.\u201d (Mr. Bush and Mr. Mondale lost their elections, as did Mitt Romney, who used the phrase in 2012). The phrase also appears only recently in presidential inaugural addresses; Mr. Clinton was the first to use it, in 1997.", "The politicians\u2019 use of it reflects the same slow acceptance of it among the American population. (Indeed, the 1929 seminal sociological study of a middle-American town, \u201cMiddletown,\u201d used the terms \u201cworking class\u201d and \u201cbusiness class.\u201d)", "According to Chronicle, a New York Times site that tracks word usage in The Times, before 1960, the phrases \u201cmiddle class\u201d and \u201cworking class\u201d appeared at roughly the same rate, which was rarely. When it did, it was often with a specific description in contrast to the wealthy and very poor. An 1877 article from Montgomery, Ala., about how the Civil War had dramatically improved the conditions for a particular group of men opened with: \u201cBefore the war there existed here a small middle class that were poor men, but were above the \u2018poor whites.\u2019 \u201d", "A 1927 article in The Times featured a city official warning that Manhattan had \u201cplenty of high-priced apartments\u201d but \u201can acute shortage of homes for the middle class.\u201d", "Most dictionaries define \u201cmiddle class\u201d to mean the people between the upper classes and working class, said Michael Adams, a professor at Indiana University and historian of the English language, in an email. But its use has expanded over time to include people who previously might have been labeled \u201cworking class.\u201d", "\u201cWhen Americans use middle class today, they have something wider in mind, including people we would consider workers,\u201d Mr. Adams said. Even though that\u2019s at odds with many dictionary definitions, he has no problem with that. \u201cI\u2019m one of those lexicographers who believes middle class or any word means what people use it to mean. The dictionaries will have to catch up with middle class speakers before \u2018the middle class\u2019 \u2014 whatever that is \u2014 disappears.\u201d", "As the baby boomer generation began to hit their teenage years in the early 1960s, \u201cmiddle class\u201d began to appear much more often in the newspaper, according to Chronicle. A front-page article on Dec. 26, 1967, reported that Mayor John Lindsay of New York City said \u201che believed that the middle class would not desert New York,\u201d while several stories that year mentioned the middle class in the context of racial integration.", "The social upheavals of the 1960s arrived with expansions in technology and consumerism, putting college educations, entertainment and more products within the reach of a growing population. In The Times, the phrase \u201cmiddle class\u201d went from appearing in about 0.2 percent of all articles in 1963 to 1 percent of all articles in 1973, which may seem like a small increase but isn\u2019t. The Times has also increased its usage of \u201cworking class\u201d and \u201cworking families\u201d since the 1960s, but neither was used on the scale of \u201cmiddle class.\u201d", "Google\u2019s Ngram Viewer, which shows the usage of words and phrases in books that Google has indexed, also shows a steady rise in the appearance of \u201cmiddle class\u201d but has it beginning earlier and then peaking during the 1970s.", "The phrase has been used more often in The Times this year; it has appeared in 1.7 percent of articles so far. It was used in 1.4 percent of articles last year, including a popular one in which The Upshot wrote that the American middle class was no longer the world\u2019s richest.

And she was in no way expecting their first contact to be an offer to discuss a potential blockbuster of a merger.", "The email, according to two people with knowledge of it and reported for the first time here, laid out in detail how global carmakers needed to consolidate to save money and suggested that a combination of G.M. and Fiat Chrysler could cut billions of dollars in costs and create an automotive superpower.", "This analysis did not interest Ms. Barra or other G.M. executives and board members. Instead, Mr. Marchionne\u2019s request for a meeting on the subject was flatly turned down, according to people with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.", "It was a rare rejection for Mr. Marchionne, the mastermind behind the merger between the Italian automaker Fiat and Chrysler, the American car company that required a government bailout to survive the last recession.", "Mr. Marchionne, however, is not one to be put off by rejection. So a month later, on April 29, in a routine analyst conference call, he doubled down. Instead of following the usual script, in which chief executives discuss the current state of their operations, Mr. Marchionne stunned the Wall Street analysts by devoting the entire call to his sudden and intense appeal to automakers to merge.", "\u201cI think it is absolutely clear that the amount of capital waste that\u2019s going on in this industry is something that certainly requires remedy,\u201d he said. \u201cA remedy in our view is through consolidation.\u201d", "It\u2019s not often that a chief executive announces to the world that his company is eager to find a merger partner. Some might even consider it a sign of weakness and, in fact, F.C.A.\u2019s stock dropped about 10 percent over the next two days. Rather than rally support, Mr. Marchionne\u2019s passionate appeal only highlighted the difficulties that lie ahead for Fiat Chrysler.", "Mr. Marchionne has had remarkable success in blending two struggling car companies into the world\u2019s seventh-largest automaker. F.C.A.\u2019s sales in the United States have doubled since 2009. But it still sold only 4.6 million cars and trucks worldwide in 2014, about half as many as competitors like G.M. and Volkswagen. Its valuable brands, like Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups, don\u2019t compensate for the fact that it makes less money than its rivals, lags in China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest car market \u2014 and barely invests in alternative-fuel vehicles that are critical to meeting the coming tougher federal rules on fuel economy.", "Mr. Marchionne says he has a detailed plan to improve F.C.A.\u2019s performance, but his current obsession seems to be playing the automotive Cassandra, warning of disastrous consequences if companies continue spending unabated. He has no patience for subtlety or delicate phrasing.", "The bigger the issue, in fact, the louder he becomes. He irritated the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration by defiantly defending F.C.A.\u2019s response to safety issues with older Jeep models. N.H.T.S.A. just last week scheduled a hearing to examine the company\u2019s follow-through on recalls, something it rarely does. Mr. Marchionne also appears headed for a confrontation with union leaders in this summer\u2019s contract negotiations because of F.C.A.\u2019s rampant hiring of lower-paid workers. Alone among auto chiefs, he wants to end the current two-tier wage system by phasing out the top wage rate as veteran employees retire.", "Detroit hasn\u2019t seen a C.E.O. as provocative and unpredictable since Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler\u2019s previous savior, in the 1980s. And as with Mr. Iacocca, confidence is never a problem for Mr. Marchionne.", "Not From the Ranks", "When in the United States, Mr. Marchionne, 62, works out of a tiny office in a wing of the sprawling Chrysler Technical Center in the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills. He prefers to spend time among engineers and product planners rather than in the lavish suite of executive offices in the nearby headquarters tower. In March, as he settled in for an interview at a small table, a window giving a view over a service drive, he downed the first of several espressos and silenced his four cellphones. Though smoking is forbidden elsewhere in the building, in this sanctuary he lit up one Marlboro after another.", "Mr. Marchionne doesn\u2019t look like a typical car executive. His uniform is a black sweater over a button-down shirt with black pants, and you get the sense he can\u2019t be bothered to find a hairbrush. Unlike Ms. Barra or Mark Fields of Ford Motor, both of whom rose through the corporate ranks, Mr. Marchionne never even worked for a car company before taking the top job at Fiat in 2004.", "Born in Chieti, Italy, a small city on the Adriatic Sea, he moved to Canada with his family as a teenager. He earned degrees in philosophy, law and business administration before joining an accounting firm at 30. From there, he spent most of his career bouncing through executive posts at unglamorous Canadian and European chemical and industrial companies.", "He was an obscure board member at Fiat when the Agnelli family, which controlled the Italian automaker, picked him to reverse its long decline. He moved fast, firing executives, flattening the company\u2019s bureaucracy, eliminating slow-selling models and paring production to match market demand. In a warm-up for Chrysler, he also fostered an entrepreneurial culture in which executives were given wide latitude to meet internal targets.", "Since he cut the deal with the Obama administration six years ago to take control of Chrysler, his moves have confounded an industry that tends to adhere to tried-and-true formulas. When other companies streamlined their brand lineups, Mr. Marchionne created new ones, such as splitting off Ram trucks from the larger Dodge division. Rather than glossing over Chrysler\u2019s battered image, he embraced it with soulful advertising campaigns that extolled the tenacious spirit behind vehicles that were \u201cimported from Detroit.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve always had this incredible sense of urgency,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always had this desire not to let things fester and to really seize the moment, because it\u2019s serendipity.\u201d", "He paused. \u201cYou create the conditions for it, and it just keeps producing outcomes or opportunities for you to pick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t pick them, then it\u2019s your own damn fault.\u201d", "He saw that kind of opportunity four years ago when he took advantage of Chrysler\u2019s precarious financial condition to negotiate a favorable contract with the United Automobile Workers union. That deal allowed him unlimited use of workers paid on a lower scale \u2014 about $19 an hour compared with $28 for veteran employees.", "The arrangement opened the door for Fiat Chrysler to go on a hiring spree of cheaper labor in the United States. Today, more than 40 percent of the company\u2019s 36,000 American factory workers earn entry-level wages, compared with about 20 percent at G.M. and 27 percent at Ford.", "Before he could benefit from his lower-wage work force, Mr. Marchionne had to strip down Chrysler\u2019s production after its 2009 bankruptcy.", "He also retooled Chrysler\u2019s organization by replacing veteran executives with a cadre of younger, unproven managers. While he set ambitious sales and financial targets, he gave his new team free rein to achieve them.", "\u201cHe creates an environment that I call the pressure cooker approach,\u201d said Bernardo Bertoldi, a business professor at the University of Torino in Italy, who helped write a recent Harvard Business School case study on Mr. Marchionne. \u201cHe provides the goals and gives them their freedom, but the pressure is on getting results.\u201d", "And after years of dysfunction under the ownership of the German automaker Daimler and then the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, Chrysler took off. Once Chrysler joined with Fiat, the combined company began posting double-digit annual increases in revenue, reaching $109 billion last year. And after absorbing losses as it paid back more than $5 billion in loans from American taxpayers, F.C.A. has become solidly profitable, reporting $717 million in net income in 2014. The bulk of its income comes from the Chrysler side of the business.", "Chrysler\u2019s revival hinged on streamlining its manufacturing base and pouring resources into its strongest brands, in particular Jeep, which has a cultlike status in this country as the most rugged and stylish of American S.U.V.s and a worldwide appeal dating back to World War II.", "\u201cHe saw the future with Jeep,\u201d said Mike Manley, the brand\u2019s chief. \u201cI remember talking to him early when we were targeting sales of a half-million, and he said we can do a lot more.\u201d", "Fiat Chrysler has opened new plants in Italy and Brazil to accelerate Jeep sales in international markets, and a Chinese factory is coming next. Last year, F.C.A. sold about one million Jeeps globally. Mr. Marchionne is shooting for 1.9 million in 2018, and the success of the brand will be critical to the company\u2019s overall results.", "\u201cYou can\u2019t help but be impressed with what Sergio has done so far,\u201d said David Cole, former chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \u201cBut the question is whether he can achieve the kind of scale necessary to keep up with automakers twice his size.\u201d", "If all his growth targets are achieved, Mr. Marchionne expects Fiat Chrysler to hit seven million in sales in three years. \u201cThat plan is predicated on a whole pile of things I want to execute flawlessly,\u201d he said. But in the next breath, he admitted that external events such as fluctuating oil prices and economic downturns could scuttle those ambitions quickly. \u201cIf I look at the history of this thing over the last 10 to 20 years,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve always had something that came out of left field and made us very, very uncomfortable.\u201d", "A Union Showdown", "Mr. Marchionne might be feeling pretty uncomfortable this summer when Detroit automakers enter contract talks with the U.A.W. When Chrysler last negotiated a contract in 2011, the carmakers were able to win concessions because Detroit\u2019s auto industry was just beginning to recover from its financial collapse during the last recession. Now, however, F.C.A. and the other car companies boast of their robust finances, and the unions are determined to share in the bounty. That could mean an end to Mr. Marchionne\u2019s unfettered use of lower-tier workers.", "One of the union\u2019s priorities is to raise wages for new workers and possibly place a cap on the number of lower-paid employees hired. Ford, for example, is required under the current contract to bump entry-level hires to full-wage status when their overall percentage at the company hits certain thresholds. Fiat Chrysler, however, has no such restrictions.", "Union workers in its plants say the two-tier system has created rifts on the factory floor. \u201cYou can feel the separation in the plant and the animosity,\u201d said Scott McGinnis, who is part of a team that trains workers for the assembly line at a plant in Sterling Heights, Mich. He says lower-tier hires like him resent that they have no way to reach the top of the wage scale, as workers do at Ford. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate to have a job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with a wage progression system, I would at least know I\u2019m working up toward something.\u201d", "Many veteran workers earning top wages are just as supportive of scaling back or eliminating the two-tier system. \u201cIt has created an \u2018us and them\u2019 mind-set where there\u2019s some mutual resentment,\u201d said Martha Grevatt, a skilled-trades worker at a plant in Warren, Mich., who was hired in the 1980s. \u201cIt\u2019s all very detrimental to union solidarity.\u201d", "Mr. Marchionne, who last year earned more than $30 million, is unapologetic about his voracious hiring of lower-paid workers. \u201cI\u2019ve just responded to business needs,\u201d he said. \u201cI needed to make cars, and we hired people.\u201d", "He defends taking advantage of the two-tier system, but Mr. Marchionne admits that the pay gap among workers creates \u201cseeds of instability.\u201d He advocates a standard wage throughout the plants. The $28-an-hour wage that veteran workers now make should be reset at a lower level when they retire, he proposes. Union workers, however, hate this idea and are instead arguing for wage increases across the board in the coming contract.", "Mr. Marchionne\u2019s aggressive use of the two-tier system is characteristic of his forceful style, which has been known to backfire. Two years ago, he challenged federal regulators on their intention to seek a broad recall of older-model Jeeps. Those Jeeps had rear-mounted gas tanks that could catch fire in high-speed rear-end collisions. In a stunning departure from the protocol for resolving car safety issues, Mr. Marchionne requested a private, face-to-face meeting with Ray LaHood, then the transportation secretary, and managed to limit the number of vehicles recalled.", "Now, however, N.H.T.S.A.\u2019s new administrator, Mark R. Rosekind, has signaled that the agency will be much stricter in how it handles recalls. Last week, N.H.T.S.A. said it would hold a public hearing in July on whether Fiat Chrysler was doing enough to fix the 10 million vehicles it had recalled in a variety of safety actions, including the 1.5 million Jeeps with vulnerable gas tanks.", "The Jeep fire issue is clearly a sore point with Mr. Marchionne. He contends that the S.U.V.s met all federal crash standards when they were built more than a decade ago and that F.C.A.\u2019s agreement to install trailer hitches to mitigate the effect of an accident is a fine remedy.", "While safety advocates have criticized the trailer-hitch remedy as insufficient, N.H.T.S.A. said this week that it would not reopen the Jeep investigation to explore other possible remedies. Still, F.C.A. could be facing enormous legal liabilities for gas tank fires. A jury in Georgia awarded $150 million in damages in April to the family of a 4-year-old boy who was killed in a Jeep fire in 2012. Fiat Chrysler has asked for a new trial in the case.", "Courting Apple and Google", "A few weeks ago, an aide to Mr. Marchionne called and said the C.E.O. wanted a follow-up discussion for this article. He had already sat for an extensive interview, but was steaming over the reaction to his consolidation manifesto in April. And he wanted to vent about it.", "He consistently declined to comment publicly about his overture to G.M. or Ms. Barra\u2019s unwillingness to meet with him about it. But during the follow-up interview he became visibly irritated by the suggestion that he had made Fiat Chrysler available for sale by broaching the topic.", "\u201cLook, if I wanted to sell I would have called a banker,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done an analysis on return on invested capital and margins that talk about the fact that we\u2019re all in the same hole.\u201d", "As he did in an earlier interview, he seethed about how the escalating costs for new technology and products were \u201cdriving me nuts.\u201d He contends that automakers waste billions duplicating efforts in developing new engines, safety technology and alternative-fuel vehicles. The conference call outcry was for the good of the entire auto industry and not because Fiat Chrysler was more vulnerable to rising costs than its bigger competitors.", "Mr. Marchionne calculates that a combination with a larger automaker, such as G.M., can save several billion dollars a year by sharing costs for new vehicle platforms and parts.", "\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally immoral to allow for that waste to continue unchecked,\u201d he said.", "No other auto executive has seen fit to agree with him, publicly at least.", "Skeptical Wall Street analysts are hard-pressed to envision interested suitors. Ford has stated that it is not looking at mergers. Ms. Barra, in her only public comments on the topic, said that doing a big deal would be a \u201cdistraction\u201d for G.M. Volkswagen is said to have had interest in the past in F.C.A., but its management has not addressed the subject outright.", "Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst, wrote in a research note to investors that auto companies \u201crarely seek merger partners willingly unless times are desperate.\u201d Yet he did not discount the possibility that Mr. Marchionne\u2019s position might encourage activist investors to push another auto company to consider a merger with F.C.A. \u201cWe have no knowledge of how all this will play out,\u201d Mr. Jonas said.", "Since opening the door for a possible merger with another car company, Mr. Marchionne has broadened his discussion about the industry\u2019s future to include tech giants like Apple and Google.", "Mr. Machionne recently made a three-day visit to California to meet with executives there, including Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Timothy D. Cook. (An Apple spokesman declined to comment.) The trip underscored the evolving relationships between technology giants and traditional automakers. Fiat Chrysler and other car companies are potentially large customers for advanced communications and navigation equipment. But Google and Apple are also developing their own cars, and may one day need to team up with big automakers for manufacturing or marketing. If and when that happens, Mr. Marchionne will be eager to participate.", "For now, he praises the companies as \u201cdisrupters\u201d who will help redefine how cars are developed and operated, and that includes autonomous vehicles. \u201cThese things are real,\u201d he told reporters after a recent speech in Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s not science fiction. They\u2019re coming.\u201d", "That Mr. Marchionne expresses enthusiasm for disruption of his industry should come as no surprise.

It also represents one of the few online brands that fizzled in the United States but found success elsewhere, as the social media pioneer Friendster has in the Philippines and Malaysia.", "How Kijiji achieved those feats is partly a story of good timing, arriving in Canada before Craigslist really took off in this country. The success is also the result of the company\u2019s tailoring itself to the subtle distinctions of the market, catering in particular to the tendency of Canadians toward thriftiness.", "\u201cCanadians are traditionally penny pinchers, which manifests itself in consumer buying differences,\u201d said Warren Shiau, consulting director of buyer behavior research at the market analysis firm IDC Canada. \u201cKijiji has no fees for anything outside of a few specific big-ticket categories, which appeals to the penny pinchers in us.\u201d", "These days, Kijiji has 6.7 million listings on the site.

On top of that, Ms. Bannister found that because Canada\u2019s vast geography and low population density make shipping costs high and delivery times long, buyers of secondhand goods preferred to make deals in person.", "To Ms. Bannister, the answer for eBay seemed to be online classified ads. At the head office, however, the idea did not appear to be quite so obvious. At the time, about 10 percent of Canadians used Craigslist, a level many eBay executives thought meant that it was fully entrenched. Nevertheless, they gave Ms. Bannister some classifieds site software being developed for Europe along with a small amount of money to adapt the site and market the result.", "The only thing the head office of eBay in California imposed was the name, Kijiji \u2014 pronounced Ka-jee-jee \u2014 which is Swahili for village.

Kijiji also was introduced in Montreal and Quebec City, largely French-speaking communities where Craigslist was then available only in English.", "Listings swiftly grew. Making money, however, was a more gradual process. Among other things, the site did not even introduce banner advertising until it had become fully established.", "Today, Kijiji has three revenue sources.

The site\u2019s pet listings led to protests from animal rights groups that it had become a haven for puppy mills, which led to policy changes. And there are the somewhat predictable schemes. This year, a 25-year-old man was arrested and charged with fraud for reportedly using Kijiji to rent and collect deposits on a summer cottage he did not own.", "Mr. Neil said that the company had about 60 employees who searched listings for fraud and that it also used software to flag questionable listings or those prohibited on the site either by laws or company policies.", "Although Kijiji is now used by almost half of all Canadians, eBay continues to advertise it heavily, placing ads on buses and on television during the current hockey playoffs.

Television and movies amply reflected the proliferating demographic.

While Hollywood still likes a good crazed villain making life miserable for an upstanding protagonist, a fictional yuppie hero nowadays is more likely to be plagued by a layoff or the crash of his mutual fund.", "And that may be the starkest difference. Unbridled acquisitiveness was the central trait of the \u201980s yuppie; the dread of losing one\u2019s property and dropping down a tax bracket may define the contemporary one.

She got back at him when she was asked if he was any good: \u201cI kissed a girl, and I liked it,\u201d she replied.", "Shade can be performed just as amusingly without words: Earlier this month, the spectacle of the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute Gala, with its attendees mugging and vying for the attention of the cameras, outdoing one another with wild headdresses and avant-garde gowns, could be thought of as a study in nonverbal shade. But shade is not only practiced among celebrities; it\u2019s enacted just as much by people who aren\u2019t famous, especially online, as a way to gossip or blow off steam, often in highly creative, subtle, even stealthy ways.", "Shade has always been subversive. It has roots in slave culture, in the development of what Johnson calls the techniques that evolved to allow African-Americans a measure of assertiveness despite being in constant physical and psychological peril. \u201cThe threat of being beaten or mutilated was always there if you were to look at a slave master directly in his eye, or if you were to sass, so African-Americans developed these covert ways of communication, which, over time, have morphed into the traditional ways that they interact with one another,\u201d he says. It makes sense, then, that the concept of shade was refined by some of the most marginalized people in American society: gay men, and, later, straight women of color, each of whom had to find socially acceptable ways to communicate humor and aggression. As the writer Tameka Bradley Hobbs explained in an article on the website For Harriet, the practice is \u201cthe bitter residue of a people who have mastered the art of dismissing and humiliating others with humor and sarcasm after having been degraded for years ourselves.\u201d", "Many people associate shade with Jennie Livingston\u2019s 1990 documentary \u201cParis Is Burning,\u201d about drag-ball culture among gay and transgender youth \u2014 most of them black and Latino \u2014 in New York City in the mid-to-late 1980s. There is shade throughout the film: in the one-on-one interviews with the film\u2019s subjects; in the conversations of secondary characters as they navigate the mean streets of late-80s Manhattan; on the scuffed floors where drag competitions \u2014 \u201ca street fight at a ball,\u201d as one character describes them \u2014 take place. \u201cOh, that\u2019s shady!\u201d one participant exclaims after the M.C. questions a competitor\u2019s eligibility in the category of \u201cmen\u2019s garments.\u201d (He was wearing a mink coat.) In another scene, the veteran performer Dorian Corey traces the evolution of the personal insult in the drag-ball community from \u201creading\u201d \u2014 identifying and picking apart a rival\u2019s physical or psychological flaws \u2014 to its more \u201cdeveloped\u201d iteration known as shade: \u201cShade is I don\u2019t tell you you\u2019re ugly, but I don\u2019t have to tell you, because you know you\u2019re ugly.\u201d", "Madonna\u2019s song and video for \u201cVogue,\u201d which came out the same year as the film, were lifted directly from competitive ball culture. \u201cVogueing,\u201d as one drag queen explains in \u201cParis Is Burning,\u201d is \u201clike taking two knives and cutting each other up, but through a dance form\u201d \u2014 in other words, a joyful and even more stylized expression of shade. Madonna\u2019s appropriation of the idea definitively marked the migration of shade from the grimy, cramped ballrooms of 1980s Manhattan into the mainstream. Soon, \u201cshade\u201d became a trend, a word co-opted to signal inside know\u00adledge of underground urban culture. In 1991, this magazine had a fashion spread titled \u201cThrowing Shade,\u201d which featured Naomi Campbell dressed in bomber jackets and catsuits, a style it called \u201cthe new black,\u201d whatever that was.", "Shade is currently having another moment, in no small part because of the ascendancy of the African-American vernacular in both popular culture and digital media. Perhaps the most famous avatar of shade right now, aside from the star of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d is the character Cookie Lyon, the star of Fox\u2019s hit show \u201cEmpire,\u201d played by Taraji P. Henson. Cookie, the ex-wife of a music mogul, is a fiercely proud, no-nonsense matriarch whose talent for delivering withering looks and devastating one-liners \u2014 \u201cThe streets ain\u2019t made for everybody, that\u2019s why they made sidewalks\u201d \u2014 is unmatched on television. (A Google search for the words \u201cCookie,\u201d \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cshade\u201d results in almost half a million hits.) But shade\u2019s most fertile terrain is the quippy, contentious milieu of social media, which prizes bursts of verbal virtuosity. In fact, shade is best served in small amounts: \u201cIf you go back to the tradition of the dozens, these were all short rhetorical structures that were designed to thrive in a sentence or two at best,\u201d says the poet Saeed Jones, who is also the literary editor at BuzzFeed.", "On the Internet, a complex grammar has developed around shade, retaining much of the pleasure and humor of its older iterations but with wider-reaching effects. Take the subtweet: a tweet objecting to something someone else has said or done without actually using that person\u2019s name. It\u2019s the digital equivalent of talking trash about someone at a dinner table without ever acknowledging the person\u2019s presence. Another shade-throwing tactic is to annotate a social-media outburst with stage directions like \u201c*sips tea*\u201d or \u201c*side-eye*,\u201d as if to say: \u201cI\u2019ll just sit back and demurely drink this beverage while I watch you act a fool and debase yourself.\u201d Shade may be most delightfully expressed through emoji \u2014 crying faces (your predictability and pitiful intelligence make me weep), googly eyes (that assertion was so absurd it exploded my brain), emergency-vehicle sirens (alert: We have a live one here). Emoji are so innocently goofy that they make for the ideal shade delivery system, allowing a person to publicly and blisteringly respond to other people\u2019s commentary without, you know, being blistering about it.", "Like the drag balls where shade thrived, hip-checking people online can be a competition, and when lots of people are fighting for approval and attention \u2014 Facebook likes, Twitter follows, Instagram comments \u2014 some of them will start to get sloppy. Jones laments the way in which the \u201chaute-couture rhetoric\u201d of shade has been cheapened \u201cinto ready-to-wear,\u201d explaining that shade actually \u201crequires a really critical reading you can\u2019t do casually.\u201d He adds: \u201cI think when most people talk about shade, they\u2019re describing being mean.\u201d True artists of shade have a smoldering quality, an assuredness that flashes in the eyes and ignites in the body. You can trace a direct lineage from New York drag queens, aggressively flaunting their style and sass on the makeshift catwalk, to a provocatively dressed Beyonc\u00e9 posing on the Met Gala red carpet, clutching her long blond ponytail in a gesture that simultaneously conveys both sexual ecstasy and queenly indifference. It would be a shame if shade, like other African-American art forms that have been taken up by mainstream culture, became diluted, its meaning encompassing any and every insult and attempt at one-upmanship. But maybe that\u2019s inevitable. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely in line with the tradition of American culture realizing that black people have figured something out,\u201d Jones says, with just a hint of, yeah, shade."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/business/media/rdio-introduces-a-cheaper-limited-subscription-for-music-streaming.html": ["In the latest volley in the music world\u2019s digital price war, Rdio, which competes with both Spotify and Pandora, has introduced a limited subscription version at $4 a month \u2014 significantly lower than the industry\u2019s $10 default price.", "Rdio, which like Spotify and other services offers streaming access to millions of songs, still sells its full-service unlimited version at $10 a month, as well as a Pandora-like radio feature that is free with advertising.

Nearly 40 percent of all text posted to Instagram contains at least one emoji in the photo caption, according to the company. In some countries, like Finland, that number climbs to more than 63 percent. In much of Europe, emoji are present in more than half of all Instagram captions.", "Instagram found that as emoji use rose across the app, the use of Internet slang formed from English letters went down, and that the two phenomena were strongly correlated. That could explain why you may be seeing fewer instances of \u201cLol\u201d on Instagram photo captions, while smiley face emoji are becoming more prevalent.", "\u201cIt is a rare privilege to observe the rise of a new language,\u201d Thomas Dimson, a software engineer on Instagram\u2019s data team, said in a company blog post on Friday. \u201cEmoji are becoming a valid and near-universal method of expression in all languages.\u201d", "Even as the limits of emoji characters are reached by the number of available emoji \u2014 around 700 by most standard shared measures \u2014 users are finding new ways to use them to communicate. Pairing two or more emoji together, for instance, can form rudimentary sentences or sentiments for others to understand. On Instagram, shoes and handbag emoji can often appear together, just as water and marine animals may often pop up alongside the bathing suit emoji.", "Instagram itself is a means of expression that does not require the use of words. The app\u2019s meteoric rise has largely been attributed to the power of images, the ease that comes, for instance, in looking at a photo of a sunset rather than reading a description of one.", "Other companies, like Snapchat, have also risen to fame and popularity through the expressive power of images.

Six officers on horseback fidgeted behind them, staring down at a crowd of about 40, an odd mixture of protesters, journalists and protester-journalists. Earlier in the afternoon, well over a thousand people marched from the Western District police station to City Hall to protest the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man whose spinal cord was severely injured while he was in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department. Only a handful of live-streamers, an older man in a kente-cloth kufi, five or six teenagers with bandannas drawn across their faces and two young women in cocktail attire who had just been kicked out of a wedding were left. Each person was filming the police.", "In the coming days, riots would convulse the city, with young people running through the streets, looting stores and setting fires, and the National Guard descending on their neighborhoods.

Bodies moved in the dark, but the faces \u2014 protesters and police officers alike \u2014 were lit up by the thin, lunar glow of cellphone screens.", "One protester was DeRay Mckesson, a 29-year-old former school administrator who has spent much of the past nine months attending and catalyzing such protests, from Ferguson, Mo., last summer and fall, to New York City and Milwaukee in December, to North Charleston, S.C., in April. Mckesson, who is from Baltimore, had returned to his hometown not long after Gray\u2019s death to join the protests.

On its screen, I could see the dramatic shot he had composed: the faces of police officers, flat and impassive. As the police marched their way up the street, Mckesson posted a Vine, a photo and a 30-second video to his 85,000 Twitter followers. \u201cWhat in the world is going on?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere\u2019s, like, how many hundred cops for 40 of us? This is wild.\u201d He walked backward at a slow pace, eyes on his screen.", "\u201cIt\u2019s strange to come home after all that time in St. Louis,\u201d he said, calmly. \u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s really driven home the saying: \u2018There\u2019s a Mike Brown in every town.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Since Aug. 9, 2014, when Officer Darren Wilson of the Ferguson Police Department shot and killed Michael Brown, Mckesson and a core group of other activists have built the most formidable American protest movement of the 21st century to date. Their innovation has been to marry the strengths of social media \u2014 the swift, morally blunt consensus that can be created by hashtags; the personal connection that a charismatic online persona can make with followers; the broad networks that allow for the easy distribution of documentary photos and videos \u2014 with an effort to quickly mobilize protests in each new city where a police shooting occurs.", "We often think of online activism as a shallow bid for fleeting attention, but the movement that Mckesson is helping to lead has been able to sustain the country\u2019s focus and reach millions of people. Among many black Americans, long accustomed to mistreatment or worse at the hands of the police, the past year has brought on an incalculable sense of anger and despair. For the nation as a whole, we have come to learn the names of the victims \u2014 Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Tony Robinson, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray \u2014 because the activists have linked their fates together in our minds, despite their separation by many weeks and thousands of miles.", "In the process, the movement has managed to activate a sense of red alert around a chronic problem that, until now, has remained mostly invisible outside the communities that suffer from it. Statistics on the subject are notoriously poor, but evidence does not suggest that shootings of black men by police officers have been significantly on the rise. Nevertheless, police killings have become front-page news and a political flash point, entirely because of the sense of emergency that the movement has sustained.", "The movement began with a single image: Michael Brown, lying facedown on the asphalt, a stream of blood running from his head. That picture, combined with the testimony of witnesses who claimed to see the teenager surrender before being shot several times, brought hundreds of people from St. Louis out to the scene of his death the same evening. The following day, Aug. 10, protests began on West Florissant Avenue nearby, as well as outside the Ferguson Police Department; the crowds demanded justice for Brown and that the name of the officer who shot him be released, prompting the police to come out in force. That night, the QuikTrip gas station on West Florissant burned, which in turn brought out the mainstream media and an even more militarized police response. By Aug. 13, images from the Ferguson protests \u2014 plumes of tear gas, armored vehicles in the streets, packs of heavily armed police officers wearing military fatigues \u2014 were leading the news.", "Mckesson watched all this from Minneapolis, where he was working in the public-school system. He was struck by the distance between the sensational accounts of rioting he saw on television and the reports he was reading on Twitter from people in Ferguson, who claimed that the cops had been firing tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds of peaceful protesters. Mckesson decided to go see the protests for himself.", "On the morning of Aug. 16, Mckesson drove to St. Louis. Inspired, in part, by the Twitter accounts he had been following \u2014 at the time, Mckesson had fewer than 900 followers and tweeted inconsistently \u2014 he decided to live-tweet the trip. Setting out, he tweeted: \u201cEn route.\u201d A couple hours later, he tweeted: \u201cSo, this stretch through Iowa has trucks that aren\u2019t very good drivers.\u201d And when he finally arrived in St. Louis, Mckesson noted: \u201cI should\u2019ve gotten gas in Iowa. Much more expensive in St. Louis.\u201d", "Mckesson arrived in Ferguson, and the next day he headed over to West Florissant, where he was tear-gassed. His terse, matter-of-fact updates, which had seemed almost comical when describing the banalities of everyday life, took on a forceful lucidity in the context of the protests, especially when they were accompanied by raw photographs from the scene.", "\u201cY\u2019all, tons of police,\u201d he tweeted that night. \u201cTear gas. It has begun #Ferguson.\u201d He added: \u201cAlso, the noise sirens are out. Tear gas feels like extreme peppermint tingling. F.Y.I. #Ferguson.\u201d Then, about an hour and 30 tweets later: \u201cPhone is dying. I am nowhere near my car. I am lost in #Ferguson. Really bad car accident. Looting across from it. Pray for me. #Ferguson.\u201d", "Mckesson was radicalized that night. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe that the police would fire tear gas into what had been a peaceful protest,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was running around, face burning, and nothing I saw looked like America to me.\u201d He also noticed that his account of that night\u2019s tear-gassings, along with a photo he took of the rapper J. Cole, had brought him quite a bit of attention on Twitter. Previously, Mckesson used the social-media platform to post random news articles that interested him, but now he was realizing its documentary power. He quickly grasped that a protester\u2019s effectiveness came mostly from his ability to be present in as many places as possible: He had to be on West Florissant when the police rolled up in armored vehicles; inside the St. Louis coffee shop MoKaBe\u2019s, a safe haven for the protesters in the city\u2019s Shaw neighborhood, when tear gas started to seep in through the front door; in front of the Ferguson Police Department when shots rang out. He had to keep up a steady stream of tweets and carry around a charger so his phone wouldn\u2019t die.", "Mckesson eventually returned to Minneapolis, but by then he had committed himself to the protests. He started traveling down to St. Louis every weekend. On one of those trips, Mckesson met Johnetta Elzie, a fellow protester who goes by Netta. They became fast friends.", "Elzie is \u201cDay 1,\u201d the term given to Ferguson protesters who showed up on Aug. 9. She grew up all around St. Louis, spending much of her childhood in the beauty salons where her mother worked. The day Michael Brown was killed, Elzie, who had been mourning the death of her mother, went down to Canfield Green, a housing complex near where Brown was shot, to pay her respects.", "The first thing Elzie did was tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s still blood on the ground where Mike Brown Jr was murdered. A cone in place where his body laid for hours today. #STL #Ferguson.\u201d She experimented with other networks to see if they could do a better job of spreading what she was seeing. \u201cI took an Instagram photo \u2014 there was one teddy bear; maybe three, four candles on the ground,\u201d she told me. \u201cI even tried Tumblr, a social-media platform that I never use. Those videos got hundreds of thousands of reposts.\u201d", "Over the next few weeks, Elzie, who studied journalism in college, emerged as one of the most reliable real-time observers of the confrontations between the protesters and the police. She took photos of the protest organizers, of the sandwiches she and her friends made to feed other protesters, of the Buddhist monks who showed up at the burned QuikTrip. Mckesson, too, was live-tweeting when he was back in Ferguson, integrating video and referring to protesters and police officers alike by name. Mckesson\u2019s tweets were usually sober and detailed, whereas Elzie\u2019s were cheerfully sarcastic, mock-heroic and forthright: a running account of events that felt intimate.", "Other voices came to the fore as well. There was Bassem Masri, perhaps Ferguson\u2019s most famous live-streamer, who attracted tens of thousands of viewers to nightly feeds that showed what the protests looked like beyond the media barricades. Another local activist, Ashley Yates, created T-shirts and hoodies that read \u201cASSATA TAUGHT ME\u201d \u2014 a reference to the former Black Panther Party member Assata Shakur \u2014 and that became part of the protest iconography. Clifton Kinnie, a senior in high school, organized other students throughout St. Louis. By the fall, these activists and a handful of others had gone from lone Internet figures to recognized faces of the movement.", "Mckesson and Elzie focused much of their attention on criticizing the mainstream media, who devoted too much airtime, they felt, to violence and discord among the protest community. As a corrective, in mid-September, they teamed up with Brittany Packnett, the executive director of St. Louis\u2019s Teach for America program, and Justin Hansford, a law professor at St. Louis University, to publish the This Is the Movement newsletter, which scrutinized and curated the daily news out of Ferguson. A wide range of readers, from reporters to protesters to officials within the Department of Justice, subscribed. Pretty soon, Mckesson and Elzie were appearing regularly on TV and radio. The two cultivated appealing personas, becoming easily recognizable to their many followers. Mckesson had begun wearing red shoes and a red shirt to protests. Later, he replaced this outfit with a bright blue Patagonia vest, which he now wears everywhere he goes. (Someone created a DeRay\u2019s vest Twitter account.) Elzie often wore dark lipstick, a pair of oversize sunglasses and a leather jacket: the beautician\u2019s daughter channeling a Black Panther.", "Mckesson and Elzie have always insisted that the movement is leaderless, that it is a communal expression of pent-up anguish spilling onto the streets, but over the fall, they were frequently called upon to serve as its spokespeople. Elzie was invited to conferences and panels, and talked with established social-justice activists around the country about the actions in Ferguson. Mckesson, who was dutifully putting out the newsletter during this time while still working at his job in Minneapolis, began using Twitter to announce actions throughout St. Louis. He and Elzie would tweet a time and location and then wait for the people to show up. By October, they were also being followed by the police, who would sometimes arrive at the scene of the action before the protesters themselves.", "Together, Mckesson and Elzie were developing a model of the modern protester: part organizer, part citizen journalist who marches through American cities while texting, as charging cords and battery packs fall out of his pockets. By Nov. 24, when Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecutor, announced that Darren Wilson would not be indicted on murder charges, a network of hundreds of organizers was already in place, ready to bring thousands of people into the streets with a tweet.", "I first met Mckesson on Dec. 7, the 121st day of continuous protests in Ferguson. Three days before, a grand jury in Staten Island decided not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, of the New York Police Department, on charges of killing Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, by choking him. Demonstrations broke out across the city, with major bridges and tunnels shut down every night by protesters, and Mckesson traveled to New York to join them. In Grand Central Terminal, I ran into a group of 30 protesters who had just performed a \u201cdie-in,\u201d lying quietly on the ground for four and a half minutes \u2014 the duration symbolizing the four and a half hours Michael Brown\u2019s body was left in the street. A handful of police officers stood by, looking bored and stern.", "The crowd headed outside into a cold rain and started up the chants: \u201cBlack lives matter!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d \u201cWe need freedom from these racist-ass cops!\u201d Three young white protesters in front of me \u2014 all dressed alike in thick, fur-fringed coats covered with see-through, formless rain ponchos \u2014 marched in a straight line with their phones set to video mode, holding them solemnly in the air like processional candles. At 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, near the New York Public Library\u2019s main branch, I saw Mckesson, recognizing him by his blue Patagonia vest. He was walking at the edge of the crowd, head buried in his phone.", "We walked with the group until it came to a halt in Times Square. Mckesson stood under a bank awning, shivering. When I asked why he didn\u2019t wear something warmer than a vest, he smiled and said, \u201cI feel bulletproof in this.\u201d", "An elderly man in an orange rain parka walked up to us and said he had been inspired by Mckesson\u2019s Twitter account and wanted to thank him for the work he did in Ferguson. \u201cYou just keep it up and stay safe,\u201d the man said. Mckesson, who speaks in a high-pitched, singsong voice, thanked the man for his kindness before turning his attention back to his phone.", "After the protest, Mckesson and I retired to a nearby cafe in a Japanese bookstore. Mckesson took out a large charging device, roughly the size of a deck of cards, and plugged in his white iPhone 6 Plus. Then, reaching into a vest pocket, he pulled out another white iPhone and plugged that in as well. Dozens of Twitter notifications piled up on his screen, and Mckesson shared them with me. Earlier that day, he asked if any of his followers knew the address of William Bratton, New York\u2019s police commissioner, thinking that he might organize a protest.", "In response, one person called Mckesson a \u201cMongoloid,\u201d while others asked if he was threatening Bratton\u2019s life. Some tweets were obliquely menacing: \u201cI look forward to seeing your ass rightfully beaten\u201d or \u201cI hope one of his Rottweilers takes a bite out of your ass.\u201d The tone of these replies went beyond standard trolling \u2014 an odd familiarity ran through them. The Twitter users, especially the more vicious ones, seemed to actually know Mckesson and some of his fellow protesters.", "\u201cThis is, like, every day,\u201d Mckesson told me. \u201cThe trolls are wild. They know where I am at all times.\u201d", "Mckesson had come to New York to attend workshops and to spread the word about actions in the city. He wanted to see if the wave of dissent that had gathered in the streets of Ferguson and radiated out across the Internet could become something substantial and organized. Two weeks later, after a series of actions involving tens of thousands of people, the murder of two New York police officers had a chilling effect on the street protests. For now, though, Mckesson was in his element, using his phone to create a connection between the outrage on social media and the actions in the streets.", "In the cafe, surrounded by shrink-wrapped pastries and a gathering of lucky cat figurines, he answered WhatsApp messages from fellow organizers and text messages from friends, and tried to fact-check a future tweet. When he wasn\u2019t sending out data, he was swiping down on Twitter to refresh his timeline with such frequency that it looked as if he were petting his phone.", "\u201cWhen I tweet, I\u2019m mostly preaching to the choir,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the heart of the movement is in the actions. It\u2019s in shutting down streets, shutting down Walmarts, shutting down any place where people feel comfortable. We want to make people feel as uncomfortable as we feel when we hear about Mike, about Eric Garner, about Tamir Rice. We want them to experience what we go through on a daily basis.\u201d", "Mckesson is a restless man. In the time we spent together, the only occasion I can recall him sitting in one spot for more than 15 minutes was in an Applebee\u2019s in St. Louis, where, after a long day of protests and TV interviews, he laid his head down next to a plate of salmon \u2014 he almost always orders salmon \u2014 and fell asleep. But his habit of seeing every minute of relaxation as a minute lost serves his activism well. In the rare quiet moments between police shootings and actions, Mckesson tweets and retweets stats, trivia, inspirational messages and the names of the dead.", "NYC TV stations report crimes committed by blacks more frequently than they even occur.", "Love is the Why.", "Justice is not an abstract concept. Justice is a living Mike Brown. Justice is Tamir playing outside again. Justice is Darren Wilson in jail.", "I once watched Mckesson spend a good five minutes trying to edit down a tweet that ran long before calling one of his closest friends. They talked through the tweet together. Ultimately they landed on this: \u201cBlackness in America is never a question of afraid or unafraid; it\u2019s a matter of varying degrees of fear, as we are victims of state terror.\u201d This obsessive focus is evident in every part of Mckesson\u2019s life. He makes a point to never curse in public. He is too busy to watch movies or television. He does not have a boyfriend (some in the movement have objected to having a gay man in a prominent position). And although fellow protesters sometimes call him \u201cthe storyteller,\u201d his tweets gain their force from their concision and relentlessness rather than from narrative flair.", "Mckesson grew up in Baltimore, the son of drug addicts; his mother left the family when he was 3, so his father and great-grandmother raised him and his sister. Starting in sixth grade, Mckesson was elected to the student government every year all the way through college. He went to Bowdoin, the small, elite liberal-arts college in Maine, paying part of his own way through a work-study job in the mailroom. During lulls, he would study the rows of mailboxes in the student union, trying to learn the name of every student on campus, hoping it would give him an edge in the coming campaigns. He also worked as a campus tour guide and diligently honed his patter. When he found that he was stumbling through the list of languages Bowdoin offered, he practiced reciting them. When he saw that prospective students weren\u2019t reacting to his presentation as enthusiastically as he hoped, he tweaked his delivery until he got it right. There is a touching earnestness to Mckesson that makes you want to believe everything he says.", "\u201cThere was a whole generation of Bowdoin students who came to the college because of the campus tours DeRay would do,\u201d said Barry Mills, the president of Bowdoin, who considers Mckesson a close friend. \u201cHe\u2019s always known how to inspire a group of people, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that he\u2019s become a thought leader for what\u2019s going on out in Ferguson.\u201d", "After graduating in 2007, Mckesson joined Teach for America and taught middle school for two years in East New York, Brooklyn, before moving back home to Baltimore to work in H.R. for the city\u2019s schools. He developed a reputation as a ruthless administrator \u2014 every hiring and firing was justified, in his own mind, by what was best for the kids in the district.", "His career, both academic and professional, was built on an unusual faith in effecting change from within a bureaucratic organization, whether a student government or the city public-school system. But when he saw Michael Brown lying dead in the street, he felt as if he had come up against the edge of that belief. \u201cI kept thinking, Kids can\u2019t learn if they\u2019re dead,\u201d he told me.", "There is an indelible picture of Mckesson taken on his first full day in Ferguson. He is standing by the side of the road, right fist raised defiantly in the air; in his left hand, he holds a cardboard sign that reads: \u201cMy Blackness Is Not a Weapon. #handsup #dontshoot.\u201d Behind him are the dull greenery of St. Louis in August and hints of the one-story, uniform brick houses off West Florissant. After a night of photographing and documenting everyone else at the protest, Mckesson, the education executive with a six-figure salary, finally turned the camera around on himself, revealing the awkward resolve of a student-body president who had lost confidence in all those systems and was trying something new.", "In March, Mckesson and Elzie traveled to Selma, Ala., for the 50th-anniversary commemoration of Bloody Sunday, the pivotal moment in the civil rights era when protesters marching on the Edmund Pettus Bridge were brutally attacked on national television by Alabama state troopers. I stood with Mckesson on the bridge. \u201cWe\u2019re really up high,\u201d he said, staring down at the brown waters of the Alabama River. \u201cCan you imagine having all those troopers on horseback riding toward you, trying to beat you down? Where do you run? You definitely can\u2019t jump over the side here.\u201d All day, hundreds of tourists had been walking over the bridge, solemnly touching its supports and snapping selfies in front of its historical markers. If Mckesson was feeling the sway of the 50th anniversary, he betrayed no emotion. Instead, he asked me how far I thought the drop was down to the river, and started searching Google for answers.", "Mckesson and Elzie have each expressed ambivalence over whether the youth movement should try to draw from the popular image of the civil rights movement. They worry that the constant comparisons with something that happened 50 years ago will dilute the immediacy of today\u2019s protests. Much as they admire the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 each is well versed in his writings \u2014 they feel his legacy has been distorted. He is held up as an avatar of genteel protest, invoked by conservative politicians and leaders in the black community as a way to discredit their movement. Mckesson and Elzie frequently point out that King was in fact a revolutionary who believed in the power of confrontation, and that it\u2019s a crime against American history to confuse the real King with an appealingly passive one. To make their point, they participated in an action called #ReclaimMLK, which sought to counter \u201cefforts to reduce a long history marred with the blood of countless women and men into iconic images of men in suits behind pulpits.\u201d", "\u201cAlso,\u201d Elzie often says whenever someone brings up King as a way of questioning their work, \u201cthey killed him too.\u201d", "If you ask Mckesson and Elzie why there is no central figure in today\u2019s movement, they will again insist on the advantages of leaderlessness. If you bring up legislative reform, they will point out that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been all but rolled back and that their aims go well beyond small changes to the criminal-justice system. If you bring up nonviolence as the only civilized way to effect change, they will recite King\u2019s words: \u201cA riot is the language of the unheard,\u201d or they will say they don\u2019t condone rioting, but they understand it. Their resistance to confining the civil rights movement to a museum made Mckesson and Elzie an awkward fit for Selma, which was filled with people doing just that.", "At dinner that night in Montgomery, Mckesson and Elzie received the news that a 19-year-old unarmed black man, Tony Robinson, had been shot and killed in Madison, Wis. They spent the meal with their heads bent over their phones, compiling and tweeting out all the information they could confirm through their sources in the Madison protest community. Piece by piece, a digital portrait of Robinson emerged: a photo of him in a graduation gown, his arm around a female friend; a few tweets he sent out in the days before his death. Then, around midnight, dinner long gone by, Mckesson sighed and held up his phone to show Elzie a photo of the front steps of Robinson\u2019s home, which were streaked with blood. \u201cThat\u2019s where they dragged him out of his house,\u201d Mckesson said.", "The next morning, in the lobby of the education center at Selma\u2019s George C. Wallace State Community College, Mckesson and Elzie took selfies with Diane Nash and her son Douglass Bevel. In the early \u201960s, Nash, along with Bernard Lafayette Jr., John Lewis and others, founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (S.N.C.C.). She also helped organize the Freedom Riders, helped lead the march from Selma to Montgomery and played a key role in the push to integrate lunch counters throughout the South. Between photos, Nash talked to another admirer about a call she had received from one of Bobby Kennedy\u2019s aides, who pleaded with her to cancel an action because Kennedy thought there was a good chance people would be killed.", "Mckesson and Elzie seemed almost star-struck, peppering Nash with questions about the civil rights movement and then posting her answers on Twitter. Mckesson told Nash she needed to get on Twitter to share her wisdom.", "\u201cTwitter?\u201d Nash asked. \u201cI just figured out how to have a Facebook.\u201d", "\u201cTwitter is the revolution, Ms. Nash,\u201d Mckesson said.", "For him, the social network seemed to have become not just the site of revolution but the conduit for his ideas. Two days later, on the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, Mckesson was scheduled to speak at a rally before a ceremonial crossing of the bridge. As we drove from Montgomery to Selma, Mckesson wrote drafts of tweets on his phone.", "\u201cI do this to make sure what I say can be tweetable,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd it helps me be precise in what I say.\u201d", "He muttered lines to himself. \u201cWe must always confront,\u201d he said, but something about the phrase displeased him. He deleted the words and started from the top.", "Mckesson and Elzie arrived in Selma and walked to the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, the starting point for the original march across the bridge. Inside, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. was addressing the congregation. The crowd outside was made up largely of union members carrying placards for their local chapters. Mckesson, Elzie and Packnett, who arrived the night before, tried to find a contact who would take them to the foot of the bridge, where Mckesson would speak. After 20 minutes of confusion, they walked back through the crowd to a small auditorium off Broad Street, where Bernard Lafayette Jr. was holding a book signing. When they walked in, an elderly woman said, loudly enough for all to hear, \u201cSocial media just showed up.\u201d", "In the end, Mckesson did not get to deliver his speech. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who followed Holder, went long, and there was no time left.", "In an interview with People magazine to promote the release of the film \u201cSelma,\u201d Oprah Winfrey voiced some of the questions skeptics have had about the modern protest movement. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful to march and to protest, and it\u2019s wonderful to see, all across the country, people doing it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I\u2019m looking for is some kind of leadership to come out of this to say: \u2018This is what we want. This is what has to change, and these are the steps that we need to take to make these changes, and this is what we\u2019re willing to do to get it.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Certain factions of the movement have made explicit demands. During the Eric Garner protests in New York, a group called the Justice League NYC, which is affiliated with Harry Belafonte, came out with a list that included the immediate firing of Officer Pantaleo and the appointment of a special prosecutor. In the wake of the Department of Justice\u2019s report on Ferguson, some people within the St. Louis protest community demanded the recall of Mayor James Knowles III. But on the whole, the movement does shy away from specific policy prescriptions. Instead, the work seems to be aimed at an abrupt, wide-scale change in consciousness, channeling the grief and anger that these police killings engender around the country. The pipelines for that energy are still under construction, but asking the leaders of the youth movement what they plan on doing with it is akin to barging into a funeral and asking the mourners why they haven\u2019t donated their inheritance to charity yet.", "Soon after I met them, Mckesson and Elzie took me on a tour of some of the sites around St. Louis where black men have been killed by the police. Many of the buildings that burned during the protests were standing in ruin. \u201cThey want to leave them all up,\u201d Elzie said, referring to the St. Louis city government. \u201cThey want this to be a museum of black rage.\u201d As we drove from the Six Stars Market, where Kajieme Powell, 25, was shot in August, to the gas station where Antonio Martin, 18, was killed in December, Elzie talked about the emotion behind the movement and how, for many people in St. Louis, the Ferguson protests represented the first time they were able to collectively voice their frustrations with the police. \u201cOur demand is simple,\u201d Elzie said. \u201cStop killing us.\u201d", "The starkness of that demand has been enough to create some measure of change, purely by creating an atmosphere of awareness and constant urgency around an issue that was previously ignored. Although Ferguson\u2019s mayor was not recalled, the Department of Justice report did lead to the resignation of the police chief, the city manager and a handful of city employees who sent racist emails. The swiftness with which the movement now acts, and the volume of people it can bring out to every protest, have turned every police killing into a national referendum on the value of black lives in America.", "In April, after cellphone video footage showed a North Charleston police officer firing eight times at the back of a 50-year-old black man named Walter Scott as he was running away, the officer was arrested and booked on murder charges the same day, and nearly every prospective candidate in the coming presidential election subsequently released a statement, expressing horror at Scott\u2019s death and promising to address criminal-justice-system reform. Later that month, after riots broke out in Baltimore, Hillary Clinton gave a speech at Columbia University in which she explicitly allied herself with the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement, and implicitly rejected some policies that her husband put in place during his presidency. Her proposals were hardly specific or new: widespread adoption of body cameras by police officers, \u201ca renewed focus on working with communities to prevent crime\u201d and a call for a \u201ctrue national debate\u201d on how to end the \u201cera of mass incarceration,\u201d but the fact that Clinton chose to address these issues at such length suggests that police reform will be an unavoidable subject during the campaign season. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen in Baltimore should, indeed does, tear at our soul,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd from Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable.\u201d She listed the names of Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and Freddie Gray, and called for \u201creal reforms that can be felt on our streets, in our courthouses and our jails and prisons, in communities too long neglected.\u201d", "Perhaps the most telling evidence of change was the charges filed on May 1 against six Baltimore police officers related to the death of Freddie Gray, which ranged from misconduct in office to second-degree depraved heart murder. While making the announcement, Marilyn Mosby, the Baltimore state\u2019s attorney, said: \u201cTo the people of Baltimore and the demonstrators across America, I heard your call for \u2018no justice, no peace.\u2019 Your peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man.\u201d", "The attention that political figures are paying to the movement points to real anxiety that African-American voters who supported President Obama won\u2019t turn out again. \u201cThis issue is at the forefront of people in the black community,\u201d Quentin James, co-founder of the public-affairs firm Vestige Strategies, which specializes in engaging communities of color, told me. \u201cNot voting is a choice, and many may choose to stay home. If you look at a pivotal state like Ohio, African-Americans ended up overvoting in 2012. If they undervote in 2016, the election becomes a little bit shakier.\u201d", "In talking about the problem of police violence at all, these national political figures are reversing a three-decade presumption within the Democratic Party, one established by Bill Clinton himself in 1994, that there is zero incentive to advocate for the rights of criminal suspects. \u201cThe narrative used to be: \u2018We support the police and whatever police unions say,\u2019\u2009\u201d James said. \u201cThat has changed. Technology, having a video camera anywhere, has changed the game.\u201d", "Most of the activists are deeply skeptical that the candidates will follow through on their promises. Rachel Gilmer, the associate director for the African American Policy Forum, pointed to the long history of Democratic candidates who have \u201cembraced rhetoric that implies their willingness and readiness to produce systemic change. However, once they\u2019ve solidified our support and are elected into office, we\u2019ve seen that they aren\u2019t willing to confront or align themselves with the powers, systems and interests that continue to exploit black lives.\u201d Gilmer went on to say that, absent a candidate who would be willing to address white supremacy directly, many within the movement would be content to opt out of voting for \u201cthe lesser of two evils.\u201d", "But perhaps the question of political follow-through is misplaced. \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d is a vital statement, especially when people are confronted with all the footage that shows police officers who may not agree. But it is more a provocation than a platform, a phrase that might be more appropriate for a rally than a sustained political movement. Jim Crow was an evil that could be addressed by Congress and argued against before the Supreme Court. But how do you legislate the worth of black lives? Could a law force a police officer to cut out the possible prejudice and fear he feels when he sees a young black man, however seemingly unarmed, reach for his waistband?", "For now, the victories of the movement are difficult to quantify \u2014 the paradox, perhaps, of a movement that exists to raise awareness of death. Shortly after Tony Robinson was shot and killed in Madison, Mike Koval, the city\u2019s police chief, released the name of the officer involved and visited Robinson\u2019s mother. In an interview with CNN, Koval said: \u201cWe have a person of color cut down in his prime \u2014 he was unarmed \u2014 by a police officer. So whether I like it or not, I am inextricably tied to the Ferguson phenomenon.\u201d", "\u201cDo I think that was influenced by the protests in Ferguson?\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cYes. But Tony\u2019s still dead, so how do you call that a win?\u201d", "On April 26, a bright, warm Sunday in Baltimore, Mckesson attended Freddie Gray\u2019s wake. Across the street from the funeral home, a group of demonstrators held up signs that read: \u201cWe are ONE Baltimore,\u201d \u201cOur hearts are with you\u201d and \u201cWe grieve with you.\u201d Television crews had set up nearby. A cable-news anchor grabbed Mckesson and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the esteemed DeRay.\u201d The two had met back in St. Louis. Mckesson agreed to come back later that afternoon to record a short interview.", "Inside, Gray\u2019s body was laid out behind a gauzy shroud. His head, swollen and shiny, was covered by a white baseball cap. A pair of spotless white sneakers had been placed on his feet.", "Looking at the body, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that in the coming months, more incidents would arise in more American cities. Nobody can predict where and when these killings may happen, only that they will happen, and that the movement will continue to draw attention to them, and that the sense of grief within black America and of constant siege at the hands of the police will not abate.", "\u201cThey never look like they do in life,\u201d Mckesson said. \u201cBeing back here, it reminds me of how many funerals we attend.\u201d", "We walked back to Mckesson\u2019s rental car. A big man in a tank top stood in the center of the road, holding up a sign that asked passing drivers to honk for Freddie Gray. \u201cWe come in peace!\u201d he screamed. \u201cWe come in peace!\u201d", "I asked Mckesson what his thoughts were after seeing Gray\u2019s body.", "\u201cI just tweeted my thoughts,\u201d Mckesson said. Over the five months I had been following him and Elzie around, from Ferguson to New York to Selma and now to Baltimore, I found that Mckesson often tweeted the answers to my questions before I could think to ask them. I took out my phone to check Twitter, but this time Mckesson saved me the effort.", "\u201cI\u2019m not desensitized to death,\u201d he said. \u201cI just expect trauma now and am trying to steel myself for what\u2019s coming next.\u201d For the first time since I met him, Mckesson seemed overcome by emotion.

In other words, it\u2019s time for another wake-up call.", "Goodman\u2019s book is a continuation of the ideas introduced his 2012 TED talk, which opens with the line, \u201cI study the future of crime and terrorism, and frankly, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d and goes on to paint in very broad strokes the ways technology could be manipulated. Examples include terrorists who can use Google Earth and smartphones to coordinate attacks and futuristic drug cartels that could synthetically alter organisms to produce illegal narcotics.", "The audiobook version expands Goodman\u2019s 20-minute TED talk into 20 hours, and the chapter on hacked homes, which details perpetrators infiltrating laptop webcams and baby monitors to spy and harass, makes for gripping listening. (Goodman reads the prologue to the book and then hands the baton to the actor and seasoned audiobook narrator Robertson Dean, who marathons through the rest.) At other times, however, the audiobook of \u201cFuture Crimes\u201d is much harder to follow. Dean is a capable reader, but the information being delivered is so dense that it becomes difficult to absorb. While I was listening, it occurred to me that this material might do better with an interactive, multimedia approach, something more immersive that demands your attention. In fact, I resorted to reading the 400-page physical book in tandem, to ensure that I was getting Goodman\u2019s point.", "Early on in \u201cFuture Crimes,\u201d Goodman, who has worked in law enforcement and technology, states his case: \u201cThe cornucopia of technology that we are accepting into our lives, with little or no self-reflection or thoughtful examination, may very well come back and bite us.\u201d He implores us to take responsibility for the world unspooling before us, which is an important and admirable cause. Many consumers who purchased items like connected-\u00adhome devices and keyless cars or applauded Amazon\u2019s plans to employ delivery drones have not considered the most extreme scenarios that each leap forward could initiate.", "Goodman writes that 600,000 Facebook accounts are compromised each day, a scary statistic. He describes how app stores are manipulated by scammers who sell fake versions of apps and can suck down sensitive personal information in the process. He points out the ways Facebook, Twitter and Google obfuscate how they make money from the erosion of your privacy, and how ineffective antivirus software can be, creating a false sense of security, which hackers can exploit. He is right to ask, What happens when our automated work forces are hacked? What happens to our homes? Our bodies?", "But many of these questions aren\u2019t actually answered or reported on. Goodman declines to explain or investigate the pushback by activists or any number of products developed to help combat surveillance culture, some of them funded via crowdsourcing sites like Kickstarter. He also doesn\u2019t acknowledge that some of the most invasive new services on the market have failed to gain traction in any mainstream way, like Apple Pay and Google Glass. Instead, Goodman focuses on the theoretical ways our technology could turn against us, if we let it. For example, he talks about the introduction of \u201cRFID tattoos\u201d and pills that can make the human body an authentication token, as if those are soon to be available in every bodega on the corner. (Spoiler alert: They won\u2019t be.)", "At the same time, some of his examples are almost archaic. Goodman brings up the study that analyzed the Facebook profiles of college students and accurately guessed their sexual orientation most of the time, which was a genuinely unsettling moment in social media history. It also happened in 2009 \u2014 eons ago for many of Facebook\u2019s current users. What\u2019s changed since then? The way social networks are becoming public record is a topic of tremendous importance, and it could have been addressed by simply tracking down the study\u2019s authors and including an interview with them. But Goodman prefers to trot out well-documented examples of privacy breaches than really explore the ways in which we are truly vulnerable. He neglects to get into more urgent questions like: Are minority communities at higher risk from a culture of surveillance? How does the erosion of anonymity and privacy online affect those who are susceptible to targeting and harassment? What laws, if any, have been passed to help prevent the crimes he describes at length in this book? How have countries been grappling with legislation around \u201crevenge porn,\u201d or the sharing of explicit images without consent? While Goodman acknowledges the \u00adreal-world threats of sexual extortion, he focuses mainly on more abstract threats to personal property, like cars and homes.

Instead we watch virtual animals moving across a world of eternal daylight built from a patchwork of layered satellite and aerial imagery, a flattened, static landscape free of happenstance: There are no icy winds over high mountain passes, heavy rains, soaring hawks, ripening crops or recent droughts. Despite these simplifications, following a tagged animal on a map is an addictive pursuit. It\u2019s hard not to become invested in its fate. The bird might die, the tag might fail. You do not know where it will travel next. The bird is unaware of the eyes that watch its progress, and you veer from a sense of power at your ability to surveil at a distance to the knowledge that you are powerless to influence what happens next.", "The more you watch, the more you feel that you are somehow taking the cuckoo\u2019s journey, too, that you are engaged on a virtual exploration of the globe. The fantasy of a borderless world is quickly replaced by visions of heroic exploration. You take up the part of a lone traveler engaged on an arduous quest to cross countries and conquer unknown spaces on the map. Because satellite tracking is expensive, we can follow the progress of only a few named animals. We become attached to them as they make their astonishing journeys. We watch young cuckoos find their way to Africa with no parental help. We see loggerhead turtles swim nearly 7,500 miles from feeding grounds off Mexico to the beaches of Japan to nest; discover bar-headed geese migrating over the Himalayas and enduring extreme and sudden changes in elevation that would disable or kill a human; we marvel at the bar-tailed godwits that make a nine-day, 11,000-kilometer nonstop flight from Alaska to New Zealand across the Pacific Ocean. To us, these appear remarkable feats of physical endurance; we cannot help measuring the capacities of animals against our own.", "This unconscious desire to see ourselves in the lives of animals is shared by the scientists engaged in these projects, who often think of the tagged animals as colleagues and collaborators. Tom Maechtle, a biologist and environmental consultant who worked on raptor migration at the University of Maryland, has spoken of how satellite tracking \u201cturns the animal into a partner with the researcher\u201d and suggested that you can think of tagged falcons as biologists who have been \u201csent out to find and sample other birds.\u201d", "Animals are increasingly regarded not only as scientific researchers but also as scientific-research equipment like sensors or probes. In one project studying climate change in West Antarctica, for example, elephant seals with tags glued to their foreheads collect and transmit data on ocean conductivity, temperature and depth that is used for weather forecasting and climate research. This notion of autonomous biological sampling devices not only confuses the distinctions between technology and living organisms but also erases the animal\u2019s agency.", "Tagged animals carry more than human technology; they carry human ways of visualizing the world. They are hybrid beasts that perfectly fit our modern conception of the planet as an environment under constant watch, where eyes in the sky track animals moving from one country to another and plot them on a map just as they do moving ships and aircraft; a world where Defense Department researchers are working on autonomous flying robots that mimic the flight of hawks and insects, where scientists fit electronic backpacks on giant flower beetles that enable them to be flown and steered by remote control.", "Early pioneers in the remote tracking of animals sought military funding for their efforts and suggested that bird migration studies could be used to improve navigation and missile-guidance systems: The development of technology suitable for animal surveillance came from a microelectronics industry with strong early links to the military. In our age of drone warfare, it is hard not to see each animal being tracked across the map symbolically extending the virtues of technological dominance and global surveillance.", "If the stuffed pfeilstorch in the German museum is the iconic bird of early animal-migration science, perhaps today\u2019s equivalent is another stork, a young bird called M\u00e9nes, satellite-tagged in Hungary in 2013 as part of an avian-migration tracking project sponsored by a European cross-border cooperation program. After leaving his nest, M\u00e9nes traveled south across Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Israel, landed in the Nile Valley in Egypt, and was there captured by a fisherman and taken into police custody. The stork, carrying a \u201csuspicious electronic device,\u201d was suspected of being a spy.", "There are photographs of him behind bars, half in shadow, beak lowered and toes spread upon concrete, a mournful casualty of a country in the grip of deep political tensions. News media reports of his plight cast his story as one of almost comical paranoia. But although the stork was innocent \u2014 an unwitting player in a geopolitical game of surveillance and intelligence \u2014 the hybrid being made of the stork and device was less clearly so. Security experts cleared M\u00e9nes of espionage, and the bird was released, only to be later found dead on an island near Aswan.

We also try to verify these accounts on the ground and through social media like Facebook and Twitter, though it is obviously hard to go on the ground to check each incident.", "I studied the use of open mapping for my Ph.D. and saw how it was heavily used during the earthquake in Haiti. I came back to Nepal after finishing my studies in 2011, and started mobilizing an OpenStreetMap community of volunteers to map major points of interests like roads, buildings, schools and hospitals. Before the earthquake, we had the most detailed map of Kathmandu Valley in the country. After the earthquake, we expanded beyond Kathmandu and teamed up with Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, a group of open mappers focused on humanitarian relief mainly from abroad.", "How do you measure your impact?", "It is a bit too early to say since we went live on Monday, but we are working with several humanitarian groups on a daily basis, including the Red Cross and the Nepali Army, to provide maps of road blocks and displaced people.", "What challenges are you facing?", "It is hard to track satellite images outside of Kathmandu especially because of rain. It\u2019s also hard to effectively mobilize so many volunteers across different time zones. We\u2019re a small nonprofit, and we weren\u2019t prepared for the scale of this disaster. The building we are working in is not very safe and we need more computers.", "\u25a0 Expert\u2019s Take:", "Dale Kunce, a senior engineer at American Red Cross International Services, said Mr. Budhathoki\u2019s project was providing data that the Red Cross gives to its relief staff on the ground. \u201cWe have a longstanding relationship with the team and we\u2019ve been using them as a sounding board,\u201d he said.

My 9-year-old nephew is still afraid to climb the stairs past the first floor in case something happens.", "How are you using technology to help in relief efforts?", "Indiegogo is a site much like Kickstarter, but people use it for fund-raising. The whole idea was to use me and my cousin Aditya\u2019s network of friends in the United States to raise money. We raised $20,000 within the first 12 hours. Overnight, after I took photos of the destruction and shared them on Facebook, it shot up to $40,000. People are engaging with us because I\u2019m posting video updates, responding to the press and connecting with individuals.

A friend at an Indian airline was able to help me figure out how to get the aid here. I\u2019ve had to tell people only to collect things I\u2019m asking for on behalf of the NGO; we\u2019d rather get cash than donations for things we don\u2019t need. That\u2019s the message the government should be telling people.", "In Nepal, we don\u2019t have a good, structured, central way of handling disasters, so we depend heavily on international aid and NGOs. The country needs to be thankful for them, but after they leave, the burden shifts to local NGOs who don\u2019t have international connections to raise money. My aim is to get money for local NGOs to do relief work for the foreseeable future, one or two years. One hundred rupees, or one dollar, goes a long way in a small village in Nepal. That\u2019s two or three big meals.", "How do you ensure that your efforts make an impact on the ground?", "We\u2019ve identified three areas for the money to go: child care, women\u2019s issues and sanitation.

Our house has some cracks. Nothing life-threatening though.", "How are you using technology to help in relief efforts?", "I\u2019m using technology to do three things:", "1. Create low-tech solutions to connect volunteers and people affected, and vice versa. Our #Nepalquake resource doc, which disseminates information about food, shelter, clean water and medicine for victims of the earthquake, has been shared more than 7,000 times on Facebook, and more than 50 volunteers actively curate, verify and connect people using that document. Because many Nepalis are on Facebook, and it\u2019s easy to use it even with slow Internet in Nepal, we have been using Facebook ads to inform people. Facebook is kind of like radio for us.", "2. We are using Viber to get latest status updates on volunteers, or at times to help with urgent needs, blast those needs via Twitter and/or Facebook and do our best to find volunteers who can help people.", "3.

The document has been shared roughly 8,000 times on social media. A local group of volunteers and people in need are using this document to coordinate. A group reached out to me saying they want to use our doc to build an app. Our Facebook ads have reached at least 70,000 people. I get 4 to 8 calls a day about coordination. From the response, I believe many people are using this document.", "How do you ensure that your efforts make an impact on the ground?", "We do our best to follow-up. For example, a young woman based in Virginia called me using Viber about a victim trapped on the outskirts of Kathmandu.", "When she called me, she sounded very worried. I assured her that if she sends me more details, I\u2019ll work with contacts and will do our best to help. I sent out information to our contacts, and we were told volunteers were dispatched who were already in the area. After 24 hours, I contacted the woman again and she told me the victim got some help. And also told me that people in nearby area need more help.", "Our volunteers also call people listed on the document about their latest status and what they need. They then update the document reflecting any changes on the ground.", "That being said, we don\u2019t know if all of the information is accurate, since it\u2019s a publicly crowdsourced document.

The lines outside Ansel\u2019s bakery seemed to embody all that was wrong with New York in its new Gilded Age: its vulnerability to hype and its willingness to pay obscene prices and endure penitential inconveniences at the hands of culinary auteurs. Almost immediately after the Cronut\u2019s debut, a Craigslist-based black-market economy of Cronut scalpers materialized, charging between $20 and $40 per Cronut. At the height of the craze, one group of scalpers was charging $100 per Cronut and $5,000 for a 20-piece order.", "Ansel knew a good thing when he saw it. Within nine days, he had trademarked the Cronut name, and he has aggressively pursued any other bakery seen to be profiting from his creation ever since \u2014 so aggressively that last fall, his legal counsel mistakenly sent a cease-and-desist letter to a Reno bakery that reportedly hadn\u2019t even used the trademarked word.

Two years later, the circus has moved on \u2014 and yet the Cronut, and the Cronut line, endure. But why?", "It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Cronut is in fact delicious. It\u2019s a croissant built into a doughnut, with a cream filling and lots of sugar; what more could you want? But Ansel\u2019s genius lies as much in his restriction of the Cronut\u2019s availability as in its material qualities. What a happy accident that his kitchen is so small, and that only so many Cronuts can be made! (It is perhaps no accident, though, that the Cronut will not be available at the larger, made-to-order bakery Ansel just opened in the West Village.) According to Ansel\u2019s website, the bakery still restricts its output to about 350 Cronuts each day.

We\u2019d like to think that the Cronut is something special and sophisticated: after all, Ansel is French. Each flavor is topped with a different color of frosting, and each pastry is packed delicately, an elegant box in an elegant bag.

(She had not been impressed, she said, by some of Ansel\u2019s other offerings, like the cookie shot and his variation on the Paris-Brest cream-puff pastry.) Jessica admitted her bafflement at other phenomena requiring line-waiting, like Shakespeare in the Park, but appreciated the order Ansel imposed at his bakery. \u201cThank God there\u2019s a process,\u201d she said.", "Ansel\u2019s security guard came out and counted everyone in line.

She had barely even seen snow.", "To combat the cold weather, she had taken to piling on so many layers that she seemed to double in size. But two decades as a competitor had given Souza a sharp sense of what she wanted and the will and single-mindedness to pursue it, and she had thrown herself into aerials with the same fervor she had once reserved for gymnastics.", "Aerials is a modern discipline created to appeal to younger people for whom traditional winter sports like figure skating and biathlon can seem fusty and unattractive. Packed with fancy, daring maneuvers that grow splashier and more dangerous every year, aerials is a recent concoction that resembles classic downhill skiing about as much as Zumba resembles the waltz.", "In aerials, skiers glide down steep ramps at more than 40 miles per hour, launch themselves high into the air, execute a series of flips and twists, land on a slope below and then ski away. Gymnasts \u2014 with their exquisite body control, fine acrobatic ability and almost masochistic capacity to train for hours at a time until they get even the tiniest move right \u2014 can, with proper instruction, make excellent aerialists. Some of the world\u2019s best aerialists began as gymnasts.", "Souza\u2019s mood was buoyant as she looked down the slope that day, Jan. 28, 2014. Giddy with excitement from her Olympics news, she was reveling in a morning of freedom before the pressures ahead. Skiing alongside her were the two people who had been her constant companions for the previous half-year: Ryan Snow, her Canadian coach, and Josi Santos, 28, her teammate and friend, a fellow recruit from Brazilian gymnastics.", "Santos had also learned her Olympic fate that day, and her news was disappointing: She had failed to qualify. But she felt that she shared Souza\u2019s triumph \u2014 the women were so close \u2014 and given how fluid these things could be, there was still a chance that a spot might open up at the last minute.", "The women were not training on the aerials ramp, but simply skiing downhill. Skiing is considered the easiest part of aerials, which, somewhat curiously, hardly involves skiing at all \u2014 just a little on the approach and a little after the landing \u2014 so this juncture on the mountain was a kind of punctuation mark in their training.", "Double Jack is a black diamond run, meaning that it is meant for experts and is much trickier than any slope aerialists might face in competition. But Snow had confidence that Souza and Santos, superb athletes who had taken instantly to skiing, would be able to handle it.", "The run, bordered by pine and aspen trees, cuts down the mountain at a sharp angle, with the first of several abrupt drops not far from the top. There are no clear sightlines up or down; crossing each ridge can feel like going over a waterfall.", "It was to be the three skiers\u2019 last run of a long and happy morning before they broke for lunch and called it a day. Snow went first, then Santos, then Souza.", "But something was not right. Double Jack was dotted with moguls, mini-hillocks of packed snow that require swift maneuvers to navigate. They can be tricky, especially if you are not used to them, and the Brazilians were not. They felt tense and tentative, worried about avoiding the bumps, worried that the turns would hurt their gymnastics-battered knees.", "What happened next happened quickly, in a blur. Snow and Santos missed it, so they do not know the details. For Souza, the memory has splintered into elusive fragments, shards of moments with no coherent narrative.", "But the story she sees in her mind always ends the same way: She is lying helpless in the snow. Her coach is kneeling above her, tears spilling down his face. And the stillness of the mountain has been shattered by the angry, whirring blades of the helicopter that has come to take her to the hospital.", "From the time she was a girl in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil, Souza seemed destined for a vocation in which she would not have to sit still. She was hyperactive, fidgety, forever climbing over something or bending her body into unlikely shapes and throwing it into places it was not meant to be.", "\u201cShe was always moving \u2014 running here, running there, always active, very restless,\u201d her mother, Odete, said. \u201cShe stopped only to sleep.\u201d", "Any moment, any thing, was a new opportunity. The living room couch served as a piece of multipurpose gym equipment \u2014 an all-in-one balance beam, bars, floor and vault that Souza would leap over as naturally as someone else might sit down. As a tiny child, she had a habit of vanishing \u2014 there one moment, gone the next. Once, following the trail left by a workman\u2019s ladder, her mother saw first a shadow and then La\u00eds, still a toddler, up on the roof. On a train trip, her mother was surprised to find that her daughter had all but detrained.", "\u201cShe had her entire body outside the train window,\u201d Odete said.", "Ribeir\u00e3o Preto is about 200 miles north of S\u00e3o Paulo. It has a middle class, a thriving commercial center and a successful manufacturing sector, but it is also home to some of Brazil\u2019s notorious favelas, or slums. One is within shouting distance of the small, tidy house where Souza grew up.", "The family\u2019s sitting room is dominated by a large television and a bulletin board crowded with photographs \u2014 Souza and her brother and sister, playing; Souza in competition, all 5 feet of her, the charm in her high-voltage smile underpinned by steely determination. Her parents separated in 1999 but live near each other and remain close. Antonio, her father, is an industrial designer specializing in medical equipment; Odete worked until recently at a small factory that makes women\u2019s shoes.", "When she was 5, Souza found a place to put all her restlessness. Her brother was taking judo lessons at the municipal sports complex across town, and when she went with her parents to drop him off, she became entranced by the gymnasts practicing there. Her parents signed her up, a year earlier than normal. It was a relief. \u201cWe needed to harness this energy,\u201d her father said.", "Angelica Aparecida da Silveira, Souza\u2019s first coach, remembers her as shy and introverted, but strong, sturdy and focused.", "\u201cChildren can give up early when the teacher is tough, but she never did,\u201d da Silveira said, sitting last summer on a practice mat in the gym where she had taught Souza. It was a cavernous, sweltering, somewhat frayed-looking place \u2014 there was no air-conditioning, and much of the equipment had not been replaced since Souza trained here years ago. Yet this gym has consistently produced top-class gymnasts who have gone on to compete on the national team. From all that talent, Souza was the best.", "Many young girls come to gymnastics with innate ability but lack the things that gymnasts need perhaps most of all: mental toughness and stamina; the maturity to take instruction, to concentrate, to sacrifice, to power through the boring repetition, to fall down and spring back up. But Souza had \u201cthe discipline, the ability to handle fatigue, the mental strength,\u201d da Silveira said. Even when Souza became a teenager \u2014 a treacherous time for many gymnasts \u2014 she did not lose focus or shift attention to school or her social life.", "From the time she was tiny and practicing for four hours a day, gymnastics was everything.", "\u201cWhen you asked her to repeat something 10 times, she would repeat it 20 times,\u201d said Gisele Fabris Moreira, who coached Souza from 1995 to 1997. \u201cShe had a great capacity to not show she was in pain if she was hurt. This was very impressive in a little girl of only 8 years old. She would fall from the bar to the floor and hit her head and then return straight to the bar. She was like an adult in a child\u2019s body.\u201d", "When she was about 10, Souza moved to S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul, near S\u00e3o Paulo, to train full time with a group of other young gymnasts. The move represented the end of her childhood and the beginning of her career. She would return home maybe once or twice a year; her mother would visit and watch her compete.", "\u201cShe was already independent,\u201d Odete said. \u201cShe lived inside the gym.\u201d", "Her transformation was striking. She had been someone who looked at the floor when she spoke, who could barely make herself heard; now she was someone who could chat for Brazil, bursting with playfulness and easy confidence. At one competition, Odete found her daughter bouncing all over the place, full of vim.", "\u201cI asked the coach, \u2018What happened to La\u00eds?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI asked La\u00eds what has happened. She said, \u2018Mom, I decided to leave my shyness behind the door of that gym.\u2019\u201d", "Many of her contemporaries reached the natural ends of their careers long before Souza did. She went on to become possibly the most successful gymnast of her generation in Brazil, competing in her first Olympics in 2004 in Athens, at 15 the youngest on the team. No matter how difficult it got, she always maintained her sunny disposition. She was the person the others went to when they needed cheering up.", "\u201cIt was unusual to see her in a bad mood,\u201d said Roberta Monari, 30, who competed with Souza on the national team from 2005 to 2007, lived with her for a time and now teaches gymnastics in New Jersey. \u201cNothing bothered her, even if she was in a bad situation or had an injury or was supertired or whatever. Some people, if you are tired, you don\u2019t practice really well, but La\u00eds never had that problem.\u201d", "It was a single-minded existence. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much life,\u201d Monari said. \u201cIt was like gymnastics, gymnastics, gymnastics, 24/7.\u201d", "As Souza entered her 20s, her body began to give out. She had numerous operations, including eight on her right knee. In 2012, she traveled to London for the Summer Games but broke a finger in training before the competition, a major disappointment. She had already been growing weary of the constant practicing, the physical punishment, the perpetual diet.", "\u201cI was in a lot of pain,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cBut I think I was mostly tired, really. The dedication is very intense, and the expectations about your weight, to always be thin \u2014 that\u2019s something that really gets to you.\u201d", "After London, she began to make other plans. But she was uncertain. She had been an athlete most of her life. She had lived away from home for years, being supported by the gymnastics team, but had never earned enough to amass any savings. Souza took a few months off, considered becoming a coach or a motivational speaker, but remained uncertain.", "Then, out of the blue, came an invitation.", "Most people in Brazil have no idea what snow feels like. \u201cIf you go down south, maybe one, five days a year it\u2019s going to snow a little bit in some hills,\u201d said Pedro Cavazzoni, the technical director of the Brazilian Snow Sports Federation, based in S\u00e3o Paulo. Determined would-be skiers can either leave the country or practice skiing on plastic ramps sprayed with water at one of the country\u2019s two snow-free ski resorts.", "In the universe of winter sports, South America is a distant galaxy. No South American country has won a medal in a Winter Olympics. Of the 13 athletes Brazil ended up sending to Sochi, none advanced beyond the qualifying rounds.", "But Brazil has sports on the brain. Last summer, it put on a rousing and disaster-free World Cup. In 2016, it has the daunting job of holding the Summer Games in one of the world\u2019s most freewheeling and disorganized cities, Rio de Janeiro. Even as they prepare to host all those athletes from all those disciplines \u2014 the swimmers, the sailors, the pentathletes, the racewalkers \u2014 most Brazilians have difficulty coming to grips with the notion that sports other than soccer are worthwhile.", "\u201cIf you take a sports magazine in Brazil, it\u2019s going to talk about football for 95, 97 percent of the pages, and then it will have 2 percent volleyball, and maybe 1 percent of basketball and maybe 0.1 percent of all the other sports,\u201d Cavazzoni said. \u201cSo except for football, it\u2019s not many sports that are well known.\u201d", "One of his jobs is to change that. Brazil is one of the largest organizers of ski competitions in South America (by necessity, the competitions take place in countries that actually have snow). The federation has a budget of about $1.5 million, Cavazzoni said, compared with $200,000 in 2009.", "With all its handicaps \u2014 the money, the weather, the location \u2014 Brazil must think carefully about how to spend that money. It is not likely to ever field a world-class ice hockey team, for instance, or to build a generation of medal-winning figure skaters. So it has been looking for newer, more obscure sports that have space for athletes from unlikely countries to excel. Until 2013, it had never had an aerialist.", "That changed with the arrival last spring of Ryan Snow, an affable Canadian with an audacious proposal.", "Snow, now 37, is compact, strikingly muscular, with reddish hair and the kind of laid-back, wind- and sun-swept face that looks unfinished unless accessorized with sunglasses. He has coached the Australian and United States women\u2019s aerials teams, taking them to the Olympics with great success.", "Raised in Red Deer, Alberta, \u201ca tiny little town with a tiny little ski hill,\u201d as he called it, Snow started skiing seriously when he was a teenager, first classic downhill and then, when he was 16 or so, aerials. He was good, too, eventually competing at the World Cup level and, at the height of his prowess, able to perform a triple back flip with four twists.", "As the United States team coach, Snow had belonged to an international working group whose goal was to expand aerials beyond the countries that dominated in it, namely China, Australia and the United States. His wife is from Brazil \u2014 he met her at Madison Square Garden when both worked as acrobats in the Ringling Brothers circus \u2014 and he believed the country was a prime candidate for an aerials program. He sent an email to the snow sports federation, and then he went to make his pitch in person.", "Snow presented a detailed plan for transforming gymnasts with no skiing experience into internationally competitive aerialists with Olympic aspirations. It started with simple acrobatic maneuvers and went on, steadily and methodically, from there.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a long, step-by-step process,\u201d Snow said. \u201cYou bounce on the trampoline; you learn some basics of what I\u2019m looking for, as far as technique. And then you learn to ski.\u201d", "The plan made sense to Brazil\u2019s sports officials.", "\u201cWe thought, That could work here,\u201d Cavazzoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very easy sport to understand how to perform. You don\u2019t need that much snow skill to perform in aerials. You need very good air skills, because the tricks in the air are the main part. It\u2019s a lot different from Alpine skiing, for instance, where you have to be really perfect on snow.\u201d", "In addition, Cavazzoni found, the sport lends itself to the sort of training Brazil can provide: lots of off-snow practice before the eventual progression to a snow-covered mountain. For much of the year, you do not need to \u2014 indeed, you probably should not \u2014 practice on snow. Instead, fledgling aerialists train first on trampolines before even putting on skis. Then, before they jump on snow, they glide down plastic ramps and practice their aerials by flipping into swimming pools \u2014 and under Snow\u2019s regimen, onto inflatable crash pads.", "Cavazzoni had come to believe that with the right approach and a bit of luck, Brazil might be able to eke out a spot in a coming Olympics \u2014 if not Sochi in 2014, then Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018.", "\u201cSo we decided to start a program,\u201d Cavazzoni said. \u201cThe first thing we needed was athletes.\u201d", "Invitations went out to gymnastics programs around the country. Aerials tryouts would be held at the Ski Mountain Park in S\u00e3o Roque, about an hour\u2019s drive west of S\u00e3o Paulo, on May 31, 2013. Only four women showed up.", "Among them were Souza \u2014 still searching for her next new thing, eager to see what she was capable of \u2014 and Santos. The two knew each other from the Brazilian gymnastics circuit, where they had briefly overlapped. Santos had never reached the Olympics and was now working as a gymnastics teacher.", "None of the four competitors knew how to ski. They were tested on their general fitness, athleticism, strength, speed and acrobatic ability, using the trampoline. How an athlete performs on the trampoline is a good measure of what she is capable of doing in aerials.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the closest simulation you\u2019re going to do in the air,\u201d Cavazzoni said. \u201cYou can jump six, seven, eight meters on a trampoline, and you can perform the same tricks and have the same air time you would have in the jump in aerials.\u201d", "Skiing itself is an ancillary skill. \u201cWhat you are looking for in aerials is athletes that are good in the air, not athletes that are good on skis,\u201d he said.", "Souza flew through the tests, scoring high in everything. And just like that, she stopped being a gymnast and starting being an aerialist. Suddenly she seemed to be carrying the future of a whole new sport for her country on her young shoulders.", "Her friends and family were not so sure. \u201cI was very nervous,\u201d her father, Antonio, said. He started getting up earlier every morning to say a special prayer for his daughter.", "\u201cI asked her: \u2018That\u2019s what you want? It\u2019s a dangerous sport,\u2019\u201d her mother, Odete, said. \u201cOf course, I was apprehensive, but it was something she wanted; I couldn\u2019t stop her. She always made her own decisions.\u201d", "One word of caution came from Moreira, Souza\u2019s former gymnastics coach. \u201cWhen I heard about her decision to move to skiing, I told her she was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut she\u2019s an adult and owner of her own decisions. She knows her own limits.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Moreira added, \u201cthat she didn\u2019t know this sport.\u201d", "There were language obstacles \u2014 Snow did not speak Portuguese, and Souza did not speak English \u2014 and Snow did not want to have a lonely athlete. If he was going to spend the next six months virtually living with someone, teaching her everything he knew, he felt it would be much easier if there were a third person. He picked Santos as his second aerialist.", "Snow soon discovered, he said, that his new skiers were game for anything, thrilled at their good fortune in finding second acts in sports. He was speaking last July over dinner in Whistler, British Columbia, after a grueling day on the slopes. A bit of snow still clung to the glacier there. Aerials is his vocation and his passion, and he knows the sport inside and out.", "The conversation between Snow and the two women was not fluent, but it was enough.", "\u201cOn the slopes, I 100 percent used Google Translate,\u201d Snow said. First he would demonstrate what he wanted the athletes to do, and then he would instruct them using simple, easily translatable commands.", "\u201cIn coaching, you say a lot, but you don\u2019t really need to use a lot of different phrases, just a few key things you need them to do,\u201d he said. He offered some examples: \u201cLock out your knees, squeeze your quads, squeeze your core, tall head.\u201d", "In Brazil, Souza and Santos worked extensively on the trampoline, honing their air tumbling skills. Then they went to Whistler, 120 miles northeast of Vancouver in the Pacific Northwest.", "There are fewer than a dozen dedicated aerials training facilities in the world. Whistler Blackcomb, a ski and snowboard resort that hosted some events in the 2010 Winter Olympics, has one of them.", "It was there, in the beautiful Coast Mountains, that the Brazilians were going to experience snow for the first time. They were going to learn how to ski.", "It was July 2013. The Sochi Olympics were seven months away.", "Skiing was like nothing the Brazilians had ever done. Souza had seen snow just once, when she competed in gymnastics in Ukraine. Santos had never been to a cold-weather country and was struck by the odd thought that the slopes looked like the inside walls of her freezer. She had assumed that skiing would be like in-line skating, with similar back-and-forth leg movements, but it was surprisingly hard and surprisingly frightening.", "\u201cWe had to learn to turn, and underneath the turns, there were rocks,\u201d she said. \u201cAt any moment we could fall and hit the rocks.\u201d She and Souza wondered if they had made the wrong decision. \u201cIt scared me a lot in the beginning,\u201d Souza said.", "Denise Lessio, Souza\u2019s physical therapist, monitored some of their training, and she could see that the women were sometimes petrified. \u201cEvery day was, \u2018Oh my God, oh my God,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they were both crying.\u201d", "But she could also tell how determined they were, especially Souza. \u201cShe was much more focused than what I was used to from La\u00eds,\u201d Lessio said. \u201cShe was much more preoccupied, for example, with the number of hours she was sleeping, the quality of her sleep, the quality of her diet.\u201d", "There was also a giddy exhilaration. After gymnastics, with its emphasis on control, precision and repetition, and of course the need to be perpetually inside a gym, focusing on tiny specific movements, the women felt unshackled.", "\u201cThey were a little bit kamikaze, really living in the moment,\u201d Snow said of their first day on the slopes. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Holy cow, keep things a little bit more under control, please.\u2019\u201d", "They were also falling a lot, at first. \u201cI even fell off the chair lift,\u201d Santos said.", "They continued to train \u2014 at Whistler; at the United States Olympics training complex in Park City, Utah; back in S\u00e3o Roque \u2014 skiing down plastic training ramps, propelling themselves into the air, and landing in swimming pools and on a giant airbag that served as a crash pad.", "In November, they traveled far north, to Ruka, Finland, and put it all together for the first time. Suddenly, it was happening. They were doing aerials.", "Some parts of it were harder than others. From gymnastics, they were experts in spatial reasoning, in knowing how high and how fast and at what angle and rotation their bodies were supposed to go. But Santos found skiing down the snow-covered approach ramp \u2014 a straight run, full speed ahead \u2014 unexpectedly scary. \u201cIt was an incomparable fear; you had no way to stop,\u201d she said.", "Souza, meanwhile, balked at the landings. \u201cHaving to land without any cushion, and having to keep skiing after you do your flip \u2014 that was the hardest part of the transition from one sport to the other,\u201d she said.", "But they were hooked.", "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the air during your flip, you look down and think, \u2018People look so small down there,\u2019\u201d Souza said. \u201cBut the sensation was good. Free. I felt free.\u201d", "By then they had become good enough, Snow thought, that they were ready to enter formal competitions. They had been doing proper aerials in the mountains for a week.", "\u201cThe time was quite short, to start a new sport and compete,\u201d Santos said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I was 100 percent ready.\u201d", "The Olympics were two months away.", "On Dec. 6, they competed in the Europa Cup in Ruka. They scored surprisingly well: Out of 26 competitors, Souza was ninth, and Santos was 12th.", "By this time they had even landed doubles \u2014 two backward 360-degree revolutions in the air \u2014 in training. But in competition, they used the move they had practiced to perfection: a single back flip, which carries the lowest degree of difficulty of all the possible aerials routines.", "They returned to the United States and competed in the Nor-Am Cup in Park City in December. In one event, Souza came in third and Santos was sixth, out of 13 competitors. In another, Souza came in third out of 12 (Santos did not participate).", "Santos\u2019s and Souza\u2019s performances earned them enough points to advance to the next level, a series of competitions known as the World Cup. Most of their opponents were landing doubles and triples, so the Brazilians had no chance of winning, or even placing high in the pack. In three World Cup events, Santos finished 30th twice and 25th once. Souza was 23rd, 28th and 32nd.", "They were very near the bottom, but oddly, that did not rule them out of the Olympics. On the contrary, by merely completing a certain number of events and not finishing dead last, they could gain enough points from the international ski federation, the sport\u2019s governing body, to be within reach of qualifying.", "The effort took on momentum of its own. \u201cThey were into it,\u201d Snow said. \u201cOne hundred percent, they were aiming for the Olympics.\u201d", "The women were continually struck by the heady novelty of it all. \u201cWe felt like that all the time \u2014 \u2018Gosh, we trained so little, and we\u2019re going to the Olympics right away,\u2019\u201d Santos said. \u201cBut it started taking over us in such a way that we got into that feeling. We were focused on that.\u201d", "Word was getting out that something peculiar and exotic was happening on the World Cup circuit.", "\u201cThe only time they didn\u2019t want to do it was when they were really cold,\u201d said Miriah Johnson, a member of Fly Freestyle, an American club based at the Olympic Park near Park City, who met Souza and Santos when they trained on the same water ramps.", "The Americans piled on layers of protective clothing. The Brazilians piled on more. \u201cThey would have their ski jackets on underneath their dry suits,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey always had three pairs of gloves on.\u201d", "The story carried irresistible echoes of \u201cCool Runnings,\u201d the film that captured, with some massaging of the facts, the anomalous efforts of a group of Jamaican bobsledders to compete in the 1988 Winter Games. In fact, that was the headline of a Bloomberg article on Dec. 5, 2013: \u201cBrazilian Skiers Chase Olympics in \u2018Cool Runnings\u2019 Redux.\u201d", "Another article, in Powder magazine, showed a photograph of Souza and Santos carrying their skis in S\u00e3o Roque, wearing T-shirts and grinning in the sunshine. Snow was giving a thumbs up. \u201cI\u2019ve never tried to do something like this so quickly before,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cBut there\u2019s 25 Olympic spots available \u2014 and I think our girls can sneak in.\u201d", "If that happened, he continued in the magazine, speaking of the Brazilian aerials effort, it \u201cwould solidify that this program is going to survive and move forward.\u201d", "The Olympics were six weeks away.", "Souza returned to Brazil over Christmas and spent New Year\u2019s with some friends: Thaysa and Lais Badaro and their parents. The sisters, who knew Souza about as well as anyone did, were worried that things had moved too quickly.", "\u201cI was afraid something could happen to her,\u201d Lais Badaro recalled. \u201cMy sister and I were like, \u2018Get out of this; do another thing; you don\u2019t have to do this.\u2019\u201d She added of Souza: \u201cBut she was like, \u2018No, I really want to do this, to have one more Olympics, and that\u2019s it.\u2019 I said O.K.\u201d", "Badaro has thought about that conversation a lot since that day, because the timing seems so spectacularly bad. \u201cTwenty-five days after that,\u201d she said, \u201cLa\u00eds had the accident.\u201d", "None of the three people \u2014 Souza, Santos and Snow \u2014 who were there on the slope the morning of Jan. 28, 2014, are sure what happened. Even the things they do remember, they tend to remember differently. Souza said it was \u201ca beautiful day, but snowing a little.\u201d Snow\u2019s recollection is that it was sunny and clear. In Santos\u2019s memory, it was clear at the bottom of the mountain and foggy at the top. \u201cThere was a lot of mist,\u201d she said.", "They arrived on the mountain by 10 a.m. or so and skied eight to 10 runs.", "\u201cThis was the last time we were going down the mountain,\u201d Souza said. \u201cWe were ready to get on the lift and leave.\u201d", "That was when they found themselves staring down the slopes on Double Jack, the final run of the day.", "Double Jack is one of Park City\u2019s trickier slopes, intended for advanced skiers. Though Santos and Souza were hardly experts, Snow felt that with the amount of practice they had packed in, they were capable of handling it. \u201cI feel it was well within their abilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a little difficult, but it wasn\u2019t out of their realm.\u201d", "But Santos disagrees. In fact, she said, she believes that she and Souza had no business being on that run at all.", "Santos was deeply traumatized by the accident and for months refused to speak about it publicly. But last September, in S\u00e3o Roque, she changed her mind. After a morning of training, she took off her skis, took a deep breath and began to talk.", "The first problem, she said, was that the skiers were confused about where they were. The air was so foggy, she said, that they could not see the black-diamond designation or how difficult the run was. \u201cIt was quite bad, with no visibility,\u201d she said.", "She continued: \u201cThere was so much mist that we went down the wrong track. It was only when we started going down that we realized we were on a moguls track.\u201d", "That was the second problem, in Santos\u2019s view: the moguls, or little hillocks of snow, that dotted the slope. She and Souza had never skied on a moguls run, she said, and to make matters worse, Double Jack was steeper and more treacherous than what they were used to. They tried to break their speed by skiing sideways; to avoid the bumps, they aimed for a slender avenue of smoother, mogul-free snow off to the right side, close to the trees. But the avenue was too narrow for comfort, Santos said.", "\u201cIt was a mistake to be there, for sure,\u201d she said of Double Jack.", "Snow had a different recollection. In his memory, the air was clear. They had not made a mistake or ended up in the wrong place. In addition, he said, the avenue that Santos described as narrow was actually quite wide \u2014 maybe five or six yards across \u2014 and certainly large enough to negotiate easily.", "Told later of Santos\u2019s account, Snow said that it was the first time he had heard it and that he was surprised to learn of her and Souza\u2019s fears. They had seemed fine to him, he said, as confident as always. And they had never told him otherwise, not at the time and not afterward, Snow said.", "It is possible, of course, that the women\u2019s doubts have solidified over time, growing stronger with hindsight.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Snow said. \u201cThere were huge communication barriers, and maybe we weren\u2019t communicating properly.\u201d", "As for Souza, who spoke about the accident in a series of interviews over many months, she will never know exactly what happened that day.", "But she does remember being at the top of Double Jack and preparing to ski down. She remembers that Snow set off first, as he generally did in training, stopping a short way down to wait for the women to catch up, and that Santos went next and she was last.", "She also remembers feeling uneasy about the run \u2014 the bumps, the speed \u2014 and trying to warn Santos to go more slowly. Following behind, she quickly caught up to Santos and shouted advice. \u201cI was telling her to ski sideways because we were going at a very high speed,\u201d Souza said. \u201cThe slope was too fast.\u201d", "She passed Santos and skied out of sight. Neither Santos nor Snow could see her.", "\u201cI had my back facing her,\u201d Santos said. \u201cAnd then when I turned around, she wasn\u2019t there anymore. It took maybe five seconds. She spoke, and then it happened.\u201d", "Santos heard nothing more. But Snow, waiting below, heard an odd little scream that trailed off. \u201cI heard a yelp, and rustling in the trees,\u201d he said.", "He found Souza lying in the snow. She was on her back at a strange angle. She was unconscious. Her breathing was not right, almost as if she were snoring. Her skis were askew. She was not moving.", "Snow had seen someone in a similar state before \u2014 not on a mountain, but behind the wheel of a mangled car by the side of a road, after an accident. It was a terrifying sight. He went into autopilot, his first-aid training kicking in. As he worked to stabilize Souza\u2019s neck, she became alert. She tried to talk.", "\u201cAnd then I said, \u2018La\u00eds, can you move your arms and legs?\u2019 And she said no,\u201d Snow said.", "\u201cAnd she looked at me and said, \u2018Ryan, help me.\u2019\u201d", "Kneeling there near the trees on the slope, in the cold, he quietly began to cry. \u201cThis was the worst moment of my life,\u201d he said.", "\u201cIt was terrible. Unbelievable. It was the most unbelievably heartbreaking thing I\u2019ve ever heard in my life \u2014 someone\u2019s desperation when they can\u2019t move.\u201d", "Souza was confused, disoriented, distressed. \u201cShe wanted to know what was happening,\u201d Snow said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think she realized what had happened or why she had just woken up in the trees on her back.\u201d", "By this time, Santos had arrived. She tried to take it all in \u2014 her friend on the ground, the eerie quiet, the sense that in that split second, everything had divided into a before and an after. She became distraught. Snow dispatched her to fetch the ski patrol nearby, shouting orders in shorthand. \u201cI just yelled, \u2018Red jacket, red jacket,\u2019 and pointed to where we were,\u201d he said.", "The ski patrol strapped Souza onto a sled and slid her down the mountain. Snow grabbed her skis and followed. Souza was loaded aboard a helicopter and flown off the mountain.", "When Souza arrived at the University of Utah hospital trauma center, she was in critical condition and near death. The accident had broken her neck and caused a dislocation close to the top of her spine, between her third and fourth cervical vertebrae.", "The dislocation, known as subluxation, had pushed the vertebrae into her spinal cord and essentially crushed the portion of it that stimulates the diaphragm, the muscle most responsible for breathing. This left Souza unable to breathe without help. She had an eight-hour operation to realign her vertebrae and stabilize her neck, but she could do nothing on her own: She was put on a feeding tube, given a tracheotomy and hooked up to a breathing machine.", "Her injury was classified as ASIA A: a complete spinal cord injury, meaning that she had no feeling below her chest, and no voluntary movement in her arms or legs.", "Back in Brazil, where Souza\u2019s accident would become big news, word was beginning to reach her friends and family. At first, it was a chaotic chain of fear and half-confirmed rumors. Her mother, Odete, got the call at 11 p.m. on Monday, from a doctor at the hospital. \u201cIt was a night that never seemed to end,\u201d she said. Her daughter might die, the doctor said. Odete did not speak English; she did not have a passport. When she got on a plane for Utah two days later, it was the first time she had left Brazil. She arrived to find a jungle of tubes and machines and her daughter lying inside.", "On Feb. 5, 2014, a week after the accident, Souza was stable enough to be transferred to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, where she was placed under the care of the chief of neurosurgery, Dr. Barth Green.", "Her condition was still highly volatile. \u201cIn general, a patient who has this level of injury and no breathing has a high chance of dying in the days and weeks following the injury,\u201d Green said.", "But he and Dr. Antonio Marttos, a surgeon specializing in trauma at Jackson Memorial who also happens to be the Brazilian Olympic team doctor, were astonished at Souza\u2019s resilience. Against their predictions, she was weaned from the feeding tube and the breathing machine.", "\u201cI\u2019m in my late 60s, and if I sustain the same injury, I have a 90 percent chance of dying,\u201d said Green, a jovial, always-look-on-the-bright-side person who is also the director of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. \u201cHer heart, her lungs, her muscles, her endurance, her metabolism, her immune system \u2014 all those things were tuned up to make her a world-class athlete.\u201d", "Souza\u2019s injury complicated Brazil\u2019s plans for the Olympics, which were scheduled to start in a matter of days. It also devastated Santos, who felt a mixture of guilt, sorrow and confusion.", "Back in Utah, while Souza was still being treated, Santos had just learned, of all things, that a spot in Sochi had opened for her after all. It seemed a confounding twist of fate. Snow, the snow sports federation and the Brazil Olympic Committee had to scramble to figure out what to do.", "\u201cI had to ask Josi, \u2018O.K., La\u00eds isn\u2019t going to the Olympics \u2014 do you want to go?\u2019\u201d Snow said. \u201c\u2018I\u2019d be honored to take you.\u2019\u201d", "All Santos could do was cry. The opportunity seemed tainted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a condition to do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI said: \u2018No, I\u2019m not good to go; I don\u2019t want to go. I want to stay with my friend. I want to be with her until she gets better.\u2019\u201d", "But Snow persisted. \u201cI had to see if she was O.K.,\u201d he said of Santos. It was important that she get back on the mountain to overcome the fear building inside her. He took her back to the slopes. She sobbed the whole first day. \u201cWe had three days to decide if we were going to the Olympics or not,\u201d Snow said.", "What changed her mind, finally, was Souza. From her hospital bed, she conveyed to Santos that she should go to Sochi. \u201cGo and do it for us,\u201d she said.", "But everyone was worried \u2014 Snow, Cavazzoni, Brazil\u2019s Olympic officials and the team\u2019s sports psychologist. They veered between thinking Santos should compete, as she had imagined doing for so long, and fretting that it could end in disaster.", "There was a larger, unspoken issue: the future of aerials in Brazil. It was hanging in the balance. Cavazzoni compared the questions officials were asking to the conversations that take place after injuries in football or hockey, when concussions or crippling accidents raise existential questions about the sport\u2019s safety. \u201cEveryone gets emotional about it, and for us it was the same,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand, you have to understand that it was just an accident. Are we going to stop a sport just because an accident happened?", "\u201cOf course it\u2019s really a pity for everybody, and of course we are all very sorry that it happened. But you know that accidents can happen.\u201d", "A sport is always bigger than the individuals in it. In the end, Santos went to Sochi, shaky but determined. She competed at a far lower degree of difficulty than anyone else, using the simple single back flip that she had practiced so many times.", "As expected, she failed to advance beyond the preliminary heat. She finished last, 22nd out of 22 aerialists. But she landed her jump perfectly. It was an emotional moment, and her mind was split, half in Sochi, half in Miami, where her friend lay in the hospital. At the bottom of the run, she raised her hand in triumph, her thumb and forefinger shaped into an L. L for La\u00eds.", "That ensured the future of Brazil\u2019s aerials program, which is now in long-term preparations for the next Winter Games. \u201cNow Brazil has an Olympian in freestyle aerials,\u201d Snow said. \u201cIt was really the birth of the program we have now.\u201d", "Officials at Park City Mountain Resort declined to discuss Souza\u2019s accident or the results of their investigation into it. There is no definitive answer, not even for the people who were there.", "\u201cTo this day I can\u2019t accept what happened, why it happened,\u201d Santos said. \u201cEvery day, I still ask myself a lot of questions.\u201d", "Snow for a time felt obsessed with piecing together a coherent explanation, and he sought out members of the ski patrol who had helped rescue Souza that day. They told him that based on her tracks in the snow, Souza had skied normally downhill for about 10 meters and then abruptly veered off course, heading to the right.", "\u201cAll of a sudden, her tracks just start to ski toward the trees,\u201d Snow said they had told him.", "Perhaps she accelerated \u2014 \u201cYou can gain quite a bit of speed in 10 meters,\u201d Snow said \u2014 and then lost control. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most heartbreaking things for me. I can\u2019t say why.\u201d", "Neither Souza nor Santos \u2014 no one interviewed for this article, in fact \u2014 blames him. \u201cEveryone did their job,\u201d Souza said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has to feel guilty.\u201d", "When asked about it, Brazilian sports officials tend to recite a list of experienced skiers who have had catastrophic accidents \u2014 Sonny Bono, Michael Schumacher \u2014 to make the point that it could have happened to anyone. And they say that although Souza had been skiing for just a few months, she had clocked enough skiing time to qualify as highly experienced.", "Snow said that what happened in Park City that day was the worst thing he had been involved with in a lifetime of sports. He has rehearsed it over and over in his mind. \u201cI was responsible for them on the hill,\u201d he said.", "Still, he continued: \u201cI look back on that day pretty much every single day, and I think, \u2018What would I have done differently?\u2019 And I would have done pretty much the exact same thing every day. I wouldn\u2019t have changed it.\u201d", "At first, Souza could talk only in a whisper. She was permanently exhausted. She slept a lot. Physical therapy was grueling, repetitive and frustrating. But her doctors marveled at her progress.", "Last spring, researchers at the University of Miami, where Green is the chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the Miller School of Medicine, received special permission from the Food and Drug Administration to participate in a trial of a new type of treatment, in which stem cells harvested from donors and then from Souza are injected into the spinal fluid at the site of her injury.", "The treatment has awakened a small amount of feeling in her arms and feet, parts of her body that were all but dead for months. Her newly recovered sensation, Green said, changes her ASIA status from A to B, meaning that new neurological connections have been established below the injury level and that the injury has been reclassified as incomplete.", "Souza now can feel, for instance, pressure on her skin, an important element in helping prevent sores that form when paralyzed limbs rub continually against a chair or a bed. More important, she again has proprioception, an understanding of where her arms and legs are in space \u2014 the quality she had so acutely as an athlete.", "None of this guarantees a return of useful movement in her arms or legs, but it is enough to give Souza hope of improvement.", "\u201cShe never once blinked an eye and said, \u2018Why me?\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m depressed\u2019 or \u2018I feel sorry for myself\u2019 or \u2018I want to kill myself,\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to get those responses after such a catastrophic injury.\u201d", "Her resilience comes from a lot of things: her religion, her discipline, her policy of setting a goal for herself, reaching it and aiming for the next one. There are also her many friends from Brazil to help Souza\u2019s mother, who has been caring almost full time for Souza since the accident.", "For a time, Souza was in a relationship with Badaro\u2019s younger sister, Thaysa, a fashion student, but the pressure brought by the change in circumstance became too much. In February, the two broke up. Recently, Souza caused a stir by coming out publicly as gay, a bold move for a Brazilian athlete.", "Perhaps she speaks differently when she speaks to herself. But in a series of conversations across many months, Souza, now 26 years old and facing a lifetime in a wheelchair, has proved true to Green\u2019s description. She has never once questioned her decision to leave gymnastics and take up aerial skiing. She has never once railed against the series of events that led her to be on the particular mountain at the particular moment, or blamed what happened on anyone.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard, but I\u2019m calm,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been.\u201d", "But you can see how frustration can flare up in a person who was always moving and now is always sitting still. \u201cSometimes I stop and ask myself why, why me?\u201d she said at one point. Once, as she spoke, Souza became preoccupied by a stray piece of hair wisping across her forehead. She could not brush it away by herself. Such a simple thing. \u201cThe hardest part is that I\u2019m always asking for a favor,\u201d she said.", "\u201cShe gets sad,\u201d said Odete, who quit her job at the shoe factory last fall to care for her daughter. It is especially hard to see such an independent person forced into such dependence, always surrounded by caregivers. \u201cShe asks to be left alone sometimes,\u201d Odete said.", "At the end of 2014, Souza returned to Brazil. She is working out where she will live, and how. Green says she is a candidate for other experimental treatments. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up where we are,\u201d Green said.", "The question of money looms, a terrible shadow in the background.", "Souza\u2019s treatment has already cost more than $800,000. Insurance paid for her medical care and hospital treatment, but she and her family have depended on the snow sports federation and the Brazil Olympic Committee to cover their considerable out-of-pocket expenses.", "A fund-raising campaign in Brazil raised more than $115,000, with additional donations of medical and mobility equipment. Souza is figuring out her future. She is negotiating to be an ambassador for the Miami Project, Green\u2019s organization, and looking to work as a motivational speaker and campaigner for disabled people, and possibly as a gymnastics commentator \u2014 she is not yet sure. There are many possibilities, but everything still feels provisional and uncertain.", "Souza\u2019s condition is big news in Brazil, her accident and its aftermath covered extensively in newspapers and on television. People who had never heard of her when she was a gymnastics champion have heard of her now. In Miami in September, the Brazilian soccer star Marcelo gave Souza his shirt after an international friendly match. In January, the Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff, approved a special law granting her a lifetime pension.", "That means Souza is to receive the maximum allowed by law: 4,663.75 reais, or about $1,786, per month. It is a good income \u2014 about what a doctor or other professional might make in Brazil \u2014 but not enough to pay for the care she will need for the rest of her life. A spokesman for the Brazil Olympic Committee said that the snow sports federation planned to pay her an additional monthly sum roughly equal to that.", "Souza still wears a smile on her face, at least most of the time, at least when she is in public. She tries not to think about her old self, but she cannot help it. It feels so close yet so out of reach, as if a flimsy curtain is all that separates one life from the other.", "She misses the little things, mostly. \u201cI want to pass my hand through my hair, to feel my hand on my face, to take a shower,\u201d she said. She recently got a tattoo on her arm: a person in a wheelchair standing up and gradually walking away.", "When she dreams at night, she said, she never dreams of skiing.

France certainly thinks so.", "France once barred its companies from using anti-takeover defenses, known in Europe as \u201cfrustrating actions,\u201d to stop hostile bidders. But last year, with the takeover market heating up and European countries worried about losing jobs, France reversed course. The French Parliament passed a law, known as the Florange Law, to give companies the ability to fend off hostile bids.", "The title of the law says it all. Florange is the French town where ArcelorMittal tried to close down two blast furnaces after a successful hostile takeover. ArcelorMittal backed down after France threatened to nationalize the plant.", "The centerpiece of the Florange Law is a mandate that French companies give two votes to any share held for longer than two years. This goes against the historical one-vote-for-every-share system that most countries have. The law allows an opt-out if two-thirds of shareholders approve one by March 31, 2016.", "In addition, the law permits French companies to adopt American-style poison pills and requires that any hostile bidder negotiate with French workers before proceeding with a takeover.", "The ostensible purpose of these changes, particularly the new voting rules, is to foster \u201clong-termism\u201d \u2014 rewarding French shareholders for holding shares for the long term and committing to the company. It\u2019s a law clearly directed not just at hostile takeovers, but also at shareholder activists and at United States institutional investors, which are increasingly vocal in influencing companies across the globe.", "It seems like common sense. After all, why not reward shareholders for sticking with their company?", "Alas, it turns out to be complicated.", "France previously allowed for double voting rights after a holding period, but on an optional basis. More than half of the companies in the benchmark CAC 40-stock index already have such a rule. But the mandatory nature of the rule has raised hackles among both shareholders and French corporations.", "Shareholders led by PhiTrust, a French asset manager, have vociferously protested because of the anti-takeover nature of these rules. By allowing French companies to fight off takeovers, shareholders argue, the law could protect entrenched and underproductive boards.", "Shareholders also fear that the rules will stem investor activism. If activists do not have as much voting power to change boards and companies, their job will become much harder. And they will be unwilling to lock up millions in capital and wait years to earn significant influence.", "Following its shareholder clientele, the world\u2019s largest proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, has issued a note largely opposing these rules. I.S.S. says it will recommend in some cases that shareholders withhold votes for directors of companies that adopt the new voting rule.", "For French corporations, the reasons for opposition are even more complicated. Some have wanted this rule simply because they buy into it as part of good corporate governance. Yet many French companies have significant shareholders already, including the biggest of them all, the French government.", "With double voting rights, you could end up with stakeholders with divergent interests and different degrees of power. One can easily see how the interests of the French state might not always align with those of other shareholders, particularly when it comes to preserving jobs.", "Some French companies have actively resisted. Renault, Orange, Vivendi and others have pushed for votes to allow the companies to opt out.", "In some cases, it has resulted in a chess game, as shareholders and companies plot moves and countermoves. For example, the French government bought $1.4 billion worth of shares to block Renault from opting out of the\nvoting law. Meanwhile, Nissan, the owner of 15 percent of Renault, is fuming, as its shares do not even have voting rights.", "Vivendi, too, faced the issue of whether to opt out of the rule in light of the fierce support of the French billionaire Vincent Bollor\u00e9, who owns 14.5 percent of Vivendi. Mr. Bollor\u00e9 vocally pressed for adoption of the new voting rule, a position for which the economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, offered his \u201cfull support.\u201d Maybe not so coincidentally, Vivendi has been a target of the hedge fund P. Schoenfeld Asset Management. In a recent vote, Vivendi shareholders chose against opting out.", "In other cases where the French government does not hold a stake, companies have moved quickly to reject the rule. Vinci, the French construction behemoth, had 99.3 percent of its shareholders approve the opt-out, according to Bloomberg News.", "The French controversy highlights similar issues over the one-share-one-vote rule in the United States. Technology companies like Facebook and LinkedIn went public with dual-class share structures that concentrate ownership with a core set of shareholders. Even Shake Shack has followed the trend among initial public offerings.", "That trend is a result of a bit of regulatory history.", "In 1988, during a wave of hostile takeovers, the Securities and Exchange Commission barred public companies from issuing stock with extra voting rights. The idea was to prevent midstream capitalizations \u2014 that is, companies\u2019 conversion to high-vote share structures in order to avoid hostile takeovers. But the rule was struck down in federal court. The subsequent compromise was that the exchanges adopted rules allowing deviation from one share one vote only if the company went public with the structure.", "The consequence is that today we have two levels of governance, just as France does. The haves are those companies that have gone public with two or more classes of shares and are controlled by a small group of shareholders. And the have-nots are companies with one share one vote that are more exposed to shareholder activism and hostile takeovers.", "The push against one share one vote has left the United States a weak outlier when it comes to market regulation. Alibaba, for example, had its I.P.O. in the United States after the Hong Kong exchange would not allow the company\u2019s share structure.", "People who speak of \u201cshareholder democracy\u201d may not be happy with the trend away from one share one vote, but does giving some shareholders more votes improve anything?", "If the French plan is adopted, long-term holders like institutional investors may win. Yet the average actively managed mutual fund turns over its portfolio every year, meaning many such investors will not benefit.", "Shareholder activists may lose, though they may not. Instead, they would have to cater to a different set of shareholders. This may be index funds, which do hold on to shares and would have more power.", "The mixed results extend to management. Presumably, a high-vote structure will discourage hostile takeovers by giving management protection, but it will also make management subservient to a smaller group of existing shareholders.", "And so, the increased voting power may not be a good thing. It may give an advantage to more passive shareholders and those that may have special interests.", "In the dual-class world, high-vote stock may keep power with founders, perhaps longer than they should have it. Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s huge expenditures on such things as self-driving cars and WhatsApp are protected because these companies are controlled by their founders. This may be a good thing in the case of Google or Facebook, but it is unclear why the grocery chain Fairway, another public company with dual-class stock, needs this structure.", "In other words, while it may seem like the cure for short-termism, high-vote shares may instead do something else, giving power to a small group of shareholders with odd interests. And whether they exercise that power vengefully or selfishly is an unknown.

It\u2019s handy. I look at my phone less than I did before, whether I\u2019m in a meeting or with my family. If there is something I need to be alerted to, I know the watch will let me know. I also pull my phone out less often because, ridiculously enough, I\u2019m now wearing \u2014 wait for it \u2014 a watch. Meaning I don\u2019t need to look at my phone every time I want to know what time it is, and I don\u2019t get sucked into its many possibilities as often.", "My practical, parental reason for wanting the watch was simple: I\u2019m frequently in a meeting or other position where it is difficult or rude to check my phone, yet I need to be reachable. I\u2019ve had to leave my phone on, or at least face up on the table, far too often. On the flip side, I often need to be reachable for work, sometimes by email, but I don\u2019t want to be picking up my phone constantly to see if that email has come in.", "The Apple Watch does exactly what I want in that respect; it alerts me only when emails are from certain people, and if there is an incoming call, I can tell at a glance who\u2019s calling, or silence the watch/stop the notification vibration with a discreet hand over my wrist. I can leave my phone in my bag.", "As a bonus, I can also leave my phone on my dresser when I\u2019m at home.

Another first world problem solved. Finally, the Apple Watch ended my constant phone hunts. I would open the Find My iPhone app on my desktop, set the phone to ping and then find it under a magazine on the counter. Now I can set off that same ping with a few swipes on my wrist.", "But are those solutions that are worth, at a minimum, a $349 investment? That\u2019s a personal call, based on budget and interest. They are to me; I\u2019ve been looking for something that had that functionality for years. But ultimately they\u2019re no more than an extension of what the phone already does, and does well \u2014 and to make it all work the way I wanted it to took time and effort as well as trial and error. (Apple is happy to help you through that process, at its stores or on the phone; when I needed help figuring out something, I filled out a form to request a call from support, and the phone rang faster than I thought possible.)", "We can count on Apple, and app developers, to find ways to make the Apple Watch indispensable for parents that go beyond staying constantly connected. For now, there are some fun (pregnancy monitoring apps) and some convenience (you can monitor volume and other settings from the watch while your toddler watches the Nick Jr. app on your iPhone). For parents of teenagers driving some models of post-2014 Volkswagens, there are serious monitoring possibilities: The watch can alert you if the car leaves a designated area or exceeds a preset speed limit. The future holds watch-enabled baby monitors and, surely, virtual toddler leashes. Already, a parent and a teenager could use Apple Watches to stay more closely connected \u2014 if, that is, you\u2019re willing to spring for a second watch.", "What about the rest of the watch\u2019s functions?

That same app also alerts me to stand every hour (a setting that can be turned off, but that I appreciate).", "You can use the watch to carry on a phone conversation without a headset, which works reasonably well in my home, but would be deeply annoying to anyone around anywhere else. There is a bit of a lag, and some volume difficulties that left me talking into my wrist \u00e0 la Dick Tracy more than once. Now that I\u2019ve made the text as big as it can be, because my eyes are failing, I really do like being able to be in easy text contact with the few people I text with frequently. That part of it is every child\u2019s secret agent dream, although, because only one of my favorite texting buddies has an Apple Watch, the opportunities to send one another our heartbeats are limited (and once you\u2019ve drawn and sent one little happy face with your finger, you\u2019ve drawn and sent them all).", "I\u2019ve paid for coffee at Starbucks, which I found entertaining, but no more convenient than paying with my iPhone. I\u2019ve used the remote-control camera app to take a family picture; I\u2019ve set quick timers for cooking or to remind me to stop working and go pick up my kids when I know I\u2019m likely to become engrossed and lose track of time. I use the workout timer daily. I enjoy and appreciate the functions of the watch, but it is not (unlike the iPhone) itself an entertainment device \u2014 I added one game app (Rules) but haven\u2019t found myself even slightly inclined to hold up one hand while poking at the game with the other.", "I like the watch for itself. I turn my wrist and see the time and the date, and a butterfly opens its wings. That makes me happy every time, although occasionally the face fails to light up until I flip my wrist more emphatically, making me look, in public, as though I\u2019m trying to draw attention to my pretty new toy. Unlike what happened when I tried to wear Google Glass in public, the watch hasn\u2019t attracted attention from strangers. It\u2019s no bigger than the watch my stylish cousin wears daily (we compared). It looks like a watch (although one that\u2019s not helpful to anyone trying to peer over your shoulder to see the time), and I haven\u2019t had a new watch in a long time.

With the economy growing and fuel prices low, the Global Business Travel Association expects total United States business travel spending to grow by 3 percent this year to about $300 billion, and by 6 percent in 2016.", "As a side benefit in this environment, corporations now have the opportunity to use travel policies to attract new employees \u2014 for example, by offering them the ability to travel in business class during longer trips or on international flights. \u201cThe talent war is back,\u201d said Caroline Strachan, a vice president at American Express Global Business Travel. \u201cIf companies are starting to be challenged in finding new talent, then a shift in policy is a good thing.\u201d", "\u201cWhat has been really interesting, in the past couple of months, is seeing a shift where clients are understanding that their business travel policies are also an acquisition tool for talent,\u201d she said, particularly for younger employees and among tech firms. In the changed economic climate, many companies are moving their travel departments away from finance or procurement and into human resources.", "Norm Rose, the president of Travel Tech Consulting, said travelers were the big winners as technology moved faster than corporate policies.", "\u201cWhen you talk about mobile technology, what you\u2019re really talking about is empowerment,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cWe are in an environment where the very fact that mobile technology is holding so strongly has shifted the balance of power toward travelers. For managed business, that\u2019s a growing challenge.\u201d", "Continuing innovation in mobile technology offers the prospect of a future in which interactive software will automatically be able to guide travelers through their journey, helping schedule and coordinate flights, hotels and rental cars.", "\u201cThe more intelligence there is, the more behind-the-scenes activity can happen if there is a disruption or a change in flight,\u201d Mr. Rose said. \u201cThis should make it easier for travelers. By 2020, we should begin to see the impact of this.\u201d", "Airlines and airports are already relying on sensors in airports to track the flow of passengers and identify bottlenecks in traffic between the curb and the gate. And they alert passengers either through text messages or emails if a flight is delayed.", "But technology in the future will allow them to see travelers\u2019 positions \u2014 through the GPS device on their phones \u2014 to track their movements. If a passenger is late for a flight, for instance, an airline might decide to rebook the passenger on the next flight automatically. The car rental service or taxi service would know of the delay, and the hotel might be notified of a late arrival \u2014 all seamlessly.", "\u201cToday, this stuff is very manual and only happens primarily with the top executives of a company, who have someone who monitors their travel and takes care of them,\u201d Mr. Koch said. \u201cBut in the future, that will all be linked together. All these things will trickle down and happen.\u201d", "What is missing, however, is for a tech innovator like Apple or Google to come up with software and technology that integrate all the disparate flows of information that are collected and make them work together.", "\u201cThis is kind of the holy grail,\u201d Mr. Koch said. \u201cWe have all this power in our smartphones, but all the individual apps are not talking to each other yet.\u201d", "For now, there are more prosaic apps. Airlines have long sought to develop more direct relationships with business travelers. Through their mobile travel apps, they can already offer more personal service and provide easy check-in options and electronic boarding passes to passengers.", "Going one step further, these apps also let passengers quickly find new options if their flights are canceled or delayed. And they also serve as a retail platform for airlines to offer other services, upgrades, car rentals or hotels.", "One of the consequences of this new technological ecosystem is a fragmentation of the travel market. In practical terms this means travelers need dozens of different apps to manage their trips \u2014 airlines, hotels, rental cars and travel groups all have their own apps for smartphones, and all seek to create unique relationships with travelers that are generally invisible to corporate travel managers.", "Dealing with this growing complexity is fast turning into a major concern facing travel managers, according to Ms. Strachan of American Express.", "Still, travel managers see many benefits to this new technological environment. The ubiquity of smartphones, for example, is improving a company\u2019s duty of care, a term that refers to its legal obligation to ensure the well-being of its traveling employees. It is now easier to track people on the road and ensure their safety.", "\u201cIt\u2019s gone beyond efficiency. It\u2019s really about effectiveness,\u201d said Eric Bailey, the corporate travel manager at Microsoft, who oversees about 5,000 traveling employees. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about cost. It\u2019s also about risk and liability reduction.\u201d", "Travel managers and business experts all acknowledge that these trends raise concerns about traveler privacy.", "\u201cIf you\u2019re a business traveler, are you entirely comfortable giving up some privacy in return for better convenience and ease of travel?\u201d said Michael W. McCormick, the executive director of the Global Business Travel Association.", "\u201cIf you are provided with a company device, the expectation is that you will leave it turned on,\u201d Mr. Koch said. \u201cBut the concern is, what if you are going out for dinner or on a date or whatever? Where is the limit? That is being debated currently.\u201d", "\u201cPeople have no problem posting pictures of themselves on Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is always a level of concern that they don\u2019t want their companies to know where they are.\u201d", "About 75 percent of travel and expense budgets, including airfare and hotels, fall under some kind of managed budget. The rest, such as ground transportation, food, fuel and other incidentals, is generally outside what corporations can control. That\u2019s a sector ripe for technological change, said Mr. Bailey of Microsoft.", "The best example of this is Uber, the ride-hailing service that has fast become the choice for business travelers, in the United States and abroad. Uber\u2019s ease of use and technology have changed expectations about ground transportation during business trips, which had long been a major challenge for travelers.", "The transformation has been swift. According to one estimate by Certify, an expense management company, Uber has nearly overtaken taxis in major American cities in terms of expensed business travel. Uber rides accounted for 47 percent of all expensed rides as of this March, up from just 14 percent in January 2014.", "The share spent on taxis, limousines and hotel shuttles dropped to 52 percent, from 86 percent, in the same period. Lyft, a rival service, accounted for 1 percent of ground transportation expenses.", "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting \u2014 and somewhat shocking \u2014 to see their growth and how they\u2019ve captured corporate spend,\u201d said Bob Neveu, chief executive of Certify, of services like Uber and Lyft. \u201cThey have solved the whole ground transportation piece.\u201d", "The rise of the sharing economy presents a new challenge to corporate managers. It raises new questions about liability \u2014 Uber cars, for instance, do not always meet all local licensing and insurance requirements. Similar questions, too, are being raised by other services like Airbnb, the online home rental service.", "\u201cThis is one of the big battles in the industry around these services, and what insurance or liability questions arise,\u201d Mr. McCormick said. \u201cWho is liable if something goes wrong?\u201d", "\u201cWe talk about this like this is new, but the fundamentals are still the same,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody wants to be effective, everyone wants to get business done, and everybody wants to get home safely.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/science/robots-that-can-match-human-dexterity.html": ["BERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 In an engineering laboratory here, a robot has learned to screw the cap on a bottle, even figuring out the need to apply a subtle backward twist to find the thread before turning it the right way.", "This and other activities \u2014 including putting a clothes hanger on a rod, inserting a block into a tight space and placing a hammer at the correct angle to remove a nail from a block of wood \u2014 may seem like pedestrian actions.

For example, the bottle cap-threading technique will work reliably when the bottle is moved from one location to another or if the bottle is of a different color. But if the bottle is tilted at an angle before it is picked up, the robot will completely fail.", "\u201cThere is nothing better to ask a roboticist, \u2018If you change the conditions, will it still work?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Abbeel said.", "To explain the new approach, the researchers draw the analogy of how baseball players track and then catch balls. Humans do not do mathematical calculations to discern the trajectory of the ball. Rather, they fix the ball in their field of vision and adjust their running speed until they arrive at the spot where the ball lands.", "This, in effect, short-circuits a complicated set of relations between perception and motion control, substituting a simple technique that works in a wide variety of situations without having to worry about details like wind resistance or the ball\u2019s velocity.", "Until now, robots have generally learned with a variety of techniques that are laboriously programmed for each specific case. The Berkeley researchers, who will present their results in a paper at the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society\u2019s conference next week in Seattle, instead connected the neural networks, which learn from both visual and sensory information, directly to the controller software that oversees the robot\u2019s motions. As a result, they achieved a significant advance in speed and accuracy of learning.", "\u201cWe are trying to come up with a general learning framework that allows the robot to learn new things on its own,\u201d Dr. Abbeel said.", "The advance underscores the rapid impact that the deep-learning approach has had on the field of artificial intelligence.

Researchers were then able to capture billions of images or samples of human language.

Both firms resisted the notion that they were building services for the wealthy and explained in detail how they planned to serve the masses and lower their prices.", "\u201cThe first time you roll out a service, it\u2019s fairly expensive,\u201d said Tri Tran, Munchery\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. \u201cBut we have an internal mission of making real, good food accessible to everyone, everywhere, and if we only catered to the upper middle class or people who are really affluent, then we will not accomplish that goal.\u201d", "He conceded that his prices weren\u2019t low enough to make Munchery an option for everyone, but the business model, he said, would soon allow for greater access. Munchery, which began in 2010, operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, New York and soon Los Angeles. Today, a typical adult-size Munchery entree costs around $11 or $12, and a child\u2019s meal around $6. With a $3 delivery fee, a dinner for a family of four might cost around $37. That compares to about $25 for dinner at, say, Chipotle, not counting the time and money it takes to get there.", "But like many e-commerce businesses, Munchery enjoys certain cost advantages over its physical counterparts that Mr. Tran says will lead to lower prices. It buys high-quality ingredients in bulk, uses a single kitchen in an out-of-the-way part of a city and uses advanced cooking tech to cut down on labor.", "Mr. Tran promises that within a couple of months, chicken, beef and fish dishes will sell for less than $10 a portion and pasta dishes for $7. In the long run, Mr. Tran is aiming for prices that are competitive with those of fast-food chains and that will make cooking at home seem expensive.", "\u201cIf you buy the same quality ingredients that we do and cook it yourself, just the ingredients alone will cost you more,\u201d he said.", "Foodies might scoff at this idea. But sociologists have found that for many low- and middle-income families, cooking every day takes too much time, planning and money. If Munchery can make a non-junk-food dinner at prices comparable to junk, without much time, wouldn\u2019t that be a useful service to people who aren\u2019t millionaires?", "\u201cIf there are great, commercially driven companies out there that can do things like food distribution at scale, and we can piggyback on their success, that could be a huge win,\u201d said Hannah Calhoon, the director of Blue Ridge Labs, an organization that aims to build tech products for low-income communities.", "You can make a similar case for Shuddle, which was created by Nick Allen, a founder of the ride-sharing service Sidecar, who said he was trying to solve a problem of modern parenting \u2014 the parents are working, the children need to be ferried among home and school and their activities, and all the ways to do so require lots of time and money. Though I did not use Shuddle for my own children \u2014 the service is available only to children who\u2019ve grown out of car seats, so mine are too young \u2014 I spoke to several parents who described it in rhapsodic terms.", "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to have someone else drive your kids while you\u2019re making dinner, so everyone\u2019s eating dinner at a logical hour,\u201d said Rana DiOrio, a Bay Area mother of three who has been using Shuddle a few times a week for several months. Ms. DiOrio, the chief executive of a children\u2019s book publishing company, said she found the service cheaper than alternatives like hiring a babysitter for an hour to drive a car, but she acknowledged that she was relatively well off and that it was not at a price that could serve everyone.", "Today, most parents pay $12 to $15 a ride \u2014 more than for on-demand services like Uber, and much more than public transportation, which of course isn\u2019t available everywhere.", "The cost is partly a result of complexity. Shuddle puts drivers through a more extensive screening than its ride-share competitors, including requiring that they have previous child care experience. As a result, almost all of its 250 drivers are female. To allocate drivers efficiently in low-density areas like the suburbs, parents must schedule rides ahead of time, and to help coordinate the rides, children must carry basic cellphones. The company uses software to track how carefully its drivers are driving.", "But Mr. Allen has a plan to sharply reduce prices: car-pooling. As Shuddle grows, it will learn enough about the ride habits of local families to put multiple children in cars or vans together, which would significantly lower the price.", "\u201cI\u2019d love to be able to get your kid to school every day for $5 \u2014 basically almost as low as taking the city bus,\u201d Mr. Allen said.", "After hearing the start-ups out, I remain unsure if they will ever get to the point where they can serve the masses. Yet even if Shuddle and Munchery do not get their prices low enough to go mainstream, they deserve credit for trying \u2014 rather than focusing only on the wealthy."], "https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/a-new-commenting-system-and-what-it-means-for-you/": ["Student comments have always been the heart and soul of this blog, and during busy months we can field some 3,000 of them a week.", "Up until now we\u2019ve done this via a simpler system than the one used by most sections at NYTimes.com, but on May 6, we\u2019re finally joining the rest of the paper \u2014 and getting all the bells and whistles that go with it.", "There are many advantages to the change for teachers and students, but there are also a few new features that may confuse longtime readers.

But the joke suggests how little regard even Google\u2019s executives held for Android a decade ago. Android, software that runs smartphones, tablets and a variety of other machines, was a side bet, and few considered it consequential to the search company\u2019s fortunes.", "Things have changed. In an era ruled by portable computers, Android has become essential to Google\u2019s future. Like an unstoppable friendly bacteria advancing upon a powerless host planet, Android, in the last five years, has colonized much of the known world. Android is now not just the globe\u2019s most popular smartphone operating system but the most popular operating system of any kind. More than a billion Android devices were sold in 2014, according to the research firm Gartner. That\u2019s about five times the number of Apple iOS devices sold, and about three times the number of Windows machines sold.", "In other words: About one of every two computers sold today is running Android. Google\u2019s once underappreciated side bet has become Earth\u2019s dominant computing platform.", "Yet all is not well on planet Android. On the eve of Google IO, the company\u2019s annual developer conference that starts Thursday, where Android will once again be a primary topic of discussion, cracks are emerging in Google\u2019s hold over the operating system. Google\u2019s version of Android faces increasing competition from hungry rivals, including upstart smartphone makers in developing countries that are pushing their own heavily modified take on the software. There are also new threats from Apple, which has said that its recent record number of iPhone sales came, in part, thanks to people switching from Android.", "Hanging over these concerns is the question of the bottom line. Despite surging sales, profits in the Android smartphone business declined 44 percent in 2014, according to the independent analyst Chetan Sharma. Over the holidays last year, according to the research firm Strategy Analytics, Apple vacuumed up nearly 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone business. The stark numbers prompted a troubling question for Android and for Google: How will the search company \u2014 or anyone else, for that matter \u2014 ever make much money from Android?", "Google is sanguine about Android\u2019s prospects and said the company\u2019s original vision for Android was never solely about huge profits. \u201cThe bet that Larry, Sergey and Eric made at the time was that smartphones are going to be a thing, there\u2019s going to be Internet on it, so let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s a great smartphone platform out there that people can use to, among other things, access Google services,\u201d said Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google\u2019s vice president for engineering for Android.", "Google points out that its bet has benefited users. The fact that Google does not charge for Android, and that few phone manufacturers are extracting much of a profit from Android devices, means that much of the globe now enjoys decent smartphones and online services for low prices. So we should all be thankful for Google\u2019s largess \u2014 but, at the same time, given the increasing threats to Google\u2019s advertising business, we might also wonder how long that largess can continue.", "Google faces several major Android-related headaches. First, while Google makes most of its revenue from advertising, Android has so far been an ad dud compared with Apple\u2019s iOS, whose users tend to have more money and spend a lot more time on their phones (and are, thus, more valuable to advertisers). Because Google pays billions to Apple to make its search engine the default search provider for iOS devices, the company collects much more from ads placed on Apple devices than from ads on Android devices. A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs estimated that Google collected about $11.8 billion on mobile search ads in 2014, with about 75 percent coming from ads on iPhones and iPads.", "A brighter spot for Google is the revenue it collects from sales via Android\u2019s app store, called Google Play. For years, Android apps were a backwater, but sales have picked up lately. In 2014, Google Play sold about $10 billion in apps, of which Google kept about $3 billion (the rest was paid out to developers). Apple makes more from its App Store. Sales there exceeded $14 billion in 2014, and rising iPhone sales in China have led to a growing app haul for Apple. Still, Google\u2019s app revenue is becoming an increasingly meaningful piece of its overall business, and it is also growing rapidly.", "Google is investing heavily to make sure that continues. Purnima Kochikar, business development director for Google Play, told me her team supporting Android app makers grew \u201cby 15 times\u201d in the last two and a half years. She added that even if hot Silicon Valley start-ups still create apps for iOS first, app makers in other parts of the world see Android as a surer path to the masses. \u201cThe reality is that folks like you should play a role in educating the Silicon Valley,\u201d she said.", "But how long Google can expect Play to keep paying remains an open question, thanks to the second Android-related headache. Google\u2019s strategy of giving Android to phone makers free has led to a surge of new entrants in the phone business, several of which sell high-quality phones for cut-rate prices. Among those is Xiaomi, a Chinese start-up making phones that have become some of the most popular devices in China.", "Because Xiaomi and others don\u2019t make much of a profit by selling phones, they\u2019re all looking for other ways to make money \u2014 and for many, the obvious business is in apps offering mail, messaging and other services that compete with Google\u2019s own moneymaking apps.", "The situation is especially painful for Google in China, the world\u2019s fastest-growing smartphone market, where Google\u2019s apps are blocked. Even in the rest of Asia, where many low-cost phone manufacturers do include Google\u2019s apps on their phones, there\u2019s growing interest in finding some alternative to Google\u2019s version of Android. About 30 percent of Android smartphones shipped in the last quarter of 2014 were actually modified, or forked, versions of the OS that may not be very hospitable to Google\u2019s services, according to the firm ABI Research. To address this problem, last year the company began a program, Android One, to get its services on high-quality, low-priced phones aimed at the developing world.", "One software start-up, Cyanogen, has raised about $100 million from several investors \u2014 and has signed a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Google\u2019s arch-competitor Microsoft \u2014 to sell phone makers an alternative user interface that works on top of Google\u2019s Android.", "\u201cWe share services revenue with the phone makers \u2014 and today they get very little of that from Google,\u201d said Kirt McMaster, Cyanogen\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere are very few companies in the world today that really like Google. Nobody wants Google to run the table with this game. So it\u2019s a good time to be a neutral third party. We\u2019re Switzerland, and we want to share that revenue with our ecosystem partners in a meaningful way.\u201d", "Google, for its part, said there was ample room in the Android world for a variety of services to thrive. \u201cIt\u2019s up to any party in these ecosystems to figure out how they want to make money,\u201d Mr. Lockheimer said.", "The final threat for Google\u2019s Android may be the most pernicious: What if a significant number of the people who adopted Android as their first smartphone move on to something else as they become power users? In Apple\u2019s last two earnings calls, Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, reported \u201ca higher rate of switchers than we\u2019ve experienced in previous iPhone cycles.\u201d Apple has not specified the rate of switching, but a survey by Cowen & Company found that 16 percent of people who bought the latest iPhones previously owned Android devices; in China, that rate was 29 percent.", "For Google, this may not be terrible news in the short run. If Google already makes more from ads on iOS than Android, growth in iOS might actually be good for Google\u2019s bottom line. Still, in the long run, the rise of Android switching sets up a terrible path for Google \u2014 losing the high-end of the smartphone market to the iPhone, while the low end is under greater threat from noncooperative Android players like Xiaomi and Cyanogen.", "Android has always been a tricky strategy; now, after finding huge success, it seems only to be getting even trickier."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/technology/silicon-valley-pays-tribute-to-dave-goldberg-at-memorial-service.html": ["STANFORD, Calif. \u2014 For a few hours on Tuesday, Silicon Valley stopped rushing headlong into the future.", "Dave Goldberg\u2019s memorial service had no golden screens, no world-changing dreams or epic lines of code.

Either Pied Piper will win the battle, get the porn contract, and live to see another day\u2014or it won\u2019t, and it will die.

Many of the world\u2019s biggest tech products \u2014 from the iPod to the iPhone to Google search to Facebook \u2014 weren\u2019t new ideas; they were better takes on old ideas, built by better, more able teams.", "Because ideas matter less than execution, we often see that once someone has one good idea in the Valley, several start-ups will move in to try to take that idea big.", "", "And because the spoils are so large, it is not unusual to see them play dirty.

According to some reports, as part of Uber\u2019s effort to recruit Lyft\u2019s drivers to Uber\u2019s service, Uber\u2019s staffers often called up Lyfts and then canceled the rides \u2014 disrupting the reliability of the company\u2019s service.", "So the ethics in \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d mirror the ethics in Silicon Valley. Earlier this season, Endframe tricked Richard, Pied Piper\u2019s founder and hapless chief executive, into divulging his technical breakthrough. Under the guise of a funding meeting at the offices of a venture capital firm, the Endframe group peppered Richard and his coders with questions about their tech \u2014 and Richard obliged, providing detailed schematics on a whiteboard. The Endframe group apparently took notes, and they quickly came up with their own copy of Pied Piper\u2019s breakthrough compression algorithm.", "This week, in a showdown at Endframe\u2019s offices, Richard spots a flaw in the company\u2019s copy. \u201cYour tech is always going to be worse than ours,\u201d he tells them, thinking he\u2019s wielding the trump card.", "But it\u2019s no trump.

Last year, Old Navy took in almost $6 billion in sales in the United States \u2014 almost as much in sales as the Gap and Banana Republic brands put together \u2014 and made up 40 percent of the company\u2019s global revenue. Earnings due this week are expected to underscore Old Navy as Gap\u2019s biggest driver of growth as its other big labels are struggling.", "Still, Old Navy faces a challenge in sustaining that strong growth in a world of cheap fashion that increasingly seems a race to the bottom.", "Mr. Larsson is unfazed. \u201cI saw an unpolished diamond in Old Navy,\u201d Mr. Larsson said in a recent interview \u2014 his first since taking the helm at the brand \u2014 in a corner of a bustling staff cafeteria at Old Navy\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. \u201cEverything starts and ends with product.\u201d", "Old Navy\u2019s success so far under Mr. Larsson has been built on a level of attention to design that sellers of low-end, family-oriented clothes \u2014 including the old Old Navy \u2014 had not put into their wares.

Matching a $10 T-shirt with a designer bag has become much more common, as shoppers grow more selective about what they will splurge on. And even as consumers benefit from lower gas prices and a stronger job market, cautious households \u2014 especially those with children \u2014 have preferred to invest in fundamentals like their cars or homes rather than their wardrobes.", "All that has been a boon to Old Navy. Sales at established stores jumped 11 percent in the fourth quarter, by far the fastest rate shown by a mass apparel brand in the critical holiday season.", "\u201cOld Navy\u2019s approach used to be selling commodities,\u201d said Betty Chen, a retail analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. But the more stylish clothes and marketing that Mr. Larsson has brought to the brand have had \u201ca strong halo effect,\u201d Ms. Chen said, that has bolstered the brand\u2019s image. \u201cAnd price points are so much lower than Gap or Lululemon.\u201d", "Conceived by Gap in the early 1990s as a response to efforts by rivals to undercut Gap on price, the marked-down version of itself was wildly successful at first. Shoppers were drawn by Old Navy\u2019s promise to combine the style and quality of Gap clothing with the low prices and big selection of a Home Depot. The whimsical layout of the stores, with concrete floors and display cases fashioned from stripped-down school lockers, was a hit in the working-class neighborhoods where they opened. Within four years, sales at Old Navy reached $1 billion, the fastest rate at the time for any retailer. (Even Google took longer to reach that milestone.) Gap opened Old Navy stores at a breakneck pace.", "That expansion started to go awry in about 2000, right around the time that H&M, the Swedish fast-fashion juggernaut, opened its first store in the United States, in Manhattan. Its strappy dresses and sharp jackets were not only cheap, but also were straight off the fashion runways. Old Navy\u2019s laid-back hoodies and campy ads started to feel uninspired by comparison. A partnership in 2007 with the celebrity designer Todd Oldham flopped. The recession took a huge bite out of retail spending, even at the low-end Old Navy. Its sales fell by more than $1 billion from 2006 to 2008. Morale hit a low.", "Brought in to rescue a brand in distress, Mr. Larsson set to work assembling a heavyweight team. He hired Ivan Wicksteed, former global creative director of Coca-Cola and the architect of brand makeovers at Converse and Cole Haan, as chief marketing officer.

Previously, its merchants would buy clothes from higher-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue or Abercrombie & Fitch and pick pieces to adapt, often clumsily, for Old Navy stores.", "\u201cWe were taking a product that was in the marketplace and we were bringing it to market maybe a year later,\u201d Ms. Stanton said. \u201cAnd our designers were designing for somebody else. So you used to get design teams say: \u2018Well, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d wear that, but it\u2019s O.K. for Old Navy.\u2019 \u201d", "Ms. Stanton instead pushed to build Old Navy\u2019s own design muscle, leaning on Gap\u2019s supply chain to allow designers to quickly test various prints, shapes and sizes in small runs in stores before increasing the production of styles that were with a hit with shoppers. It shifted its collection from everyday or basic items to others that were on-trend and in season. Instead of hiring designers whose experience was in the low-price market, Old Navy hired top talent: an accessories and bag designer from Coach, athletic wear designers from Nike and Reebok, the men\u2019s apparel director from North Face.

But that\u2019s what happens in the fashion industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you keep competing with generic products, and a higher and higher discount, you\u2019re going to lose. If Apple doesn\u2019t continuously refresh its products and make them current, they\u2019re dead. And that would happen here as well.\u201d", "A new area that Old Navy has thrown itself into is active wear, for the first time investing heavily in performance fabrics, like breathable textiles. With sportswear, Old Navy is tapping into a trend that has swept through fashion, as sneakers and yoga pants take the place of jeans and pumps. But where a pair of yoga pants from Lululemon might cost almost $100, the same amount would outfit an entire family in performance wear at Old Navy, Ms. Stanton said.", "There are big challenges ahead for the company. For one, it starts to be compared against a year of strong sales, making further growth particularly difficult. In the first quarter of the year, same-store sales growth at Old Navy slowed to 3 percent, though it remained the fastest-growing Gap label.", "Rising wages overseas, as well as heightened scrutiny over working conditions at Gap\u2019s foreign suppliers, also raise concerns over Old Navy\u2019s low-price business model.", "Some analysts also wonder whether the recent jobs growth or savings from gas prices will prompt some shoppers to graduate from Old Navy, rising up the luxury ladder.

Snobbishness in fashion is on its way out, he says, especially among younger generations.", "\u201cThe industry is traditionally built on the ladder, but I don\u2019t know if people aspire to that anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cTimes are changing, and prestige is being looked at differently.\u201d Young shoppers, especially, will always want to save \u2014 \u201cthen they want to travel, experience things,\u201d he said.", "\u201cSometimes when I shop at high-end brands, I get this look when I walk in, like people working there are screening me and asking: Are you good enough to be our customer?\u201d Mr. Larsson said. \u201cI hate it.

That first week of March was no different from the others, spent entirely working and roasting mosquitoes at home.", "Then, on Sunday, I woke up tired and feverish, with a temperature of 102 degrees. I was exhausted and had an annoying headache. But no sore throat, no cough and no viscous substances running through my nose. So I reached Dr. Google and learned that a sudden fever not accompanied by typical flu symptoms is evidence of dengue (or chikungunya, another disease brought on by the same striped mosquito).", "I promptly recalled all the public awareness ads on TV and in magazines urging people to seek immediate medical attention if they suspect they have dengue, and I felt almost a civic duty to report to a hospital. There is no cure for dengue, but timely treatment lowers the death rate below 1 percent. Also, I was taking a prescription anti-inflammatory drug called meloxicam to relieve neck pain and I needed to know, for sure, if I should keep taking it.

Apparently it is possible to test for dengue after the first day of fever, before antibodies appear. The NS1 antigen test is cheap and reliable. I also learned that it was definitely not advisable to continue to take meloxicam because, like aspirin, it could also raise the risk of bleeding; my orthopedist called the next day to forbid me from doing it.", "I assume the doctor I saw at the hospital didn\u2019t report me as having dengue, so I guess I\u2019m not included in the Ministry of Health statistics.

It was the rare academic research that became a mainstream news story, perhaps because its conclusion could be delivered in a succinct and unassailable headline: Gender bias exists, whether we\u2019re conscious of it or not.", "It\u2019s a headline that has been reiterated many times in many fields with an almost fill-in-the-blanks predictability. Google \u201cgender bias\u201d and you\u2019ll be offered a parade of findings that echo those of Goldin and Rouse. One study shows that college students rate online instructors higher in evaluations if they believe their female instructors are men. Another finds \u201ca profound and consistent gender gap\u201d in the ability of female entrepreneurs to attract investors in the same numbers as their male counterparts. Another reports on the striking differences in the ways that professional athletes are portrayed in the media when breaking them down by gender. Yet another determines that female employees in the tech industry receive far harsher performance reviews than male employees do, even when they\u2019ve been deemed to be equally competent on the job.", "All of these studies and others like them conclude that your chances of being chosen, promoted, esteemed and celebrated in the professional realm are lower if you\u2019re a woman, so why wouldn\u2019t it be true for female fiction writers too? The same way that the clarinet in the hands of a woman sounds different when heard from the other side of a curtain rather than when she\u2019s sitting in plain view, we read women writers differently. Writing by women is often interpreted as smaller, more particular and personal, and presumed to speak specifically to other women, while writing by men is often perceived to be broadly commenting upon social structures, institutions and experiences that are universally relevant and resonant to us all. This phenomenon is exaggerated when women write about domestic themes, because notions of domesticity and femaleness are so entangled that many presume it\u2019s the only thing women can write about \u2014 that indeed all literary writing by women is a single-gender genre the Nobel Prize-winner V.\u2009S. Naipaul described as \u201call this feminine tosh.\u201d", "There\u2019s been nary a day in the past decade that I haven\u2019t had to set someone straight about the fact that I wrote my books for people, not women. My female colleagues report much of the same. We swap stories and shake our heads and laugh, but it isn\u2019t funny. Because when an artist has to assert that her intended audience is all humans rather than those who happen to be of her particular gender or race, what she\u2019s actually having to assert is the breadth and depth of her own humanity.", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a secret commission of readers and editors dedicated to the mission of keeping women writers down. I think we live in a patriarchy, which means that everything we observe, desire and consume is in some essential way informed by gender assumptions that privilege men. Change can come from acknowledging and recalibrating the context in which we receive the story, the sentence, the sound. It\u2019s about realizing that the truth can be found when we close our eyes and listen.", "Cheryl Strayed is the author of the #1 New York Times best seller \u201cWild,\u201d the New York Times best seller \u201cTiny Beautiful Things,\u201d and the novel \u201cTorch.\u201d Strayed\u2019s writing has appeared in \u201cThe Best American Essays,\u201d The New York Times Magazine, Vogue, Salon, Tin House, The Rumpus \u2014 where she wrote the popular \u201cDear Sugar\u201d advice column \u2014 and elsewhere.

The one is the sphere of the American man; the other, at least predominantly, of the American woman.\u201d Like many turn-of-the-century thinkers, Santayana was worried about the marginal nature of intellectual and creative work in the United States; he couldn\u2019t help defining it as essentially feminine and contrasting it to the \u201caggressive enterprise\u201d of men in industry and business.", "A split between the public sphere of action and the private one of emotions and feelings characterizes life in the secularized modern world. Santayana witnessed its extreme manifestation in a society predicated on endless expansion \u2014 a continuous exertion of the will to action that has made \u201cdomestic fiction\u201d long seem interchangeable with \u201cwoman\u2019s fiction.\u201d By 1911, the roles of women in post-Civil War America had already moved far away from the prescriptions of \u201cLittle Women.\u201d In \u201cThe House of Mirth\u201d (1905), Edith Wharton had exposed a growing restlessness even within the more luxurious mansions. But the stereotypes of the expansionist New World \u2014 the gendering of the home for women, and the world for men \u2014 have stubbornly persisted.", "Biology was also deemed to be destiny in the Old World. But the norms devised and imposed by Victorian imperialists were eloquently contested, producing two of the greatest novels of English literature: \u201cMiddlemarch\u201d and \u201cTo the Lighthouse.\u201d Today, Hilary Mantel belongs to a long line of women writers who were indisputably essential to the making of English literary culture.", "In the United States, however, the male myths of proud autonomy and self-\u00adreliance have made for a hypermasculine intellectual and literary culture. Its custodians have ranged from Hemingway, the war reporter and boxer manqu\u00e9, to today\u2019s TV anchors lying about their proximity to war. Its insidious prejudices make men seem naturally equipped to tackle complex ideas, chart tectonic geopolitical shifts, summarize the diverse American condition and erect literary skyscrapers like the Great American Novel. Regional, racial and ethnic labels have obscured the reputations of, among others, Carson McCullers, Zora Neale Hurston and Maxine Hong Kingston. Paula Fox and Mary McCarthy, shrewd observers of the liberal imagination\u2019s insincerities, must suffer oblivion in between occasional revivals. At the same time, cultural authority has been endowed on those who document the men in full (Tom Wolfe) as well as warn against the American will\u2019s enslavement by technology (Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo). Novels about suburban families are more likely to be greeted as microcosmic explorations of the human condition if they are by male writers; their female counterparts are rarely allowed to transcend the category of domestic fiction.", "Happily, as Santayana pointed out, \u201cAmerican orthodoxy, though imperious, is not unyielding.\u201d Its grudging concessions to women and minorities have slowly weakened our inherited notions of private and public life. And there are signs that the old literary presumptions are fading: for instance, the general acclaim for Shirley Hazzard\u2019s \u201cThe Great Fire,\u201d a triumph of the moral imagination; the recognition of formal and intellectual resourcefulness in the novels of Jennifer Egan and Rachel Kushner, and in the short fiction of Jhumpa Lahiri, Deborah Eisenberg and Lorrie Moore. The old colonial mansion is being rebuilt on a wholly different foundation. Appropriately, its most ingenious architects seem to be ostensible practitioners of domestic fiction \u2014 such as Barbara Kingsolver (\u201cThe Poisonwood Bible\u201d), Jane Smiley (\u201cA Thousand Acres\u201d) and Marilynne Robinson (\u201cHousekeeping\u201d and \u201cHome\u201d) \u2014 who know that the house of intellect and feeling can be more spacious, when left unlocked, than the tallest skyscraper.", "Pankaj Mishra is the author of several books, including \u201cThe Romantics: A Novel,\u201d which won the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction, and \u201cFrom the Ruins of Empire,\u201d a finalist for the Orwell and Lionel Gelber Prizes in 2013.

At the time, the HoloLens headset was a clunky web of straps, wires and electronics. But it was able to project images onto lenses in front of people\u2019s eyes, adding virtual landscapes and objects on top of the view of the natural world.", "The team leaders thought this augmented reality product had the potential to be the next big thing in consumer technology, as groundbreaking as the PC and the smartphone. But this was Microsoft, the company that had managed, time and again, to take ingenious innovation and bungle it on the way to store shelves. Microsoft had its software on smartphones years before Apple released the iPhone. Few cared. A full decade before the Apple Watch, Microsoft introduced its own computer on a wrist. It did not take off.", "The HoloLens team members were confident in their creation. But they worried that Mr. Nadella, a two-decade Microsoft employee then looking at cost-cutting measures and mass layoffs, would kill it for being too risky and far-out.", "Mr. Nadella didn\u2019t flinch.", "\u201cHe said right away, \u2018This is something that we\u2019re going to do,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Holmdahl said. \u201cWe are going to create a new product category, and this is the type of thing that Microsoft should be working on.\u201d", "That response says a lot about the reshaped Microsoft Mr. Nadella envisions \u2014 one with fewer internal fiefs and with more willingness to favor big bets on new technologies over protecting legacy cash cows. Part of that rebuilding occurred at a Microsoft conference that started on Wednesday in San Francisco, where he sought to mend Microsoft\u2019s frayed relationship with software developers, making it easier for them to convert apps written for Apple and Google\u2019s mobile operating systems to run on Windows.", "In a recent interview, Mr. Nadella, 47, said he and the company had learned from its past mistakes. His Microsoft understands, he says, the discipline needed to build products that look and feel polished. Every part, from hardware to software to online services, must work in harmony.", "\u201cOne lesson learned is you\u2019ve got to finish the scenario with excellence,\u201d said Mr. Nadella, who speaks in verbal arpeggios, emphasizing points with octave-leaping sentences. \u201cYou just cannot stop. You have to complete this, and I think that\u2019s where Apple has taught us all what experience excellence means in the creation of categories.\u201d", "In some ways, Microsoft is already a different place from the infamously balkanized one Mr. Nadella inherited from Steven A. Ballmer in February 2014. Not long ago, the company had about a half-dozen internal systems for managing the development of software; Mr. Nadella is pushing everyone to use a single one, in the belief that top-notch internal tools will help it create top-notch products.", "He has taken up an effort started under Mr. Ballmer to end the factional strife inside Microsoft, making the 118,000-strong work force nimbler. He has rallied them around mantras, like making personal computing more personal through wearables and other devices. To better translate Microsoft\u2019s innovation into products people want to buy, he has directed the company\u2019s research group, the biggest in the technology industry, to work more closely with product engineers.", "And just as important, Mr. Nadella has shown a sense of humility. Mr. Ballmer once laughed at the iPhone in a television interview. Mr. Nadella, in contrast, has aggressively pushed Microsoft\u2019s Office software onto Apple and Android devices \u2014 the very devices that have eroded Microsoft\u2019s influence.", "\u201cTheir arrogance consumed them,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, a longtime critic of Microsoft whose company reached an agreement to cooperate on software integration with Microsoft last year. \u201cNow with Satya, they have a much more open mind about working with people.\u201d", "Still, given the company\u2019s history, there is plenty of skepticism about whether Mr. Nadella can pull off a hit with HoloLens and other inventive products starting to trickle out of the Microsoft pipeline. Analysts have been impressed with Mr. Nadella\u2019s fast-growing cloud computing business, and the company\u2019s stock, up almost 40 percent since he took over, is hovering near a 15-year high. But he hasn\u2019t yet shown whether Microsoft can deliver an earthshaking new technology.", "At the meeting about HoloLens, Mr. Nadella told the team how he wanted the project to proceed. It was not going to be organized like Xbox, the company\u2019s video game system, which developed as a semiautonomous republic. He wanted the group to be fully integrated into Microsoft.", "That meant collaborating with people developing Skype, the company\u2019s online voice and videoconferencing service, as well as the Windows and video games teams. The HoloLens group had already started moving in this direction even before the meeting with Mr. Nadella, but his orders galvanized them. Microsoft says HoloLens will go on sale \u201cin the time frame\u201d when Windows 10, its new operating system, is released this summer.", "In other words, the HoloLens is only a crucible for the new borderless Microsoft Mr. Nadella is seeking to create. No pressure.", "\u2018A Decent Batting Average\u2019", "There is a short list of big technology companies that have staged comebacks that restored them to their former glory. Arguably, that list contains just one name: Apple.", "Microsoft, which passed the 40th anniversary of its founding in April, is an easy target for critics because its golden era, the 1990s, was eons ago on the digital calendar. For today\u2019s young entrepreneurs and software developers, it\u2019s hard to believe the Microsoft of 2015, defanged by antitrust battles and strategic missteps, once ruled the industry.", "It\u2019s also easy to overstate Microsoft\u2019s problems. With $22 billion in profit last year, $87 billion in revenue and a cash pile over $95 billion, it often trades places with Google as the second most valuable technology company in the world after Apple. Windows and the Office suite of productivity software continue to print money, especially from corporate customers, despite a spate of premature obituaries. While Mr. Ballmer was harshly criticized for his tin ear on technology, more than a dozen new products released under his watch exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue.", "Imposing, yes, but Microsoft is rarely named among the future-defining tech companies of today, especially when it comes to the consumer businesses. It is nearly always an afterthought following Amazon, Apple ,Google and Facebook.", "In the interview in early April, Mr. Nadella argued that Microsoft\u2019s misses should be put in perspective.", "\u201cWhat gets lost is we wouldn\u2019t be who we are and as successful as we have been if we didn\u2019t have a decent batting average,\u201d Mr. Nadella said, sitting on a couch in the same understated and window-lined office once occupied by Mr. Ballmer and, before that, Bill Gates. \u201cI think we would be dead and gone if we were just mostly failing. It\u2019s just that our average in the last five years has not been as great as, let\u2019s say, Apple\u2019s.\u201d", "Mr. Nadella pointed in particular to tablet computers. Relying for years on other companies to build all tablets running Windows, he says, led to poor products. Now, the company is heavily advertising the Surface, a tablet that Microsoft designs and builds.", "Of course, it\u2019s one thing to make hardware and another thing to make good hardware.", "Attention to detail, so crucial in today\u2019s hardware market, has not been Microsoft\u2019s strongest suit. When Microsoft first introduced the Surface several years ago, the company did not have a touch-screen-friendly version of its Office applications \u2014 the hugely popular programs like Word and PowerPoint \u2014 ready to go at the start. It was a bit like trying to sell a car with one wheel missing.", "A similar problem arose last year, shortly after Mr. Nadella became chief executive. The team working on a new version of Surface was frustrated that it took multiple steps \u2014 start the device, enter a password, open an app called OneNote \u2014 before a user could start taking notes on the tablet with a stylus.", "\u201cBy the time you\u2019re done, you probably would have said, \u2018I just would have wrote this down on a piece of paper,\u2019 \u201d said Steven Bathiche, a Microsoft researcher who is now part of the Surface team.", "Hardware and software groups were unable to resolve their conflicts, each fearing that changes would throw them off schedule.", "Mr. Nadella was not pleased.", "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to ship this without making it work,\u201d Mr. Nadella responded at the time. \u201cOne of the advantages of being C.E.O. is you say things like that and people rise to the occasion,\u201d he said.", "By the time the Surface shipped, you could click one button on the stylus to start taking notes.", "Translating Innovation Into Sales", "A big part of Microsoft\u2019s fate rests with its research arm, the quasi-academic group responsible for conjuring breakthroughs that will keep Microsoft relevant for generations to come.", "On Monday, Harry Shum, the Microsoft executive vice president who oversees the research operation, was bursting with pride while demonstrating Skype Translator, a new product that incorporates years of work by researchers to convert voice conversations from one language to another in real time.", "Mr. Shum gamely agreed to conduct a portion of an interview using Skype Translator. Mr. Shum sat in his office, and I sat in a conference room down the hall looking at Mr. Shum\u2019s face on a computer screen. I asked questions in English, and Mr. Shum responded in Mandarin, his native tongue. He answered a question in Mandarin about the impact he says Skype Translator can have, and the software spit out an English transcript and synthesized recording seconds later.", "The software made mistakes \u2014 Skype transcribed his name as \u201cHairy\u201d \u2014 but it got the point across. \u201cToday we have a lot of obstacles of communication,\u201d Mr. Shum said, according to the Skype translation. \u201cBecause we speak a different language, you speak English, I speak Chinese, if we are not able to understand the two sides, the world would have a lot of problems.\u201d", "Founded in 1991 by Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer at the time, as an early warning system for disruptive new technologies, Microsoft Research occupies a building that has a spacious, multistory atrium, filled with a swirl of employees in T-shirts, jeans and other timeless fashions of tech.", "It is the biggest operation of its kind in the technology industry, with more than 1,000 scientists and engineers working in labs as far away as China and Israel. The company\u2019s research-and-development spending last year was $11.4 billion.", "Spending doesn\u2019t guarantee success, however. There is a long history of technology companies fumbling commercial opportunities from research breakthroughs sitting right under their noses. In the 1970s, Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center developed a forerunner of the modern PC, with a graphical user interface and mouse. An outsider who saw it, Steven P. Jobs, was the one who eventually capitalized on the technology with the Apple Macintosh.", "Mr. Nadella is trying to avoid missed opportunities. He has pushed researchers and product engineers to work closer than ever before. He invited Mr. Shum to attend a regular Wednesday-afternoon meeting of a small group called the product leadership team; Mr. Shum is the first representative from Microsoft Research to participate in the sessions.", "Inside the old Microsoft, the translation technology could easily have languished as a cool demo and nothing more. Product groups would have been slow to embrace an experimental technology that could introduce new costs not to mention uncertainty into their release schedules.", "\u201cInstead of saying, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s see what we can do together,\u2019 you\u2019d say, \u2018Well, when you cross this level of accuracy, come and talk to me, then we\u2019ll figure out when we can slot you in,\u2019 \u201d said Gurdeep Singh Pall, the Microsoft corporate vice president in charge of Skype.", "Breaking down barriers at Microsoft is still a work in progress, but some executives said the tone had changed markedly. \u201cSkype had every reason to push back,\u201d said Peter Lee, a corporate vice president at Microsoft Research. \u201cBut instead Gurdeep, especially, just embraced this.\u201d", "\u201cThere\u2019s an eagerness in the business units to pick up ideas that are going to make a significant difference,\u201d said Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, who is on the technical advisory board for Microsoft Research.", "Mr. Shum, who worked for years as a top engineer on Bing, a distant No. 2 in the search engine market to Google, has seen Microsoft get burned in new technology markets before.", "\u201cIt\u2019s at this very critical moment for the company, and either we build products people love or we will be history,\u201d Mr. Shum said.", "HoloLens, too, is jammed with technologies that started in Microsoft Research, including the display technology used to paint virtual images on lenses in front of people\u2019s eyes. It uses cameras developed by Microsoft researchers and first used in Kinect, an Xbox accessory, to map a person\u2019s surroundings so virtual objects stay where they\u2019re supposed to.", "Slick hardware, though, will go only so far. If HoloLens has any chance of becoming a breakout hit, it will need must-have applications \u2014 add-ons that will do for augmented reality what wildly popular services like Instagram and Snapchat have done for smartphones.", "Changing the Game", "At the Microsoft conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company showed examples of how HoloLens will be used. In one, a medical school expects to adopt HoloLens to let students learn anatomy. In another, a building developer plans to have clients explore finished architecture while on a project still in construction.", "Those examples fill nice niches, but they certainly don\u2019t scream mass market. For that, Microsoft is turning partly to games.", "In September, Microsoft paid $2.5 billion for Minecraft, the video game played by tens of millions of people. By January, the logic behind the purchase started to become a little clearer when the company showed the game on HoloLens.", "In Minecraft, players can build and destroy structures, sort of like playing virtual Legos. With the HoloLens, the game is no longer confined to a smartphone or a computer screen, though. Players wearing the headset can decorate the surfaces of a room with Minecraft blocks, then destroy them, if they like. In the demonstration Microsoft showed, it was possible to build on a coffee table, then crush it to expose a cave below.", "Mr. Nadella said HoloLens was a big reason for buying Minecraft.", "\u201cLet\u2019s have a game that, in fact, will fundamentally help us change new categories,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cHoloLens was very much in the works then, and we knew it.\u201d", "At least one thing is certain: Microsoft will have a lot of competition. Magic Leap, a closely watched start-up that Google has invested in, is developing an augmented-reality device. Virtual-reality headsets from Oculus, owned by Facebook, Valve and Sony, which envelop users with virtual environments, are also on the way.", "There is also little evidence so far that the public is clamoring to don a headpiece and wear it for hours. Google Glass is a cautionary tale. The company has pulled back significantly on its aspirations for that computer-in-your-face product, as least for now.", "Doubters have already lined up with HoloLens, certain that Microsoft will once again trip over itself. The product looks as if it will be far more expensive than smartphones, which benefit from subsidies from wireless carriers that lower their initial cost. One current Microsoft executive said HoloLens would cost significantly more than a game console, which runs more than $400.", "Even if Mr. Nadella and other top executives have recognized the need for change, there are still pockets of resistance. Rahul Sood, who ran a venture capital fund inside Microsoft until November, praised Mr. Nadella for changing Microsoft, but said there wasn\u2019t enough risk-taking below him.", "\u201cThe part making that harder is there is a big layer of middle management,\u201d said Mr. Sood, who founded Unikrn, a start-up based in Seattle that is focused on competitive gaming. \u201cI think it\u2019s slowly changing. I think they need more entrepreneurs in the company.\u201d", "Even Mr. Nadella hints at uncertainty when discussing the kind of impact HoloLens will have.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to overhype it like Google Glass and say this is the next,\u201d he says, trailing off. \u201cI want us to be deliberate about what it is.\u201d", "At least with HoloLens, Microsoft appears to be skating to where the puck could be headed in technology, rather than where it has been. Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist in Seattle and a former senior executive at Microsoft, said he was encouraged that the company was doing that rather than playing catch-up in smartphones.", "\u201cThat battle is already fought and lost,\u201d Mr. Silverberg said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to change the game.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/style/the-shaky-moral-compass-of-silicon-valley.html": ["When I lived in Silicon Valley, I was struck by not just the region\u2019s income disparity, but also by the lack of compassion that wealthy tech workers sometimes displayed toward the poor.", "I would overhear tech employees complain about the homeless in degrading ways \u2014 at coffee shops, bars and in parks. Sometimes their disgust spread online. One notorious example took place in 2013, when Greg Gopman, then the chief executive of AngelHack, a code start-up, lamented on Facebook, \u201cwhy the heart of our city has to be overrun by crazy, homeless, drug dealers, dropouts, and trash I have no clue.\u201d (He later deleted the post.)", "This is not exactly in keeping with the Valley\u2019s self-designated catchphrase: \u201cWe\u2019re making the world a better place.\u201d", "Homelessness is everywhere in the Valley. Consider the proximity of the Jungle, an encampment in San Jose, Calif., where 350 homeless people lived in tents and shacks. The Jungle sat like the backdrop for a dystopian sci-fi novel in the shadow of Apple, Google and other tech giants until it was shut down last year after pressure from neighbors and water-quality regulators. Or consider how a 24-hour bus route in Palo Alto becomes an impromptu homeless shelter at night.", "The wayward moral compass of the Valley also manifests itself in the bizarrely frivolous things that some tech execs pursue: an Uber for private jets, a social network for the 1 percent and a dating app only for rich men.", "Sure, every city has its homeless problems (Los Angeles\u2019s Skid Row sits a few miles away from Beverly Hills), but Silicon Valley is supposed to be different, making the world a better \u2026 you get the point.", "Paul K. Piff, a professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine, believes all the money sloshing around the Valley could make some tech executives unaware of their surroundings. He has conducted several social experiments that consistently show that when people gain access to money, their empathy toward the less fortunate falls and, at the same time, their sense of entitlement and self-interest rises.", "\u201cWith money comes a decreased level of compassion towards other people and an increased focus on yourself,\u201d Dr. Piff said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that it is making people bad. It just makes them more internally focused.\u201d", "In one study, Dr. Piff rigged a two-person game of Monopoly to ensure that one participant had the upper hand. Before long, the person who started to win began displaying mean tendencies toward the loser. In another study, Dr. Piff found that poor people gave away more money to people in need than the rich do.", "Other researchers have found that just thinking about money can have a similar effect. Kathleen D. Vohs, a professor of marketing at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, conducted an experiment in which two groups sat in front of a computer screen saver. One group saw fish swim by, the other saw money.", "\u201cThe group that sees the money will be self-concerned, they\u2019ll use the word \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019 more, and they are really worried about what they\u2019ll get out of the situation,\u201d Dr. Vohs said. \u201cThey are also not very good interpersonally; they are not helpful, not kind, not empathetic.\u201d All this, she added, can happen just by thinking about money.", "While Dr. Vohs\u2019s and Dr. Piff\u2019s social experiments are mostly lab-based, and can be applied to anyone with money, they can be illustrative of the way many tech workers live, and why some may be oblivious to the plight of those around them.", "Silicon Valley has been called the greatest creation of wealth in history. A report last year found that the average tech worker\u2019s pay in San Mateo County, home to East Palo Alto and Menlo Park, is $291,497 a year. Even the interns in tech are rich, with some making $75,000 a year, more than the median household income in the United States.", "Moreover, those who are not superrich often live as if they are. Employees at large tech companies commute in free first-class buses and work on campuses filled with numerous perks like free sushi, massages and yoga classes.", "This is not to say that everybody in the Valley lacks compassion. There are plenty of tech workers who volunteer (and don\u2019t advertise their good deeds on Facebook). Mr. Gopman, who once compared the homeless to \u201ctrash,\u201d has become an advocate for people in need, he said in an interview, and recently started a nonprofit to tackle San Francisco\u2019s homeless crisis.", "Big-name tech executives are involved in the effort, too.

There are several versions of this nascent technology, but they generally work by using a projection device that wirelessly picks up information from the phone and uses sophisticated optics to allow the information \u2014 maps, speed, incoming texts, caller identification and even social media notifications \u2014 to hover above the dashboard.

By contrast, a head-up display in the car that gives nondriving information that is out of alignment with the road \u201cis the worst of two worlds,\u201d Dr. Wickens said. \u201cIt is clutter, contributing to potential failure and distraction contributing to potential failure.\u201d", "He said that when the information projected is related to driving and made simple \u2014 like speed or a navigation arrow \u2014 it appears from his research to provide a modest safety advantage.

In place of this certainty are dozens of tiny trade-offs: When is a client matter urgent enough to delay parenting, and which clients can be put off or rescheduled as the need arises?", "The inescapability of these calculations is perhaps the biggest psychic cost of the flexible schedule, according to others who have experimented with it.

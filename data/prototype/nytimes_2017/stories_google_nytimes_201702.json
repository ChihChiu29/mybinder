An additional fabric liner was added to Mr. Taylor\u2019s residual limb. But it was too tight, so the additional liner was removed to allow better suction for the prosthesis. Another technician knelt on the floor, fiddling with the alignment of the new foot.", "When Mr. Taylor\u2019s leg was fitted and he had on a new pair of Nikes, Chris Kort, the owner of Prosthetics in Motion, based in Manhattan, pointed him to a wheelchair for the 60-foot trip to a parallel bar walkway.", "\u201cWhy can\u2019t we walk there?\u201d Mr. Taylor asked, with a mix of urgency and agitation.", "At the end of the five-hour appointment, Mr. Taylor, 36, walked out of the office on two legs, joining the ranks of thousands of New Yorkers who use artificial limbs to help them get around in a city that prides itself on walking and more walking.", "More than 4,000 amputations were recorded in the city during 2014, according to the most recent data from the New York State Health Department. Nationally, statistics indicate that more than half of all amputations are a result of vascular disease, often a complication of diabetes. About 45 percent are a result of trauma and less than 2 percent are, like Mr. Taylor\u2019s, because of cancer. All in, about two million Americans live with amputations.", "The sight of a high-tech carbon-fiber lower leg peeking out from a pair of shorts is increasingly common in New York. But what sets apart Mr. Taylor\u2019s situation is that the operation to remove his right leg below the knee was elective. Mr. Taylor chose to amputate to gain a more active life.", "For much of his life, Mr. Taylor struggled to walk. As a teenager, he had gaping wounds on his feet from a rare skin disease, linear scleroderma, constricting his right ankle with scar tissue. Several years ago, a wound appeared on his leg and never healed. Cancer developed. Last February doctors were confident surgery would remove the cancer, but when it did not, he was presented with two options: drastic reconstructive surgery or amputation.", "\u201cWe went from 5 miles an hour to 100 miles an hour overnight,\u201d he said, referring to the sudden need for a life-changing decision.", "Even though amputation seemed extreme, Mr. Taylor, a product manager at Verizon, committed to exploring it and reconstructive surgery.", "\u201cHow do you shower?\u201d Mr. Taylor recalled wondering. \u201cDo you have your prosthetic on all day? Do you sleep with it on? I really had no idea.\u201d", "A family friend heard about Mr. Taylor\u2019s dilemma and put him in touch with Alec Evedon, a young man in Florida who had decided on amputation after a motorcycle crash left him with 40 percent of the use of one foot.", "\u201cThat mentality that I would rather die than get an amputation quickly changed,\u201d Mr. Evedon, 22, said. He explained the nuances of his new life to Mr. Taylor: You shower using a chair; you wear your prosthesis all day; and no, you do not sleep with it on.", "He also insisted that Mr. Taylor meet with a prosthetist, comparing the intimate, continuing relationship they might have to one with a hairstylist or tattoo artist. Mr. Taylor, whose left arm is covered with tattoos, understood.", "Prosthetics in Motion appeared at the top of a Google search and what was planned as a quick visit turned into three hours. \u201cWe became part of his interview process,\u201d said Michael Lichter, 34, a prosthetic technician with the company. Like Mr. Taylor, he collects sneakers, favors flat-brim ball caps and rides a bike. He is also a below-the-knee amputee, the instant result of a car crash. (\u201cI had on a brand-new pair of Reebok Classics that I was really mad about,\u201d he said.) He spent the following months swamped in depression. After three years in a wheelchair, he got a prosthesis and learned to walk again.", "Mr. Taylor\u2019s choice came during a time when thoughts about how prostheses are worn and what they should look like were shifting, Mr. Lichter said, and that helped to normalize amputation. While many people opt for prostheses meant to look like limbs, the bionic look is becoming more common, especially among military veterans. Even a recent shoe campaign from the designer Kenneth Cole features an uncovered prosthetic leg of a model front and center.", "Drastic reconstructive surgery, or limb salvage, was Mr. Taylor\u2019s other option. Doctors offered differing opinions about how far into the muscle or bone the procedure should go. The only consensus was recovery time: six months of bed rest, provided the surgeon got all of the cancer and no infection developed.", "\u201cHe has suffered so much for so long \u2014 25 years \u2014 that we didn\u2019t want any more huge surgeries that were maybes,\u201d Mr. Taylor\u2019s wife, Christa, said.", "But Mr. Taylor felt pressured to choose reconstruction. He said one doctor, who could perform both operations, refused to even discuss amputation. Others cast shadows over amputee life that did not align with the positive and agile amputees he had met.", "Despite the fact that numerous studies show amputation and reconstruction result in similar function and life quality, amputation seems to be linked with failure, and some doctors have put their patients through hopeless operations to avoid it, said Dr. Daniel E. Prince, an orthopedic oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who performed Mr. Taylor\u2019s amputation.", "\u201cI think it comes from a little bit of the God complex in medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can fix anything.\u201d", "Mr. Taylor came to realize that he felt peaceful about amputation and uncertain about reconstruction. His constricted ankle, even before the cancer, meant walking 10 blocks was a challenge. Reconstruction might get the cancer, but it would not fix the walk.", "\u201cWhat am I trying to save?\u201d he recalled asking himself. \u201cAmputation is going to get me a new prosthetic that will have more range of motion than my actual ankle.\u201d", "In the end, Mr. Taylor knew what to do after an M.R.I. revealed the cancer had spread, reducing the odds that reconstruction would be successful. With his decision made, the surgery could not come fast enough. Mr. Taylor, with a dose of morbid humor, took the first option available \u2014 a Friday the 13th last spring.", "The day of the operation arrived after a sleepless night, but Mr. Taylor said he felt a sense of celebration. For seven years he had spent two hours a day dressing his wounds. That morning he did not bother. As he left his apartment, he noted that he was walking down his last set of stairs on his two feet.", "Now \u2014 nine months after the amputation and five months after his prosthetic fitting \u2014 Mr. Taylor is back on two feet. To measure his progress, he recalls what his right foot had permitted him to do, which was not much. When a friend came to visit New York two years ago, it was Mrs. Taylor who walked around the city with him while Mr. Taylor stayed home. But when someone else came to visit a few weeks ago, Mr. Taylor walked more than two miles, four times the distance he had been limited to previously. Even Mr. Taylor\u2019s physical therapist\u2019s office, a few blocks from his Brooklyn apartment, is now a stroll away rather than a cab ride.", "\u201cThose things I don\u2019t think about anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI just put my leg on and walk and it is on until I go to bed. That\u2019s it.\u201d", "Stairs to the subway are still a challenge. He describes each step down with his prosthetic leg as a slight free-fall rather than a controlled descent. But he waits for the rush of commuters to dissipate before he slowly makes his way down, relying on the handrail. At any rate, he said he was just glad to be taking the subway. The Taylors\u2019 monthly Uber bill has fallen significantly.", "While out with his three dogs recently after a snowstorm, Mr. Taylor walked with a noticeable limp but trod through old snow without a hitch. He had been practicing.", "\u201cIt was a little wobbly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I got used to it.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/podcasts/the-daily/the-daily-unambiguous-enforcement-for-an-unambiguous-law.html": ["United States law is unambiguous: It is illegal to be in this country without documentation.

In a nutshell: He is Felix Kjellberg, one of the world\u2019s most popular video game live-streamers on the internet. He\u2019s amassed an enormous following on YouTube, where he essentially films himself playing video games and talking to the camera. I\u2019ve watched him before \u2014 for the entire length of him beating a video game \u2014 and it\u2019s actually captivating and somewhat intimate, like he\u2019s having an extended discussion with you. He\u2019s made millions of dollars doing it, too.", "Well, that happy arc ended this week, when The Wall Street Journal published a series of stories going back into PewDiePie\u2019s history of video streams, highlighting a series of anti-Semitic acts that have occurred over the last year.", "Kjellberg maintains they were off-color jokes that went too far. But that didn\u2019t stop Disney and YouTube from severing ties with the guy, cutting short his multimillion-dollar contracts.", "So I\u2019m curious. What do you think this episode says about online gamer culture? A ton of folks are coming to Kjellberg\u2019s aid after this whole thing, saying that The Journal has blown the whole thing out of proportion. Do you buy that?", "Farhad: Well, if by \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d he means they accurately reported that he\u2019s repeatedly invoked Nazi imagery and recently paid some folks to hold up a sign saying \u201cDeath to All Jews,\u201d then I guess that\u2019s right!", "But I suspect PewDiePie is not ignorant of online culture. You don\u2019t get to be YouTube\u2019s biggest star without understanding the racist underbelly of the internet. It\u2019s perfectly fine, in some online circles, to say terrible things about others and then to laugh it off as just a meaningless joke that only offends humorless \u201csnowflakes.\u201d It seems obvious that PewDiePie was playing with that.", "The bigger question for me is how the big sponsors of these stars of tomorrow \u2014 companies like Google and Disney \u2014 change how they vet people like PewDiePie. Tomorrow\u2019s celebrities are going to come from the internet culture. To older folks running these media companies, internet celebs are going to look and sound totally off the wall, but the execs are going to feel pressure to sign them based on their huge popularity. It seems clear no one at Disney was actually paying attention to PewDiePie \u2014 the Nazi stuff was out there for everyone to see, and Disney responded only once The Journal came calling. So perhaps that will be the first fix here: actually paying attention to the internet celebs you\u2019ve paid so handsomely.", "Mike: My guess is that\u2019s a generational shift that will take years. I\u2019m genuinely curious how many folks at Disney and YouTube who are high enough up the chain to make multimillion-dollar deals actually watch gaming streams \u2014 I\u2019m guessing not a lot of them. It\u2019s a relatively novel activity, so as ad-buying agencies and the like start hiring people who, um, actually watch the videos they\u2019re selling ads against, perhaps they\u2019ll get smarter about whose videos they choose to sell sodas and sports cars against.", "Anyway, that\u2019s enough from me.

The conference is an annual trade show in Barcelona, Spain, where executives from across the telecom, media and technology worlds gather to meet and, potentially, sign new deals.", "Mr. Hastings\u2019s headline act \u2014 part sales pitch, part industry update \u2014 comes as Netflix\u2019s attention has increasingly turned to its overseas subscribers.", "The Orange deal, one of Netflix\u2019s first international partnerships, is a case in point.", "The two sides finally reached an agreement in late 2014, just as Netflix began expanding across much of Europe. As part of the deal, Orange customers are offered a one-month free trial with Netflix and the ability to pay for the streaming service through their existing monthly contracts. Orange has also entered into an undisclosed revenue-sharing pact in France, which has often been wary of the potential for Netflix\u2019s American shows to outmuscle local content.", "But the talks were not all smooth sailing.", "Along with the typical back-and-forth about how much revenue each side would receive from the deal, Orange was concerned that Netflix, whose European headquarters are in Amsterdam, had not signed on to French rules requiring online video distributors to fund local-language content.", "St\u00e9phane Richard, the company\u2019s chief executive, also had said he would not work with Netflix, fearful that Orange would become a \u201cTrojan horse,\u201d potentially helping the streaming service gain a global following, only to then cast Orange aside.", "But for cable and cellphone companies from Bulgaria to Bolivia, the calculation is simple. Though many of them initially resisted such deals with online content providers, gaining access to Netflix\u2019s exclusive programming helps set them apart from local rivals, just as customers\u2019 online habits have shifted toward video, particularly on their smartphones and other mobile devices.", "\u201cNetflix wants to be exposed to as many people as it can,\u201d said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders Analysis, a media and telecom industry research company in London. \u201cTelecom operators want to keep people inside their walls, so they are willing to let Netflix in.\u201d", "Netflix\u2019s American revenue, $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, still constitutes a majority of its sales.

After an uneasy standoff, Netflix eventually agreed to pay for improved access. In response, late last year, Comcast decided to include the streaming service on its set-top cable box, so people could watch Netflix without having to leave Comcast\u2019s digital universe.", "Overseas, Sky, the British content and cable provider, has refused to include Netflix on its own set-top box, primarily because it views the streaming service as a direct competitor to its own original programming.", "Telekom Indonesia, that country\u2019s largest telecom operator, also banned Netflix from its network last year, saying it was not registered to offer content there. The company, which is state owned, later signed a deal with iFlix, a competing streaming service from Malaysia.", "Analysts say many operators, even those that have signed partnership deals, still fret that Netflix \u2014 alongside other American tech giants like Google and Facebook \u2014 will benefit more from these relationships than they will. Avid television watchers, for instance, have invested emotional capital into popular Netflix shows like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cNarcos,\u201d and often view their cable provider as a mere conduit to watching such digital content.", "\u201cNetflix\u2019s exclusive shows are dominating people\u2019s water cooler moments,\u201d said Tony Gunnarsson, a senior analyst at Ovum, a technology research firm, in London. \u201cConsumers are already watching Netflix, so it\u2019s better for operators to add Netflix to their services or people will go elsewhere.\u201d", "For Bob Greene, managing director of online entertainment at Liberty Global, a cable giant controlled by the billionaire John C.

Netflix had hoped to be included on Liberty Global\u2019s millions of set-top boxes from Latin America to Europe.", "At first, Mr. Greene said, Liberty Global limited the partnership to Britain, including the Netflix app on its cable service but keeping billing separate. (It takes an undisclosed of percentage of revenue from its subscribers signing up to Netflix.)", "Yet as Liberty Global crunched the numbers, it realized that its British customers who watched Netflix were less likely to jump to rival products and showed more loyalty to its own services.", "So in early 2016, Mr. Greene renewed negotiations with Netflix to expand the partnership, eventually signing a worldwide deal to offer the streaming service in its more than 30 markets across Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe by early next year, at the latest.", "\u201cIf our customers want Netflix and we don\u2019t offer it, they\u2019ll find another way to get it,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cWe\u2019re better off if they don\u2019t have to go elsewhere to find what they want.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/podcasts/the-daily-president-trumps-foreign-policy-muse.html": ["Back on the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald J.

The works in this exhibition, \u201cFirst Look: Artists\u2019 VR,\u201d all make use of animation \u2014 far cheaper than filmed virtual reality, which requires 360-degree camera rigs \u2014 and all employ a more or less surreal vocabulary: Objects float in space, spaces collapse into one another. Unlike video games, these artworks are not responsive to users; many of them are tentative explorations of the medium\u2019s potential rather than full-fledged achievements.

Her work \u201cMan Mask\u201d plops you in a hazily defined, whited-out world, derived from scenes from the video game \u201cCall of Duty\u201d \u2014 and she has distorted the game\u2019s soldiers and mercenaries into translucent shades while a woman\u2019s voice recites an EST-style mantra of \u201chappiness, peace and cheerfulness.\u201d", "Ms. Rossin\u2019s obscure figures and cynical voice-overs find an echo in \u201cTransdimensional Serpent,\u201d by the virtual reality veteran Jon Rafman, which places you amid white humanoids, satyrs and snakes in an empty space, a forest, and a ruined interior.", "Other works are less manifold.

Jeremy Couillard\u2019s project is a jokey portal to the afterlife, in which you rise from a cartoon cadaver and ascend through colorful, heavenly tubes.", "Mr. Couillard has also devised video games in the past, and many artists using virtual reality seem closer to game designers or cinematic animators than to painters or sculptors. What\u2019s unexpected, therefore, is that so few of the virtual reality artworks I\u2019ve seen really require its immersive capabilities. All of the projects in \u201cFirst Look\u201d can be streamed both in stereoscopic form, to be seen through the goggles, or as flat images, to be watched on your phone\u2019s screen, and the difference is often negligible.", "Some works, such as Jacolby Satterwhite\u2019s \u201cDomestika\u201d \u2014 another in his many astral mock-ups featuring men in titillating positions \u2014 actually function better without goggles on, and exhibit little difference from two-dimensional video works. Though the virtual reality imagery has been rendered in a sphere, rather than a flat plane, the effect is the same, and if that\u2019s so, must we really put a silly cardboard mask on our faces?", "New technologies have promised to uproot artistic conventions many times, but rarely do the promised revolutions ever arrive. The development of the web in the early 1990s led to a boom in \u201cnet art,\u201d which busted along with the dot-com bubble. At MoMA PS1 last summer, the excellent retrospective of the Chinese artist Cao Fei featured an offline computer running an archived copy of Second Life: a defunct alternate-universe game from the early 2000s, in which Ms. Cao constructed a surreal environment inhabited by her alter ego, China Tracy. There might be more applicability for augmented reality, which layers digital material atop the real world. Last summer, the Seattle Art Museum commissioned Tamiko Thiel to develop an augmented reality artwork viewable in the Olympic Sculpture Park, which overlaid the natural greenery with strange, ecologically worrying additions. But the crashed-and-burned Google Glass \u2014 remember when those were going to \u201crevolutionize the art museum\u201d? \u2014 should serve as a caution that even the less immersive augmented reality can seem too disruptive for many.", "What works for video game designers may be less applicable for fine artists, for whom the creation of images is supposed to be a means to something larger, and not an end in itself. That was the great lesson of modernism: Art is more than mere illusion, and it gains further meaning by pushing media to the limits of their capabilities. Virtual reality, by contrast, is a medium without limits \u2014 a medium that tries to parallel life itself. The wonder I felt when I first put on an Oculus Rift, and lost myself in Mr. Steegman Mangran\u00e9\u2019s rain forest or Ms. Rossin\u2019s floating world, is undeniable.

She began the song singing against a lone repeated piano note; she ended it a cappella, and in between it was framed against low, grave strings.

This wasn\u2019t a performance concerned with perfection; it was meant to telegraph passion. \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d is a seductive song about awareness and action (or lack thereof) and Ms. Perry restlessly stalked a rotating stage as though she couldn\u2019t be contained. By the end of the song, the white picket fence she sings about in the first verse has been dismantled and turned into a canvas for the United States Constitution.

If Ms. Keys sounded more natural but no less volatile in her vocal drama, it\u2019s probably because she has had a lot more experience. The other collaboration bolstered a country singer with a soul band. Sturgill Simpson performed his \u201cAll Around You\u201d (from the best country album winner, \u201cA Sailor\u2019s Guide to Earth\u201d), with the horn section from the Dap-Kings, who had backed the soul belter Sharon Jones until her death in November.

Lady Gaga has sung about being addicted to fame before (see her first album, \u201cThe Fame\u201d), and she\u2019s dallied with turning herself into a rock star. She\u2019s also sung duets with Tony Bennett and tried to fashion herself into a rootsy balladeer.

The Time had their old dance moves, which some audience members joined in on, but the choice of material was self-serving. Then Bruno Mars arrived to play \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d like a Prince tribute band, with costumes (purple jacket, ruffled shirt), equipment (a white guitar with a long appendage) and showmanship modeled directly on the movie \u201cPurple Rain\u201d; Mr. Mars even handled the guitar solos.

Both write slick pop melodies and were just happy to be there. But the performance was arranged as a literal mash-up, with Ms. Ballerini inserting bits from her song \u201cPeter Pan\u201d within Lukas Graham\u2019s big hit \u201c7 Years.\u201d It made little sense. \u201cPeter Pan\u201d is a high-class kiss-off to an immature boy, while \u201c7 Years\u201d is a weepy coming-of-age tale about making it in the music business. With the artists alternating sections, it was hard to get a grasp on either song. And because \u201c7 Years\u201d was a bigger pop hit (and has been out as a single longer), Ms. Ballerini couldn\u2019t help but feel like an afterthought.

Flashing lights and disco dancers on stage were a homage to \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d the 1977 blockbuster that mainstreamed disco and gave the Bee Gees a clutch of hits. The movie\u2019s star, John Travolta, had made an appearance earlier in the show.

With its frontseat singalongs, \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d has proved humanizing for untouchable stars like Justin Bieber and Mariah Carey (and further endeared fans to Adele and Michelle Obama), but forcing it live at the Grammys, sans a real vehicle, fell flat. Jennifer Lopez, John Legend, Keith Urban and others all seemed to struggle with the words to Neil Diamond\u2019s \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d \u2014 though Mr. Diamond looked pleased to be there \u2014 and the segment couldn\u2019t help but feel like a transparent bid to recreate Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s Oscar selfie.

For an editor, proving a negative to a writer \u2014 especially one facing the possibility that his beloved last paragraph, his \u201ckicker,\u201d has to be thrown out \u2014 is always hard.

However, those who experienced such an attack through their home gadgets reported losses of $1,000 to $5,000 from the incidents.", "\u201cThere\u2019s still this whole sort of, \u2018Gee whiz, it\u2019s so cool\u2019 thing that\u2019s going on\u201d with internet-connected home appliances, said Lee Tien, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights. \u201cThat\u2019s also what often gets us into trouble.\u201d", "As smart home devices become more popular, they will become bigger targets for hackers. So it behooves us to get ahead of the curve by securing our home appliances, using these tips from security experts who have closely studied smart home accessories.", "When shopping for an internet-connected home device like a smart speaker, lighting system or television set, a good rule of thumb is to go with a trusted brand.", "Larger, well-regarded companies like Amazon or Google have a background in developing products with security in mind, said Liviu Arsene, an analyst for Bitdefender, which sells security hardware for protecting smart home accessories. Before buying a product, consumers should do a web search on it to see if the company regularly issues software updates that fix security vulnerabilities, he said.", "People should also carefully read company privacy policies. David Britton, a vice president in the fraud and identity department of Experian, the credit reporting agency, said people should be curious about whether companies themselves were a threat to user privacy.", "\u201cWhat are they capturing about you?\u201d he said. \u201cIs the data leaving the device? Is it being sent back to the mother ship?\u201d", "Consider the smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Amazon said its Alexa smart assistant, which is used in its Echo speakers, automatically downloads software updates to defend against new security threats. Data from the Echo is also uploaded to Amazon\u2019s servers only after people utter the wake word \u201cAlexa,\u201d the company said. That minimizes the likelihood that the device will record conversations unrelated to requests intended for Alexa.", "Google said its Home speaker similarly issued regular software updates and employed advanced security features, like a technique that disables the device if its software is tampered with. The company added that the speaker processed speech only after the words \u201cO.K. Google\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d were detected.", "But other large brands occasionally engage in behavior that customers may find objectionable. The smart TV maker Vizio, for example, made headlines with revelations from the investigative news site ProPublica that it kept a detailed record of customer viewing habits and shared it with advertisers, who could then use the information to identify other devices you owned.", "Your Wi-Fi network is the pulse of your smart home, thus it is a vulnerable attack point. Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene suggest connecting all your smart home accessories \u2014 for example, your Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat, Samsung smart refrigerator and Philips Hue smart lights \u2014 onto a Wi-Fi network that is separate from the one connected to your computing devices, like your smartphone, tablet and computer.", "With two distinct Wi-Fi networks, it will be harder for a hacker to jump from infiltrating your smart accessory on one network to a personal computer on the other network, Mr. Arsene said.", "The easiest way to create a second Wi-Fi network is to make a guest network. Many modern Wi-Fi routers, like TP-Link\u2019s Archer C7 (the top router recommended by The Wirecutter, a product recommendations site owned by The New York Times), include the ability to host a network for guests that uses a name and password different from that of your primary network. Quarantining your smart speakers, lights and TV onto a guest network will allow them all to interact with one another, while keeping your computing devices safer in the event that any of the smart accessories are hacked.", "If you are paranoid about your Wi-Fi network being hacked, you can also change the Wi-Fi router\u2019s network settings to disable broadcasting the network name entirely, Mr. Britton said. That would make it difficult for a hacker driving by to detect and compromise your network, though it would also require house guests to manually type in your network name and password when they log on to your Wi-Fi.", "The same security principles for websites apply to the so-called internet of things. You should set strong, unique passwords for logging into each device you own. If you recycle your passwords and one device is compromised, the others can be, too.", "A strong password can be a random string of characters or a nonsensical phrase with numbers and special characters. (Examples: My favorite number is Green4782# or The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%.)", "If you cannot memorize your passwords, that is a good thing: That means they are hard for hackers to crack. Keep them written down on a piece of paper and stored in a safe place, or store your passwords in a password-managing app like 1Password or LastPass.", "While reputable manufacturers of smart home accessories offer software updates to patch security vulnerabilities, it is often up to the consumer to stay on top of updates. Because it lacks a screen, a smart light bulb or an internet-connected power socket is going to have a tough time informing you that it needs a software update.", "Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene recommend that consumers regularly log into the mobile apps or websites for their smart home accessories to check if they need software updates. If updates are available, install them immediately.", "Among security researchers, putting a piece of tape over a computer webcam has become a tongue-in-cheek recommendation for those who are extra paranoid about their privacy. (Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, does it.)", "With smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, there is an equivalent: a mute button to disable the device microphone so it can no longer listen. In the unlikely event that a device is hijacked, muting the microphone could help prevent hackers from listening to your conversations, Mr. Britton said.", "Or you could go the safest route and opt out of having these devices at all. That was the method chosen by Mr. Tien, the lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who previously studied the privacy risks of smart meters, the devices that utility companies use to monitor energy consumption.", "He said he accepted the privacy implications of owning a smartphone, but a smart home accessory?", "\u201cI think it\u2019s sort of asking to have your privacy invaded to have something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that the value of it is really all that great.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/fashion/esquire-magazine-jay-fielden.html": ["To that pocket-square-wearing, sidecar-sipping human known as the \u201cEsquire man,\u201d this was life as it was intended to be: a roomful of wags in natty suits throwing back cocktails and trading banter in one of Manhattan\u2019s hottest restaurants, as willowy models and square-jawed movie stars circled the room.", "At Esquire magazine\u2019s \u201cMavericks of Style\u201d dinner, held at Le Coucou on a rainy night this past November, spirits were so high, and consumed so freely, that it might as well have been 1966 \u2014 doubly so, since Gay Talese, Esquire\u2019s living monument to the New Journalism of the 1960s, was holding court, dry gin martini in hand, a few yards away from Jay Fielden, Esquire\u2019s new editor in chief.", "\u201cThere was a period of time when Esquire had a real literary charisma, and there was a culture that responded to it,\u201d said Mr. Fielden, 48, sounding nostalgic as he reclined in a banquette, wearing a steel-bluel Ferragamo suit and sporting what may be the best head of male hair in the magazine industry, a cascade of artfully coifed curls that calls to mind both the belletrist whimsy of Oscar Wilde and the gunslinger gusto of Wild Bill Hickok. \u201cHow do you make that urgent to a younger generation?\u201d", "It\u2019s a question that may determine the fate of a magazine that for 84 years has not just sought to serve the American man, but to define him. Since the days of Hemingway, Esquire has provided a running seminar in the arts of manhood. It is where young men turned to learn to mix a French 75, tie a full Windsor knot, ogle (in purely aesthetic terms, of course) the latest lingerie-clad Hollywood ing\u00e9nue and absorb life lessons from stoical, stubble-face cover subjects like Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper.", "But times have changed. As we move into the era of transgender bathrooms and L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. studies, when millennials are more likely to take their cultural cues from Justin Bieber\u2019s Instagram feed than 6,000-word profiles of Sean Penn, Mr. Fielden is charged not just with bringing back Esquire\u2019s glory days, but with also figuring out exactly what the Esquire man \u2014 that is, the American man \u2014 is in 2017.", "It is up to the 13th editor in Esquire\u2019s history to decide if this is a crisis or an opportunity.", "\u201cIt felt like Armageddon,\u201d Mr. Fielden said, recalling the fire that ripped through his modernist Connecticut home in 2010. \u201cIt just sent this noxious smoke throughout the house. You close your eyes. You can\u2019t breathe.\u201d", "Seated in a glassy Esquire conference room on the 21st floor of the Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Fielden described how the fire and smoke, which was like \u201cexploding 50 cans of spray paint,\u201d destroyed perhaps 80 percent of his family\u2019s possessions.", "\u201cYour first response is, \u2018All our stuff!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut the point is, it was oddly freeing. Subliminally, we all do things to preserve the status quo. The major lesson that has helped me as an editor is to realize not to hang on to the things that would keep you from doing something dangerous.\u201d", "It is a nice metaphor. But even Mr. Fielden admits that it is no simple thing to decide what to keep and what to discard when you\u2019re translating the magazine of Capote and Cheever to the Skrillex generation.", "On that pale winter afternoon, Mr. Fielden, wearing a blue windowpane Cifonelli suit, was reviewing the 102 editorial pages of the March issue, all taped on a wall before him. That issue, complete with a redesign, is the first that fully shows his vision for the magazine. The cover subject is not a chiseled hunk in the mold of Ryan Gosling or George Clooney, but James Corden, the host of CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Late Show.\u201d", "After seeing a Carpool Karaoke segment featuring Mr. Corden, Rod Stewart and ASAP Rocky, Mr. Fielden began wondering if Mr. Corden was a good model for the new Esquire man. \u201cHe represents a lot of what I\u2019m after,\u201d he said, explaining that his version of Esquire \u201cis aimed at a reader who\u2019s an upstart, an iconoclast, an independent thinker, the most charming guy in the room.\u201d", "A portly Everyman with an impish wit, Mr. Corden is at heart a disrupter, Mr. Fielden said, the kind of man who looks totally at home in a red custom-made Gucci suit and silk Gucci loafers embroidered with tigers, as he appears in the issue.", "\u201cI mean, here\u2019s this bloke from England who\u2019s a little overweight, with his zaftig charisma showing up, taking the latest slot that potheads and college students watch, and suddenly he\u2019s become a viral sensation that\u2019s global,\u201d Mr. Fielden said, a trace of his Texas twang poking through.", "That talk show host was hardly the only peacock to grace the pages of that issue.", "In a telling sign that Mr. Fielden plans to blow out fashion coverage, adding color and spectacle, the March issue features a model wearing a \u201ccyberpunk meets Outward Bound\u201d foul-weather ensemble by Prada, including pink scuba sneakers and a raincoat with a print inspired by Google Earth, that might give Jared Leto pause.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no cigar smoke wafting through the pages,\u201d Mr. Fielden said, \u201cand the obligatory three B\u2019s are gone, too \u2014 brown liquor, boxing and bullfighting.\u201d", "As a straight white man, Mr. Fielden does not exactly represent a departure for the top of the Esquire masthead. Indeed, his profile is almost too perfect for the job. Craggily handsome in a vaguely Willem Dafoe way, he grew up in San Antonio with a father who enjoyed hunting and fly fishing, so he has the \u201carts of manhood\u201d element deep in his DNA.", "But Mr. Fielden is also fashion fluent (he edited Men\u2019s Vogue, working with Anna Wintour, until that magazine closed in the great magazine die-off of 2008 and 2009), as well as literary (he edited articles by the likes of George Plimpton at his first magazine stop, The New Yorker).", "His ability to cross boundaries was on display at Town & Country, a magazine associated with ladies who lunch, where Mr. Fielden managed to increase revenues 46 percent over his five-year reign there, in part by attracting more male readers.", "\u201cI gave Town & Country some teeth, reporting on behavior that wasn\u2019t always that which, well, Emily Post would approve, like having an evening toke instead of a Scotch on the rocks,\u201d said Mr. Fielden, who still serves as that magazine\u2019s editorial director.", "While he aims to do the inverse at Esquire, and bring in more female readers, Mr. Fielden nevertheless has a legacy to protect at Esquire. Esquire, after all, has been the industry\u2019s most exclusive boys club for eight decades running.", "When Esquire debuted from its Chicago headquarters in 1933, it was a magazine with a mandate.", "\u201cEsquire aims to be the common denominator of masculine interests,\u201d a mission statement in that first issue read. Esquire, the statement said, would be a pointed rebuke to the \u201cmad scramble\u201d for female readers (and their advertising dollars) by the general-interest magazines of the day, which provided features for men only \u201cafter the manner in which scraps are tossed to the patient dog beneath the table.\u201d", "Esquire provided anything but scraps. That first issue was like the publishing equivalent of \u201cMeet the Beatles,\u201d with Arnold Gingrich, the founding editor, serving up articles by a future Nobel Prize winner (Ernest Hemingway), a future poet laureate of the United States (Joseph Auslander) and a heavyweight champion (Gene Tunney), not to mention work by literary lions including Ring Lardner Jr., Dashiell Hammett and John Dos Passos.", "Through the Depression and the war years, the pages of Esquire were the place to be for the brightest and brawniest of American writers. Hemingway published his classic story \u201cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro\u201d in the magazine in 1936. F. Scott Fitzgerald seemed to spend more time in Esquire than in the Commodore Hotel bar, publishing 43 stories in the magazine in just seven years before his death in 1940 at age 44.", "Despite its literary bona fides, Esquire was no undergraduate seminar. Thanks to steamy pinup illustrations by artists including Alberto Vargas, Esquire was basically Playboy before Playboy. A ban of Esquire by the Office of the Postmaster General led to a watershed 1946 Supreme Court decision on censorship that helped open the floodgates for Hugh Hefner\u2019s topless Playmates the next decade.", "Observers might have expected this monument to bourbon-and-shotguns manhood to crumble when faced with the rise of feminism, flower power and civil rights in 1960s. Instead, Esquire entered a second golden age.", "\u201cA successful magazine has to build a myth its readers can believe in,\u201d decreed the celebrated editor Harold Hayes, and under his watch, Esquire did not just cover the \u201960s, it became part of the story.", "The art director George Lois, known for his cover showing Andy Warhol being sucked into a can of Campbell\u2019s soup, turned the Esquire cover into a form of pop art: the boxer Sonny Liston as \u201cthe first black Santa Claus\u201d; the Italian actress Virna Lisi with a face full of shaving cream for a 1965 article on \u201cThe Masculinization of the American Woman.\u201d", "Showing off his instincts for journalistic anarchy, Mr. Hayes dispatched the literary pranksters Terry Southern, Jean Genet and William Burroughs into the tinderbox of the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Facing down the armies of the police in the riot-torn city, the kimono-clad Mr. Genet, a prostitute and thief turned novelist, concluded that America would be better off being \u201creduced to powder.\u201d", "Like that heady spirit of revolution, however, Esquire\u2019s zenith could not last. But as a result, for nearly 50 years, every new Esquire editor \u2014 there were six in the 1970s alone \u2014 assumed the job with an implicit mandate, to bring it back to its glory years.", "There were game attempts. Clay Felker, the founding editor of New York Magazine, took over the publication in 1977 and attempted to revive it as Esquire Fortnightly. While Mr. Felker had his hits (movies like \u201cUrban Cowboy\u201d and \u201cLegends of the Fall\u201d grew out of articles on his watch), the magazine bled money and was soon bought by an upstart publisher of giveaway magazines headed by two young Tennesseeans, Phillip Moffitt and Christopher Whittle, who installed Mr. Moffitt, then 32, as editor.", "Industry skeptics reacted as if Tiger Beat had snapped up The New Yorker, but the new regime rode the \u201chip to be square\u201d 1980s, when classic Eisenhower-era suits, cocktails and social climbing roared back into fashion, to a striking turnaround, selling the magazine to Hearst in 1987.", "But by 1994, Esquire\u2019s rival, GQ, had surpassed it in circulation and advertising pages, with titles like Details making a claim on Generation X. Esquire replaced the highly regarded editor Terry McDonell with the longtime New York magazine boss Edward Kosner, who vowed to revive its legacy as a writer\u2019s magazine.", "Sometimes it worked. Other times, attempts to channel the spirit of Mr. Hayes fell flat, such as when Norman Mailer, then 71, took on the Madonna phenomenon. Writing in the third person, Mr. Mailer caught up with the star after a draining photo shoot, writing, \u201cOf course her breasts would be the first part of her to express such physical discontent, even as any good fellow\u2019s penis would shrivel when low in spirit.\u201d", "By 1996, The New York Times was observing Esquire\u2019s \u201cthinning spine and declining circulation.\u201d A year later, Hearst handed the reins to David Granger, GQ\u2019s celebrated executive editor.", "Mr. Granger\u2019s attempts to provoke did not always hit the mark. The endlessly dissected 1997 cover story \u201cKevin Spacey Has a Secret,\u201d written with grand New Journalism pretensions, was widely viewed as a clumsy attempt to \u201cout\u201d Mr. Spacey, who compared the article to McCarthyism.", "Even so, Mr. Granger settled into a 19-year-tenure \u2014 the longest in Esquire\u2019s history \u2014 in which the magazine enjoyed a financial recovery, and became the Meryl Streep of the National Magazine Awards (it won 17 during Mr. Granger\u2019s reign).", "By 2015, however, the numbers had started to slip, and critics were murmuring about Esquire\u2019s seemingly aimless web strategy.", "On Jan. 29, 2016, David Carey, the Hearst president, strode into the Esquire offices with Mr. Fielden to introduce him as the new boss.", "To borrow Mr. Hayes\u2019s phrase, it was time to build some new myths.", "Mr. Fielden takes the helm at a time when men\u2019s magazines as a category seem to be having an identity crisis.

If that\u2019s the Holy Grail, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done with newspapers and magazines for our entire existence, and that\u2019s where this thing has to hit, because the human race is not getting stupider.\u201d", "Even so, Esquire is pouring new resources into the web. This past December, Esquire\u2019s 48-hour pop-up channel, \u201cThe Esquire Guide to Grooming\u201d on Snapchat\u2019s Discover platform, reached more than three million unique viewers.

Trump was considering evicting the press corps from the White House, which became the talk of the Sunday-morning political shows.", "This is not to say that an Esquire editor who reads the literary critic Christopher Ricks for fun in airports has any plans to scuttle Esquire\u2019s prized long-form literary tradition to fit Twitter attention spans.

It is behavior that can ignite road rage in nearby human drivers.", "By comparison, Delphi\u2019s test car, which uses an Intel computing platform installed in an Audi Q5, is more aggressive.

They hunt together all winter and come spring, when the bird is ready to mate, Jenna leaves it in a field with a fresh-killed rabbit to start its own life.", "\u201cYou spend time crafting something beautiful, and then you let it go,\u201d is how Jenna puts it. \u201cThe wild can be human work,\u201d notes Helen Macdonald in her 2014 memoir \u201cH Is for Hawk,\u201d pointing out that without the gentle intervention of falconers who protect their birds until maturity, entire species would now be extinct. Sherman comes from a long line of desert foragers who evolved to trot marathon distances. Aya is a fledgling whose survival is threatened by power lines, farmers and bulldozed woodlands. If we can help them develop their native talents, we\u2019ll have something better than a pet: a partner.", "\u201cOr just a long walk alone in the rain,\u201d Jenna points out. There\u2019s been no sign of Aya since we left her and from this distance, her natural camouflage is already making her hard to spot. A few more steps and she\u2019ll be invisible. A faint jingle of bells indicates she\u2019s still nearby.", "\u201cO.K., here we go,\u201d Jenna says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen? She flies off to be a hawk.\u201d She walks a few more steps, then pulls some food from her pouch, raises her arm, and whistles.", "The branch rustles, and suddenly Aya plunges from the tree, soaring toward Jenna like she can\u2019t wait to be home."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/business/dealbook/snap-ipo-plan-evan-spiegel.html": ["Snap Inc. is aiming to adopt the most shareholder-unfriendly governance in an initial public offering, ever.", "The Snap regulatory filing was disclosed Thursday, and as previously reported, the company will be issuing out only nonvoting shares in its I.P.O. Snap admits that this is unprecedented, acknowledging, \u201cWe are not aware of any other company that has completed an initial public offering of nonvoting stock on a U.S. stock exchange.\u201d", "It is different from its predecessors, Facebook and Google, which went public with a dual class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. In recent years, Facebook and Google have revised this structure to add a nonvoting third class of shares to preserve founder control, yet shareholders have had at least some vote even if they couldn\u2019t sway the results.", "Snap has followed the natural evolution of this disenfranchisement, simply eliminating shareholder rights from the get-go. And this is not just about replicating the venture capital model, where founders get control but investors get board seats and veto rights over significant transactions. Here, Snap is not even giving crumbs.", "For gurus of good corporate governance, this is bad enough, but once you dig into the details of how this nonvoting stock works, it gets much worse for shareholders.", "Snap has set up three share classes. Class A will be offered to the public. These shares have no voting rights and no hope of ever having voting rights.", "Class B shares have one vote each and are convertible into Class A stock. These are shares held by prior investors and employees.", "Then there are the Class C shares, with 10 votes each, which are convertible into Class B stock. These shares are held in equal number by the two Snap co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy. Specifically, each of them holds 107,943,924 Class C shares. These shares will give the two men complete voting control over Snap.", "The two founders have a proxy arrangement that transfers voting control to the other if one dies, but it doesn\u2019t cover whether they vote their shares together while alive, so presumably they could deadlock. Snap has solved this problem by granting a performance stock award to Mr. Spiegel that will be 3 percent of the company\u2019s post-I.P.O. value.", "This award will be paid out in equal quarterly installments over three years beginning in the third full quarter after the offering. After this, Mr. Spiegel will have total control over Snap and Mr. Murphy will simply be a close second.", "The fact that the 26-year-old Mr. Spiegel is getting total control of a new company with uncertain prospects but real growth is perhaps cause for alarm, and I wrote as much last week. Who knows what will happen years from now?", "Snap, which looks a lot like Twitter did at its I.P.O. stage, could also experience bumps in the road as Twitter did. In its prospectus, Snap calls itself a camera company, but it really has just one product, Snapchat, which is beloved by the younger crowd for its disappearing photos and texts.", "Facebook, Google and Microsoft as well as Amazon have survived because of the ability to provide multiple successful offerings. Twitter has struggled with just one product \u2014 the platform on which people the world over, including the American president, send 140-character messages called tweets.", "Whether Mr. Spiegel can expand beyond Snap\u2019s disappearing photos and texts is unknown, though the media machine will certainly turn up the hype to 11 trumpeting claims that he is the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. Indeed, a recent New York Times article on Mr. Spiegel described him being \u201cmature,\u201d a listener and someone Eric Schmidt at Google was talking up as a visionary. This may or may not be pablum, but one has to wonder why it justifies this type of stock given the risks.", "If things are going well, no one is going to question Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy\u2019s control. But if things are bad, then shareholder complaints may be valid, a spur to action. Indeed, control makes sense only if shareholders and the two executives disagree about whether things are going well. But that assumes that shareholders will be irrational or wrong or not know as much as the two men at the helm. The last point may have some validity \u2014 but is it worth complete disenfranchisement, again given that Snap is a very early-stage company and Mr. Spiegel is so young?", "I suppose it all might be palatable for most diversified investors in exchange for the huge potential upside, except for the last two parts of this scheme. First, in October Snap issued a dividend of one Class A share for each Class C share the two men owned. The result was to allow Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy to sell half their shares without worry of losing control. The company could reload this at any point, issuing out another dividend of Class A shares if the two need more money.", "Second, the founders\u2019 control goes away only if they die or when they hold only 30 percent of the Class C shares they held at the time of the I.P.O. This means that Mr. Spiegel or Mr. Murphy can sell 69 percent of his Class C shares and all of his Class A and B shares and still control the company. And then, they can reload with a second dividend of Class A shares on all of the Class C shares.", "So, barring unforeseen circumstances, the only way the two founders are ever really going to lose control of Snap is if both die. This raises some interesting possibilities.", "Hypothetical Scenario 1: Mr. Spiegel is hit by a bus and dies. Mr. Murphy would now have complete control of the company. Yet Mr. Spiegel is supposed to be the visionary executive who justified this voting structure. Or is Mr. Murphy, 28, equally visionary? (Or perhaps it is more likely they are just executing well on the \u201cdisappearing pictures\u201d concept just as Mark Cuban executed well on \u201cinternet radio\u201d before selling broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for billions of dollars.)", "Hypothetical Scenario 2: At age 30, Mr. Spiegel decides that life as a billionaire married to a supermodel (he\u2019s engaged to Miranda Kerr) is more fun spent on an island in the Pacific. He quits his job but still holds Class C shares and wields his power to elect directors and run the company part time.", "Hypothetical Scenario 3: Mr. Spiegel continues to hold the shares and keep his day job and at age 50 is head of a middling internet company with great potential, but he refuses to give up control, or starts behaving erratically.", "Potential investors, particularly the big money managers like the BlackRocks of the world, should likely be asking themselves: Is it all worth it, given the risks? I\u2019d note here that Google has a sunset provision on its dual class shares, while Mr. Zuckerberg is going to give up his ability to control Facebook if he leaves the company with the issuance of Facebook nonvoting stock. Does Mr. Spiegel deserve better than that? And remember the other tech titans, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, all have one share, one vote.", "In its prospectus, Snap says its team is \u201ckind, smart and creative,\u201d which is kind of like Whitney Houston singing, \u201cI believe that children are the future.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot of other stuff about growth and big ideas. Snap may be right, and Evan Spiegel truly is the second coming, but this just does not justify the extreme governance given the risk.

And super-duper-stars aren\u2019t \u201cnice.\u201d", "That narrative persisted until last June, when Mr. Durant, who had spent eight years dutifully toiling in small-market Oklahoma City for the Thunder, became one of the most heavily courted free agents in league history. The bidding war for his services was like a sports-world variation of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d", "As Mr. Durant holed up in the Hamptons with his agent, Rich Kleiman, to field pitches, the league\u2019s glamour teams descended, dangling monster contracts and a chance at movie-star-scale celebrity. The Boston Celtics even brought along Tom Brady to flash a Super Bowl ring. Even so, no one ever thought he would really leave his heartland home. He was too, you know, nice.", "But he did. Not only did he set in motion one of the great superstar divorces in league history with his old point guard, Russell Westbrook, but he joined the juggernaut Golden State Warriors, a longtime punching bag that had transformed into the Google of pro basketball. Last season, they won a record 73 regular-season games; featured Stephen Curry, the back-to-back league M.V.P.; and beat the Thunder in the playoffs a month before.", "At last, he was famous enough, or at least mass-market enough, to land on the cover of Rolling Stone. But the league\u2019s equivalent of Luke Skywalker was also recast as Darth Vader, villain 1A on a team of supervillains. He may have been the most scrutinized athlete in America.", "But the funny thing about being in the eye of the hurricane? It\u2019s surprisingly calm there.", "Eight months after the decision that rocked the sporting world, Mr. Durant, 28, a starter in Sunday\u2019s N.B.A. All-Star Game, is easing into a new life as a new face of the Warriors, a brash brand of disrupters armed with Google-scale ambition that has been called \u201ctech's team.\u201d He drives a Tesla, pals around with the Silicon Valley\u2019s A-list and is laying the foundation for a tech empire of his own.", "Here is a look at Mr. Durant\u2019s life in the Bay Area over a recent two-day stretch between big wins against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Thunder, as he made the rounds as arguably the hottest start-up in Silicon Valley.", "It was early afternoon on an unseasonably warm winter Tuesday, and Mr. Durant was in high spirits, barreling down the Bayshore Freeway in a black Cadillac Escalade on the way to a speaking engagement at YouTube\u2019s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif.", "That morning, Mr. Durant was the centerpiece a lavish groundbreaking ceremony for the Chase Center, the $1 billion pleasure dome on the San Francisco waterfront that the team plans to occupy by 2019.", "But now he was hungry, so he and Mr. Kleiman dropped in to the nearest restaurant they could find, which was Jack\u2019s, a family restaurant and bar near the YouTube campus.", "With his six-foot-infinity frame and impossibly long legs, Mr. Durant seemed to swallow a yard of real estate with each stride. As an eight-time N.B.A. All-Star seemingly dressed for Pitti Uomo (he wore a blue custom suit, a striped pocket square and white Common Projects sneakers), Mr. Durant certainly stood out in the wood-beam suburban sports bar where a number of diners were decked out in blue-and-gold Warriors gear.", "But even though Jack\u2019s that day looked like a Durant-themed hall of mirrors, with clips of his epic rejection of a LeBron James shot from the day before flickering on TVs, he was able to walk unmolested through the busy restaurant and take a seat in a rear booth for a plate of boneless hot wings.", "Mr. Durant is comfortable with the level of scrutiny he receives in the Bay Area, meaning, not too much. \u201cHey, it\u2019s not L.A., it\u2019s not New York,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere in between.\u201d", "Although he has appeared on magazine covers for a decade, he still carries himself like a teenager. He slouched in the booth with his shoulders slumped, face buried in his iPhone before the food arrived.", "Once the conversation did start, however, Mr. Durant sounded pensive, introspective.

I was awkward-sized.\u201d", "Raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood, Mr. Durant said he \u201cdidn\u2019t look the part\u201d of a cool kid, adding that, \u201cIt made it easy for me to not worry about the social life and just play basketball.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the gift and the curse of being an athlete that is so dedicated at an early age, you forget about real life sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m just in the last few years starting to feel comfortable to meet new people, going out in groups, meeting new girls, hanging out. That stuff was foreign to me until a few years back.\u201d", "Near the end of the lunch, a petite woman in a Warriors jersey trailing two eager children approached the booth. \u201cExcuse me, Kevin?\u201d she asked diffidently. But a man in his security detail whisked her away before he could respond.", "Upon leaving the booth, however, Mr. Durant demonstrated his growing ease with fame among his adopted family of Warriors fans, making a beeline toward the woman\u2019s table to graciously pose for selfies with the family.", "\u201cThey can feel how much heat that I got from coming here,\u201d he said of his controversial move to Bay Area. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make me feel at peace.\u201d", "Fifteen minutes later, the Escalade pulled into a parking garage beneath the sprawling YouTube campus. Mr. Durant had no time for a plunge down the office\u2019s 45-foot-long red slide, sink a 10-footer on the indoor putting green or grab a quick snooze in a Kubrickian, white-plastic \u201cnap pod.\u201d After all, he was the employee perk that day.", "He proceeded to an auditorium that was filled to capacity with YouTube employees, some of them looking barely old enough to vote, let alone drink, and took a seat onstage across from Neal Mohan, YouTube\u2019s chief product officer, who was moderating an employees-only question-and-answer session that was live-streamed to YouTube and Google offices around the world.", "Flashing a $59,000 Vacheron Constantin watch, Mr. Durant did not exactly fit the profile of the skinny-armed tech programmer. But he cast himself as just another member of the YouTube generation, talking about his obsession with Grand Theft Auto V, hip-hop and, of course, YouTube. \u201cI\u2019m sure you guys know, you want to look at one quick video and it turns into four or five hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dangerous, that app.\u201d", "When an audience member asked if he planned to try acting, like the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 Blake Griffin or the Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James, Mr. Durant snorted sarcastically, \u201cIf anybody could do it, it\u2019s Blake Griffin and LeBron.\u201d The audience erupted in laughter, since both players are considered Oscar-worthy on-court floppers. Mr. Durant, holding back a chuckle, insisted that he was talking about their impressive work in commercials and movies.", "Then the talk took a more serious turn. Asked if he is plugging himself into the Bay Area tech scene, Mr. Durant responded that he is eagerly following the lead of a Warriors teammate, Andre Iguodala, who is a noted investor in companies like Twitter, Facebook and Tesla.", "Last summer, in fact, Mr. Durant and Mr. Kleiman unveiled a start-up of their own, the Durant Company, with a swelling portfolio of investments in tech companies like Postmates and Acorns, in addition to hotels and restaurants and film and television development. They are also investing with Ronald Conway, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201csuper angel\u201d investors and a front-row fixture at Oracle Arena (the Warriors\u2019 current home in Oakland), and consulting with Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs\u2019s widow, on his own charity foundation.", "In a sense, Mr. Durant is not wholly unlike the legions of ambitious 20-somethings in hoodies and cool sneakers who descend on Silicon Valley to make hundreds of millions.", "The only difference is, he has already made hundreds of millions.", "The next day, Mr. Durant was piloting his black Tesla Model S up a windy road in the Oakland Hills, after the Warriors\u2019 morning shootaround. It was around noon on game day, the second meeting of the season with his former team, the Thunder. He seemed more distant that day, his voice quieter, raspier.", "Dressed in a gray Warriors hoodie, he steered into a hilltop cul-de-sac and pulled into a driveway of his sleek contemporary-style house, where he hopped out, plugged in the Tesla, and headed into the house through a garage where his black labradoodle Ro was resting peacefully.", "As his private chef hunched over the stove, preparing a game-day pasta meal, Mr. Durant slumped into the world\u2019s longest sectional sofa and stared out the soaring windows, which were rattling from the wind, toward downtown Oakland in the distance. He chose the house for the view.", "\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful to be on top of everything, see it from a different perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was at the bottom growing up.\u201d", "Mr. Durant has been living in the 10,000-square-foot rental for only a few months, and as a bachelor who spends half his time on the road, it has a temporary feel to it. The white lilies on the kitchen table were silk, the fiddle-leaf fig plant in the corner of the family room was plastic.", "Still, it was decorated in a style that might be called Sports Superstar Moderne: the stark white walls are festooned with abstract Expressionist artwork, with ample trophies on display. The house has a home recording studio, a recreation room littered with Washington Redskins memorabilia, a movie theater that seats 16, and a walk-in closet devoted to sneakers.", "Mr. Durant padded barefoot past his hangar-size master bedroom, into another vast closet where he keeps his custom suits, jewelry and watches. The real treasure there, however, was his swelling collection of vintage concert T-shirts from the 1980s and \u201990s \u2014 Nas, Biggie, Metallica, Stone Cold Steve Austin. \u201cI take pride in my collection,\u201d he said.", "Old T-shirts may seem like an odd obsession for a player who helped pioneer the neo-preppy nerd-chic look (bow ties, Urkel-style glasses and backpacks) that swept the league a few years ago. In 2013, he even covered All-Star weekend as a fashion correspondent for GQ.", "But what\u2019s the point of looking runway-ready in a culture where Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s sweatshirt sets the tone? Mr. Durant feels more at home in the Silicon Valley-approved wardrobe of jeans, sneakers and hoodies.", "\u201cFashion,\u201d he said, \u201cis what you make of it.\u201d", "Back in the family room, Mr. Durant paused in front of his frame wall containing a moody black-and-white photograph showing three clenched fists, each with a small triangle tattoo at the base of the thumb. One fist was Mr. Durant\u2019s, another belongs to Charlie Bell, a childhood friend who is now a top executive at Jay Z\u2019s agency, Roc Nation, and third to Mr. Kleiman, who still represents Mr. Durant through Jay Z\u2019s Roc Nation Sports and is also working for him directly as his manager and partner in the Durant Company.", "The photo is a reminder to himself about real friendship, Mr. Durant said. His social world had shrunken since his controversial move.", "\u201cWhen you make it to the league, especially from where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s like everybody made it,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cI can remember times going to a club, I had 30 people with me. I\u2019m thinking to myself, this was never me. But if you\u2019ve never had the support outwardly like that, people showing you affection in your face, love in your face, even if it\u2019s fake, you try to grab that because it feels good for the moment.", "\u201cNow, it\u2019s us three.\u201d", "He may be rounding the math a little bit. Mr. Durant may have called off his engagement with Monica Wright, a W.N.B.A. player, and dialed back the entourage, but he goes out often after games in San Francisco and is quickly making friends with the tech titans who populate Oracle Arena\u2019s version of celebrity row.", "In September, he celebrated his birthday at a lavish barbecue at the house of Ben Horowitz, the influential venture capitalist and business partner of Marc Andreessen. Two months later, he watched the election results at the home of Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for internet software and services, along with Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, and Pharrell Williams.", "\u201cI think that\u2019s why a lot of athletes and entertainers work well with some of those guys, because for one, they all had humble beginnings,\u201d Mr. Durant said. \u201cThey built something from the ground up, so they can relate to us.\u201d", "Minutes before he was ready to settle down for his 2 p.m. nap, Mr. Durant headed to the real sanctuary in his Oakland home, the recording studio.", "\u201cMan, why you all keep it so cold in here?\u201d he asked Raleigh Dunn, his recording engineer, while taking a seat in the corner. The lights turned low, Mr. Dunn prepared a sample of the Chi-Lites \u201cHave You Seen Her\u201d for Mr. Durant to lay rhymes over. While some might call Mr. Dunn a \u201cproducer,\u201d Mr. Durant has a different name for him: music therapist.", "At this point, the N.B.A. star with a sideline in rap has become the stuff of clich\u00e9. Before there was Damian Lillard, there was Kobe Bryant. Before Mr. Bryant, there was Shaquille O\u2019Neal. But those guys were different. They made records. They wanted cred. Mr. Durant\u2019s rhymes are more like an audio diary, intended only for himself and close friends. For him, music is like meditation, or sometimes, primal scream therapy.", "\u201cI\u2019ve got so much stuff on my mind, quite honestly, it\u2019s kind of easy for me to say it all here,\u201d Mr. Durant said, looking almost monastic with his goateed face hidden in the hood of his sweatshirt. Music, he said, is \u201ca release. It keeps me in the moment. It takes my mind off this crazy world.\u201d", "In a few hours, he would hit the court against the Thunder and Mr. Westbrook, his former teammate. While Mr. Durant has called the supposed feud between the two \u201cfake drama\u201d whipped up by the news media, there are clearly unresolved issues.", "In their first on-court meeting last November, Mr. Westbrook appeared to troll Mr. Durant by showing up for the game wearing an orange bib that read \u201cOfficial Photographer.\u201d (Mr. Durant is a budding amateur photographer who shot Super Bowl 50 for The Players\u2019 Tribune, the sports site started by Derek Jeter, and in which Mr. Durant has a stake.)", "But at the moment, Mr. Durant would only say that latest rhymes were about \u201crelationship things, both with male friends, females, relationships that might have been broken on both sides.\u201d", "That\u2019s the beauty of music. Once you put it down on tape, he said, all the nagging issues \u201care just out of my mind. I can move on to the next thing.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/technology/personaltech/saving-iphone-voice-mail-messages.html": ["Q. Recently, my brother passed away. In the months leading to his death, he left me a series of voice messages on my iPhone, describing his health, his wishes, etc. I would like to archive these recordings somewhere other than on my phone. Is there a way to transfer voice messages to the computer?", "A. If your iPhone is running at least iOS 9 and you have the Visual Voicemail feature enabled, you can save, store or share those voice mail recordings with a couple of screen taps. Just open the phone app, select the Voicemail tab and choose a message you would like to preserve. When the message file opens to show the playback controls and additional caller information, tap the Share icon at the top-right side of the screen.", "The Sharing screen shows all the apps and places you can put a copy of the voice mail message. For example, you can attach it to an email or text message, save it to a Note file, make a Voice Memo from the recording or store it on any connected file-storage services you use \u2014 like iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive or Dropbox.", "If you have a compatible Mac, you can also wirelessly beam the file from phone to computer with Apple\u2019s AirDrop feature. When you save the file to your computer, you can play the recording back in iTunes, Windows Media Player or another audio program that supports .m4a (Advanced Audio Coding, or A.A.C.) files.", "For phones not running iOS 9 or later, there are other ways to copy the voice mail messages to a computer. You could connect the phone to the computer with a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio cable and use the free Audacity sound-editing software to make recordings of the messages. You can also use programs like iExplorer or iMazing or services like Everlasting Voice. Your wireless carrier may have other solutions."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/magazine/youtubes-monster-pewdiepie-and-his-populist-revolt.html": ["Felix Kjellberg, known to his fans as PewDiePie, is by far YouTube\u2019s biggest star. His videos, a mix of video-game narration, humorous rants and commentary, have cumulatively been viewed billions of times, and more than 53 million people subscribe to his channel. He has been called \u201cthe king of YouTube\u201d and countless variations thereon, and he has remained unchallenged on that perch for years, making millions of dollars and leveraging his popularity into outside ventures.", "But Monday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Disney-owned Maker Studios, a longtime partner of Kjellberg\u2019s, would no longer have anything to do with him; later, YouTube announced that it was canceling a show developed with Kjellberg, and removing his channel from its lucrative \u201cGoogle Preferred\u201d advertising program. At issue was a series of recent comedy videos. In one, he found performers on the freelance site Fiverr willing to dance and hold up a sign of the client\u2019s choosing. He asked them to write \u201cDeath to all Jews,\u201d and they did; in his subsequent video, he expressed shock that the request had made it through. \u201cIt was a funny meme, and I didn\u2019t think it would work,\u201d he said, mock-begging news outlets not to make too much of his stunt. \u201cI swear, I love Jews,\u201d he said, \u201cI love them,\u201d before playing a few notes on a kazoo.", "As he anticipated, plenty of news outlets saw a story in his antics. Others saw something more. A post on The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, marveled at Kjellberg\u2019s performances, and wondered in disbelief if they might signal sympathy for its ideology. \u201cUltimately, it doesn\u2019t matter, since the effect is the same,\u201d the post said, \u201cit normalizes Nazism, and marginalizes our enemies.\u201d As the controversy mounted, Kjellberg denounced the \u201chate-based groups\u201d that had taken notice of his videos. \u201cI was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online,\u201d he said in a Feb. 12 Tumblr post. \u201cI think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary. I know my audience understand that, and that is why they come to my channel.\u201d This explanation, unsurprisingly, did not satisfy Maker Studios, or, for that matter, Google.", "It\u2019s tempting to write off this scandal as an inscrutable product of a teen subculture, wrapped up in layers of irony and the peculiar language and aesthetics of YouTube. It is likewise easy to frame the episode as an isolated collision between offensive speech and careful sponsors. But it\u2019s most useful to understand Kjellberg\u2019s meltdown in the context of the vast platform on which it took place \u2014 YouTube \u2014 and the nascent strains of politics that could come to define it.", "With more than a billion users, YouTube has become not merely a platform but almost a kind of internet nation-state: the host of a gigantic economy and a set of cultures governed by a new and novel sort of corporation, sometimes at arm\u2019s length and other times up close. It\u2019s a system Kjellberg has spent recent months antagonizing in a broader and less-inflammatory way, even as he continued to thrive within it. He bemoaned its structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube\u2019s very own populist reactionary.", "In December 2016, Kjellberg\u2019s account was about to pass 50 million subscribers \u2014 a milestone, and a record. But in his videos, he seemed to be ending the year on a pessimistic note. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to complain about YouTube,\u201d he said in a video. \u201cAgain.\u201d The platform, he suggested, had changed in a way that he found worrying, and maybe punitive. Subscriptions are the fundamental organizing principle of YouTube \u2013 akin to a Twitter feed, they deliver to users exactly what they\u2019ve signed up to see \u2013 but, Kjellberg said, they were becoming less important to the way viewers found videos. What YouTube was doing instead, he claimed, was packing people\u2019s feeds with material they didn\u2019t care about, from channels they\u2019d never subscribed to. His viewership numbers had suffered as a result, he said. His rant spiraled on from there, swerving among resentment and self-deprecation, grievance and absurdity, toying with both revolutionary and reactionary tropes, and ending where it had begun: with a threat to close his account.", "It might seem hard to believe that anyone would want to watch a YouTube video complaining about YouTube\u2019s internal economic politics, but more than 20 million people did (the video\u2019s title, \u201cDELETING MY CHANNEL AT 50 MILLION,\u201d surely helped). For years now, in fact, YouTube has been one of Kjellberg\u2019s most-addressed subjects, second only perhaps to video games. In September, he even collapsed the distinction between the two, releasing a smartphone game called Tuber Simulator. The object is to become a famous YouTube star. Players begin their careers in a dank, windowless room and scrounge for views and cash, with videos like \u201cBikini Wax Your Pets\u201d and \u201cGO Outside \u2013 Walkthrough,\u201d the latter a play on a common form of video-game vlog. It\u2019s both an extended joke about making money online and a functioning, moneymaking app. \u201cIf the intention was to make a biting critique of late capitalism, Pewdiepie and Outerminds have wildly succeeded,\u201d Gita Jackson wrote for the gaming site Kotaku. \u201cBut if not,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe game still gets there by accident.\u201d", "For product reviewers and gamers, for the unboxers and the how-to teachers, for the interchannel drama analysts, the bloggers, the makeup artists and the pranksters, YouTube looms large not just as a context but also as a character. The daily exigencies of life on YouTube are perhaps the only subject that cuts across every major YouTube category. Showbiz loves to make movies about showbiz, and television loves to make television about TV. YouTube has simply democratized this impulse.", "It makes sense that YouTube would become home to such a performatively self-aware economy. It is, after all, one of the most mature of the major social platforms. It is extremely culturally productive, and can claim genuine stars as its own. Above all, it pays. And in the people who depend on the platform to pay their bills, it inspires a peculiar mixture of paranoia, desire, gratefulness and disdain that shows up clearly in their work. YouTube\u2019s peculiar relationship with the economy within it is fraught, promising and poorly understood. It\u2019s also unique among social-media platforms \u2014 but maybe not for much longer. For now, most of the biggest internet platforms are understood as venues for communication, expression and consumption. YouTube has given us a glimpse at what happens when users start associating social platforms with something more: livelihoods.", "Watch enough YouTube programming on any subject and you\u2019ll gradually come to understand the struggles of starting and maintaining a channel. You\u2019ll become familiar with the mementos Google sends creators at subscriber milestones \u2014 a silver \u201cplay\u201d button at 100,000, around which time your favorite YouTubers might start talking about quitting their day jobs, and a gold one at a million, when they are more to likely have done so. You\u2019ll hear plenty about conversations with YouTube support, many of which contradict one another. You\u2019ll develop opinions about YouTube\u2019s copyright rules, age restrictions and advertising policies. You\u2019ll get an intuitive sense of the YouTube attention marketplace and how people try to take advantage of it, and you\u2019ll hear about advertising rates. You\u2019ll hear conspiracy theories \u2014 some rooted in daily shared YouTube experience, others rooted in less visible fears, desires and resentments \u2014 some of which gain considerable traction.", "And why shouldn\u2019t you? YouTubers are not employed by YouTube, but they are paid by YouTube, because it matches their videos, automatically, with advertisers. The platform and the video-makers share a clear and common goal: to persuade audiences to watch more videos in order to make more money from ads. But even with a unifying cause, creators inevitably discover smaller ways in which their goals and YouTube\u2019s are at odds. It is in YouTube creators\u2019 interest, for example, to understand the best practices for getting the most YouTube subscribers, or the best strategies for making videos that YouTube might algorithmically recommend. But it is in YouTube\u2019s interest for the inner workings of its platform \u2014 including recommendation algorithms, the way it calculates advertising rates and the precise locations of its boundaries \u2014 to remain at least somewhat secret, to prevent creators from gaming the platform\u2019s quirks at the expense of either YouTube\u2019s user experience or its bottom line. Criticism from its creators is one of the many things YouTube tolerates to maintain this arrangement, which is otherwise clearly working to their benefit.", "Emergent politics of social platforms differ in scope and character and sit along peculiar axes, some familiar, others new. On Twitter, which does not pay popular users, they revolve around matters of speech and harassment; the platform hosts a range of progressive movements as well as an extremely visible and openly racist reactionary movement, and they have been at war. On Facebook, which is bigger and less combative, they focus on censorship and governance. But on any major platform, they tend to grow from the same fertile place: the gap between the structures built by the company and what users are allowed to do within them. Inevitably, this leads users to fundamental political questions: Who gets what, and why? Who gets to do what, and why?", "Kjellberg\u2019s December video drew responses from other YouTubers, debunking or explaining or affirming the claim by YouTube\u2019s biggest star that the platform just wasn\u2019t what it used to be, some gathering millions of views of their own. In retrospect, though, one brief moment in the original video was especially notable. As he wound down his rant, he hinted at a different sense of victimhood, drawing from the same sense of umbrage but directing it in a startling direction. After criticizing the platform for not understanding the realities of working on YouTube and wondering aloud if he was being punished, or somehow demoted, he affected a sincere voice and said, \u201cI\u2019m white.\u201d", "\u201cCan I make that comment? But I do think that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he continued, before a smash-cut and a return to a mocking rant about not letting YouTube win \u2014 another assurance to viewers that, as always, he was just kidding, and that the offensiveness of the prior claim was the reason he\u2019d made it.", "Here, again, it is helpful to situate Kjellberg properly. He initially rose to popularity within the video-gaming subculture, which, beginning with the \u201cGamerGate\u201d movement and continuing through the American presidential election, became surprisingly and darkly politicized. His core audience is young, and his sensibility clearly appeals to a masculine teenage impulse to shock and provoke.

Back then, suspense struck me as a cheap trick, like tickling the sole of a baby\u2019s foot or cooking with scads of butter. The novels I loved occasionally included a murder \u2014 sometimes even a police inspector whose investigation actually produced the culprit \u2014 but the real question at stake wasn\u2019t \u201cWho killed the old bastard?\u201d but \u201cIs there a God, and if there isn\u2019t, why should we be good?\u201d", "Now that I\u2019m older, I have a grudging respect for the mystery novel and its resourceful practitioners, writers whose art depends on catching the world-weary reader unawares. Suddenly I too can see the point of having my questions answered, the teasing threads unknotted, cases closed.", "Katie Kitamura would seem to share my youthful disregard for closure. In her third novel, \u201cA Separation,\u201d she has created a kind of postmodern mystery in which we end up with a dead body, evidence of a violent crime, an abundant trail of clues and even angry mourners, yet nobody feels compelled to pursue the investigation. There is something unknowable in human nature, the novel seems to assume, something better left unexamined. \u201cOnce you begin to pick at the seams,\u201d we are told, \u201call deaths are unresolved.\u201d", "\u201cA Separation\u201d is narrated by an unnamed 30-ish woman about whose history we learn very little; even her nationality is unspecified, though we\u2019re told that fellow Londoners regard her as \u201cforeign.\u201d The story opens with an imperious phone call from the woman\u2019s mother-in-law. Where is her son and why isn\u2019t he answering his phone? What Kitamura\u2019s narrator doesn\u2019t tell the older woman is that she and Christopher have been separated for six months, an estrangement he has made her promise to keep secret for reasons that she \u2014 and we \u2014 will never know.", "Christopher is a rich, clever, charming Englishman, the author of a much-praised social history of music. For years since its publication, he has talked about writing a second book, this time about worldwide rituals of mourning, a subject that has recently seemed to grip him with a new urgency. \u201cIt was a strange project for a man who had hitherto lost nothing of significance,\u201d his wife reflects. \u201cNot even a pet dog, a man who had no conception of what real loss must feel like.\u201d His mother has tracked Christopher down to the southern Peloponnese, where he has evidently gone to research the \u201cweepers,\u201d professional mourners who are still, according to local tradition, paid to ululate at funerals. \u201cYou know how powerful my intuition is,\u201d his mother persists. \u201cI know something is wrong, it\u2019s not like him not to return my calls.\u201d", "The narrator doesn\u2019t share her mother-in-law\u2019s concern. Her husband, she\u2019s discovered, is a compulsive philanderer, and she has finally gotten sick of his infidelities, his fakeries. But because of her own deception-by-omission, her inability to say that she and her husband are separated, the young woman finds herself agreeing to fly to Greece to track him down in the out-of-season beach resort where he has apparently been holed up for the last few weeks. It\u2019s a long way to travel and she\u2019s never had any desire to see Greece, but, she tells herself, \u201cI supposed it would be my last dutiful act\u201d as a daughter-in-law. When she and Christopher come face-to-face, she intends to ask him for a divorce.", "Kitamura\u2019s previous novel, \u201cGone to the Forest,\u201d was set during a colonial revolt in a nameless country in an undefined era. The geographical setting of \u201cA Separation\u201d is Google Maps specific: The book\u2019s action unfolds in the fishing village of Gerolimenas on the Mani Peninsula. Yet the same austere indeterminacy, the same allegorical quality that haunted Kitamura\u2019s earlier fiction is also at work here. In \u201cGone to the Forest,\u201d the unspecified country was devastated by a volcanic eruption that smothered the land in \u201ca blizzard of ash.\u201d \u201cA Separation\u201d features forest fires that have similarly reduced the countryside to \u201cmounds of burnt charcoal, a lunar landscape\u201d that emits a stench \u201cso heavy you could barely breathe.\u201d While the earlier narrative took place on a white landowner\u2019s farm, worked and surrounded by \u201cnatives,\u201d \u201cA Separation\u201d depicts a postcolonial form of colonialism: a luxury resort planted in a poor traditional society that\u2019s been devastated by the Great Recession, a resort in which the only interaction of the guests with their host culture is service-based, and where, as the narrator soon discovers, a taxi driver or receptionist\u2019s efforts at human kindness are regarded by their \u201cbigoted\u201d clientele merely as efforts to extract more money from them.", "Much as the narrator might like to remove the strictures of these power relations and escape into something more spontaneous, she\u2019s trapped by her own inability to trust the people around her. Oddly, the most emotionally charged scene in the novel occurs when, having invited the young hotel receptionist (with whom she suspects Christopher has had a flirtation) to dinner, the narrator dissolves into seething resentment when her guest orders the most ostentatiously expensive items on the menu. Fuming, she watches as the other woman \u201csucked the meat out of the lobster\u2019s claw, her chin growing slick with butter,\u201d then devours her steak with a \u201ccarnal satisfaction.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d the narrator recognizes, \u201cI knew even then that it wasn\u2019t her order or the meal that I was going to pay for. This was all just a cipher for another infraction.\u201d", "Lots of things in \u201cA Separation\u201d are just ciphers for other infractions, other codes that the novel\u2019s \u201coutsiders\u201d \u2014 its narrator included \u2014 have unwittingly violated. In the hierarchical world of Kitamura\u2019s novel, there is little love or friendship between equals, only manipulation and control, guilt and obedience, humiliation and submission.

He pointed to \u201cvery meaningful groups\u201d \u2014 Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to \u2014 that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said.", "To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operated. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook\u2019s \u201csafety check,\u201d a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during catastrophes. Mr. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to confirm that Safety Check was activated during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Florida last year.", "Mr. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook\u2019s role in keeping communities well-informed, which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news.

Here, most people view the American pastime, if they know it at all, as a faraway curiosity. The locals understood that Piazza was famous when he arrived, but they needed Google to discover the reason. The level of renown he earns here will depend entirely on his ability to execute an ambitious plan to lift his beleaguered club back to the top flight of Italian soccer.", "So he kept moving on that recent Sunday morning, doling out bilingual small talk around the V.I.P. lounge of Reggiana\u2019s stadium before a recent game against Modena, a nearby rival. Cigarette smoke and the faint echoes of fans\u2019 chants wafted in from the stands. Parmigiano-Reggiano from a local sponsor was carved and shoveled onto plates of pumpkin tortellini. Finally, palms pressed and pleasantries exchanged, Piazza stole away to a modest private box where he could reflect on his professional transformation.", "\u201cI remember, as a player, complaining if we had a small plane,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018We couldn\u2019t get a 757?

While play crackled below him, he timed a rotating advertisement screen near the stands. Soon, Maurizio Franzone, the team\u2019s general manager, joined Piazza and his guests in the outdoor viewing area, and for the next two hours Piazza peppered him with questions about players and tactics.", "It was Franzone who first made contact with Reggiana\u2019s previous owners on Dec. 10, 2015. Piazza and Franzone have been friends for years, and they had long discussed the idea of investing in soccer. After the initial meeting, Franzone, who had spoken to about 20 other clubs in Italy, excitedly reported back to Piazza that it could be the perfect situation. Reggiana played in a large stadium that could eventually accommodate upper-league crowds. It boasted a training facility with 11 fields. It was geographically close to countless potential sponsors. It possessed a fan base desperate for brighter days.", "\u201cPut it this way: This is a team that needs to come back,\u201d said Franzone, 47, a former professional goalkeeper who favors three-piece suits and a finely groomed beard. \u201cThe people of Reggio Emilia need it.\u201d", "It has not been easy being a Reggiana fan over the last two decades. In the 1990s, the club played in Serie A, the country\u2019s top tier, and in 1995, it opened a new stadium, which hundreds of the team\u2019s fans helped finance through the purchase of multiyear season ticket plans.", "But things quickly went awry. The team was relegated in 1997, and a few years later, after going bankrupt, it was forced to surrender the title to its stadium, which had been sold at auction. Today, the arena is owned by Giorgio Squinzi, the owner of the nearby Serie A team Sassuolo. The teams share the stadium, with Reggiana paying rent \u2014 an arrangement that causes its fans much embarrassment.", "But Piazza, for now, has gained the fans\u2019 trust. On June 18, 10 days after he announced a deal in principle to buy a majority stake in the club, thousands of fans greeted him with a rally in the main city square, serenading him with team songs. (He has declined to disclose financial details of the deal, but various local media outlets reported the investment was around $3 million.)", "And if there was some initial concern that Piazza might be a detached foreign owner, minding his investment from overseas, he has thus far dispelled it. He has made seven trips to Italy since buying the team, embracing a life of redeye flights. He has adopted a holistic approach to player development and pondered which elements of American sports culture could work in Italy. New sponsors have signed on; old ones that had abandoned the club in its lean years have returned. The number of season-ticket holders has doubled to 5,243, up from 2,615 last season.", "Currently Reggiana (14-5-7) sits in fourth place in the league standings.", "\u201cWe firmly believe in the Mike Piazza project,\u201d said Stefano Cavazzoni, 46, who lives in Reggio Emilia and began following the team in the early 1980s.", "Gabriele Miari, 30, noted that Piazza sometimes left little notes on a Facebook fan page devoted to the team that Miari helps moderate. He described being at an away game this season at Lumezzane, a cold day in a nondescript city, when Piazza walked over to the stands to chat with some fans. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not hot like Miami,\u201d Piazza said sarcastically in Italian, making them laugh.", "\u201cHe made us feel close to him even though he\u2019s a very wealthy man,\u201d Miari said. He shrugged when asked to rate Piazza\u2019s language skills. \u201cHis Italian is like our English,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs practice.\u201d", "Piazza, who took six months of Italian lessons (and acknowledges that he needs more), has been brushing up on his soccer, too. He grew up near Philadelphia and had only a passing interest in the sport until he retired. He joked that he once thought Reggiana\u2019s favored formation was a 4-4-3, a nonsensical configuration. But Franzone said Piazza\u2019s baseball career had given him credibility with players and fans alike. \u201cThey know you know the smell of a locker room,\u201d he often tells Piazza.", "Sports ownership has its visceral joys, too, and Piazza was clearly enjoying himself as the game wore on. He yelled toward the field: \u201cDai, dai! Atta boy! Bravo! Get that ball!\u201d He drank an Aperol spritz and a few glasses of ros\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a bad headache,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we pull this game out, it\u2019ll be worth it. It\u2019s two Advil.\u201d", "The conversation at halftime turned to the region\u2019s famous gastronomic tradition, or as Piazza called it, \u201cthe other reason I bought the team.\u201d He breathlessly cataloged the area\u2019s cured meats: \u201cThe prosciutto, the bresaola, the coppa, the mortadella \u2014 that\u2019s all here.\u201d", "Noting that he had met with groups aiming for expansion franchises in Major League Soccer before buying Reggiana, he said: \u201cI\u2019d rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis. You can\u2019t get a good meal there!\u201d", "When Reggiana scored its eventual winning goal in the second half, Piazza threw a left-handed uppercut \u2014 balancing the wineglass in his other hand \u2014 and let out a prolonged yell. He cursed when a Reggiana player injured himself and again when the fourth official announced that there would be four minutes of injury time.", "\u201cYeah!\u201d Piazza said when the final whistle blared, before closing his eyes and touching his chest. \u201cMamma mia.\u201d", "Afterward, several fans walked over to greet Piazza, addressing him as \u201cPresidente\u201d \u2014 the formality of which always makes his wife, Alicia Rickter, laugh. Piazza shook hands and posed for pictures. \u201cGrazie per essere venuti,\u201d he said. Thank you for coming.", "As he prepared to duck inside, an elderly man reached over to grab his hand. \u201cYou bring us good luck,\u201d the man said in Italian. \u201cPlease come again.\u201d", "The next day, while eating lunch with Franzone in the city, Piazza likened owning a soccer team to harvesting macadamia trees, a process that can take five years to yield nuts. \u201cI wanted to come into a situation where there was something to build,\u201d he said.", "Piazza has adopted the same approach to life in Italy. He was 34 when he visited Italy for the first time. He had been to Japan seven times at that point in his life, but somehow never to the home country of his paternal grandparents.", "The trip changed him, he said. Growing up, he had absorbed a bundle of cultural idiosyncrasies \u2014 whether tastes, mannerisms or locutions \u2014 that sometimes manifested themselves explicitly or in other cases merely fizzed beneath his consciousness. In Rome, he found these stray fragments of his identity fitting naturally, exhilaratingly, into his surroundings.", "The next year, he and his father visited Sciacca, the town on the southwestern coast of Sicily where his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Giuseppe Piazza was born in 1789.", "\u201cI felt like a duck going back to water,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI just related. I could just feel it. I just felt Italian.\u201d", "These days, Piazza has been renting a home in a village called Quattro Castella, about 10 miles south of Reggio Emilia. He has considered having his children \u2014 Nicoletta, 10; Paulina, 7; and Marco, 3 \u2014 attend Italian schools for a year.", "In the restaurant, Piazza fiddled with the patterned scarf around his neck, joking that he accessorized like this only in Italy, where he felt sartorially inadequate alongside the locals. Scanning a menu, he made a face when he came across the horse tartare; his children were taking riding lessons, he explained.", "Piazza is enjoying this cross-cultural learning process. He said the rigors of this new life \u2014 stacking airline miles, struggling with a new language, savoring new foods, connecting to his family\u2019s roots \u2014 had invigorated him in the vacuum left by baseball.", "\u201cI played baseball for 16 years,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to reconcile the fact that I\u2019ll never again feel the juice of hitting a home run in front of 50,000 people.\u201d", "To be sure, baseball still seeped into conversation during the first two days of his trip. Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and Byung-Hyun Kim were the two pitchers he never figured out. He thought the increasing reliance on \u201cMoneyball\u201d principles had precipitated his retirement. He called being booed at Yankee Stadium \u201cthe coolest thing I remember from my career.\u201d", "But it is soccer, calcio, that consumes him now. \u201cI like the adventure of this,\u201d he said of the Reggiana project. \u201cI\u2019ll hop on a train. I\u2019ll hop on a plane. I\u2019ll get in the car. I\u2019ll just go. I like the energy.\u201d", "He sipped Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine produced in the region. \u201cI could fail,\u201d he said. \u201cI could end up losing some money here.

His reasons for doing so were, in certain respects, complex and conflicting, but for now it will suffice to inform you that this voyage was undertaken in order to raise awareness of two distinct but related matters. The first of these was the regrettable fact of human mortality and the need to do something about it; the second was that of his candidacy in the following year\u2019s presidential election.", "This man\u2019s name was Zoltan Istvan, and I had known him for about a year and a half by the time he began his progress across the country, from the Bay Area, where he lived, to Florida, and thence northward to Washington, where he planned to ascend Capitol Hill and, in coy allusion to Martin Luther\u2019s delivery of his 95 Theses, affix a Transhumanist Bill of Rights to the great ornate bronze door of the Rotunda.", "In an article on The Huffington Post, utilitarianly titled \u201cWhy a Presidential Candidate Is Driving a Giant Coffin Called the Immortality Bus Across America,\u201d Istvan laid out his rationale. \u201cI\u2019m hoping,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy Immortality Bus will become an important symbol in the growing longevity movement around the world. It will be my way of challenging the public\u2019s apathetic stance on whether dying is good or not. By engaging people with a provocative, drivable giant coffin, debate is sure to occur across the United States and hopefully around the world. I\u2019m a firm believer that the next great civil rights debate will be on transhumanism: Should we use science and technology to overcome death and become a far stronger species?\u201d", "For transhumanists, this could only be conceived of as a rhetorical question, the obvious answer to which was a resounding yes. I had spent the previous 18 months immersed in this diffuse and heterogeneous movement, through which I encountered many forms of radical optimism about the potential for technology to transform the human condition, to improve our bodies and minds to the point that we become something better \u2014 something other than the animals we are. I met scientists who were convinced of the possibility and necessity of converting our minds into code, of uploading them into machines. I visited a cryonics facility outside Phoenix, in which the severed heads of the faithful were stored in liquid nitrogen, in the hope that future scientific innovations would permit their eventual return to life. I spent several nights in a basement in Pittsburgh with a group of self-proclaimed cyborgs who designed and built human-enhancement technologies for subdermal implantation. And I met a great many believers in what is known as \u201cthe technological Singularity,\u201d a messianic prophesy of our coming merger with machines, most famously advanced by Ray Kurzweil, a director of engineering at Google.", "I first met Istvan at a transhumanist conference in Piedmont, Calif., in the spring of 2014. He was handsome in an irrefutable and yet somehow unserious fashion, like a life-size Ken doll or a proof-of-concept for an Aryan eugenic ideal. I recognized right away that he was not a typical transhumanist. He was polite and charismatic and in no obvious sense geeky or awkward. He gave me a copy of a book he recently self-published called \u201cThe Transhumanist Wager,\u201d an unwieldy novel of ideas about a freelance philosopher named Jethro Knights who sails around the world to promote the need for life-extension research and winds up establishing a floating libertarian city-state called Transhumania \u2014 a regulation-free utopia of tech billionaires and rationalists \u2014 from which he wages an atheist holy war on a theocratic United States.", "A couple of days later, at a cafe in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, he told me of how the novel did not go over well with any of the 656 agents and publishers he sent it to over the previous year. He had spent over a thousand dollars, he said, on postage alone. The book\u2019s cover, which he designed himself, featured a greenish negative image of his own face, in profile, staring into the vacant sockets of a human skull.", "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be like \u2018Hamlet,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, with the whole Yorick scene?

But yeah, I\u2019m not sure it really works.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse book covers,\u201d I said, which for all I knew might have been the truth.", "He confided that his wife, Lisa, a gynecologist who worked for Planned Parenthood, recently started to express a keen interest in his doing something productive with his life. Lisa had just given birth to their second child and, what with the exponentially growing cost of living in the Bay Area, she was becoming increasingly concerned about the need to begin saving for their two daughters\u2019 educations. He explained to me that he was reluctant to fritter away money on such things, given that by the time the girls were in their late teens, it would be possible to upload the informational content of a Harvard or Yale degree directly to their brains and at a fraction of what such an education costs today.", "Lisa, he said, was largely tolerant of his views, but drew the line at gambling their children\u2019s futures on the fanciful notion of some imminent technological intervention.", "\u201cObviously she\u2019s a little resistant to transhumanist ideas,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause in the near future her entire profession will be obsolete.

You know, with babies being produced by ectogenesis and whatnot.\u201d", "When, some months later, Istvan emailed me about his decision to run for president, I immediately called him. The first thing I asked was what his wife thought of the plan.", "\u201cWell, in a way,\u201d he said, \u201cit was Lisa who gave me the idea. Remember how I said she wanted me to do something concrete, get some kind of a proper job?\u201d", "\u201cI do,\u201d I said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m guessing running for president on the immortality platform was not what she had in mind.\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cIt took a little while for her to come around to the idea.\u201d", "\u201cHow did you break it to her?\u201d", "\u201cI left a note on the refrigerator,\u201d he said, \u201cand went out for a couple hours.\u201d", "I met Istvan on a Friday morning outside an empty secondhand bookstore in Las Cruces, N.M.; from there, we would commence our encoffined journey to Austin for a campaign event the following Monday evening. His hair was neater, blonder, than it was when I last saw him seven months earlier, and his face and neck were mottled from exposure to the desert sun. He was accompanied by an exceptionally tall and willowy young man with long, center-parted black hair and wide, ascetic eyes. This young man held a video camera attached to a tripod in one hand; the other he extended toward me in solemn salutation.", "\u201cRoen Horn,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to live forever?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that I do,\u201d I said, feeling the slender bones of his hand as I received it in my own.", "\u201cWell, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cDo you want to die? Do you think death is a good thing?\u201d", "\u201cThese are tricky questions,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I think about them on the bus and get back to you?\u201d", "This Roen Horn, I learned as we walked down the eerily deserted main street, was a volunteer for Istvan\u2019s campaign, a zealous advocate of radical life extension who was also making a documentary about the Immortality Bus. The vehicle in question was, at the moment, moored in the parking lot of a nearby Bank of America. The immediate plan, Istvan told me, was to drive out into the desert to the White Sands Missile Range, where he intended to stage a protest highlighting the need to divert public money away from weapons spending and into life extension.", "The Wanderlodge was an even odder spectacle than I had anticipated: a great brown absurdity with the words IMMORTALITY BUS WITH TRANSHUMANIST ZOLTAN ISTVAN neatly hand-painted in white across the length of its midsection. On the rear of the bus were painted the words SCIENCE VS. THE COFFIN. A construction of inward-slanting wooden boards, also brown, was affixed to the roof, on top of which rested an elaborate arrangement of synthetic flowers. The effect of all this was not uncoffin-like, but it helped if you already knew what you were supposed to be looking at.", "Within were all the trappings and creature comforts of a midrange 1970s bachelor pad: a kitchenette equipped with ice machine and microwave oven, a dining table, ample bench-style seating for on-road lounging and, toward the rear, two narrow bunks and a bathroom (nonfunctional). Orange shag carpeting featured throughout.", "The thing was road-worthy, more or less, as long as you didn\u2019t drive it uphill at too steep a gradient and as long as you pulled over every 90 minutes or so to refill the motor oil, which leaked out the side at a truly alarming rate. This steady leakage was a concern for Istvan, not just with respect to the long-term health prospects of the Immortality Bus but more urgently the likelihood of our getting pulled over on the freeway by a traffic cop \u2014 something that, given the conspicuousness of the vehicle, seemed a nontrivial prospect.", "The difficulties began about half an hour outside Las Cruces. As the freeway slung a wide loop around the jagged foothills of the Organ Mountains, the sound of the engine, striving to haul us uphill, had become a shrill rasp. We were maxing out at about 35 m.p.h., and Istvan\u2019s hulking form was bent low over the wheel, as he eyed the dashboard\u2019s archaic array of mysterious dials.", "\u201cWe look to be overheating pretty bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this far into the red. And this isn\u2019t even a particularly big hill. We could have a problem here, gentlemen.\u201d", "Upward trajectories were best avoided, he explained, on account of a cruel paradox at work in the ancient mechanics of the Wanderlodge: The longer you went uphill, the harder the engine had to strain to move the bus at even a sluggish pace; and the slower you went, the less air circulated from outside to cool the engine, thereby perpetuating the cycle of overheating.", "We crested the hill and began to pick up speed on the downward slope. The engine\u2019s whining descended somewhat in pitch, and I was newly confident that we were no longer about to grind to a halt in the desolate heat of the desert.", "\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d I said.", "\u201cActually,\u201d Istvan said in a cheerful tone, \u201cit\u2019s far more dangerous coming downhill, because we\u2019re relying on 40-year-old brake pads here.\u201d", "Although I was not sure I wanted to live forever, I was sure that I didn\u2019t want to go down in a blaze of chintzy irony, plunging into a ravine strapped into the passenger seat of a thing called the Immortality Bus. For all that Istvan railed against the tyranny of death over human lives, his attitude toward basic road safety was at times wildly cavalier. The fact that he was piloting a 38-foot coffin bus through New Mexico did not, for instance, stop him from looking at his phone every couple of minutes, responding to texts and emails, checking the social-media analytics on his latest piece for TechCrunch, etc.", "Between the driver and passenger seats there was a large, raised, shag-pile-carpeted area, which I was using to lay out my various writerly impedimenta: voice recorder, notebook, pens and so forth. This, it turned out, housed the Wanderlodge\u2019s engine. At one point, Istvan decided that it might ameliorate the overheating issues if he opened this up to \u201clet the engine breathe.\u201d As soon as we lifted the lid of this housing, the whole interior was quickly transformed into a hellish, hurtling sauna, heated by the searing petroleum fumes that emanated from the roaring shag-pile maw of the open engine unit.", "\u201cI know it\u2019s not pleasant!\u201d bellowed Istvan over the near-deafening roar of the engine, \u201cbut it\u2019s really helping with the overheating!\u201d", "At length we pulled over to let the engine cool awhile, and Istvan went outside to change the oil. Horn was recumbent on the long couch to the rear of the driver\u2019s seat, staring impassively at the ceiling, his hands cradling the back of his head. This was to become his default attitude throughout the trip.", "I craned around in my seat and asked him how he wound up volunteering for Istvan\u2019s campaign.", "\u201cI just really don\u2019t want to die,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that would suck more than being dead. So I\u2019m just doing what I can to ensure that life-extension science gets the funding it needs.\u201d", "\u201cSo what is it you do?\u201d", "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "\u201cI mean workwise. When you\u2019re not volunteering for Zoltan.\u201d", "\u201cI run the Eternal Life Fan Club,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an online organization for people who are serious about living forever. Not, like, 500 years like a lot of transhumanists. Forever.\u201d", "Horn was 28, he said, and lived in Sacramento with his father, a recently retired insurance-claims adjuster, and his mother, who worked in a movie theater. His parents were Christians, his father a Calvinist who believed in eternal life in paradise for the elect and in eternal damnation for the unchosen. He was especially vocal in his conviction that his atheist son was destined for the infernal torments of hell.", "\u201cHow does he feel about this whole Immortality Bus thing?\u201d I asked.", "\u201cHe\u2019s actually O.K. with it,\u201d Horn said. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s cool I\u2019m getting to be on TV news and all.\u201d", "The military testing area at White Sands, N.M., is a forlorn and silent place. It was here that the boundaries of technological possibility, the boundaries of fear, were redrawn by men of science in the last days of World War II; it was here, in July 1945, that the first atomic bomb was detonated, the prototype of the Fat Man plutonium device that was delivered three weeks later from the heavens to the mortals of Nagasaki. Here at White Sands, science made its nearest approach to divine likeness, divine knowledge. Here, with these experiments in celestial violence, humanity came closest to transcending itself, fulfilling itself.", "Just past the security checkpoint at the entrance to the facility, there was a kind of open-air munitions exhibit that featured a squat replica of the Fat Man, along with dozens of other decommissioned rockets and bombs. In the undulating heat of the desert, these slender tilted obelisks loomed like the inscrutable monuments of an ancient thanatopia, a henge of metal phalluses thrusting skyward in ecstatic communion with the cosmic powers. Istvan removed from his backpack a banner he had printed for the occasion and, positioning himself in front of one of the larger rockets, instructed Horn to take a series of photographs of him bearing the rolled-out message: TRANSHUMANIST PARTY PREVENTS EXISTENTIAL RISK. The intention of the protest, if you could really call it that, was to create a series of images and short videos to be uploaded to Istvan\u2019s various social-media accounts and shared among his many thousands of followers. Leaning self-consciously against the Fat Man replica, I scribbled in my notepad. Horn took out his phone and filmed a six-second Vine video of Istvan saying: \u201cStop nuclear war! It\u2019s a devastating existential risk!\u201d Then he filmed Istvan giving another brief speech on the central theme of his campaign: the need to divert government spending away from war and into research on life extension.", "Later that evening, we pulled off the Interstate and checked into a motel. As I stood in the doorway, waiting for Istvan and Horn to get their stuff from the Wanderlodge, I browsed through a stand of leaflets by the entrance. Most of these advertised sites of general touristic interest \u2014 for instance, PistachioLand, \u201chome of the world\u2019s largest pistachio\u201d \u2014 but there was also a small assortment of Christian pamphlets, and of these I selected one that was simply titled \u201cEternity.\u201d It was a prospectus of the apocalypse, published by an outfit called the Gospel Tract and Bible Society. Standing in the empty lobby of the motel, I read of God\u2019s decree that all things shall cease to exist \u2014 that \u201cthe heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up\u201d \u2014 and I thought again of the unearthly monument I had walked around that day, the ceremonial circle with its ranged machineries of death.", "Reading on, I learned how I, or my soul, might survive the death of my body and all other worldly things by surrendering myself to the Lord. I remembered asking Horn, earlier that day, about how his religious upbringing might have informed his belief that he would live forever through science. He said there was no longer any need for gods.", "\u201cScience is the new God,\u201d he said. \u201cScience is the new hope.\u201d", "Horn, with his Calvinist background, seemed to me now a walking illustration of the way in which scientific progress had displaced divine providence as our culture\u2019s locus of faith. He embodied, in fact, the religious dimension of transhumanism: a movement that, in its grand mythos of the coming Singularity, maintains a Christian distaste for the flesh and its frailties. Its delirious eschatology foretells a final unity with the technological divine, through which the elect will make the transition from time into eternity.", "Istvan, by contrast, had come to transhumanism from a more secular, hedonic background. In his 20s, having graduated from Columbia University with a degree in philosophy and religion, he fixed up an old yacht and set out to circumnavigate the globe. He funded his trip partly by making short documentaries for the National Geographic Channel about the remote places he was visiting. Somewhere along the way, he invented an extreme sport called volcano boarding (basically snowboarding, except you do it on the slopes of an active volcano). While reporting on the large number of buried land mines still remaining in Vietnam\u2019s former DMZ, Istvan himself came very close to stepping on one; his guide tackled him from behind as he was walking and brought him to the ground just inches from where an unexploded mine was jutting from the earth.", "In the narrative he had constructed about his life, this was the moment he became a transhumanist \u2014 the moment he became consumed by an obsession with mortality, with the unacceptable fragility of human existence. He returned to California to set up a real estate business and, taking full advantage of the permissive finance culture of those years, bought and flipped a number of properties in quick succession. He hated the work, but he was good at it and made quite a lot of money very quickly. Right before the crash in 2008, he sold half his portfolio and came out of the deal a millionaire. Forty years after his own parents fled communist Hungary, he had become the embodiment of an American capitalist ideal: the immigrant son with a weird European name who became an honest-to-God self-made millionaire. It hadn\u2019t even been that hard. The money was enough to enable him to quit his job and to dedicate himself to the possibility, and the necessity, of achieving immortality through science.", "On Saturday afternoon, we pulled in at a truck stop some hours west of Fort Stockton and took a booth at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Horn grabbed a salad; his austere calorie-restrictive diet, oriented as it was toward maximum life extension, was ill served by the truck stops and gas stations and drive-through hamburger repositories of West Texas. While Istvan fielded a call from his irate wife about an overflowing toilet he failed to repair before setting off across the country to promote immortality, I took the opportunity to quiz Horn about his lifestyle choices.", "He was a transhumanist ascetic, a young man who had largely withdrawn from the world so that he might never have to leave it. He had placed his faith in the idea of \u201clongevity escape velocity,\u201d the popular transhumanist notion that the pace of advancement in the science of life extension would eventually accelerate to the point that, for every year that passes, average human-life expectancy increases by more than a year. Horn told me that, in his parents\u2019 house in Sacramento, he slept on the floor of his bedroom, partly because he didn\u2019t want to buy a bed when what little money he had might better be spent on supporting life-extension research, but mainly because of a distaste for soft surfaces. (This self-avowed aversion was roundly contradicted by his near-fanatical dedication to couch-based recumbence, as outlined above.)", "\u201cI have to admit,\u201d I said, \u201cI find this whole immortality thing difficult to get behind. Doesn\u2019t your obsession with living eternally actually amount to your being totally imprisoned by death?\u201d", "\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut aren\u2019t we all? Isn\u2019t that kind of the whole idea?\u201d I told him that I took his point, and we both laughed, a little awkwardly perhaps, and ate our lunches in silence for a while, listening in on Istvan\u2019s terse exchange with his wife.", "It was late October, and the truck stop was lavishly bedecked with the ghoulish paraphernalia of the season \u2014 plastic jack-o\u2019-lanterns, cotton spider webs, wall-mounted witches on broomsticks and other festive gewgaws. Dangling from the ceiling directly behind Horn\u2019s head was a rubber statuette of Death itself, the skeletal form shrouded in a ragged black cowl, a plastic scythe clutched in its bony little hand. This cartoonish figurine twirled slowly on its nylon string, distracting me with its overblown enactment of bargain-basement foreshadowing.", "\u201cI just want to have fun forever,\u201d Horn said at length, guiding a forkful of dry salad leaves toward his pale face. \u201cThe 20 years I get from eating the way I do could be the difference between my dying and my getting to longevity escape velocity. I\u2019m holding off on pleasure now so that I can have more pleasure later. I\u2019m actually a total hedonist.\u201d", "\u201cYou don\u2019t seem even slightly like a hedonist to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t drink, you don\u2019t take drugs. You barely eat. To be honest, you seem like a medieval monk.\u201d", "Horn cocked his head to one side, gave the idea some consideration. I didn\u2019t want to raise the topic of sex, but it seemed to hang there, twirling slowly above our heads like the rubber avatar of Death. I didn\u2019t have to, as it turned out: Horn brought it up himself.", "\u201cYou know one really cool thing about being alive in the future?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d", "\u201cSexbots.\u201d", "\u201cSexbots.\u201d", "\u201cYou know, like A.I. robots that are built for having sex with.\u201d", "\u201cOh, sure,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of sexbots. It\u2019s a nice-enough idea. You really think that\u2019s going to happen, though?\u201d", "\u201cFor sure,\u201d Horn said, closing his eyes and nodding beatifically, in momentary reflection upon some distant exaltation. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m very much looking forward to.\u201d", "He had a particular way of smiling that was half evasion and half challenge. Out of context, you might be tempted to describe it as smug, but the effect was somehow deeply endearing.", "\u201cThe problem I have with sexbots,\u201d I said, \u201cis why wouldn\u2019t you just have sex with an actual person? I mean, all things being equal.\u201d", "He said: \u201cAre you kidding me? A real girl could cheat on you, sleep around. You could get an S.T.D. You could maybe even die.\u201d", "\u201cIs that potentially a bit alarmist?\u201d", "\u201cNo way, man. It happens literally all the time. See, a personal sexbot would never cheat on you, and it would be just like a real girl.\u201d", "He said nothing for a time and drank at leisure from his glass of water. He consumed some further forkfuls of salad. He gazed out the window at the parking lot full of trucks, the Interstate beyond, the ever-present vultures hanging in the air.", "I said, \u201cDo you mind me asking if you\u2019ve had bad experiences with people cheating on you?\u201d", "\u201cI have so far abstained from sex,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never had a girlfriend.\u201d", "\u201cYou\u2019re saving yourself for the sexbots?\u201d", "He nodded slowly, shrewdly raising his eyebrows. You bet he was saving himself for the sexbots.", "\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said, raising my hands in capitulation. \u201cI hope you live that long.\u201d", "He said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I will.\u201d", "My feelings toward Istvan were complicated, contradictory and subject to sudden mutations, intensifications and reversals. His grandiosity exerted a paradoxical magnetism, tempered as it was by an easygoing self-deprecation. He would be talking about wanting to change the world, convincing folks that immortality was within their grasp, and in the next moment, he would be taking delight in some scheme he\u2019d come up with to keep the Wanderlodge on the road for another few hours.", "\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m good at, half-assing stuff,\u201d he told me one afternoon in the parking lot of a Walmart where we stopped to fill a cart with containers of motor oil and some barbecue trays to collect it as it leaked from the bus.", "I said I\u2019d begun to think of the Immortality Bus as the Entropy Bus, the three of us trundling across Texas in a great mobile metaphor for the inevitable decline of all things, the disintegration of all systems over time.", "\u201cEntropy sucks,\u201d Horn said.", "\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Istvan said. \u201cIt absolutely is what it is.\u201d", "The question of futility, given the inexorable suckiness of entropy, was raised many times on the Wanderlodge. Istvan and Horn believed that life was rendered meaningless by death. If in the end everything was lost, they asked, what was the point of anything?", "I did not feel qualified to answer this question, but I tried to make a case for life as it currently stood, which meant trying to make a case for death. Wasn\u2019t it the fact that life ended, I asked, that gave it what meaning it had? Wasn\u2019t it the very fact that we were here for so brief a time, that we could be gone at any moment, that made life so intensely beautiful and terrifying and strange? (Then again, wasn\u2019t the idea of meaning itself an illusion, a necessary human fiction? If a finite existence was futile, wouldn\u2019t immortality be just a state of endless futility?)", "There was no beauty in finitude, they replied, no meaning to be extracted from oblivion. My arguments, Horn insisted, were transparently motivated by a \u201cdeathist\u201d ideology, a need to protect myself against the terror of death by trying to convince myself that death was actually not so terrible. As crazy as most of what Horn said sounded to me, he was, I thought, basically right about this.", "We drove through the emptiness. Now and then we passed a hand-painted sign standing in a field, a gesture of anonymous pride or defiance. A \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d A \u201cDeport Obama.\u201d A \u201cDon\u2019t Mess With Texas.\u201d Mostly, we passed roadkill. For miles at a stretch, the only landmarks were corpses: foxes, raccoons, armadillos in various states of putrefaction on the margins of the Interstate. Istvan swigged at intervals from a magnum-size vessel of greenish energy drink he picked up on our last Walmart stop. We talked for hours and then for hours more we said nothing at all. We listened to a Tom Petty greatest-hits cassette straight through, twice, three times. \u201cRunnin\u2019 down a dream,\u201d Petty sang, \u201cthat never would come to me.\u201d An hour later, he sang it again.", "About an hour east of Ozona, we pulled off the Interstate onto a narrow side road so that Istvan could remove the barbecue tray, which was by now almost overflowing with leaked oil. We were on the perimeter of a vast ranch, a flat and half-barren landscape of scrub grass and squat cactuses as far as the human eye could see. I went behind the bus to urinate, and as I did so I looked up and counted five vultures idling overhead, like predator drones in the inverted abyss of the sky. I tried to imagine how we might have appeared to the serene eyes of these primordial beasts, three medium-size mammals lumbering upright, without apparent purpose, around a great coffin-shaped leviathan. But what could any of this \u2014 men, coffins, journeys \u2014 possibly mean to these creatures, to whom nothing was required to mean anything? Being not yet dead, we were probably irrelevant to their view of the landscape.", "I struggled to remember some lines from the eighth of Rilke\u2019s Duino Elegies, in which he writes about the freedom in which animals live: \u201cthe Open\u201d upon which they look out but which is unavailable to our sight, oriented as we are always toward the overbearing presence of our own finitude. Back on the bus, I searched for the passage on my phone and found it: \u201cWe, only, can see death; the free animal/has its decline in back of it, forever,/and God in front, and when it moves, it moves/already in eternity, like a fountain.\u201d", "Later, as we barreled along the Interstate, Horn cheerfully drew our attention toward a gigantic billboard that read, \u201cIf you die today, where will you spend eternity?\u201d", "\u201cIn the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the ground.\u201d", "He told me about an accident he had when he was 9. He fell from his bike, punctured his spleen and very nearly died from internal bleeding. There were weeks in the hospital, then a recovery; but a darkness was revealed to him, a black terror beneath the thin surface of the world. Every night, he awoke gasping from the same nightmare, in which he had died in his sleep, in which he felt himself lying there in his bed feeling nothing, an impossible body. Every night this same experience of a thing that could not be experienced, this same vision of a thing that could never be glimpsed. This was the beginning of his move away from the religion of his parents, he said, this vision of the nothingness that awaited him after death.", "\u201cWhat do you say,\u201d asked the newsman, \u201cto people who accuse you of trying to play God?\u201d", "We were standing on a lavishly tree-lined street in an upscale residential neighborhood in Austin where a campaign event was about to take place, and Istvan was being interviewed for local TV news. He was dressed in a shirt and slacks, his hair combed meticulously back from his high-domed forehead.", "\u201cI would agree that we are, in fact, trying to play God,\u201d he said.", "It was to me that he said this, or at any rate it was me he was looking at when he said it. The bearded and lavishly perspiring cameraman, who was double-jobbing as a reporter, had requested that I stand to one side of him as filmed; Istvan would, in this way, appear to be addressing a dedicated news reporter, rather than a guy who, presumably because of budget cuts, had been forced to do two jobs simultaneously.", "This was a thing that had been happening to me lately. I had started to see myself as a mechanism through which signals were passed. I would be sitting on the bus, jotting down snatches of conversation in my notebook, details of scenery or sensation, and I would see myself as a primitive device, a machine for the recording and processing of information. I would be at the checkout in a cavernous Walmart, paying for snacks, and I would see myself as one of many millions of mechanisms in a vast and mysterious system for the upward transfer of wealth. I knew, of course, that this was a result of my overexposure to mechanistic ideas, but on some level I recognized that I had always seen myself in this way.", "\u201cAnd what made you decide to run for president?\u201d asked the cameraman who was also a reporter.", "\u201cI believe,\u201d Istvan said, \u201cthat we should take technology as far as it can take us.\u201d His hand gestures had the practiced decisiveness of a real-deal politician; in the presence of the camera, as he gazed unblinkingly into my eyes, he had taken on a plausibly presidential aura. He seemed, suddenly, a vast physical presence, a great hollow monument to his own significance.", "\u201cAnd that includes,\u201d he said, \u201cbecoming technology ourselves. At some point, we are going to become more machines than human beings. That\u2019s what my presidential campaign is advocating for. That\u2019s the conversation I\u2019m trying to start.\u201d", "A cluster of young men approached us. They were part of an Austin biohacker group, and they were here for the campaign event. They had names like Alec, Avery and Shawn; they were, for transhumanists, a startlingly frat-brovian contingent, all laid-back Texan vibes, loosefitting vests, hypertrophied upper bodies.", "Horn received them in his usual manner, avoiding traditional greetings in favor of an immediate interrogation as to their stance on eternal life.", "\u201cI\u2019m down,\u201d said a guy named Alec, as though Horn had just asked him if he wanted to go in on a bag of weed. \u201cLet\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s make it happen. Life is awesome.\u201d", "\u201cRight?\u201d Horn said. He glanced meaningfully at me, a look that I took as mild admonishment for previous exchanges in which I expressed reservations about absolute judgments on the awesomeness of life.", "We went into the house where the event was to take place, a small split-level open-plan that was almost entirely devoid of furniture. I was given to understand that the place was shared by a loose cohort of biohackers; it was not apparent who did and did not live there, but it seemed to be a kind of transhumanist commune or futurist frat house. Even for an event of this sort, the gathering was overwhelmingly male.", "We mingled for a while, and I drank some surprisingly potent home-brewed ale, and then Istvan delivered a fluent and apparently unscripted speech. History was being created, he said, with this movement, this campaign, which was not about getting votes but about raising awareness of the coming Singularity and the importance of living long enough to experience it.", "We hung around for an hour or so afterward, and at some point, Horn gave an impromptu speech of his own. He delivered this oration \u201cin character\u201d as a generic hipster, wearing a pair of black-framed glasses and a slightly strained knowing smirk on his face. This was a role he\u2019d been tinkering with in the videos he uploaded to the Eternal Life Fan Club\u2019s website over the course of the campaign.", "\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t mainstream,\u201d he said to the assembled biohackers, most of whom seemed mildly perplexed by the performance. \u201cYou still have your childlike imaginations. If you want to take your nonmainstreamness to the next level, you\u2019re gonna have to live forever. You know what the most mainstream thing ever is? Dying. Dying is totally mainstream. Being dead in the ground is totally mainstream. Vote for Zoltan if you want to live forever!\u201d", "I\u2019d seen this performance of Horn\u2019s before and had advised him that it was a little too broad in its depiction of the hipster trope, that it seemed like more of a caricature of a caricature than a representation of any actual person, and that, furthermore, the injection of performative irony into his delivery tended to obscure the absolute earnestness of his message. But right now, perhaps because of the unusually strong home-brew beer I was drinking, I was enjoying it immensely, and I felt a strange tenderness for him swelling in my chest, an almost fraternal instinct of protection, very much at odds with any properly journalistic imperatives.", "I agreed with practically nothing that came out of his mouth the entire time we spent together. He was as strange a person as I had ever met, and I had met a great many strange people in the year and a half I spent reporting on transhumanists. I found myself hoping that he would not be disillusioned, that he would maintain, as long as he lived, the sense of his own exemption from death. His very belief that existence was rendered meaningless by death was, I thought, precisely what seemed to afford his life a sense of purpose, a sense of direction. This, in the end, was why humans would always look for meaning and would always find it in some variety of religion. You do what you can with the strangeness of being here, for the time being.", "As soon as the media people moved on, Istvan wanted to hit the road; the party was still building momentum, but he had an early flight the next morning to Miami, where he had a corporate speaking engagement, and he needed to pilot the Wanderlodge to a place across town where he\u2019d arranged to park it until the next leg of the tour. He completed a valedictory round of handshakes, and then we boarded the Immortality Bus once more.", "An hour or so later, we were in the backyard of an empty house on the far outskirts of the city, waiting for a cab to come and take us to our respective hotels. Istvan and I were downing the last of the Immortality Bus\u2019s booze stash. I was feeling a little lightheaded from the drinking, and from the small amount of weed I smoked at the party before remembering I hated smoking weed, and so I climbed down into the yard to take the air. The night was warm and fragrant and alive with the gentle chirping of crickets. I stared up at the stars, feeling pleasantly out of it. It was good to be outside, to be in the world, to be a living animal.", "The more I listened, the more urgent the chirping of the crickets seemed to become. I remembered then having read something in the news a couple of weeks earlier about a cricket infestation that had been particularly intense in the area around Austin. The swelling of the insects\u2019 numbers had to do with the summer\u2019s having been unusually wet. Now in the autumn, the cooling of the air had forewarned them, on some primordial level, of their own impending death. The chirping I was listening to, I now realized, was the sound of thousands of male animals expressing their urge to reproduce, an instinct made acute by their own approaching demise. The sound seemed to be intensifying and to be coming at once from everywhere and nowhere, to be generated by the night itself.", "I heard the buzz of Istvan\u2019s phone from across the yard. Our cabdriver calling, probably. I breathed in deeply, assimilating the warm and complicated air, the fragrant night. In my tipsy state, it seemed outright implausible that all of this would one day be beyond my reach, that one day I would die and never again breathe this air or hear these sounds \u2014 crickets, traffic, words, vibrating phones: the interwoven signals of animals and machines \u2014 or feel the hopeful surge of alcohol in my blood, the world advancing its uncertain promise. It seemed ludicrous to think that this was it: just this once, and never again.", "I heard the hollow slam of the Immortality Bus\u2019s door, and Istvan calling my name. Our cab had pulled up at the curb. I took a last look at the looming apparition of the bus, the great brown sarcophagus of the American highway, and was momentarily taken by the facile charm of its standing as a metaphor for life itself: an incomprehensible and futile journey, in a vast coffin-shaped recreational vehicle, out of one nowhere into some other. I walked toward the street, toward Istvan and Horn, deciding to tell them about this life-as-coffin-bus idea, and to tell them that I was glad to have been on this journey for a while, whatever it meant or did not mean. But by the time I got to the car and slid in beside Horn, Istvan was already sitting up front, passionately laying out the coordinates of the posthuman future to our cabdriver, and the moment had passed."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/t-magazine/saint-laurent-anthony-vaccarello.html": ["Word comes that Anthony Vaccarello, the new creative director of Saint Laurent, would like to meet at the house. His own house, I wonder? No. The house of Saint Laurent, as in the headquarters of the label?", "Yes. But which? There are three houses of Saint Laurent, scattered across Paris. Each is different, in usage and in mood: the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. This is \u201cSaint\u201d Laurent we\u2019re talking about, bestower of the contemporary wardrobe, the man who put women into pantsuits, a tortured artist in couture and the inventor of 20th-century style. No designer has ever been closer to godliness, in the eyes of the fashion industry, and specifically the French, than he.", "The first house of Saint Laurent is located on the tony Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 on Paris\u2019s Left Bank \u2014 the Rive Gauche, which Saint Laurent named his ready-to-wear line after in 1966. It\u2019s around the corner from the apartment of Karl Lagerfeld, the designer\u2019s sometime friend and most-of-the-time bitter rival; Yves Saint Laurent himself lived in an apartment on the Rue de Babylone, just a few blocks away. This location is the creative hub of the company, housed in a 17th-century h\u00f4tel particulier, painstakingly refurbished and planted with one of those coldly geometric, Le Notre-ish box-hedge gardens. Vaccarello\u2019s predecessor, Hedi Slimane, determined the d\u00e9cor and the general ambience of sleek modernity and distinctly French formality. But Slimane was based in Los Angeles. Today, it\u2019s where Vaccarello works, with his studios traditionally divided into tailleur and flou, like a true French haute couture house.", "There\u2019s also a Saint Laurent house on Rue de Bellechasse: formerly an abbey and the Ministry of Defense and currently a shell, destined to become the brand\u2019s corporate headquarters. Against dismal financial outlooks for many of luxury\u2019s biggest players, Saint Laurent has bucked the odds: It grew more than 25 percent during 2016, breaking the billion-dollar mark in annual turnover for the second year in a row. Today, the business makes roughly three times the amount it made five years ago, and as of 2016 figures, has swelled to be the second largest player in the luxury portfolio of Kering Group, the conglomerate that owns a majority stake in it.", "Against that backdrop \u2014 of vast fortune, and of a house literally being rebuilt \u2014 Vaccarello showed his Saint Laurent debut in September. There were klieg lights and a 32-foot neon YSL logo dangling from a crane, like a crib mobile, a baited hook or the sword of Damocles, depending on your outlook and degree of cynicism. Vaccarello could, feasibly, want to meet there.", "Finally, there\u2019s 5 Avenue Marceau. If the first location represents the creative heart of Saint Laurent and the second its commercial head, this address is its soul. It\u2019s where Saint Laurent\u2019s haute couture house stood, making made-to-measure clothes for a clientele composed of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most discerning women. Although the building remains the same, the ateliers closed in October of 2002, when Saint Laurent retired. Since then, it has been home to the Fondation Pierre Berg\u00e9-Yves Saint Laurent, a charity devoted to showcasing works of art, and fashion, that intersect with the designer\u2019s oeuvre and interests. At least, it was until last April; this fall, after extensive renovations, it will reopen with a slightly simpler name, as the Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent. (There will be a counterpart in Marrakesh, on the appropriately named Rue Yves Saint Laurent.)", "Avenue Marceau currently houses the history of Yves Saint Laurent: over 20,000 items of clothing, accessories, drawings and various evocative objets. Haute couture garments and the offices of seven conservation specialists are housed in the space formerly occupied by the ateliers. The old staff canteen is now home to hats, shoes and jewelry, kept in rigorous museum-grade conditions. In the room where Saint Laurent\u2019s drawings are stored, pressurized gas cylinders hunker against the wall. In case of fire, they will explode and fill the room with vapor to preserve the drawings. \u201cThese are the most important,\u201d says Olivier Flaviano, director of the future Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent Paris, of the thousands of sketches boxed by season. \u201cBecause they were touched by the hand of Yves Saint Laurent.\u201d The building is the fashion equivalent of Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb.", "History has always meant a lot to Saint Laurent \u2014 history and continuity. Yves Saint Laurent had four French bulldogs, all named Moujik: When one died, it was swiftly replaced with a close likeness. It\u2019s been the same with the house\u2019s creative successors. While Saint Laurent himself was at the helm, he ceded control of his ready-to-wear women\u2019s wear to the designer Alber Elbaz, better known in his later role as head of Lanvin, and men\u2019s wear to a young Frenchman named Hedi Slimane. Slimane returned in 2012 as creative director of the entire label. In between, it was helmed by the designer-cum-director Tom Ford, and the Italian Stefano Pilati. Slimane exited the label for the second time last spring, and was replaced by Vaccarello, a young Italo-Belgian. All their collections have, to a degree, been contemporary reincarnations of Saint Laurent\u2019s illustrious past.", "In the end, Vaccarello and I meet in the marble-floored salons of Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9. Above, workrooms hum with activity. Later, we walk through the atelier tailleur, where technicians are busy pinning mannequins with toiles: trials of garments, executed in inexpensive calico to illustrate volumes and to allow a designer some experimentation before cutting into the final fabrics. Around the corner, under the eaves, a trio officially titled modelistes are working on a series of calfskin garments in oil-slick purple and lipstick red. They comprise a new team installed by Vaccarello, who loves leather. Otherwise, the techniques and methods are age-old. All are working on the forthcoming fall collection.", "It\u2019s exceptional to be allowed to see this. Upon hearing that I\u2019m a journalist, the workers eye me suspiciously and shield their work protectively until reassured by Yewande Animashawun, the premiere (head) of the tailoring workroom. They are not only concerned about revealing next season\u2019s designs \u2014 a degree of furtive secrecy is standard practice in fashion. But for the past four years in particular, the house of Saint Laurent was impenetrable. The previous creative director, Hedi Slimane, had an uneasy relationship with the fashion press, rarely granting interviews and refusing to invite a number of journalists and critics to his shows.", "By contrast, Vaccarello says he wants to capture the warmth of Saint Laurent\u2019s early years. I ask if the atelier remembers that time, if any of the original staff remains. \u201cThere are some from that period,\u201d he says \u2014 14 staff members from Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s era still work with the company. \u201cThe artistic director changes, but the most important people stay.\u201d", "Vaccarello is slim, dark-haired, with hooded eyes and a sparse beard covering his chin. It\u2019s flecked with gray, although Vaccarello is only 37. He speaks with a heavy French accent, having grown up in Brussels, the non-Flemish speaking part of Belgium. Vaccarello is also faultlessly modest \u2014 and not just when deferring importance to his atelier. He dubbed his own debut collection a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d underscored by his decision to present it in the construction site of the new Saint Laurent headquarters. Perhaps humility is a necessary virtue when being awarded one of the trickiest gigs in the business.", "Not only is Saint Laurent one of the most influential brands, creatively and culturally, but now, thanks to the success of Slimane, it\u2019s also one of the biggest financially. Whoever designs for the house of Saint Laurent instantly becomes a star. Vaccarello is now in charge of a $283 million-a-year business and the job of reinterpreting Saint Laurent\u2019s legacy as he sees fit: revamping boutiques, reshooting advertising, entirely revising its visual identity.", "The history of Saint Laurent, and hence of contemporary expectation, hangs like that Damoclean sword. Complicating matters, some of that history is still living; Saint Laurent died in 2008, but his partner in business and in life, Pierre Berg\u00e9, sat front-row at Vaccarello\u2019s debut. Now 86, Berg\u00e9 became romantically involved with Saint Laurent shortly after their first meeting in 1958; the two lived together until 1976 and Berg\u00e9 served as C.E.O. of Yves Saint Laurent Haute Couture until its closure. During 40 years in fashion, Berg\u00e9 forged a reputation for his passionate, fiery temper and for a certain severity. It comes through today, undiluted and as recognizable as Berg\u00e9\u2019s face, with its proud nose, shock of silver hair and raised, jutting chin. The buttonhole of his lapel is stitched with a hairline tricolor loop of ribbon that signifies he is a Grand Officer of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know very much Anthony Vaccarello \u2014 I\u2019ve seen only one collection,\u201d he emphasizes, emphatically. \u201cClear?\u201d Berg\u00e9 pauses, fixing a steely glare. \u201cIt is not my business ... I want to be very clear with you. I respect very much Pinault \u2014 the father and son. They never ask me my advice \u2014 happily \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to give it.\u201d Berg\u00e9 has been outspoken in the past. He is still a close personal friend of Hedi Slimane \u2014 he employed him first \u2014 but was famously dismissive of Tom Ford and Stefano Pilati. Vaccarello is treated more generously. \u201cThe difference between Vaccarello and Ford and Pilati is that he likes Saint Laurent,\u201d states Berg\u00e9, sternly. \u201cHe tries not to imitate. I do not expect a fashion designer to imitate Saint Laurent.\u201d", "Vaccarello\u2019s interpretation, to many eyes, was unexpected. Instead of obvious, outright homage, he chose to base his first collection on a leopard-print dress from Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s July 1982 collection. The original was made when Vaccarello was 2.", "It\u2019s an obscure starting point for a Saint Laurent collection. As any fashion nerd will swiftly explain, Saint Laurent is hurrahed as the greatest designer of the last century. Rising to fame when appointed Christian Dior\u2019s successor in 1957, he scandalized the establishment three years later by basing a collection on Parisian Existentialists (the initial glimpse of his beloved Left Bank in his clothes) and for making a black leather jacket. His \u201cBeat\u201d line was the first couture collection inspired by the street, and foreshadowed the youthquake counterculture of the 1960s as well as punk. Shortly after, Dior permitted Saint Laurent to be conscripted into the army (he had deferred twice previously), and quietly replaced him. In 1961, Saint Laurent founded his own house with Berg\u00e9 (who sued Dior for breach of contract to raise the capital). He then set about revolutionizing fashion.", "He made trousers for women fashionable, and transmogrified masculine staples such as Caban coats and safari jackets into seductive women\u2019s wear pieces. (He also did the same with Little Lord Fauntleroy knickerbockers, with less lasting impact). He was the first to bare breasts in a fashion show, under a layer of chiffon, in 1968; he spectacularly revived the shoulder pad in his \u201cForties\u201d collection of 1971, which became the blueprint for a silhouette that would dominate the 1980s; and he launched designer ready-to-wear in 1966, upending the hierarchy of the entire fashion industry and sounding the death knell for the influence of haute couture, if not its actuality. His final show, in 2002, was staged at the Centre Pompidou before 2,000 guests, and was projected on massive outdoor screens to thousands more. It closed with Saint Laurent being serenaded by Laetitia Casta \u2014 then the Marianne \u2014 and Catherine Deneuve, whose wardrobe he designed for the 1967 film \u201cBelle de Jour.\u201d Two French national monuments, honoring a third.", "How do you compete with that?", "\u201cTo be honest, I did it without thinking too much,\u201d Vaccarello says simply. \u201cWhen I arrived, my first thing was to meet Pierre Berg\u00e9, to really understand the house, and the spirit of who Yves Saint Laurent was. Pierre Berg\u00e9 was, for me, the most important person to listen to and to see before. Then I went to the archive, to exercise what I had in my mind. For every image I had in my head, I wanted to see the real clothes.\u201d", "I reel them off, as anyone who has paid attention to fashion for the last half-century would: dresses patterned with Piet Mondrian\u2019s paintings, the \u201cLe Smoking\u201d tuxedo, the Ballets Russes collection, the green fur chubbie jacket from that 1971 collection. Vaccarello nods to them all.", "\u201cI was taking them out of my head. I saw all of that in one week. It was quite amazing. And then I was thinking, how to do my Saint Laurent, now? And how to make it differently than how it was done by all the designers before? I wanted to make something to dream about, not something real. Saint Laurent, when he started, did real clothes. Those real clothes are everywhere, in the stores, in Zara, everywhere. You dress like he predicted in the \u201970s. So I didn\u2019t want to do the Caban, the trench, the Saharienne. I wanted to do dresses that were like collages, not a real piece that I saw at the archive.\u201d", "Considered from that perspective, Vaccarello\u2019s Saint Laurent debut makes sense. The dresses were, he says, composites of elements from Saint Laurent\u2019s history: the poufy, blousy sleeve of that 1982 dress; a bow from 1991; the lace from a 1971 dress shot by Jeanloup Sieff \u2014 all mixed together to create a fusion that speaks to the present. It\u2019s like design via Google image search: type in \u201cYSL\u201d and grab a bit from everywhere. The silhouettes Vaccarello produced were short, racy, leggy, with an inflated \u201980s shoulder sometimes slipping down the arm. They spoke not of couture but of club culture. A few dresses, with scooped-out necklines in velvet or leather, were chopped into tops above bluejeans \u2014 the only item of clothing Saint Laurent famously said he wished he\u2019d designed. Vaccarello then studded the outfits with identifiable bits of Saint Laurent iconography, like the tassels reminiscent of his Chinoiserie collection as earrings, or the Cassandre-designed \u201cYSL\u201d piercing ears or embedded as heels on shoes.", "\u201cEveryone has an idea of Saint Laurent,\u201d says Vaccarello, with an exasperated sigh. \u201cBut he did so many things. It\u2019s impossible ... \u201d Impossible to live up to? Impossible to span all of those in a single collection? Or maybe just impossible to please everyone? Perhaps that\u2019s why Vaccarello went for styles out of left field as opposed to those great greatest hits. \u201cMore than another house, when you see everything that Yves Saint Laurent did ... \u201d Vaccarello\u2019s voice trails off. \u201cYou do flowers, he did it. You do lacing, he did it.\u201d", "Marcel Proust insisted that remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were. That\u2019s frequently the case with Yves Saint Laurent, who, incidentally, was sufficiently obsessed with Proust to base the d\u00e9cor of his chateau on his work, and to commission Louis Vuitton to create a monogrammed crate to cart his volumes of \u201c\u00c0 la Recherche du Temps Perdu\u201d around in. Contrary to popular belief, Saint Laurent wasn\u2019t universally canonized. His trendsetting 1971 collection was severely dismissed at the time. He was nicknamed \u201cYves Saint Debacle\u201d and the collection was called \u201ca tour de force of bad taste.\u201d", "The debuts of Saint Laurent\u2019s successive successors have, famously, been less than successful, each individually undergoing a baptism by fire. Some dubbed Tom Ford\u2019s version \u201cslick,\u201d as a pejorative; Pierre Berg\u00e9 pointedly refused to comment. Saint Laurent himself, still alive, would not attend. Stefano Pilati\u2019s was described as clich\u00e9d French, his ruffled skirts compared to chicks in an Easter parade. A few said that Slimane\u2019s early outings resembled Topshop or the stylist Rachel Zoe\u2019s eponymous line. \u201cAt Saint Laurent, everyone hate ... \u201d laughs Vaccarello. \u201cI find it fascinating. I like it. Maybe I\u2019m a masochist or something, but I like that it\u2019s a passionate house, you love it or hate it.\u201d", "Critical reviews of Vaccarello\u2019s first show were mixed: The French, he stated, eyebrows raised, were laudatory. Others, not so much, specifically the powerful American newspapers. \u201cI like having different opinions of what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he says magnanimously, when I broach the subject. He was pleased that Berg\u00e9 seemed pleased. \u201cHe loved what you could connect the most to Yves Saint Laurent,\u201d Vaccarello says.", "Vaccarello seems, on the surface, unconnected to Saint Laurent. His sensibility has been sniped at by Italians and Belgians as smacking too much of each other. Vaccarello recalls that when studying at La Cambre, the Belgian fashion academy that also educated Olivier Theyskens, he was asked to pick a contemporary designer\u2019s work to study. Others chose the Belgian deconstructionist Ann Demeulemeester, or the minimalist Helmut Lang. Vaccarello chose Tom Ford. After working in Rome under Karl Lagerfeld at Fendi, Vaccarello established his own label in 2009, gaining attention for souped-up short-and-sexy dresses in the body-contouring mold of Azzedine Ala\u00efa as well as that of Ford. He was plucked by Donatella Versace to design her Versus line in 2014 in much the same formula.", "Saint Laurent is an unexpected step, given that path. Even Vaccarello didn\u2019t anticipate the offer from Kering. \u201cI had a lot of propositions for working for houses before. It was always a no. I didn\u2019t want to leave my brand if it was not for something like ... this,\u201d Vaccarello shrugs, looking into a full-length mirror, inlaid into a marble alcove. \u201cI went, because I am polite. It was very clear, no, no, no. But as a joke I said \u2018The only house I will stop my brand for and would be interested to work with is Saint Laurent.\u2019\u2009\u201d When he was officially given the Saint Laurent job, Vaccarello sat on the news for a few months as rumors swirled, before the official announcement was made in April of last year.", "Vaccarello\u2019s office at Rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 is, roughly, the size of his former studio in its entirety. It\u2019s currently pinned with the elements he\u2019s planning to integrate into his next collection, due to be shown in March. There are no fabrics or sketches, just image after image, layered over each other, in sections titled \u201cBig Black Sequins\u201d or \u201cAnimal Embroideries.\u201d There are lots of \u201980s party dresses, in the same vein as that of Vaccarello\u2019s debut. There are a bunch of fur coats. An image of a famous fall 1980 Saint Laurent haute couture jacket embroidered with a quote from the Jean Cocteau poem \u201cBatterie\u201d sits next to a photograph of Debbie Harry in a slogan tee. \u201cThat\u2019s the starting point,\u201d states Vaccarello, tapping it. \u201cBut everything can change.\u201d", "Vaccarello will show some men\u2019s wear, but there\u2019s the sense he isn\u2019t massively involved in that side of the business, although men have featured in his Saint Laurent campaigns. Generally, the men are used as accessories to the women \u2014 like those big tasseled earrings, or the logo heels. Image is important to Vaccarello. He\u2019s shot three print campaigns, although he\u2019s only produced one collection. The first featured mostly-naked models writhing in denim, photographed by Collier Schorr; the second, by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, which was released in magazines in October, effectively previewed Vaccarello\u2019s first collection, with the model Anja Rubik in a short leather dress with exaggerated shoulders. The full campaign images hit magazines this spring, again photographed by Schorr and entirely different from the October shots. \u201cFor me the image of Saint Laurent is sometimes more important than the collection,\u201d states Vaccarello bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s not about clothes, it\u2019s more about a mood, an emotion, a way to live, a way to move. Rather than buy that jacket, buy that bag.\u201d", "Saint Laurent, as a house, has been a master image manipulator. Yves Saint Laurent famously posed for a nude portrait to advertise his first men\u2019s fragrance. A later campaign for his wildly successful Opium scent courted controversy with its caption, \u201cFor those who are addicted to Yves Saint Laurent.\u201d Slimane, too, showed the power of image: Despite unfavorable criticism of his clothes, they sold, due in part to the polished campaigns and a rehauling of the label\u2019s overall aesthetic. Perhaps that will be the real litmus test for Vaccarello: Can he carve a distinct identity for his own tenure? After all, Vaccarello\u2019s debut dresses aren\u2019t enormously different than the after-dark proportions of Slimane\u2019s collections.", "Ultimately, success is marked by how well the clothes sell. For all that fuss about the history of Saint Laurent, for all the thousands of garments hermetically sealed in the archives, how much does legacy really matter? How much do ordinary customers care about the cultural capital of storied brands like Saint Laurent, so prized and cosseted and worshiped by the industry? Should one have to visit the Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent to understand a Vaccarello dress?", "Vaccarello made some connections blatant \u2014 a YSL logo is fairly unmistakable \u2014 but few would dissect his dresses into the collaged components he referenced, and relate them back to Saint Laurent\u2019s heritage. Nor do they need to in order to enjoy wearing them. It\u2019s the opposite of Yves Saint Laurent's distinguished cadre of haute couture clients, whose intelligence and culture were, supposedly, reflected in the choice of garments on their backs. They could read Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s references \u2014 to Cubism, to Shakespeare \u2014 and appreciate the sentiments.", "\u201cI think it\u2019s not about changing identity,\u201d Vaccarello says of his role at Saint Laurent. \u201cIt\u2019s about making it for now.\u201d Maybe this is a whole new approach to fashion, in the digital age of constant distractions. The history\u2019s there, if you want to remember it.", "But, to paraphrase Proust, you\u2019ll only find those lost times if you search for them."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/technology/personaltech/making-your-phone-take-dictation.html": ["Q.

Meanwhile, media firms held onto the economically challenged business of delivering news and entertainment.", "Proponents of the breakdown of the bundle economy most often cite cable television.

The magic of bundle economics allows consumers to get more for less, while also maximizing revenue for the provider. Imagine that there are two hungry diners at a burger joint where the restaurant\u2019s marginal cost of food is zero-ish. One customer is willing to fork over $5 for a burger and $1 for fries. The other will shell out $5 for fries but only $1 for a burger. By selling a la carte, the restaurant maximizes revenue by pricing each item at $5. Both consumers leave hungry, and the business takes in $10. However, both diners would snap up a $6 bundle, allowing them to sate their appetites while shelling out $12 in total. Everyone is better off (perhaps not healthwise).", "In the digital environment, two additional forces are driving this tidal wave of digital bundling.", "First, the near-zero marginal cost of distribution makes all-you-can-eat packages compelling.

Recently, the F.C.C. dropped this investigation \u2014 believing that this kind of bundling is now commonplace in a competitive market. Plainly this is the thin edge of the wedge for net neutrality. Connectivity and cloud computing services will most likely start to include \u201cunrated\u201d services to differentiate themselves further from other commodity providers. In the short term, this shift will most likely be a boon for consumers. Time will tell whether this stifles long-range innovation \u2014 especially in bandwidth-intensive services such as video streaming.", "Second, firms need to mitigate the high cost of attracting and retaining online consumers. Netflix can amortize the expense of acquiring and servicing a subscriber over the hundreds of dollars of revenue they will generate if they hang around for a couple of years. Selling individual shows for a few bucks a pop would be vastly more expensive in marketing, billing and service costs.", "Tying several services together (even when they are not all directly complementary) increases customer loyalty. Amazon Prime has more than 66 million subscribers. Just a few years ago, it was mostly a free-shipping service. Now, it includes an extensive library of free e-books, videos and music. The large base of Prime subscribers makes life hard for would-be Amazon competitors \u2014 who have to contend not just with Amazon\u2019s scale in any particular vertical but also the combined value of the eclectic products and services that Amazon bundles together. This value may also increase as artificial intelligence and machine learning help personalize these applications.

These help make firms like Facebook and eBay so valuable \u2014 because additional users increase utility for everyone, making it hard for upstarts to compete.

As usual, there was a lot of Trump-related stuff, but let\u2019s start with a few items that had nothing at all to do with our new president.", "First: Snap (the maker of Snapchat) finally unveiled its I.P.O. documents. It\u2019s been years since a big American consumer tech company went public, so everyone on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley has been salivating over Snap\u2019s debut on the market. And what we learned can be boiled down to two sentences: Snap is making a whole lot of money. And it\u2019s losing even more.", "Mike: Also, they used the words \u201csext\u201d and \u201cpoop\u201d in the S-1 filing. That\u2019s a big win in my book.", "Farhad: O\u2026.K.... The company, which makes its money from ads that appear in its app, said that it sold $405 million in ads last year. But it lost $514 million at the same time.", "Another interesting data point was the size of its user base. Snapchat has about 160 million daily users. That\u2019s not small! But it\u2019s not that big, either, compared to Facebook and Instagram. It\u2019s more in line with Twitter, which is not doing all that well.", "This seems to be the main question Snap will have to battle as it tries to attract investors: Is it the next Facebook, or the next Twitter?", "Mike: I\u2019m kind of wary of Snapchat, to be honest, at least as a stand-alone public company with long-term, major growth prospects. I honestly could have seen it as a part of Facebook, but I don\u2019t think Evan Spiegel, Snapchat\u2019s C.E.O., had any interest in reporting to Facebook\u2019s chief, Mark Zuckerberg. I do think it\u2019ll have a successful I.P.O., though.", "Here\u2019s Snap\u2019s problem. Part of what made companies like Facebook so successful is this economic term and Silicon Valley buzzphrase: network effects. Essentially, the larger a network gets, the more people tend to find value in it. Facebook is the classic example of positive network effects strengthening the site over time.", "Snapchat has a bit more difficult time doing that. It doesn\u2019t have a follower model similar to Facebook\u2019s, which means it takes a bit more effort to find new or interesting people to interact with on Snapchat. Also, content posted by people who aren\u2019t your friends isn\u2019t easily discoverable, another issue of keeping people engaged, in my mind.", "A lot of folks compare Snapchat to Twitter, which I think is a pretty apt way of looking at it. Both companies really rely on brand advertising \u2014 basically, high-dollar accounts from huge advertisers rather than a bunch of smaller accounts that make up the long tail of revenue \u2014 and that seems to pale in comparison to the advertisers that go with, say, Google or Facebook.", "And, as Facebook will tell you all day long, advertisers love targeting data, which Facebook has in droves. Snapchat, less so.", "Farhad: Let\u2019s turn to Trump. The tech industry continued to be roiled by clashes with the new administration. The war expanded to a number of fronts.", "First, there was immigration. Lots of tech workers protested President Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel from a number of Muslim-majority countries.

Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s co-founder, and Sundar Pichai, its C.E.O., who are both immigrants, spoke out in support of the protesters. And even though some of them initially dragged their feet, by early in the week just about every other tech leader had come out in strong opposition to the immigration ban.", "This is moving much faster than I thought it would. I\u2019m not surprised Silicon Valley is a liberal bastion; I am surprised that workers here reacted so strongly to the new order. Were you? And where do you think this goes?", "Mike: Honestly, I wasn\u2019t shocked. It seemed like a national backlash, and people mobilized almost immediately. Besides being quite liberal, tech has many, many workers here from Asia and the Middle East and this directly affects them and their families. I would have been surprised if they had all stayed quiet.", "I do think the Uber phenomenon around this was interesting. Almost overnight, Uber became the target for outrage, as people were upset at the continued willingness of Uber\u2019s chief, Travis Kalanick, to be on Trump\u2019s economic council. As hundreds of thousands of people deleted their Uber accounts and employees internally voiced concerns, Travis stepped down from the council.", "And to your earlier point, the speed of how people mobilized so quickly was indeed breathtaking. I think a lot of it had to do with a feeling of helplessness among people that I heard about quite a bit. They wanted to do something, hence the protests, but also deleting and boycotting Uber felt satisfying to many, like they were taking a stand. We\u2019ll see if that blows over now that Travis is off the council.", "Farhad: On the other hand, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief, decided that he\u2019s not quitting the Trump advisory council. In a statement, Musk said he didn\u2019t like the immigration order, but that he\u2019d use his position on the council to suggest changes to the policy.", "The funny thing, though, is that Musk already seems to be limiting his ambitions. He suggested on Twitter this week that he didn\u2019t think he could press Trump to retract the order. That ship had sailed! But yes, this is still a man who wants to colonize Mars. Guess some things are easier than others.", "Mike: Sending a man to Mars is more feasible than changing Donald Trump\u2019s stance on immigration. This is the part where I would normally use the thinking face emoji if we were texting each other.", "Farhad: There is one hard-charging Silicon Valley bigwig who doesn\u2019t seem to be giving up on Trump: Peter Thiel.

Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense \u2014 meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone.

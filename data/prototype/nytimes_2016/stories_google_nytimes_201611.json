These sites are not neutral platforms, but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices; the more they stew, the more time they spend on the site. In the case of a fake news story that claimed that Mr. Trump won the popular vote, Google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results.", "That wasn\u2019t the only role that Silicon Valley played in this election. Tech companies didn\u2019t face the same degree of populist assault as the banks, but they came to embody as much as Wall Street the harsh, unequal American economy that didn\u2019t care a lick for the people left behind.", "There is an enormous disconnect between Silicon Valley and the people it serves. Mr. Trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it. By attacking companies like Amazon (for tax avoidance) and Apple (for outsourcing labor on its products), Mr. Trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after Hillary Clinton\u2019s highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs.", "More than that, Mr. Trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing, which Silicon Valley derides as the old economy. Technology companies believe in the idea of \u201cdisruption,\u201d their great promise to the world. Internet-driven efficiency replaces the \u201cfriction\u201d holding us back \u2014 bureaucrats, unions, brick and mortar stores, cumbersome factories along with libraries, the post office, taxis and hotels.

Tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals.

And when he wanted to express his outrage, attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being \u201ccrooked\u201d and the system \u201crigged,\u201d he went on Twitter.", "Turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society, so that political transitions can be made peacefully, that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities won\u2019t be targeted by hateful discourse. But civility and empathy can be disrupted, too.", "By fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions, the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create. It\u2019s no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election, even as the broader market rallied.

From the moment the young actor heard of the project, he had been intrigued by its improbable story and conflicted hero. The director Garth Davis was there, too, and the three settled in over fresh ginger tea. But then Mr. Patel noticed a whiteboard covered in a blizzard of Post-its. He looked at the notes. \u201cI was like, wait, you haven\u2019t done the script yet?\u201d he said.", "They had not. But what was there, in those dozens of stickies, was so captivating that Mr. Patel knew he had to have the role. Based on Saroo Brierley\u2019s best-selling memoir, \u201cA Long Way Home,\u201d the film tells the true story of a 5-year-old Indian boy who fell asleep on a train and ended up in Kolkata, thousands of miles from home. Lost and unable to tell authorities the name of his mother or hometown, he was soon adopted by a couple in Australia. Years later, Mr. Brierley searched for his family back in India with only help from Google Earth and a smattering of memories.", "When the movie had its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, Mr. Patel earned rave reviews for his portrayal of the adult Brierley. In hindsight, he seems so right for the role of this young Tasmanian trying to make sense of his privileged upbringing that it\u2019s hard to believe that Mr. Davis, at least at first, thought he was so wrong for it. He was, Mr. Davis said in an interview, too skinny to play the \u201csporty\u201d character, for one thing. And while Mr. Patel, who was born and raised in London, speaks with a British accent and had learned an Indian one for roles in five films, starting with \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d in 2008, he had never tackled an Australian one.", "What Mr. Davis was looking for in the character of Saroo, it seemed, was someone a bit less \u2026 Dev Patel. \u201cHis acting style wasn\u2019t necessarily what I had in mind,\u201d the director conceded.", "It was clear Mr. Patel would have to fight for this one. You seem like a lovely guy, the director and screenwriter told him, but you\u2019ve got to throw your hat in the ring with everyone else. \u201cActually, they were very sweet about it,\u201d Mr. Patel said with a laugh.", "Earlier this month, Mr. Patel was here at a restaurant not far from his West Hollywood home, talking about how he ultimately secured the lead. Tall (6-foot-2) and filled out and sporting the full beard and mustache he cultivated for the role, Mr. Patel, 26, looks nothing like the awkward, earnest teenager he played in \u201cSlumdog.\u201d", "That film, co-starring Freida Pinto, went on to win eight Academy Awards, including for best picture and best director, and forever changed the way Mr. Patel looked at India and his place in it. At school in London, he remembered, \u201ca lot of kids were bullied, and I spent a lot of time repressing my culture just to fit in.\u201d When he traveled to India, the experience was life-changing. \u201cWe went to the most incredible places you wouldn\u2019t see in a package holiday, and it blew away all the clich\u00e9s I had in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI fell in love with my co-star. Everybody I met was listening to Led Zeppelin.\u201d", "If the shoot changed his life, the film itself initially did little to alter Mr. Patel\u2019s prospects in Hollywood. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting cast after \u2018Slumdog,\u2019\u201d he said. At times, the breakthrough film even worked against him. He wasn\u2019t allowed to audition for the South Asian title character of \u201cLife of Pi,\u201d Ang Lee\u2019s 2012 adventure fantasy, he said, because the filmmakers thought he had become overexposed. Suraj Sharma, who eventually landed the role, \u201cdid an amazing job, and the film blew me away, but there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s like, damn, I wish I could have at least taken a shot at it.\u201d", "Insistent movie executives and his own love for martial arts \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m the biggest Bruce Lee fan,\u201d he said \u2014 led him to take a role in \u201cThe Last Airbender,\u201d an action fantasy film whose budget dwarfed that of \u201cSlumdog.\u201d The movie was a critical flop. \u201cIt was a very humbling moment,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI learned very quickly the power of saying no.\u201d", "Worthier projects followed, and Mr. Patel was soon working with some of the industry\u2019s most celebrated actors, including Jeremy Irons, in \u201cThe Man Who Knew Infinity\u201d (released in the United States this year) and the seasoned ensemble cast of the \u201cExotic Marigold Hotel\u201d films, which included Dames Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. \u201cMaggie Smith was so patient with me, but she is a complete scene stealer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have this huge monologue, and then at the end she\u2019ll say one line or throw you a sour look, and she\u2019s ripped the scene away from you.\u201d", "For the role of Saroo, Mr. Patel met with the director for six hours, plowing his way through every scene. He did a full screen test, capped off by a request from Mr. Davis to scream his guts out. \u201cHe goes, \u2018I want you to lose your mind,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it if you don\u2019t want to, but I knew in my head that if I said no, that was it. So I lost it. I completely went somewhere.\u201d", "Mr. Davis also wanted him to look more like the real Saroo, so off to the gym he went. After playing a sickly Indian mathematician struggling through five British winters in \u201cInfinity,\u201d Mr. Patel was, he admitted, \u201ca twig.\u201d He discussed his weight gain plans with the real Saroo, who noticed him eating a particularly hearty breakfast one day. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to get a little bit bigger,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brierley recalled. \u201cAnd he\u2019s definitely done that. He looks sensational.\u201d", "To better connect with the character, Mr. Patel rode trains across India \u2014 \u201cJust so I could understand what it would be like to be on a train that long\u201d \u2014 and visited orphanages.", "Mr. Patel also worked with a dialect coach for eight months to recreate Saroo\u2019s Australian accent. \u201cI think everyone was stunned by his accent work,\u201d Mr. Davis, who is Australian, said. \u201cIt\u2019s flawless, really. Australian accents are very hard \u2014 they\u2019re kind of ugly and complicated \u2014 but the guy never stopped working.\u201d", "\u201cIt was very difficult,\u201d Mr. Patel acknowledged.

After losing his sight in his mid-40s, Dr. Hull, a newlywed with a young family, had decided that blindness would destroy him if he didn\u2019t learn to understand it. For three years he recorded his experiences of sight loss, documenting \u201ca world beyond sight.\u201d", "We first met Dr. Hull in 2011, having read his acclaimed 1991 book \u201cTouching The Rock: An Experience of Blindness,\u201d which was transcribed from his audio diaries.

These included an Emmy-winning Op-Doc in 2014 and culminated in the feature-length documentary \u201cNotes on Blindness.\u201d", "But we were also interested in how interactive forms of storytelling might further explore Dr. Hull\u2019s vast and detailed account \u2014 in particular how new mediums like virtual reality could illuminate his investigations into auditory experience.

Once the Halls focused on adopting, they spent roughly five months over a span of nine months in the country, running with their Ethiopian friends and learning the Amharic language. When they met their future children, they spent a week visiting the orphanage in the Ethiopian capital before asking the girls if they would like to be adopted and come home with them.

Knopf. $28.95.", "We don\u2019t usually think of Timothy Leary as a consumer advocate, but in his zealous promotion of LSD, the iconoclastic 1960s psychologist was searching for what today we would call an ad blocker \u2014 though his tiny tabs relied more on messing with our sensory receptors than dropping code on our mobile phones.", "In his new book \u201cThe Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads,\u201d Tim Wu reminds us that Leary pushed acid in the pursuit of \u201ca complete attentional revolution\u201d in which his followers would reject the growing external stimuli of commercial media in favor of an inward, spiritual journey.", "It\u2019s more than a bit ironic, then, that Leary felt compelled to resort to a classic marketing trick, the jingle, to press his case. His \u201cTurn on, tune in, drop out\u201d was so catchy that, though failing to smash the attention economy, it was ultimately complicit in contributing to it, showing up in a campaign for Squirt, a grapefruit-flavored soda: \u201cTurn on to flavor, tune in to sparkle, and drop out of the cola rut.\u201d", "This gets at the heart of the compelling thesis of \u201cThe Attention Merchants,\u201d namely that the age of mass media and mass marketing is characterized by an arms race between those who seek to capture the valuable commodity of our attention and capitalize on it for gain and those who resist this harvesting of time either through drugs; regulation; or most effectively, collective boredom, distraction and indifference. Wu\u2019s argument is that each boom in commercial media in some way went too far and provoked an either minor or major revolt, pushing the advertising industry to adopt more sophisticated or extreme methods to monetize our time.", "Drawing a line from the snake oil salesmen of the early 20th century, through the birth, rise and decline of broadcast to the \u201cattention plantation\u201d of Facebook, Wu\u2019s history also illustrates the cyclical resistance movements against advertising. First came the unscrupulous false advertising, then the corrective of investigative journalism; first the tidal bore of broadcast television, then the corrective of the remote control; first the era of spam, then the development of filters and blockers.", "The book is studded with sharp illustrations of those who have tried to stop the encroachment of advertising on our lives, and usually failed. In the 1930s, for example, Rexford Tugwell, an economist and member of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration, sought to introduce far stricter legislation on drug advertising, which would have barred pharmaceutical and cigarette industries from making false claims about their products. The pressure brought by manufacturers on broadcasters to resist the proposed legislation saw both Tugwell\u2019s recommendations watered down and Tugwell himself smeared as a Communist. Newspapers and radio barely covered the controversy, in part, Wu writes, as a response to pressure from advertisers.", "This struggle has only become more relevant today. Many media companies, including The New York Times, are now almost entirely dependent on the ability to build and sustain a business model that captures people\u2019s time and resells it to advertisers, or provides something so valuable to individuals that they will pay for the journalism, programming or experience they receive. If you walk the floor of a modern newsroom, you will most likely see journalists staring at real-time charts flickering with numbers, and dials telling editors where readers are spending every second of their time. If you have got this far in the review, then I and Tim Wu are doing well \u2014 around 55\u202fpercent of readers, on average, will have stopped after 15 seconds.", "There is little sign of this trend slowing, only accelerating. Facebook and Google represent the largest and most successful advertising-funded businesses in history. They are busy developing technologies that track not only our attention but also every aspect of our online behavior and, in Facebook\u2019s case, synthesizing it with what is known as our \u201csocial graph.\u201d That graph is the circle of colleagues, acquaintances, families and friends we connect with online and determines as a result what type of advertising and even what type of news or other content we see. We are largely unaware of how the hidden tracking technologies operate and are complicit in how much we surrender.", "From his historical perspective, Wu can see that often a moment such as this one, in which our eyeballs are so thoroughly monopolized, is followed by resistance. But his concern is that we have not individually or collectively paid enough attention to the commercialization of every part of our lives: \u201cOur society has been woefully negligent about what in other contexts we would call the rules of zoning, the regulation of commercial activity where we live, figuratively and literally. It is a question that goes to the heart of how we value what used to be called our private lives.\u201d", "Clearly not a fan of the selfie stick or the culture of \u201cmicrofame,\u201d Wu sees a tendency to self-aggrandize online, turning us all into miniature attention merchants. As the man who coined the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and a skilled thinker about the importance of an open web, Wu is nevertheless largely disappointed about where the internet has taken us. In a chapter titled \u201cThe Web Hits Bottom\u201d he describes in some detail the business model of the new-media company BuzzFeed and the quest for \u201cvirality.\u201d Wu is steadfastly skeptical, seeing \u201clittle to admire\u201d online. Though he briefly describes \u201cbright spots\u201d like Wikipedia and Reddit and name-checks online legacy media that he grudgingly admits have improved their offerings, he sees them as being \u201cengulfed by the vast areas of darkness, the lands of the cajoling listicles and the celebrity nonstories, engineered for no purpose but to keep a public mindlessly clicking and sharing away.\u201d", "What his thesis doesn\u2019t allow for is the possibility that despite his skepticism, we may have become rather deft in developing our own spam filters and that while the \u201copen web\u201d has in fact delivered a lot of cats falling over, it has also given us access to more knowledge than ever before and more engaging forms of information. It has done this in part because of the possibility of advertising revenue, not despite it.

In fact, it doesn\u2019t have a driver \u2014 it operates using sensors and software, although for now, a person is stationed on board ready to hit a red \u201cstop\u201d button in an emergency.", "At a time when self-driving cars are beginning to make progress \u2014 most notably with a trial program that the ride service Uber began in Pittsburgh this fall \u2014 the bus represents a different approach to technologically advanced transportation.", "A driverless car, after all, is still a car, carrying at best a few people. By transporting many passengers on what could be very flexible routes, driverless buses could help reduce the number of cars clogging city streets.", "It\u2019s no surprise that the bus is being tested in Helsinki, which has been at the forefront of efforts to use technology to rethink public transportation.", "Driverless buses like this one are being used in private, controlled settings, for example to shuttle students around a campus or employees on the grounds of an industrial plant. Helsinki is one of the first cities to run so-called autonomous buses on public roads in traffic; another project, in Sion, Switzerland, has been operating for several months, although the service was suspended in September for two weeks after a minor accident.", "The Helsinki bus is a project of several universities with cooperation and money from government agencies and the European Union. The two-year, $1.2 million project, called Sohjoa, is just one manifestation of a movement to reduce the use of cars, and the traffic jams and greenhouse gases that come with them.", "\u201cA good possible outcome is that less and less people will own personal vehicles in the cities because they really don\u2019t need them anymore,\u201d said Harri Santamala, who coordinates the project and directs a \u201csmart mobility\u201d program at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.", "In September, a Sohjoa bus, which can accommodate up to 12 passengers sitting and standing, made its debut on a straight, quarter-mile route in the city\u2019s Hernesaari district, turning 180 degrees at both ends. The trip connected a popular sauna and restaurant at one end with several restaurants at the other, and attracted a small stream of curious riders.", "\u201cWe chose this as a first route because we can study a huge amount of different traffic issues depending on the time of day,\u201d Mr. Santamala said.", "The buses are not as sophisticated as Uber\u2019s self-driving cars, or those being developed by Google and other companies. Those are essentially \u201cfree-range\u201d vehicles, able to travel just about anywhere by comparing what their sensors detect about roads and surroundings with a database that has been compiled by the cars over time. (Before Uber began offering rides in Pittsburgh, for example, employees drove its cars around the city for months, collecting data.)", "The buses, made by a French company, are \u201ctaught\u201d a route by having operators drive them using steering and acceleration controls on a small box. The route is then fine-tuned with software. In operation, the buses have laser sensors and GPS to keep them on the route, and can deviate only if alternate routes have been \u201clearned\u201d as well.", "While the buses are designed to travel at about 15 m.p.h., or 25 kilometers pe hour, they are running at half that for the Helsinki trials. Lateral movement is also restricted; if a car is double-parked along the route, for instance, the bus must wait until the car moves or the bus operator steers around it using the control box.", "\u201cWe have to be very keen about safety,\u201d Mr. Santamala said.", "Those restrictions provide an underwhelming experience for now. The most excitement occurs when a vehicle like the white van crosses too closely, or when a motorist approaches from the rear and, impatient with the bus\u2019s tortoiselike pace, swerves around it.", "Mr. Santamala said the project aimed to establish a real bus route \u2014 probably a seasonal one \u2014 in the next two years.

Reducing the number of operators could make it financially feasible to run routes that serve only a few customers, or to vary routes throughout the day based on ridership.", "Helsinki has already seen several efforts to use technology to change public transportation. One was an on-demand minibus service, Kutsuplus, that was operated by the regional transport agency for four years. Using a smartphone, customers could choose pickup and drop-off locations. The service\u2019s software then combined requests from several customers and calculated an optimal route for one of its 15 minibuses.", "\u201cIt was a good experiment,\u201d said Sami Sahala, who advises the city on \u201cintelligent transportation\u201d issues. \u201cBut it was a little bit ahead of its time.\u201d Kutsuplus was heavily subsidized by the city, and although the service was popular and gaining riders, it was doomed by budget cuts at the end of last year.", "A spinoff company, Split, ran an on-demand service in Washington that was discontinued last month, and Uber and its ride-service rival, Lyft, have developed similar ride-share services that use the companies\u2019 drivers and their private cars.", "Other efforts to remake transportation continue in Helsinki. The most ambitious is a service introduced this fall by a Finnish company, MaaS Global, that offers all-inclusive transit services for a monthly fee. The concept, called \u201cmobility as a service,\u201d takes its inspiration from the changes that have occurred in the telecommunications industry over the past several decades, Mr. Sahala said.", "\u201cYou used to pay for all the calls you made,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the advent of mobile phones, the business model started to change. Now you pay a fixed price, and everything is included.\u201d", "Through an app called Whim, MaaS Global lets customers order transportation from point A to point B and then guarantees it will provide it, using a combination of trams, buses, taxis, rental cars and car-sharing services.", "\u201cYou\u2019re covered,\u201d said Sampo Hietanen, the chief executive of MaaS Global. \u201cYou can just concentrate on going.\u201d The monthly fees vary depending on how much transportation is needed.", "Mr. Hietanen said that to be successful, the service should provide the same feeling of independence that owning a car does.", "Cars are expensive, and studies have shown that most urban car owners rarely use them, so there\u2019s a potential market in people who give up their cars and spend some of the savings on a service like Whim.", "Self-driving cars and buses may eventually help to make services like MaaS Global\u2019s widely affordable, Mr. Hietanen said.", "For now, the bus trials continue. Last month, the project moved to a more complex route in Espoo, on Helsinki\u2019s outskirts, and is now operating in Tampere, 111 miles (179 kilometers) to the north.", "Mr. Santamala and his colleagues analyze each trip to learn how a self-driving bus differs from one operated by a human, and how motorists and pedestrians interact with it.

What happens now to the art scenes of London and Glasgow, to the schools and galleries, and above all to the young Britons whose futures have been arrested, is unknowable but very unpromising.", "The affecting retrospective \u201cMark Leckey: Containers and Their Drivers,\u201d now on view at MoMA PS1, appears almost as a time capsule from Britain before June 23: a sprawling, bopping showcase of musical history, anthropological assemblage and personal reverie. A prodigious aggregator of high art and popular culture, Mr. Leckey is a profoundly British figure, shaped especially by the country\u2019s postpunk and dance music scenes. Winner of the 2008 Turner Prize, he stands at the forefront of a generation of British artists who revived the country\u2019s art scene, and though this exhibition pulses with the exuberance of the British culture that nurtured him, it can at times feel like a love letter to a Britain that has come and gone. (The show has been deftly structured across two floors of the museum by Peter Eleey, PS1\u2019s associate director of exhibitions and programs, and Stuart Comer, who leads MoMA\u2019s department of media and performance art. Mr. Comer is American but spent more than a decade in London.)", "Running through this artist\u2019s work is a passion for the British underground, particularly its music subcultures, which Mr. Leckey examines with both a sociologist\u2019s diligence and a diarist\u2019s nakedness. Born near Liverpool in 1964, Mr. Leckey came of age as Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Marc Quinn and others found fame under an umbrella designation as Young British Artists. But Mr. Leckey preferred rave nights and obscure vinyl, and sat out that media-confected jamboree. After a few years in New York, he returned to London and was invited to contribute to a show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts on music videos, a genre he found more engaging than most visual art.", "The result was \u201cFiorucci Made Me Hardcore\u201d: a rhythmic, enthralling video chronicle of Britain\u2019s nights on the tiles from the 1970s to the 1990s. Pasty white kids bop about in workingmen\u2019s social halls, and drunk teenagers boogie under strobe lights; Northern Soul fans in bell bottoms give way to ravers with whistles. Mr. Leckey brought the pleasures of Britain\u2019s working classes (specifically from northern England) into elite (and southern) art institutions, and held up popular culture as the truest source of Britain\u2019s creative life. Crucially, the kids danced more often than not off the beat: Mr. Leckey did not synchronize sound to image, which imbued the video with a loss and wistfulness belying its four-on-the-floor beat. \u201cFiorucci\u201d became a cult success in the turn-of-the-millennium art world, though today, when archival imagery is found in the cloud rather than on tape, it can be hard to remember just how much labor was required to synthesize its night-owl history.", "Mr. Leckey stuck with music with his \u201cSound System\u201d sculptures, totemlike stacks of speakers, amps and buffers that burble out snippets of vocals, beats and bodily sounds. But by the mid-2000s his approach had grown more omnivorous, and his art began to recycle and reconstitute fine art, popular culture and his own past as elements of a single, undifferentiated stream of content. Lecture-performances such as \u201cCinema-in-the-Round\u201d (2006-08) and \u201cIn the Long Tail\u201d (2009), which screen here on video, mash up art history and economics with fantastical claims, recalling the jumbled but spirited pedagogical interventions of Joseph Beuys. \u201cIn the Long Tail,\u201d for example, somehow equates the statistical concept of long-tailed distribution to the tail of Felix the Cat \u2014 the silent-era cartoon that Mr. Leckey treats as an archetype of media distribution and mutation. Felix pops up a lot in this show, most uncannily in a giant inflatable version scrunched into a gallery, his chin smushed into his belly.", "In 2013, Mr. Leckey\u2019s practice of aggregating high and low culture drove him to organize an ornery exhibition, \u201cThe Universal Addressability of Dumb Things,\u201d which treated antiquities, machines, consumer goods and art, by William Blake, Louise Bourgeois and Ed Atkins, as so much commensurate stuff. The Google-addled cabinet of curiosities toured across Britain, and when it ended Mr. Leckey roughly duplicated many of its objects, then placed them on staggered displays that recalled natural history museums. Authentic artworks and copies, unique objects and 3-D printouts, shoes and sex toys are absorbed into a homogeneous presentation of world culture, in which technology has vitiated the very need for museums to preserve significant objects. It\u2019s bracing, like seeing an alien exhibition of our species, though one could do without the related posters and paratexts: Mr. Leckey has a wearying penchant for buttressing his projects with promotional materials for from his earlier shows, and should be confident enough now to let that go. (There are also photographs here of reviews of past exhibitions in Artforum or Frieze; even we critics are fodder for the system.)", "Recently, Mr. Leckey has veered back to autobiographical territory. A room-filling sculpture of a Liverpool highway overpass, and a hallway illuminated by sallow yellow lamps used to illuminate British motorways, transform the galleries of PS1 into memory palaces of his northern English childhood. There is also a crepuscular LED display of Britain\u2019s national power grid; watching the lights go out across the island gives a frisson of the Brexit-induced ruin to come.", "Most impressive is \u201cDream English Kid 1964-1999 AD,\u201d which limns the artist\u2019s youth primarily through scraps of video discovered online. We see record shops, washed-out public housing, a shadow walking through London\u2019s Soho; we see clips of Joy Division, the Manchester-born band Mr. Leckey worships; we see the same highway overpass we encountered as sculpture, which on screen appears in a fog-bestrewn black-and-white like something out of \u201cThe Third Man.\u201d As in \u201cFiorucci Made Me Hardcore,\u201d this aching new video gains its power through shrewd editing and a lightly worn nostalgia. Unlike \u201cFiorucci,\u201d this one was made largely through YouTube and other digital sources; what appears to be first-person is actually made of others\u2019 lives.", "The melancholy \u201cDream English Kid\u201d may not have the outward-facing joy of \u201cFiorucci,\u201d nor the exacting wit of his cabinet of curiosities. But it\u2019s one of Mr. Leckey\u2019s best works. It captures, more than anything before, the gravid, intoxicating atmosphere of Britain in the 1990s that nurtured the most consequential generation of British artists of the last century. Brexit has made the video doubly nostalgic, not only for the last days of analog culture, but for an open, imaginative Britain that has not yet shot itself in the foot."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html": ["WASHINGTON \u2014 Days before the presidential election, James Alefantis, owner of a local pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong, noticed an unusual spike in the number of his Instagram followers.", "Within hours, menacing messages like \u201cwe\u2019re on to you\u201d began appearing in his Instagram feed.

One person even visited Comet Ping Pong to investigate the allegations for himself.", "To combat the fake news tide, Mr. Alefantis has contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the local police, and he has asked Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit to remove the articles. Yet the misinformation has continued to spread, growing into a theory known as #pizzagate that has traveled to Ireland. At one point, Comet\u2019s staff counted five #pizzagate Twitter posts a minute.

Days before the election, users on the online message board 4Chan noticed that one of Mr. Podesta\u2019s leaked emails contained communications with Mr. Alefantis discussing a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton.", "The 4Chan users immediately speculated about the links between Comet Ping Pong and the Democratic Party. Some posited the restaurant was part of a larger Democratic child trafficking ring, which was a theory long held by some conservative blogs.

In hindsight, it would have been better to express Mrs. Clinton\u2019s polling margin as equivalent to a 2.2 percentage point lead \u2014 and that the true margin could be higher or lower by several points. That would have better conveyed the race\u2019s uncertainty.", "Poll aggregation is built on the idea that pollsters are more accurate as a group than they are individually. During the primaries, I used state polls to argue that Mr. Trump was the strong favorite to win the nomination. However, general-election polls did less well, and so did I. State polls underestimated the Republican-versus-Democrat margin by four percentage points, the largest error in decades. This presidential-level polling error was echoed in the national House popular vote and Senate polls, which were also both off by a median of four percentage points. As Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight has pointed out, errors are often correlated. A warped ruler is flawed no matter how many measurements are averaged.", "The pattern of polling errors provides a clue to why Mr. Trump\u2019s victory came as a surprise. In states that Mr. Trump won, his actual margins against Mrs. Clinton were a median of six percentage points better than the last available polls. In contrast, in states won by Mrs. Clinton, the gap between polls and outcomes was 0.2 of a percentage point. Mr. Trump\u2019s hidden strength in the states he won suggests that some fraction of Republican voters were struggling between party loyalty and difficulty with accepting Mr. Trump.

This contradicts my pre-election assumption that undecided and minor-party voters, unusually abundant this year, would not break strongly in either direction.", "The outcome may have also been swayed by the letter that James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., sent to Congress on Oct. 28 about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, after which national and state polls swung toward Mr. Trump, perhaps decisively.", "I suggest that we retire the concept of the \u201cundecided\u201d voter.

In one particularly interesting example, during the Republican primary season a reader of my website who goes by the initial N. used Google Correlate, a tool that allowed her to find web search terms that showed the same pattern as state polling data. Using those search terms, N. predicted the outcome in unpolled states more accurately than demographic models of the Republican electorate.

As many have noted, if 55,000 Trump supporters had instead cast votes for Mrs. Clinton in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, we would be looking at a narrow Clinton victory. Hampered by inadequate data, her campaign grasped the danger to her supremacy in these states too late.

The acrimonious debate over whether to add housing included both predictions that the neighborhood would fill up with the tech equivalent of Chinese factory dorms and worries that residents would disturb a habitat for local burrowing owls.", "One city councilman even suggested that if the city built housing in North Bayshore, it could create a Google voting bloc that would turn Mountain View into a factory town. But after the City Council decided against adding new housing, voters responded by electing three pro-housing candidates, including Mr. Siegel. One of the new Council\u2019s first acts was to instruct the city\u2019s planning department to study ways to add housing to North Bayshore.

We believe VR storytelling allows for a deeper understanding of a place, a person, or an event.", "This month, we added support for 360-degree videos into our core news products across web, mobile web, Android, and iOS platforms to deliver an additional immersive experience. Times journalists around the world are bringing you one new 360 video every day: a feature we call The Daily 360.", "The current state of 360 videos on the Web", "We\u2019ve been using VHS, our New York Times Video Player, for playback of our content on both Web and Mobile Web platforms for the last few years. Building support for 360 videos on those platforms was a huge challenge. Even though the support for WebGL is relatively mature nowadays, there are still some issues and edge cases depending on platform and browser implementation.", "To circumvent some of those issues, we had to implement a few different techniques. The first was the use of a \u201ccanvas-in-between\u201d: We draw the video frames into a canvas and then use the canvas to create a texture. However, some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge are not able to draw content to the canvas if the content is delivered from different domains (as happens with a content delivery network, or CDN), even if you have the proper cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) headers set. We investigated this issue and found out that we could leverage the use of HTTP Live Streaming through the use of an external library called hls.js to avoid this problem.", "Safari also has the same limitation regarding CORS. It seems to have been an issue in the underlying media framework for years and for this scenario, the hls.js workaround doesn\u2019t solve the problem. We tackled this issue with the combination of two techniques:", "By doing this, we avoid the CORS video texture bug since the content and the iframe are in the same domain as the CDN and we were able to show the player in the parent domain, and the content inside the iframe.", "Many of our users see our videos from within social media apps on their phones. On iOS, almost all of these social network applications load off-site content on their own in-app browsers instead of using the native browser, which raises a longstanding technical issue: the lack of support for inline playback video, even on iOS 10. This happens because inline playback support is still disabled by default on web views.", "The technical problems listed above aside, the basic theory on how we should view 360 content is pretty straightforward. There are basically four steps to implement a simple 360 content view solution:", "These four steps could be implemented just using the WebGL API but there are 3D libraries like three.js that provide an easier way to use renderers for canvas, svg, CSS3D and WebGL. The example below shows how one could implement the four steps described above to render 360 videos or images:", "", "When we first started to work on supporting 360 video playback on VHS, we researched a few projects and decided to use a JavaScript library called Kaleidoscope.

As a result, we decided to go with a different approach for each platform.", "For the iOS core app, we created a small Objective-C framework that uses the same approach as Kaleidoscope. Initially we considered to start the development using Metal and OpenGL, but those are lower-level frameworks which require significant development work to create scenes and manipulate 3D objects.", "Luckily, there\u2019s another option: SceneKit is a higher-level framework that allows manipulation and rendering of 3D assets in native iOS apps. Investigation revealed that SceneKit provided adequate playback performance, so we chose to use it to render the sphere and camera required for 360-degree video playback.", "We also needed to extract video frame buffers into a 2D texture to be applied as a material for the sphere, and to do that we decided to use SpriteKit. SpriteKit is a powerful 2D graphics framework commonly used in 2D iOS games. Our playback framework uses a standard iOS AVPlayer instance for video playback and uses SpriteKit to render its video onto the sphere.", "Finally, we bind user interactions and device movements to control the camera\u2019s motion using standard iOS gesture recognizers and device motion APIs.", "By using these tools we were able to create a 360 video framework that is very similar to Kaleidoscope.

What many emoji users don\u2019t know is that every speechless monkey and manicure emoji that shows up on our keyboards is tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium, an opaque group of representatives from mammoth tech companies who decide which new glyphs will make their way to our fingertips and which will be kept out of reach.

They realized there was no emoji to represent one of their favorite foods, so Ms. Lu drew up a design and Ms. Lee set out to have a dumpling added to the emoji keyboard alongside the hamburger and the pizza slice.", "That brought her to Unicode, a nonprofit organization that standardizes text characters across digital devices \u2014 ensuring that a message sent from, say, an American iPhone can be read on phones, computers and tablets used around the world. Thanks to the global surge in popularity of colorful and figurative emoji characters during the past several years, it also now decides whether we should all be able to text in-line pictures of brontosaurs, chopsticks and mermen to one another.", "Any texter who wants to propose a new emoji for review must first navigate Unicode\u2019s labyrinthine website, submit an academic-style paper arguing the case and ultimately gain the approval of representatives from a pool of tech companies \u2014 including Apple, Google, Adobe, Oracle and the German software company SAP \u2014 that pay $18,000 each in annual dues for the right to vote on characters. Once approved, the encoded characters are kicked back to the tech companies to design the emoji in their own aesthetics and offer the glyph to their users.

He winkingly referred to Unicode\u2019s committees as \u201cshadowy,\u201d and represented them in a PowerPoint with the an emoji of faceless figures but then fielded questions from the crowd. When one conferencegoer inquired about his chances of getting his own emoji onto the keyboard, Mr. Davis said that Unicode had committed to ushering in about 70 emoji symbols a year and that about half of all public proposals made the cut. The dumpling is scheduled to show up on devices next year.", "Later, academics took to the stage to critique Unicode\u2019s ultimate control over emoji; an Adobe typeface designer and font developer campaigned for more androgynous ones to complement the proliferation of female and male glyphs; and regular users advocated on behalf of their own emoji. Pitches included a person meditating, a peacock, a pretzel and a hijab. \u201cI really just wanted a hijab emoji of me that I could use with my friends across social media,\u201d said Rayouf Alhumedhi, a 15-year-old Saudi girl who came to Emojicon to push for a glyph that looks like her. \u201cIf there are four emoji of a mailbox, why isn\u2019t there one for the 50 million hijabi women around the world?\u201d", "And in perhaps the bluntest speech of the conference, Keith Winstein, a professor of computer science at Stanford, proposed wresting the creation of emoji from Unicode\u2019s grasp entirely. He called Unicode\u2019s control over modern visual expression \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d He praised communication platforms like Slack that allow users to upload their own emoji, no Unicode encoding required. To make the point, he called up Slack on a big screen behind him and conjured an emoji showing a woman wearing the hijab. \u201cI didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission,\u201d he said. \u201cI just did it!\u201d", "Mr. Winstein and Ms. Lee recently collaborated on an official proposal asking Unicode to create a visual encoding loophole of sorts that would let people introduce pictographs without waiting for Unicode\u2019s approval.

The potential initial public stock offering of Snap at very likely an extraordinary valuation will push other tech companies to go public, generating more money in the pockets of the tech elite to make acquisitions.", "But the result of all this merger activity is a broad push toward oligopoly, meaning industries are dominated by just a few big players.", "Take media and telecommunications.

Republicans and Democrats alike have called for regulators to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal.", "In Washington, you can expect not just greater enforcement but possibly a change in the laws to focus on corporate giants that dominate a market through their immense size.", "So there is a rush to get deals through before the laws change. Either way, things are not getting better. And the risk of being left behind because of technological disruption and change is driving companies to make acquisitions faster. It is also a trend that, not surprisingly, affects larger companies. Thomson Reuters reports there have been 615 deals year to date, down from 967 in 2014, so the deals are concentrated at the higher end.", "This trend is spurring the return of the oft-derided conglomerates that came about in the 1960s. As was the case then, instead of growth and survival, we may just end up with bloat.", "At the moment, it is hard to find anything that can slow the merger train. Everything is going right. But it is in these times that perhaps caution is necessary. The merger market has always been cyclical. The current is moving forward, but sentiment can change. In addition, the risk of disruption still exists, whether it be the United States election, renewed uncertainty in Europe or global turmoil from Russia. And there is the prospect of higher interest rates, and how that will affect cheap deal financing is anybody\u2019s guess.", "If we have learned anything from more than 100 years of corporate mergers, it is that the lurking influences eventually emerge and the current trends driving all of this merger activity are unlikely to last.

The autumnal salad, in a yuzu-and-grape dressing, included concord and green grapes, robust greens, shaved melon, radishes and stracciatella cheese. For dessert, yuzu cream was essentially a bowl of thick, sweet, citrusy cream strewn with raspberries, pistachios and olive oil crumble.", "Note: There\u2019s a wrong way and a right way to get to Kissa Tanto.

Like the offerings at Kissa Tanto, the food exhibits Asian and Italian influences \u2014 a recent menu item, for example, was eggplant tortolloni with miso, mushrooms, brown rice dashi and mustard greens.

We went from the orange and herbal flavors of smoked Castelvetrano olives to red wine rigatoni (made with reduced red wine, instead of water) with venison, celeriac, blistered grapes, juniper and a touch of coffee. Tender slices of aged duck, strewn with dandelion greens, arrived in a vivid red sauce of beetroots and strawberries, enhanced with Nootka rose honey. Vegetables here are not a dieter\u2019s refuge: Heirloom carrots, hidden beneath a mound of sprouted wheat, were prepared with duck fat and ramp vinegar and sat atop a voluptuous daub of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.", "Royal Dinette, 905 Dunsmuir Street, royaldinette.ca.

I was drawn by the restaurant\u2019s elaborate Japanese menu, with the occasional French or Latin twist. The flame-seared aburi oshi sushi was especially intriguing.", "When we arrived, the waiting area was filled. We killed time by peering into the busy kitchen where I watched a baker pouring green batter into a shallow pan. What is that?

Soba peperoncino, with shrimp, squid and ribbons of sweet pepper and jalape\u00f1o in a chile-garlic sauce, had a real bite to it. Salmon oshi sushi lived up to expectations. A thin layer of pressed local wild salmon atop rectangles of rice had been torched just enough to coax a caramelized flavor from a sweet sauce (I asked a waitress what was in it; \u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d she said, sotto voce) that augmented but didn\u2019t overwhelm the pure flavor of the salmon. Wasabi and soy sauce were nowhere in sight.", "And finally, the green tea opera cake \u2014 an elaborate Japanese take on the French version \u2014 appeared. \u201cIt takes three days to make,\u201d our server said effusively.", "We beheld the wonder of geometry and color.

Attended to by a young woman who served as a sort of grand dispenser of knowledge (\u201cNo need to Google Yelp on your phone,\u201d she said, as my dining companion, in search of recommendations, was in the midst of doing. \u201cI\u2019ll be your Google.\u201d) We followed her suggestion and ordered a very good Okanagan white wine.", "Dishes were served as they were prepared, resulting in a traffic jam on our small table. Sockeye salmon ceviche with avocado, watermelon radish and flash-fried quinoa was a pretty, pastel dish, citrusy clean and light. The small pizza, its thin crust appetizingly blistered and charred in the beautiful tile oven we had walked by, offered flashes of decadent saltiness from the slivers of guanciale and green olives.

In fact, the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the world: With billions of people glued to Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, Twitter, Weibo and other popular services, social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political force, to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events.", "The election of Donald J. Trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the planet, social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society. They have subsumed and gutted mainstream media.

And they are destabilizing and replacing old-line institutions and established ways of doing things, including political parties, transnational organizations and longstanding, unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia.", "Most important, because these services allow people to communicate with one another more freely, they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among once-marginalized groups. These ad hoc social movements range widely in form, from \u201calt-right\u201d white supremacists in the United States to Brexiters in Britain to ISIS in the Middle East to the hacker collectives of Eastern Europe and Russia.

Last month the company reported that about 1.8 billion people now log on to the service every month. Because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among people, they become strikingly more powerful as they grow. With about a quarter of the world\u2019s population now on Facebook, the possibilities are staggering.", "\u201cWhen the technology gets boring, that\u2019s when the crazy social effects get interesting,\u201d Mr. Shirky said.", "One of those social effects is what Mr. Shirky calls the \u201cshifting of the Overton Window,\u201d a term coined by the researcher Joseph P. Overton to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss.", "From about the early 1980s until the very recent past, it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the mainstream, things like overt calls to racial bias (there were exceptions, of course, like the Willie Horton ad). But the internet shifted that window.", "\u201cWhite ethnonationalism was kept at bay because of pluralistic ignorance,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cEvery person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the TV about immigrants or was willing to say white Christians were more American than other kinds of Americans \u2014 they didn\u2019t know how many others shared their views.\u201d", "Thanks to the internet, now each person with once-maligned views can see that he\u2019s not alone.

The groups also become ready targets for political figures like Mr. Trump, who recognize their energy and enthusiasm and tap into it for real-world victories.", "Mr. Shirky notes that the Overton Window isn\u2019t just shifting on the right. We see it happening on the left, too. Mr. Sanders campaigned on an anti-Wall Street platform that would have been unthinkable for a Democrat just a decade ago.", "Now, after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, the way forward for Democrats will very likely be determined as much by collectives on Facebook as by elites in Washington \u2014 and, as a result, we\u2019re likely to see more unlikely candidates and policy positions than we would have in the past.", "The upshot is further unforeseen events. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely going to get more of these insurgent candidates, and more crazy social effects,\u201d Mr. Shirky said.", "Mr. Trump is just the tip of the iceberg.

That is why many of his closest supporters have long cautioned that the most headline-grabbing proposals of his run for the presidency should not be taken literally \u2014 they are guideposts, the supporters suggest, not plans.

Or at least what he is going to try to do, in partnership with Republicans who on Tuesday retained control of both houses of Congress.", "It was in Mr. Reagan\u2019s last months in office that Mr. Trump took out a full-page ad in several newspapers complaining that \u201cfor decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States.\u201d Flirting with a presidential run himself \u2014 he was 41 \u2014 and seeking the publicity that would become addictive, he called for the United States to pull out of the Middle East, which he called \u201cof only marginal significance to the United States for its oil supplies,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhy are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing protect their interests?\u201d", "It is a line he often repeated in his unlikely candidacy. America\u2019s Asian allies, South Korea included, are about to learn whether that is an opening negotiating position, or the condition for America\u2019s continued military presence in the Pacific. Japan\u2019s best hope arises from the fact that he is now focusing his attentions on the United States\u2019 five-times-as-large trade deficit with China, which he described in May as engaged in \u201cthe greatest theft in the history of the world.\u201d", "At home, his instincts often mix elements of what he has heard or read from the left and the right.

In his first year, he will have to square those two promises \u2014 or not.", "Indeed, his campaign talk has often contradicted his past proposals.

His motivation: He was considering a bid for the presidential nomination of Ross Perot\u2019s Reform Party, which had made federal debt reduction one of its signature issues.", "But it is in national security that he faces some of the biggest quandaries.", "His zero-sum instincts kick in when the subject turns to immigration, which is essentially the importation of people. He has long argued that immigrants take jobs from Americans, diminishing prosperity by dividing the American pie into a larger number of smaller pieces. The idea that they can bolster the economy, too \u2014 as some of the founders of Intel, Google and other Silicon Valley powerhouses did \u2014 never creeps into his speeches.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s views of the economy are also deeply rooted in his identity as a real estate developer.

If you were to analyze this news outlet for the ratio of positive emotional words to negative ones, would you find a dip linked to the events of the past few weeks?", "It\u2019s possible, suggests a study published last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Analyzing Google Books and The New York Times\u2019s archives from the last 200 years, the researchers examined a curious phenomenon known as \u201cpositive linguistic bias,\u201d which refers to people\u2019s tendency to use more positive words than negative words.

The positive category included about 400 words, including \u201cawesome,\u201d \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201cgrace.\u201d The negative one included about 500 words, including \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cgrief\u201d and \u201chatred.\u201d", "Then the researchers looked at how many times these positive and negative words appeared each year, across 1.3 million texts in Google Books and 14.9 million New York Times articles. They also analyzed word usage relative to unemployment and inflation rates, wartime casualty estimates and national happiness surveys.", "Looking for changes over time can provide clues about the mechanism behind the linguistic positivity bias, said William Hamilton, a doctoral candidate at Stanford University who focuses on linguistic trends and was not involved in the study.", "Many theories have been proposed: Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re social creatures, and affirmative language promotes group bonding and cooperation.

What may be less compelling is the researchers\u2019 finding that there is an overall decrease in positive language use over the last 200 years.", "Tools like the LIWC database were developed around \u201cthe way people write and talk today,\u201d said Mark Liberman, a linguistics professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was not part of the study.

The idea, known as Long Short-Term Memory, or LSTM, was not widely understood when it was introduced. It essentially offered a form of memory or context to neural networks.", "Just as humans do not restart learning from scratch every second, a certain type of neural network adds loops or memory that interpret each new word or observation in light of what has been previously observed. LSTM strikingly improved these networks, leading to huge jumps in accuracy.", "It may be that Dr. Schmidhuber\u2019s misfortune is that he was simply too early \u2014 a few years ahead of the powerful and more affordable computers we have today. It was not until recently that his concepts started to pan out.", "Last year, for example, Google researchers reported that they had used LSTM to cut transcription errors in their speech recognition service by up to 49 percent.

How those ambitions ultimately play out is anyone\u2019s guess.", "One issue that Mr. Trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking American jobs.", "\u201cThe jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by technology,\u201d Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said at the conference.", "That\u2019s a truth that may be at odds with Mr. Trump\u2019s ambitions.", "Still, Mr. Schmidt had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits.", "\u201cManufacturing jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take that for granted.\u201d", "Despite all of the hand-wringing among C.E.O.s surprised about the outcome of the election, there was a sense of optimism \u2014 or at least a sense of hope \u2014 that pervaded their words.", "\u201cWe all know a lot about Trump the campaigner \u2014 now we have to find out about the Trump who needs to get things done,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said.", "\u201cHe will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to be,\u201d he continued. \u201cI assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things change.\u201d", "Mr. Blankfein added, \u201cI\u2019m going to see how it goes before I become mournful.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/books/zadie-smiths-swing-time-explores-friends-diverging-paths.html": ["Doubles \u2014 pairs of friends, rivals and families; contrasting ideologies and views of the world \u2014 animate Zadie Smith\u2019s novels, as surely as doubles and doppelg\u00e4ngers haunt many Hitchcock movies. Her astonishing debut novel, \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d (2000), recounted the story of two World War II vets \u2014 polar opposites and best friends \u2014 and their extended families, opening out into a teeming, Bruegel-esque portrait of a multicultural London. \u201cOn Beauty\u201d (2005), another magical big-city novel (set mainly in Boston), also depicted two very different families with intertwined lives. And the disappointing \u201cNW\u201d (2012) used the diverging stories of two childhood friends to look at the potent and ever shifting dynamics of money and class.", "Ms. Smith\u2019s latest novel, \u201cSwing Time,\u201d works a variation on this setup. This time, it\u2019s two spirited London girls and their very different trajectories. There are echoes of Wendy Wasserstein\u2019s captivating 1981 play, \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic\u201d \u2014 in their titles, lifted from 1930s classics in film and song, and in their portraits of two friends\u2019 coming of age and their conflicted relationships with their mothers.", "At the same time, this novel addresses many themes that have animated Ms. Smith\u2019s work since the start: the competing claims that family, cultural heritage and politics exert on identity; how personal imperatives are shaped (or not) by public events; the mix of emulation, resentment and rebellion that inform children\u2019s attitudes toward their parents.", "Told in the first person, the narrative cuts back and forth in time, alternating between persuasive chapters about the unnamed narrator\u2019s memories of her childhood and adolescence (when she and her friend Tracey both aspired to become dancers), and dull, strangely generic chapters about her grown-up experiences, working as an assistant to a famous singer and would-be humanitarian named Aimee, who can \u201cprocure a baby\u201d for adoption \u201cas easily as she might order a limited-edition handbag from Japan.\u201d", "The novel\u2019s flashback chapters, set in London, possess the tactile energy and emotional detail of \u201cWhite Teeth.\u201d Ms. Smith conjures the electric pulse of the 1980s and 1990s, when goth and punk were taking over the streets, and the nostalgia of the Cool Britannia years, when people rode Vespas to work and decorated their cubicles with pictures of Michael Caine in \u201cAlfie\u201d \u2014 the boys looking like \u201crebooted Mods\u201d with \u201cKinks haircuts from 30 years earlier,\u201d the girls like \u201cJulie Christie bottle-blondes in short skirts with smudgy black eyes.\u201d She also captures the now-quaint rituals of that era before smartphones and the internet transformed daily life \u2014 when email was still a rarity, and research was conducted not through Google, but in libraries, reading old newspapers and microfiche.", "She is more adept here than in \u201cNW\u201d at mapping the inner lives of her heroines, though the radical sympathy she evinced for her characters in \u201cWhite Teeth\u201d and \u201cOn Beauty\u201d has given way to a somewhat more grudging attitude \u2014 perhaps accounted for by the fact that the story is told from the narrator\u2019s decidedly subjective point of view. Ms. Smith conveys her heroines\u2019 youthful passion for dance \u2014 a calling that only Tracey has the talent to seriously pursue \u2014 and the push-pull of their passive-aggressive friendship.", "Tracey \u2014 whose absent father has been in jail, and whose angry mother is an enabler of Tracey\u2019s worst impulses \u2014 is the diva, the heedless one, who wears flashy clothes, has lots of boyfriends and takes a lot of drugs. The narrator is the good girl, the self-conscious, prudent one, who plays Ethel to Tracey\u2019s flamboyant Lucy. Eager to escape the shadow of her chilly, politically ambitious mother, the narrator goes off to college, and eventually takes a job that requires her to play Ethel to Aimee\u2019s Lucy.", "Aimee is a complete celebrity stereotype \u2014 a rote mash-up of Madonna and Angelina Jolie, who possesses none of the satiric edge or surprising tenderness of, say, the Justin Bieber-inspired hero of Teddy Wayne\u2019s 2013 novel, \u201cThe Love Song of Jonny Valentine.\u201d And the chapters that chronicle Aimee\u2019s much publicized efforts to build a school in an unnamed African country are beyond tedious \u2014 Aimee jetting in from her cosseted life in Britain and America to visit a village and meet with children and politicians, all the while trailed by video cameras. These sections are so perfunctorily rendered that they often feel like stuffing, written to fill out the novel\u2019s schematic structure, which moves between present-day, Aimee-centric sections, and flashback, Tracey-centric ones.", "Some of the narrator\u2019s experiences in Africa with Aimee \u2014 combined with her efforts to understand shifting attitudes toward race in music and dance \u2014 are meant to raise larger questions about cultural appropriation, and the relationship between the privileged West and the developing world. But these issues do not spring organically from this clumsy novel \u2014 a novel that showcases its author\u2019s formidable talents in only half its pages, while bogging down the rest of the time in formulaic and predictable storytelling."]}

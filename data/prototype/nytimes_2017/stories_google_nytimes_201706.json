Gmail is now the most widely used web email service.", "But the service has been criticized by privacy advocates for scanning email to generate contextually aware ads. The ads in email bothered users more than other targeted advertising found across the web, because users are more touchy about the privacy of email versus, for example, browsing history.", "\u201cThis action was driven by concerns from business users \u2014 not regular individuals,\u201d said Seth Schoen, a senior staff technologist from the Electronics Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cSome of the regular people who use Google services disliked the way their email contents were being used to target ads way back in 2004. Yet their concerns couldn\u2019t get much traction until Google became aware 13 years later that some current or prospective paying enterprise customers were uncomfortable with this practice.\u201d", "The decision to stop combing email to distribute specific ads in Gmail is a sign of Google\u2019s seriousness in winning over corporate customers to use its internet infrastructure and services. Ads still represent a vast majority of Google\u2019s revenue, but the company sees Google Cloud as a growth area.", "Google had said its policy was not to target ads in Gmail based on personal information, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial data, and that information extracted from a user\u2019s email will only be used for ads in Gmail.

Then the company started selling excess cloud capacity to other companies.", "Before Google and Microsoft realized it, Amazon had created a high-margin multibillion-dollar business that was encroaching on their turf. They are still struggling to catch up.", "If the cloud computing business just grew, Amazon Prime was a bold bet from the beginning, the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet for shoppers: Pay an annual fee and all shipping costs for the year are covered.

In the headiness of the late-1990s dot-com boom, it became the symbol of how this new invention called the World Wide Web was going to change everything. Then, like many of the leading dot-com companies, it blew up. The world wasn\u2019t quite ready for Amazon. It came very close to going under.", "Mr. Bezos redoubled his focus on customers, largely closed the company off to the media and got to work doing some serious experiments. Amazon developed, for instance, the Kindle e-reader, which for a time seemed likely to kill off physical books entirely.", "One thing the retailer did not do was make much money. In its two decades as a public company, Amazon has had a cumulative profit of $5.7 billion. For a company with a market value of nearly $500 billion, this is negligible. Walmart, which has a market value half that of Amazon, made a profit of $14 billion in 2016 alone.", "Huge profits at Amazon were always put aside so the company could invest more. This has tended to drive both skeptics \u2014 there are still a few, even now \u2014 and competitors crazy. \u201cDid Amazon Just Jump the Shark?\u201d was the headline on an article on the investing website Seeking Alpha on Friday.", "But the tens of millions of customers do not care whether Amazon is hugely profitable. They care if it is making their lives easier or better.", "\u201cJeff Bezos is making shopping great,\u201d said Chris Kubica, an e-book consultant and software developer who watches Amazon closely. \u201cHe\u2019s made me come to expect better from every checkout counter. Oh, I can scan my entire shopping cart full of groceries in one go, without stopping, as I roll into the parking lot? Yes, please. Where do I park?\u201d", "After the company\u2019s disastrous foray with the Fire Phone, Amazon could have done what many other also-rans in smartphones do and keep putting out devices that most people ignore in favor of Apple and Samsung devices.

The Alexa intelligent assistant, which runs on it, can play music and tell jokes, and now Google, Apple and Microsoft are copying it.", "\u201cBezos is ahead of the game, always,\u201d said Sunder Kekre, a professor at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cBe it drones or Amazon Go\u201d \u2014 a grab-and-go shopping experiment that eschews human cashiers \u2014 \u201che is able to craft smart business strategies and position Amazon quite distinctly from competitors.\u201d", "As Amazon pushes on with its ceaseless experimenting, however, it risks being seen as less of a cute disrupter of the old and as more of a menace.

The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a frequent foe of Amazon, noted that the company is \u201crapidly monopolizing online retail\u201d and that both Prime and Echo \u201care strategies for locking in consumers and ensuring they don\u2019t shop anywhere else.\u201d Amazon declined to comment for this article.", "Where will it all end?

These tools can outperform human beings at a given task.", "This kind of A.I. is spreading to thousands of domains (not just loans), and as it does, it will eliminate many jobs. Bank tellers, customer service representatives, telemarketers, stock and bond traders, even paralegals and radiologists will gradually be replaced by such software. Over time this technology will come to control semiautonomous and autonomous hardware like self-driving cars and robots, displacing factory workers, construction workers, drivers, delivery workers and many others.", "Unlike the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution, the A.I. revolution is not taking certain jobs (artisans, personal assistants who use paper and typewriters) and replacing them with other jobs (assembly-line workers, personal assistants conversant with computers). Instead, it is poised to bring about a wide-scale decimation of jobs \u2014 mostly lower-paying jobs, but some higher-paying ones, too.", "This transformation will result in enormous profits for the companies that develop A.I., as well as for the companies that adopt it. Imagine how much money a company like Uber would make if it used only robot drivers. Imagine the profits if Apple could manufacture its products without human labor. Imagine the gains to a loan company that could issue 30 million loans a year with virtually no human involvement. (As it happens, my venture capital firm has invested in just such a loan company.)", "We are thus facing two developments that do not sit easily together: enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands and enormous numbers of people out of work. What is to be done?", "Part of the answer will involve educating or retraining people in tasks A.I. tools aren\u2019t good at. Artificial intelligence is poorly suited for jobs involving creativity, planning and \u201ccross-domain\u201d thinking \u2014 for example, the work of a trial lawyer. But these skills are typically required by high-paying jobs that may be hard to retrain displaced workers to do. More promising are lower-paying jobs involving the \u201cpeople skills\u201d that A.I. lacks: social workers, bartenders, concierges \u2014 professions requiring nuanced human interaction. But here, too, there is a problem: How many bartenders does a society really need?", "The solution to the problem of mass unemployment, I suspect, will involve \u201cservice jobs of love.\u201d These are jobs that A.I. cannot do, that society needs and that give people a sense of purpose. Examples include accompanying an older person to visit a doctor, mentoring at an orphanage and serving as a sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 or, potentially soon, Virtual Reality Anonymous (for those addicted to their parallel lives in computer-generated simulations). The volunteer service jobs of today, in other words, may turn into the real jobs of the future.", "Other volunteer jobs may be higher-paying and professional, such as compassionate medical service providers who serve as the \u201chuman interface\u201d for A.I. programs that diagnose cancer. In all cases, people will be able to choose to work fewer hours than they do now.", "Who will pay for these jobs? Here is where the enormous wealth concentrated in relatively few hands comes in. It strikes me as unavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.", "As for what form that social welfare would take, I would argue for a conditional universal basic income: welfare offered to those who have a financial need, on the condition they either show an effort to receive training that would make them employable or commit to a certain number of hours of \u201cservice of love\u201d voluntarism.", "To fund this, tax rates will have to be high. The government will not only have to subsidize most people\u2019s lives and work; it will also have to compensate for the loss of individual tax revenue previously collected from employed individuals.", "This leads to the final and perhaps most consequential challenge of A.I. The Keynesian approach I have sketched out may be feasible in the United States and China, which will have enough successful A.I. businesses to fund welfare initiatives via taxes. But what about other countries?", "They face two insurmountable problems. First, most of the money being made from artificial intelligence will go to the United States and China. A.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product. It\u2019s a virtuous circle, and the United States and China have already amassed the talent, market share and data to set it in motion.", "For example, the Chinese speech-recognition company iFlytek and several Chinese face-recognition companies such as Megvii and SenseTime have become industry leaders, as measured by market capitalization. The United States is spearheading the development of autonomous vehicles, led by companies like Google, Tesla and Uber. As for the consumer internet market, seven American or Chinese companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are making extensive use of A.I. and expanding operations to other countries, essentially owning those A.I. markets. It seems American businesses will dominate in developed markets and some developing markets, while Chinese companies will win in most developing markets.", "The other challenge for many countries that are not China or the United States is that their populations are increasing, especially in the developing world. While a large, growing population can be an economic asset (as in China and India in recent decades), in the age of A.I. it will be an economic liability because it will comprise mostly displaced workers, not productive ones.", "So if most countries will not be able to tax ultra-profitable A.I. companies to subsidize their workers, what options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they wish to plunge their people into poverty, they will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their A.I. software \u2014 China or the United States \u2014 to essentially become that country\u2019s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies in exchange for letting the \u201cparent\u201d nation\u2019s A.I. companies continue to profit from the dependent country\u2019s users. Such economic arrangements would reshape today\u2019s geopolitical alliances.", "One way or another, we are going to have to start thinking about how to minimize the looming A.I.-fueled gap between the haves and the have-nots, both within and between nations. Or to put the matter more optimistically: A.I. is presenting us with an opportunity to rethink economic inequality on a global scale.

Worse, it\u2019s uneven: Older, wealthier and more educated people turn out in large numbers. Last year, for example, 70 percent of those over 70 years old voted. By contrast, only 43 percent of those under 25 did.", "Even in presidential elections, when turnout is highest, the electorate does not reflect America. In primaries and local elections, turnout can dip into single digits. This has proved catastrophic for both major parties in our political system, often favoring extreme candidates and ensuring that most incumbents have no real contest.", "Raising turnout presents two distinct challenges: How does our campaign win the next election? And how does our political system raise voter turnout for the long term?", "The first challenge is easier. One way for campaigns to get their voters to the polls is to recruit a good candidate who can inspire voters and run a competitive race.", "Then there\u2019s painstaking fieldwork.

Many were from California; this week, Orange County\u2019s board of supervisors is deciding on Denver-style reforms.", "We hear a lot about voter suppression. It is true that in many states and cities, Republican officials make it harder to vote, placing obstacles aimed especially at minorities. This has rightly drawn attention and condemnation \u2014 and some reversals in court.", "But the counter-trend is growing. The Illinois legislature, for example, just adopted automatic registration, by unanimous votes in both houses. If the governor signs it, then citizens who have contact with state agencies, including the motor vehicles department, will be automatically registered unless they decline.", "Oregon was the first state to institute automatic registration, but now there are eight, as well as Washington, D.C.

Momentum is growing; so far this year, 32 states have introduced proposals to institute or expand it.", "Republicans approve of automatic registration because researchers believe it is truly nonpartisan. It\u2019s so new that we have only one test case: Oregon this year. The state saw higher turnout among people who were young, poorer and less urban.

It saves money, cleans up voter rolls and reduces the chance of error and fraud \u2014 without increasing the risk of hacking.", "These are all important. But can it raise turnout? By itself, probably not. In concert with other reforms, maybe.", "One reason turnout is dismal is that the United States is one of very few democracies that places the burden of registration on the voter. Does it seem normal to have to register to vote? It isn\u2019t. In nearly every other advanced democracy, citizens are automatically registered.", "And nearly every other democracy holds elections on weekends, or makes Election Day a holiday.

For wage workers, however, it\u2019s daunting.", "\u201cIt is very hard to get voters\u2019 attention,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe squeeze our Election Day into the middle of everything else Americans are doing. We never say, \u2018Stop, think about your country and vote.\u2019 \u201d", "Then there is the decentralization of American elections. \u201cWe have elections every single week,\u201d said Seth Flaxman, who runs the nonprofit organization Democracy Works and TurboVote, an app that texts or emails people voting reminders, instructions and forms. \u201cWe\u2019ve given out information for over 2,000 races so far this year.

Despite that, turnout in every kind of election except presidential elections is declining. And in presidential elections, turnout is stagnating. Youth voter turnout is at an all-time low.", "\u201cChanging election administration, reforms around convenience voting \u2014 the literature is pretty conclusive that none of these have any significant long-term effect.\u201d", "Not everyone agrees. Some researchers point to election-day registration, for example, as something that works. Fifteen states let voters register when they vote. It makes sense that election-day registration could increase turnout. In some states, registration closes a month or more before Election Day. Are you finally ready to pay attention to the election? Too late!", "In their 2013 book \u201cWho Votes Now?\u201d Jan E. Leighley and Jonathan Nagler found that in such states, election-day registration would raise turnout by 6.6 percentage points. (Becker, however, thinks the evidence linking election-day registration to better turnout is weak.)", "As for automatic voter registration, pioneering Oregon had the largest increase in turnout of any state between 2012 and 2016. According to a new analysis by the Center for American Progress, about 116,000 people registered who would have been unlikely to do so on their own, and 35 percent of them voted. That\u2019s a pretty low rate. But it\u2019s still 40,000 new voters.", "Other strategies could focus on helping young people identify as prospective voters and make voting a habit once they\u2019re eligible. Eric Marshall, director of the liberal Funders\u2019 Committee for Civic Participation, argues for expanding registration drives in high schools, to register high schoolers before they reach their 18th birthdays, and before they scatter.", "Election officials could try to help people feel more competent at understanding the issues and candidates. People don\u2019t enjoy doing things they\u2019re bad at. Becker suggests changing the typical small-type voters\u2019 handout about the candidates, written in government-ese, and experimenting with more appealing messages.", "Flaxman\u2019s goal is to bring voting information and inspiration into the channels people already use.

Is Kabul, Baghdad or Peshawar not enough?", "In the aftermath of every atrocity, before we have had a chance to properly mourn the dead, urgent conversations are started \u2014 as if good, sound analysis could somehow make us feel better. We talk about the police\u2019s past failures. We talk about the intelligence community\u2019s past successes. We talk about our resolve and our phlegmatic defiance. Then we feel resilient enough to take out the trash or walk the dog again.", "In Britain as in Pakistan, these discussions often become shrill and turn to religion. After last weekend\u2019s attacks in London \u2014 but before her party lost its majority in Parliament on Thursday \u2014 Mrs. May said that we will need to have embarrassing conversations. What she probably meant was that we\u2019ll talk about how Muslims are like prepubescent boys and must be taken aside to be told the facts of life and the true spirit of Islam. Your holy texts are being misused. Forget those lullabies that were whispered to you in your cradle teaching you to hate us.

But just the thought of looking for a new air-conditioner is enough to make you break out in a sweat. How do you know which one to buy, and how it will affect your energy bill? What if your apartment building doesn\u2019t allow window units? Not to worry: We\u2019ve done the research for you.", "The key to comfort and savings is finding the unit that fits your space. An air-conditioner that isn\u2019t powerful enough won\u2019t effectively cool your home and could end up inflating your power bill. One that is too powerful will work too quickly, shutting off before most of the humidity has been removed, leaving your place cool but clammy. And all that cycling on and off can stress the equipment and shorten its life span.", "Energy efficiency is another factor: The energy efficiency ratio (EER) is a measure of how well a cooling system will operate when the temperature outside is 95 degrees. Look for an air-conditioner with an Energy Star label, indicating that it is more efficient than required by government standards. But remember that no matter how efficient your air-conditioner is, you won\u2019t get the most for your money \u2014 or be as comfortable as you could be \u2014 if your home is not properly sealed and insulated.", "With all of that in mind, here are some guidelines to help you find the right air-conditioner for your home.", "CENTRAL AIR Central air-conditioning is the most popular type of cooling system in the United States. More than 75 percent of households with a cooling system use central air, according to the latest data from the United States Energy Information Administration.", "But New York City is one of the big outliers. The reason: Its building stock is older than that of most major American cities, according to estimates by the Department of Buildings, with about three-quarters of the buildings constructed before 1960 \u2014 in other words, before central air-conditioning became popular. Retrofitting older apartments with central air means installing a condenser outside the home, a fan-and-coil system inside and ducts to distribute the cooled air. That\u2019s not cheap, and it requires space, a resource lacking in many New York City apartments.", "\u201cIt is very tricky to retrofit a building that was built without air-conditioning,\u201d said Andrew Gerringer, the managing director for new business development at the Marketing Directors, a New York development, leasing and marketing company. \u201cBuildings that have installed it\u201d \u2014 including, he noted, some apartments at 190 Riverside Drive and Manhattan House at 200 East 66th Street \u2014 \u201chave done so through great expense and aggravation.\u201d", "Even if you are willing to give up a closet to install a central air system in your prewar apartment, your building may not allow you to put a condenser on the roof. And retrofitting an apartment built without ductwork could be prohibitively expensive. In the best-case scenario \u2014 where you don\u2019t have to run a pipe through your neighbor\u2019s kitchen ceiling to get to your compressor \u2014 installing or replacing a whole-house system can cost, on average, from $2,650 to as much as $15,000, according to Fixr.com, a site that tracks home improvement costs.", "Another consideration: Most central air systems lack room-by-room control, so if you want to cool the bedroom while you\u2019re sleeping, you\u2019ll have to cool the rest of your home, too. Still, because the ducts and mechanical components are built in, effectively hidden within the walls, floors or attic, central air is the most discreet option.", "If you decide it\u2019s right for you, check out Consumer Reports\u2019 buying guide for reliability by brand and be sure to consider the system\u2019s Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER), which measures how efficiently a central air-conditioner operates over an entire season (like the energy efficiency ratio, the higher the number, the better).", "Hire an installer who will work with you on a well-thought-out plan for where to put the ductwork, and be sure to insulate that ductwork. Also, budget for seasonal visits by a professional to change the filter, clean the coils and perform other maintenance to ensure that the system is working properly.", "Bottom line: If you have space for the ductwork, central air is a quiet, convenient and design-friendly way to cool your home.", "DUCTLESS MINI-SPLIT AIR-CONDITIONER If central air is not an option, a ductless mini-split system may be your best bet. Mounted on a wall and operated by remote control, these systems still require an outdoor compressor, but there is no bulky ductwork involved. Refrigerant is circulated through tubing that connects the indoor and outdoor units.", "Though not as discreet as central air, ductless mini-split systems are highly efficient, as each unit can be controlled separately. These systems can also provide heating. The cost of outfitting a 2,000-square-foot home ranges from about $1,800 to $7,000, according to Fixr.com; the more wall units you need, the higher the cost. As with central air, you will need a professional installer and should budget for an annual maintenance check.", "WINDOW UNITS Inexpensive and easy to install, window units are among the most popular options for cooling individual rooms. Starting prices range from $129 for a small unit designed to cool a 150-square-foot room to $599 for a larger unit designed to cool a 1,600-squre foot space, according to Lowe\u2019s.", "To figure out what size you need, measure the room you want to cool and calculate the overall square footage. You can find the recommended cooling capacity (measured in British thermal units, or BTUs, per hour) for your room size at Energystar.gov/roomac.", "Be sure to take into account sun exposure and how the room is used. If the room is heavily shaded, for example, the Energy Star chart recommends reducing capacity by 10 percent.

In the kitchen, increase capacity by 4,000 BTUs.", "Based on five summers\u2019 worth of research and tests, The Sweethome, a product review site owned by The New York Times, recommends the LG LW8016ER (about $210) for most spaces measuring between 300 and 350 square feet. It not only cooled as efficiently and effectively as other window units of similar size and price tested by The Sweethome, it was also quieter, with a lower volume and deeper pitch. For those willing to pay more for an even quieter model, The Sweethome recommends the Frigidaire Gallery FGRQ08L3T1 (about $300).", "If your windows are horizontal-sliding or crank-out models, casement air-conditioners like the Frigidaire FFRS0822S1 ($460) or the Kenmore 77223 ($550) are widely available options, according to The Sweethome. And while most people want their air-conditioners to be as inconspicuous as possible, those willing to pay for something with visual appeal might consider Friedrich\u2019s K\u00fchl line, which starts at $600 for a window unit and offers $50 panels in colors including cobalt blue, deep red and pink diamond.

If you want to change the temperature without getting up from the couch, it allows you to do so using your smartphone or computer, or with your voice via Google or Amazon Echo. Nest also learns the temperature you like and builds a schedule around when you\u2019re home, which can help reduce energy bills.", "BUILT-IN AIR-CONDITIONERS Don\u2019t want to block the view with an unsightly window unit? Built-in air-conditioners, also known as through-wall units, are mounted in a metal sleeve that goes through an opening cut in the wall.", "While The Sweethome has not tested any wall units, Mr. McCabe pointed to the LG LT0816CER as a good bet. \u201cWe know that the very similar window version is very good, and the other choices are either more expensive (sometimes much more), less energy-efficient\u201d or difficult to find in stores, he said. \u201cYou might be able to find a cheap wall-sleeve A/C made by Midea and sold under various brand names, including Arctic King, Westpointe and Comfort-Aire, among others,\u201d he wrote in his air-conditioner review. \u201cBut they\u2019re generally not available through major retailers.\u201d", "PORTABLE AIR-CONDITIONERS These free-standing units, most professional reviewers say, should be used only as a last resort. Portable air-conditioners are not only more expensive, less efficient and noisier than window units, but they sit entirely inside the home, taking up valuable floor space, and use unsightly venting tubes that look as if they belong on the back of a washing machine. In short, they are bulky, ugly and don\u2019t work very well.", "Consumer Reports found that these units delivered only about half the cooling capacity they claimed, with few lowering the temperature to even 80 degrees after 100 minutes running.", "Still, if you live in a building that does not allow window units, this may be your only option, apart from a fan. If you decide to go this route, The Sweethome advises that units with two hoses are better than those with one, and recommends the dual-hose Whynter Elite ARC-122DS (about $500).

Most days, he trawls a constantly-updated list of sites he hates (including Elam\u2019s \u201cA Voice for Men\u201d), seeking out arguments he finds repulsive, baffling and, he admits, fascinating to watch play out in real time. Clicking through his list, he reads post after post, charting the themes and preoccupations of the day, the latest catchphrases and memes, the shifting alliances and disputes.", "\u201cI plunge myself into this endlessly swirling caldron, and I see what\u2019s new,\u201d Futrelle told me recently. When he began the site in 2010, it was an after-work hobby. Since 2014, it has become a full-time enterprise, bankrolled by advertising revenue and PayPal donations from his readers. Most of those readers, Futrelle says, are women, for whom the site\u2019s lively discussion threads offer a place they can talk (and laugh and cry and yell) about internet misogyny without being harassed on all sides by internet misogynists. The discussion under \u201cKilled by Chivalry\u201d quickly stretched to over 700 comments.", "Futrelle\u2019s journey toward his idiosyncratic career began in the late 2000s, when he kept finding himself in long, drawn-out Reddit arguments with self-described men\u2019s rights activists (M.R.A.s, in manosphere shorthand). At first he was shocked to discover that M.R.A.s even existed \u2014 that there really was, in his words, \u201ca group of guys who saw men as America\u2019s most oppressed class.\u201d Some of these men, he realized early on, were hardened misogynists or trolls: They argued that only men should be allowed to vote, or they gleefully condoned the use of violence to keep women in their proper place. But some of the less extreme posters reminded Futrelle uncomfortably of his younger self. Looking back on his high-school years, he saw himself as under the sway of some of the same flawed assumptions prevalent among the M.R.A.s.", "\u201cLike the \u2018nice guy\u2019 fallacy,\u201d he told me, referring to the implicit belief that being persistently \u201cnice\u201d to a woman could lead to her owing you sex. \u201cIt\u2019s rapey and gross. But it\u2019s very widespread. And I had a little bit of it, back then.\u201d Challenging those notions online sometimes felt, for Futrelle, like a form of penance; whether he was changing minds or not, he felt compelled to keep arguing.", "Futrelle started his own site in 2010, originally under the goofy name Man Boobz, aiming to build a stand-alone repository of careful anti-M.R.A. analysis. Perhaps, he speculated, his site could become a web destination that a confused young man might conceivably stumble upon while Googling for answers. \u201cThat does happen, now and then,\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019ll get an email saying, you know, \u2018Thanks, I was going down a bad path.\u2019 \u201d At first, almost all of his readers were committed M.R.A.s; they had followed him for Reddit so they could leave argumentative comments under whatever he wrote about them. But within just a few months, Futrelle was attracting a significant female audience: women eager to learn what men were getting up to online but put off by the prospect of trudging through the manosphere themselves.", "\u201cHe\u2019s basically our filter for looking at an eclipse,\u201d said Jaclyn Friedman, a feminist writer and activist who relied on Futrelle and his site while assembling an early guide to the manosphere for The American Prospect, in 2013. As Friedman\u2019s work became more visible, she was increasingly mentioned in the manosphere or contacted by its participants, occasionally in posts or emails suggesting she deserved to be raped or killed; Futrelle, she says, would help her sift through the threats, using his experience to make judgments about which were worth taking seriously.", "In We Hunted the Mammoth\u2019s early years, Futrelle assumed the communities he was scrutinizing were essentially fringe movements with a fixed and fairly low limit to their growth. This changed in 2014 with GamerGate, a snowballing manosphere-born campaign of that directed a large volume of misogynistic harassment who called out sexism in the world of video games. \u201cThe old-school M.R.A.s mostly sat GamerGate out,\u201d Futrelle said. \u201cThey thought video games were for wusses.\u201d But the movement rallied a new coalition of online misogynists, not just gamers but pranksters from message boards like 4chan and 8chan and \u201cedgy\u201d conservatives like those reading Breitbart News, which, sensing an opportunity to expand its audience, hitched its wagon to GamerGate early on. (The notorious former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was a particularly vocal evangelist for the movement.)", "In the eyes of the post-Gamergate manosphere, Futrelle is the prime example of a S.J.W. (social-justice warrior) trying to \u201cwhite knight\u201d his way to approval by the feminists and liberals who dominate American cultural discourse. On the site Encyclopedia Dramatica, a Wikipedia-style compendium of articles written from a broadly pro-manosphere perspective, the entry for \u201cDavid Futrelle\u201d (\u201coccasionally referred to as FATrelle or \u201cFatrolle\u201d) cherry-picks quotes from Futrelle\u2019s writing in hopes of characterizing him as an apologist for pedophilia, torture porn and child prostitution. Another site, Demagogue, apes the visual style of We Hunted the Mammoth almost to a tee, attempting to target Futrelle with the same zeal he targets them.", "\u201cIn the long run, David Futrelle\u2019s been a big boost to my career,\u201d says Elam, one of Futrelle\u2019s most frequent individual targets. \u201cEventually he sent all kinds of people to my website that figured out they weren\u2019t exactly getting the straight picture from him. Some of these people have not only stayed and started reading the site, they\u2019ve become financial supporters.\u201d Futrelle, Elam says, \u201cclaims to mock misogyny, but what he really does, in essence, is he mocks the pain of men that are really going through hard times. He might as well be on a cancer unit making fun of people for being sick.\u201d", "Mike Cernovich, a prominent online conspiracy theorist, is another frequent subject of We Hunted the Mammoth posts. By email, Cernovich suggested that Futrelle intentionally exaggerated the size of his readership by creating \u201csock puppets\u201d (fake users) to write comments under his own posts. \u201cWhen I Google myself, his stuff shows up,\u201d Cernovich added. \u201cI don\u2019t read the blogs, as they are predictable and boring.\u201d", "Futrelle\u2019s approach to the manosphere \u2014 best summed up as \u201cdocument and mock\u201d \u2014 is often most palpable in his post titles, which are sometimes just a few degrees away from Onion headlines. (\u201cHarry Potter pushes \u2018willing cuckoldry as a moral imperative,\u2019 weirdo Nazoid pickup artist explains\u201d; \u201cinternet laughs after men\u2019s right\u2019s activists discover Amazon\u2019s Alexa is a feminist.\u201d)", "The posts themselves often follow a template not dissimilar from the one used by the John Olivers and Seth Meyerses of the world. Some recent manosphere rant or manifesto is held up for inspection and then broken down into snippets and interspersed with Futrelle\u2019s commentary, designed to bring the absurdities of the target into view. It would be fair to criticize the site as an echo chamber: a place where almost everyone agrees that online misogyny is rampant and congratulates themselves for knowing so, taking what pleasure they can in laughing at their enemies\u2019 latest mutterings. Over the years, while poring through Futrelle\u2019s posts for help with magazine articles about the manosphere, I have wondered what the site would look like, and what it might accomplish, if it made more of an effort, alongside its fact-finding and analysis, to speak directly to manosphere denizens. But Futrelle believes that direct engagement simply isn\u2019t part of his mission. \u201cPut bluntly, this blog isn\u2019t for you,\u201d he wrote in a 2010 post directed to the M.R.A. readers still hanging on after following his migration from Reddit. \u201cIt\u2019s for all the people in the world who aren\u2019t you.\u201d", "As Donald Trump blustered his way to the presidency, Futrelle watched the manosphere thrill to the rule-breaking candidate as an avatar of their collective worldview: an old-school misogynist unshackled by politically correct strictures; a self-proclaimed anti-elite outsider but also a boastful \u201calpha\u201d male who unapologetically did what he wanted with the political establishment, much like, it was gleefully pointed out, a powerful pickup artist or \u201cseduction artist\u201d did what he wanted with unsuspecting women.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate the extent to which, for a lot of these guys, Trump is a wet dream come true,\u201d Futrelle said. Increasingly, staying on top of his beat has meant adding more destinations to his daily roster, following his manosphere subjects as they branched out to a new generation of racist alt-right stamping grounds and meme-filled neo-Nazi sites like the Daily Stormer, which, as he documented, was now making calculated appeals to a manosphere readership, claiming that all-male neo-Nazi clubs could be hubs for sharing tips and tricks on how to \u201chunt and capture your own women.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s not pleasant reading,\u201d Futrelle said glumly. \u201cSomething about it still fascinates me, but it\u2019s definitely not pleasant.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/25/fashion/weddings/marla-friedman-eduardo-weinstein.html": ["Marla Kate Friedman and Eduardo Alberto Weinstein are to be married June 25 at Caff\u00e8 Storico, a restaurant at the New-York Historical Society.

Instead, T.S.A. workers volunteered to help create the data for the contest from scratch, repeatedly walking through a set of test scanners at a laboratory in New Jersey. In some cases, the workers carried concealed items through the scanners, and these images are carefully labeled.", "By analyzing this data, neural networks and other algorithms can learn to pinpoint concealed items on their own. Jeremy Achin, a founder and the chief executive of the data analysis company DataRobot, said that neural networks were well suited to such a task.", "But he also warned that the technology could make mistakes and that in some cases it could be vulnerable to bad actors. Research has shown that after analyzing the performance of an image-recognition system driven by a neural network, miscreants could mark or otherwise alter items in ways that fool the system into seeing things that are not there \u2014 or failing to see things that are.", "For those reasons, the immediate aim is not to build technology that replaces human screeners but to find a way of removing some of the burden from those screeners, Mr. Goldbloom said.", "In the world of health care, researchers see deep learning as something that can augment the talents of doctors, not replace them.

Cook, the chief executive of Apple, delivered a blunt message to President Trump on how public schools could better serve the nation\u2019s needs. To help solve a \u201chuge deficit in the skills that we need today,\u201d Mr. Cook said, the government should do its part to make sure students learn computer programming.", "\u201cCoding,\u201d Mr. Cook told the president, \u201cshould be a requirement in every public school.\u201d", "The Apple chief\u2019s education mandate was just the latest tech company push for coding courses in schools. But even without Mr. Trump\u2019s support, Silicon Valley is already advancing that agenda \u2014 thanks largely to the marketing prowess of Code.org, an industry-backed nonprofit group.", "Code.org was founded in 2012 by Hadi Partovi, an early investor in Facebook and Airbnb, and his twin brother, Ali Partovi, himself an early investor in Zappos and Dropbox. The group first gained renown by using a viral video to stir up mass demand for coding lessons. Now Code.org\u2019s goal is to get every public school in the United States to teach computer science.", "In our tech-driven world, Hadi Partovi argues, computer science has become as essential for students as reading, writing and math. \u201cEncryption is at least as foundational as photosynthesis,\u201d he said.", "Computer science is also essential to American tech companies, which have become heavily reliant on foreign engineers. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to limit immigration make Code.org\u2019s teach-Americans-to-code agenda even more attractive to the industry.", "In a few short years, Code.org has raised more than $60 million from Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Salesforce, along with individual tech executives and foundations. It has helped to persuade two dozen states to change their education policies and laws, Mr. Partovi said, while creating free introductory coding lessons, called Hour of Code, which more than 100 million students worldwide have tried.", "Along the way, Code.org has emerged as a new prototype for Silicon Valley education reform: a social-media-savvy entity that pushes for education policy changes, develops curriculums, offers online coding lessons and trains teachers \u2014 touching nearly every facet of the education supply chain.", "\u201cThey have got this multipronged approach,\u201d said Amy Klement, a partner at Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment organization started by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, Pam, which has given $5.5 million to Code.org. \u201cIt\u2019s unique and a model I would love to see replicated.\u201d", "But Code.org\u2019s multilevel influence machine also raises the question of whether Silicon Valley is swaying public schools to serve its own interests \u2014 in this case, its need for software engineers \u2014 with little scrutiny. \u201cIf I were a state legislator, I would certainly be wondering about motives,\u201d said Sarah Reckhow, an assistant professor of political science at Michigan State University. \u201cYou want to see public investment in a skill set that is the skill set you need for your business?\u201d", "Mr. Partovi, 44, said he simply wanted to give students the opportunity to develop the same skills that helped him and his backers succeed. He immigrated as a child to the United States from Iran with his family, went on to study computer science at Harvard, and later sold a voice-recognition start-up he had co-founded to Microsoft for a reported $800 million.", "\u201cThat dream is much less accessible if you are in one of America\u2019s schools where they don\u2019t even tell you you could go into that field,\u201d Mr. Partovi said.", "Even so, he acknowledged some industry self-interest. \u201cIf you are running a tech company,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely hard to hire and retain engineers.\u201d", "Code.org is now one of the largest providers of free online coding lessons and more comprehensive computer science curriculums. It has also provided training workshops to more than 57,000 teachers, Mr. Partovi said.", "The rise of Code.org coincides with a larger tech-industry push to remake American primary and secondary schools with computers and learning apps, a market estimated to reach $21 billion by 2020.", "Last year, Apple rolled out a free app, called Swift Playgrounds, to teach basic coding in Swift, a programming language the company unveiled in 2014.", "Last month, Apple introduced a yearlong curriculum for high schools and community colleges to teach app design in Swift. Apple has also supported Code.org by hosting the group\u2019s popular Hour of Code events in its stores.", "Before Code.org emerged, the National Science Foundation, industry, and education experts worked for years to develop and spread computer science instruction in schools. In 2009, for instance, an engineer at Microsoft started a program called Teals (for Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) that places tech company volunteers in schools to help teach the subject.", "Then Mr. Partovi came along with the idea of using a viral video to spark mass demand for the courses.", "He began by persuading Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, to appear in a short film promoting coding to students. In its first week on YouTube, the video, called \u201cWhat Most Schools Don\u2019t Teach,\u201d racked up roughly nine million views. Within two weeks, Mr. Partovi said, about 20,000 teachers contacted him.", "Mr. Partovi compared Code.org\u2019s approach to those of start-ups like Airbnb and Uber. \u201cAirbnb is disrupting the travel space, but they don\u2019t own the hotels,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe are in a similar model, disrupting education. But we are not running the school and we don\u2019t hire the teachers.\u201d", "Mr. Partovi\u2019s elite connections didn\u2019t hurt.", "One day in early 2013, he bumped into his neighbor, Bradford L. Smith, then a senior Microsoft executive, in a driveway outside their homes in Bellevue, Wash. Mr. Smith had recently published a Microsoft report calling for a federal plan to better prepare students for careers in computer science and engineering.", "Mr. Partovi, for his part, was hoping to go viral with a message that coding could improve students\u2019 job prospects. Teaching skills that may lead to higher-paying jobs \u201cseems like the kind of idea that everyone in the country can get behind,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Partovi promptly invited Mr. Smith over to preview his celebrity coders video.", "Microsoft soon became Code.org\u2019s largest donor. Mr. Smith, now the president of Microsoft, compared their efforts to an educational initiative in the late 1950s. Back then, the Soviet Union had just won the space race by launching Sputnik, and the United States, in an effort to catch up, passed a law to finance physics and other science courses.", "\u201cWe think computer science is to the 21st century what physics was to the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Smith said.", "Together with local groups, Mr. Partovi said, Code.org and Microsoft have helped persuade 24 states to allow computer science to count toward math or science credits required for high school graduation. Along with groups like Black Girls Code, Girls Who Code and Latina Girls Code, Code.org has worked to make the subject accessible to a diverse group of students.", "But the movement has also supported legislation that could give companies enormous sway in public schools, starting with kindergarten, with little public awareness.", "Last year, Microsoft and Code.org helped push for a career-education bill in Idaho that, education researchers warned, could prioritize industry demands over students\u2019 interests. Among other things, they said, it could sway schools to teach specific computer programming languages that certain companies needed, rather than broader problem-solving approaches that students might use throughout their lives.", "\u201cIt gets very problematic when industry is deciding the content and direction of public education,\u201d said Jane Margolis, a senior researcher at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.", "The Idaho bill read, in part, \u201cIt is essential that efforts to increase computer science instruction, kindergarten through career, be driven by the needs of industry and be developed in partnership with industry.\u201d", "When a reporter apprised him of the bill\u2019s language, Mr. Smith of Microsoft seemed taken aback, saying he had not endorsed it. \u201cBroad public education should not be grounded first and foremost in the needs of any particular industry \u2014 or in the needs of industry as a whole,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Partovi noted that Code.org had opposed a \u201cmore extreme\u201d coding bill in Florida that would have required students to obtain industry certification. It has also opposed bills that would allow coding courses to count toward foreign-language credits in high schools, he said. Still, Mr. Partovi added, \u201cWe do think that tech companies have a role to play.\u201d", "The Idaho law took effect last year. One of its first results was a new program, developed with Oracle, to train public-school teachers how to teach students Java, Oracle\u2019s popular coding language. Other companies, including the chip maker Micron Technology, were invited to help develop computer science standards for Idaho schools.", "\u201cSome people will believe that industry is going to be driving our education system forward, and that is absolutely not the case,\u201d said Angela Hemingway, executive director of the Idaho STEM Action Center, which oversees the state\u2019s computer science education initiative. \u201cThey are collaborative partners.\u201d", "Certainly, many students across the country, and their parents, are clamoring for computer science. But what if some other subject \u2014 say, data science (which involves computing) \u2014 turns out to be more important and broadly applicable for students\u2019 lives, careers and communities?", "The clout behind computer science has all but obviated a wider debate about whether, to better prepare students, schools might introduce an array of new subjects. It has also overshadowed discussion about whether students would be better off if schools modified traditional math classes to increase the emphasis on fields like statistics.", "Mr. Smith of Microsoft said that tech companies and philanthropists were simply trying to give voice to an overlooked subject. \u201cWhat we really need is a national conversation about the broad array of intellectual disciplines that will be fundamental to the future of American students,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a broad array, not a single subject.\u201d", "Mr. Partovi concurred. \u201cWe have a lot of debate in this country about how to teach,\u201d he said, \u201cand not enough debate about what to teach.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/technology/apple-wwdc.html": ["\u2022 Apple gave a sneak peek of HomePod, a speaker, to rival Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home.

That company offers a wireless multispeaker system that allows users to listen to music throughout the home, similar to HomePod\u2019s ability to chain together speakers.", "The big question, though, is whether the intelligence inside Apple\u2019s speaker is good for anything beyond music. Apple was early to the voice game with Siri on the iPhone, but rivals have since lapped it \u2014 their voice-command devices are faster, they know more, and they are less annoying to use.

Mr. Kalanick has faced particular scrutiny in recent months as Uber has worked to overcome scandals, including employees detailing sexual harassment and systematic attempts to evade law enforcement personnel in some cities.", "The discussions by the nine-member board preceded a report from Mr. Holder\u2019s investigation, scheduled to be released on Tuesday. In recent months, Uber has fired more than 20 employees for infractions including sexual harassment and discrimination.", "\u201cThis starts at the very top,\u201d said Micah Alpern, a principal at A.

An outpouring of other cases followed, and Uber retained at least two law firms \u2014 including Covington & Burling \u2014 to look into the matters.", "Uber has since faced other problems, including an intellectual property dispute over self-driving car technology with Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google\u2019s parent company. Uber also is dealing with a Justice Department investigation into tools that it used to evade law enforcement personnel in cities where the authorities were trying to shut down its ride-hailing service. Many executives have left the company in recent months.", "Even so, Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position has for months seemed secure, especially because of how the company is structured. Uber\u2019s board follows a \u201cfounder-friendly\u201d governance structure, made popular in Silicon Valley by Google and Facebook. Seven of Uber\u2019s nine board members hold so-called super-voting shares, allowing them to have a stronger say in the board room. Four director seats are empty.", "Because Mr. Kalanick and a few allies hold a majority of those shares, his position has been safe \u2014 and would most likely remain so, even if he took a leave.", "Some Uber board members have expressed support for Mr. Kalanick. Garrett Camp and Ryan Graves, who have been with Uber since its early days, have long believed that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leadership was necessary to buck an aggressive incumbent taxi industry.

The firm\u2019s recommendations also include other sweeping changes at the company.", "Mr. Michael has not resigned, nor has he been asked to do so, according to a person familiar with the matter, but he was evaluating his options.", "This year, Uber\u2019s general counsel and some board members recommended that Mr. Michael take leave from his position at the company until the results of the Holder report were delivered, according to three people familiar with the matter.", "Mr. Michael, who has been at the center of three controversies at Uber, refused to step down, and Mr. Kalanick did not force him to do so.", "Mr. Michael did not respond to a request for comment.", "Employees and close watchers of the company worry that even the most damning conclusions of the Holder investigation could be ignored.", "\u201cAny response without complete buy-in from the top is a complete waste of time,\u201d said Stephen Hirschfeld, a partner at the labor law firm Hirschfeld Kraemer who regularly investigates corporate harassment issues. \u201cIt can have an even worse impact on company morale if people already know it\u2019s a total joke.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/technology/daily-report-apple-shifts-its-tech-priorities-to-reinvent-itself.html": ["Apple unveiled the HomePod, its version of a smart-connected speaker, at its annual developer conference on Monday.

What Apple does instead is reinvent products to be better than their predecessors.", "In this case, Farhad writes, Apple\u2019s reinvention with the HomePod will also mean something larger. Apple has been under scrutiny for some time about whether it can keep growing, given its large size and questions about what new products it can churn out to keep up with high expectations from investors. To meet those demands, Farhad says, Apple also needs to reinvent itself.", "Specifically, for Apple to make the HomePod work, it needs to prioritize certain technologies \u2014 artificial intelligence, cloud services and others \u2014 that it has typically kept on the back burner.

She saw an internet listing for Forefront in Manhattan, which predated the Brooklyn branch, and decided to give it a try. Though the website did not say the church was gay-affirming, there were no statements opposed to same-sex marriage, and a Google search of the pastors did not turn up any antigay remarks. At a brunch with some members, when the topic of same-sex marriage came up, Ms. Fontela waited for someone to say something that would force her to leave, she said. But everyone supported it, she said.", "\u201cI\u2019m sitting in this big table of Christians, and they\u2019re all completely for this thing that I\u2019ve been hiding and afraid of sharing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt got to my turn to chime in, and I could barely get the words out.

They\u2019ve got nothing but love, nothing but joy.

He estimated that several dozen evangelical churches have officially affirmed gay members in recent years, with many more moving in that direction. But the path was risky, he said. Mr. Pagitt warned Mr. Williams that churches that have taken it, including EastLake Community Church near Seattle and GracePointe Church near Nashville, lost up to 70 percent of their members and large shares of their revenues. \u201cIt\u2019s not the smartest growth model,\u201d Mr. Pagitt said.", "\u201cIn mainline churches, clergy tend to be more progressive than their congregations,\u201d Mr. Pagitt added. \u201cIn evangelical churches, clergy tend to be more conservative than the people in the pews.

Even people who are themselves O.K. with gay people in churches, something shocks them about their pastor changing. Having that conservative anchor is something they find very freeing.\u201d", "Go easy with the congregation, Mr. Pagitt told Mr. Williams. Make sure the people who were uncomfortable with the change did not feel indicted or unwelcome.", "When Mr. Williams told people that his father was transgender, reactions were divided.

The remaining company kept operations in automotive electronics and engine technologies such as fuel injectors and diesel components.", "Over the last few years, as autonomous driving technology began developing rapidly, Mr. Clark saw an opportunity to take Delphi in a new direction.", "Two years ago, Delphi also acquired Ottomatika, a Pittsburgh start-up developing automated-driving software, for $32 million.", "To preserve Control-Tec\u2019s freewheeling start-up culture, Delphi is allowing it to operate largely as an independent company. That includes one lounge where its engineers build Lego cars and occasionally play board games, and another where they share homemade beers.", "\u201cThe worst thing we could do is stifle the creativity, the energy they have,\u201d Mr. Clark said.", "Delphi has also partnered with Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli maker of camera systems that can spot obstacles and trigger braking.

A version of its luxury A8 model will be able to drive in stop-and-go freeway traffic up to 37 miles an hour while allowing drivers to pursue other tasks. The vehicle reportedly will notify drivers in emergencies, giving them eight to 10 seconds to intervene.", "Despite these limited advances, many automotive technologists remain uncertain about whether technology will ever be able to operate smoothly with a human driver who may be reading email or playing World of Warcraft.", "\u201cI believe that Level 3 autonomous driving is unsolvable,\u201d said John Leonard, a mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has collected detailed examples of driving situations that are currently impossible for state-of-the-art autonomous driving systems. \u201cThe notion that a human can be a reliable backup is a fallacy.\u201d", "Yet, despite widespread skepticism, the automotive industry is spending heavily on artificial intelligence technologies designed to make cars safer before they are fully autonomous.

They spent some of their days at a Metro station handing out fliers that urged strangers to offer rooms for rent, and in the evenings they fielded angry email complaints from a woman who had rented space in the basement. Despite the difficulties they faced that week, the huge demand for accommodations from people who had flocked to the inauguration convinced the group that the business they were hoping to create, which they called AirBed & Breakfast, would succeed if they persisted.", "Also in town for the festivities were two other hustling San Francisco startup jockeys, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp. They had used a website to find more comfortable accommodations, but on Inauguration Day they couldn\u2019t get a cab and had to sprint miles in the wicked cold to get to the mall on time. Camp had been trying to convince Kalanick to join him in a startup that would allow people to summon a car with the push of a button on an iPhone. The cab problems they had in Washington, which were similar to what they experienced in Paris a few months earlier, helped persuade him that the company, then called UberCab, had potential.", "At certain moments in history, a confluence of technological and social advances creates the opportunity for a new field of innovation. That was happening at the beginning of 2009. A few months earlier, a reluctant Steve Jobs had been persuaded by his colleagues to allow other companies to develop apps for the iPhone. That happened just as Google Maps and GPS and other tools were enabling more wondrous mobile-based services. In addition, cloud services such as Amazon\u2019s allowed startups to store and process large amounts of data without building their own infrastructure. The explosive growth of Facebook had encouraged people to create trusted identities and share things online. And as the 2008 financial crisis receded, the overcaffeinated venture capitalists of Silicon Valley became frenzied in the pursuit of new potential unicorns.", "The result was the blossoming of a type of economic activity with many kludgy labels \u2014 the \u201csharing\u201d or \u201cgig\u201d or \u201con-demand\u201d economy \u2014 that do not quite capture its disruptive and transformative nature. What companies such as Airbnb and Uber have done in the past decade is take the peer-to-peer sharing of digital content that flourished online, through sites like Napster and YouTube and Facebook, and apply it to our physical world, including cars and rooms and scores of other goods, tasks and services.", "Three new fast-paced narrative books written by seasoned business journalists (all of whom I have known since my days in the magazine world) detail the personal, financial and social aspects of the rise of these companies. \u201cWild Ride,\u201d by Adam Lashinsky, executive editor of Fortune, is a crisp and lively look at both the good and bad aspects of the rise of Uber and its C.E.O., Kalanick. His Fortune colleague Leigh Gallagher has similarly produced a colorful account of Airbnb and its C.E.O., Brian Chesky, \u201cThe Airbnb Story.\u201d And Brad Stone of Bloomberg News has intertwined the two tales in \u201cThe Upstarts,\u201d a richly researched and highly readable narrative that provides additional layers of insight by weaving in contrasting stories of competing companies that failed.", "In addition to these narratives, which are generally celebratory, it is also useful to read a darker counterpoint, Jonathan Taplin\u2019s \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d which argues that the radical libertarian ideology and monopolistic greed of many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs helped to decimate the livelihood of musicians and is now undermining the communal idealism of the early internet. \u201cThe original mission of the internet,\u201d he writes, \u201cwas hijacked by a small group of right-wing radicals to whom the ideas of democracy and decentralization were anathema.\u201d", "As happens on all of history\u2019s uncharted frontiers, the pioneers of the sharing economy have displayed an energizing mix of idealism and recklessness. Airbnb\u2019s founders came from a background of arts and design, rather than coding and engineering, which offered, contrary to the preaching of STEM education apostles, an advantage in a new economy built on connecting humans to other humans. As a child, Chesky used to visit the Norman Rockwell Museum near his home and spent hours sketching . \u201cOn a family trip to Florence one year,\u201d Gallagher reports, \u201che stood in front of the statue of David for eight hours, meticulously drawing it.\u201d Gebbia studied the violin, played jazz piano and originally planned to be a painter. They met at the Rhode Island School of Design, and they started their company when a big design conference came to San Francisco and there was a shortage of hotel rooms.", "Both managed sports teams while at R.I.S.D., and their tale illustrates the importance of team formation in innovation. Each brought different skills to their collaboration: Chesky evolved into a manager and chief executive, and Gebbia focused on product design. To complete the team, they brought in Gebbia\u2019s friend Blecharczyk, a computer science geek from Harvard who had started a software company when he was an undergraduate. \u201cNo one of us alone could have done this,\u201d Gebbia said. \u201cTwo of us alone couldn\u2019t have done this. But the combination of what Nate brings, what Brian brings, what I bring, put that together, and I think that\u2019s how we\u2019ve persevered through all the challenges.\u201d", "That perseverance \u2014 indeed an insane persistence \u2014 was another component of their success. Having come up with a wacky marketing idea of repackaging breakfast cereal during the 2008 conventions in boxes featuring Obama or John McCain, they lived on the leftover cereal during the subsequent lean year of struggling to keep the company going. They used their scarce resources to fly to New York on weekends to watch how the early adopters were using Airbnb and offering to photograph for free the apartments that were listed on their site.", "In the case of Uber, both co-founders were already somewhat successful serial entrepreneurs. The idea for an on-demand car service originated with Camp, but Kalanick shaped it. He was a maestro of collaborative brainstorming. Like Steve Jobs, he firmly believed that collaboration happened best when people got together in the flesh, and he turned his San Francisco apartment into a gathering place he called the Jam Pad. \u201cIt was a kind of entrepreneurial safe house, a place where like-minded obsessives could gather in front of a whiteboard and debate the intricacies of building internet companies,\u201d Stone writes.", "At first neither he nor Camp wanted to run Uber, so they set out to add a manager to their team. Kalanick sent out a tweet, \u201clooking 4 entrepreneurial product mgr.\u201d A 27-year-old midlevel product manager for General Electric in Chicago sent back the most lucrative Twitter reply in history: \u201cemail me :) graves.ryan@gmail.com.\u201d Graves was hired, and the stock he got is now worth more than $1.5 billion.", "Collaboration, however, can only go so far. It is also necessary to have an intense, driven leader with the visionary brilliance and obstinacy of a Steve Jobs. After finally signing up full-time as C.E.O. in 2010 and edging Ryan Graves down a notch, Kalanick became that.", "Kalanick focused on beating back regulators, from San Francisco to Paris, who insisted that if Uber cars were going to function like taxis they had to adhere to the rules and licensing requirements that cabbies faced. He fought with a righteousness mixed with self-interest that caused most city officials to think of him as arrogant (or another word that begins with \u201ca\u201d). It was a classic case of technological disruption where there is merit to both sides: It was unfair to medallion taxi owners to allow a competitor that did not have to play by the same rules, and yet for years city officials had become so beholden to and intimidated by the taxi industry that the medallion and licensing system had become a way to protect the interests of the owners rather than of passengers.", "With his scorched-earth approach to rules, Kalanick not only won battles for Uber but also for a techno-libertarianism that was contemptuous of most government attempts to regulate disruptive innovation. \u201cUber\u2019s lawyers and lobbyists, who had begged him, unsuccessfully, to seek compromise and testify with humility, began to whisper in reverent tones about a new political dictate that contravened all their old assumptions. Travis\u2019s Law,\u201d Stone writes. \u201cIt went something like this: Our product is so superior to the status quo that if we give people the opportunity to see it or try it, in any place in the world where government has to be at least somewhat responsive to the people, they will demand it and defend its right to exist.\u201d He was right.", "Only once did Kalanick show caution. In 2012, Uber was still using only professional drivers, mainly in town cars. A competitor started a service named Lyft that allowed drivers to use their personal cars, sometimes festooned with a playful pink mustache. Kalanick, uncharacteristically, argued to regulators that this should be illegal. But when he saw Lyft gaining traction, he reversed himself and responded with a ride-sharing service called UberX that quickly became dominant.", "A good litmus test to determine a person\u2019s basic ideological outlook is to ask about Uber\u2019s use of surge pricing. To some, it is a sensible way to match supply and demand by encouraging more drivers to come out and some consumers to find other transportation during periods of peak demand. Hotels and airlines use variable pricing all the time. To others it smacked of gouging, especially when there were huge spikes in prices during Superstorm Sandy and a hostage crisis in Sydney. Some of the problems could have been avoided with a bit more sensitivity \u2014 Uber would have been wise to kick in its own financial incentives for drivers during a major crisis \u2014 but that was not an instinct that came naturally to Kalanick. \u201cAnyone who whined about surge pricing, in his eyes, was too thick to understand the laws of supply and demand,\u201d Lashinsky writes. The hard-driving testosterone-fueled culture of Uber eventually caused problems. Earlier this month, the board approved top management changes, which included having Kalanick take an indefinite leave of absence, after an independent investigation found a culture of sexism and disrespect pervaded the company.", "Chesky has been more sensitive to public concerns, but the complex issues raised by Airbnb are as challenging, especially in places where the service is dominated not by easygoing millennials renting out a spare bedroom but instead by developers who buy up multiple houses and apartments to convert into short-term rentals. That can destroy residential neighborhoods and decimate the supply of affordable housing. To his credit, Chesky has tried to deal with these issues as well as the problem of racial discrimination that had infected the service. I watched in admiration earlier this year as Airbnb and my hometown, New Orleans, painstakingly negotiated a complex agreement, with enforcement and taxing mechanisms, specifying the number of days per year each type of place could be rented on Airbnb, with distinctions made by neighborhood and by whether a place was owner-occupied.", "The benefits that Airbnb and Uber pioneered go beyond convenience. They allow people to make human connections in an era that has become much more institutionalized in the decades since family-run bed-and-breakfasts began being replaced by standardized hotel chains. Stepping into someone\u2019s personal car or apartment forges a bond of trust and, in Gallagher\u2019s words, \u201cyields a little vote of confidence in our fellow humanity.\u201d A disconnected society becomes slightly more connected, not just digitally but also physically.", "Stone saw this firsthand while covering Chesky on a visit to Paris in November 2015 when the terrorist attack that killed 130 people occurred. \u201cI Ubered home that night to my Airbnb, near the Cath\u00e9drale Notre Dame de Paris,\u201d he writes. \u201cOnce back, I received a frantic phone call from my worried host, Ivan, whom I had never met in person (he was out of town and had left me the keys) but who wanted to make sure I was O.K. The next morning, he emailed: \u2018I was relieved to hear you yesterday on the phone. I hope you are well today despite the critical times in Paris.\u2019 He invited me to stay for as long as necessary until the travel situation in the city returned to normal.\u201d", "Uber and Airbnb, as embodied by their young billionaire leaders, represent, to their supporters, a radical expansion of freedom and a liberating empowerment of individuals to supply services as they please, without government interference. They have provided workers with added flexibility and sources of income, and they have created a new economy based on trust and earned reputations. Consumers rate their drivers and hosts, and they in turn rate us. When it works well it encourages all involved to be a bit nicer and restores the bonds of trust that have been fraying in our society.", "But as Stone points out, \u201cUber and Airbnb have also come to represent, at least to some, the overweening hubris of the techno-elite. Critics blame them for everything from destroying the basic rules of employment, exacerbating traffic and ruining peaceful neighborhoods to bringing unrestrained capitalism into liberal cities.\u201d On a deeper level, this new economy is disrupting not only old industries but also the entire concept of work. Instead of having \u201ca job,\u201d a growing number of people will, by desire or necessity, support themselves by juggling on-demand gigs. That presents an issue that goes well beyond the need for new regulations; it will require whole new ways to think about pensions, health care, benefits, sick leave, disability and retirement savings.", "What these books show is that societies must find ways to absorb these economic transformations, because it is futile to resist them. Peer-to-peer technology may be disruptive, and its effects can be messy. But it has an inexorable tendency to empower people to find \u2014 and produce \u2014 new offerings that improve our lives by reinforcing the most basic rule of entrepreneurship, which is to make something that people really want."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/opinion/sunday/liberals-in-strange-places.html": ["GUESS which state has the highest interest in impeaching President Trump.", "It\u2019s Montana.

Mr. Raskin\u2019s vision clashed with the loftier ideas of many at Apple, including Steve Jobs, who eventually took over the Mac team and steered it toward building the general-purpose personal computer that redefined the tech industry.

Chen wrote in his review, the Show is far from perfect; it has some bugs and you get the feeling that Amazon is still searching for a killer purpose for it.", "But these are quibbles. The Echo Show is a remarkable machine, not just for what it is now but for the way it clarifies Amazon\u2019s vision of the future of computing.

Amazon\u2019s business model, which depends on millions of households buying millions of goods, is uniquely suited to selling Echos at low prices, because Amazon is certain it can make money on the device from extra Amazon purchases. (The lowest-priced Echo, the Dot, sells for $50; the new Show, available to the public starting Wednesday, sells for $230, but you get $100 off if you buy two.)", "What\u2019s more, Amazon is far ahead. The Echo is much more useful than Google Home, which was released two years after Amazon\u2019s device, and the Apple HomePod speaker will not ship until the end of the year.

One is the Show\u2019s unusual and quietly innovative interface.", "Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices, told me that when the company was first designing the Show, it tried to use the same interface that it used for its tablet computers. But the team soon realized this didn\u2019t work. For one thing, the Echo Show is designed to be used just with your voice \u2014 the screen adds extra information, but you have to look at it only when you specifically ask for visual information (such as when you want a video). A standard mobile operating system, which is heavily visual, just wouldn\u2019t work.", "Another reason a tablet interface wouldn\u2019t have worked is that it felt too much like a computer, and one overriding design goal of the Echo and the Echo Show was to hide any relationship to anything computerlike.", "The Show\u2019s operating system, memory, storage and other specifications are completely hidden from users. The Echo does have a version of apps, known as \u201cskills,\u201d but they aren\u2019t anything like smartphone apps. You install them just by asking Alexa to enable them, and when you want to use one, you just name it. To watch a video, you just ask for the video \u2014 you don\u2019t load up a web browser or the YouTube app and then search for it.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a very different mental model than the traditional computer, smartphone or tablet, where you have to think of which app you want to use and then open it and then dive in,\u201d Mr. Limp wrote in an email.", "The Echo Show has one other advantage over smartphones and tablets: It\u2019s always there in the same spot.", "Your phone and tablet move around the house.

He is instead consumed with improving the present reality on the ground, especially as seen through a customer\u2019s eyes. The other thing to know about Mr. Bezos is that he is a committed experimentalist. His main way of deciding what Amazon should do next is to try stuff out, see what works, and do more of that.", "So the best way to think of this deal is to look at Whole Foods as a kind of guinea pig for Amazon \u2014 a pricey, organically sourced one, perhaps, but a guinea pig all the same.", "Amazon almost certainly doesn\u2019t know yet how exactly Whole Foods will fit into its long-term plans. You can expect it to make few dramatic changes to Whole Foods in the near future. Instead, Mr. Bezos and his team will most likely spend years meticulously analyzing and tinkering with how Whole Foods works. They will begin lots of experiments. When something works, they will do more of that, then more, and then even more. They may take over the world all the same \u2014 and, in the process, probably usher in big changes to large swaths of the economy, affecting everything from labor to urban planning \u2014 but they\u2019ll do it in ways we won\u2019t be able to predict now.", "\u201cI think they look at this as an opportunity to learn,\u201d said Venky Harinarayan, an early Amazon executive who later worked at Walmart, and who also ran a venture capital firm in which Mr. Bezos was a big investor. \u201cIt\u2019s an experiment for everyone \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone has figured out yet how to use a store to service online customers at massive scale. That\u2019s the experimental piece.\u201d", "In this light, I suspect that the Whole Foods deal starts less with a strategic end-goal and more with this insight: Shopping for food is broken. Both the in-store experience and the many attempts at online delivery \u2014 from Webvan to Instacart to Amazon\u2019s own service, Amazon Fresh \u2014 have failed to create the sort of seamless buying experience we enjoy with nonfood e-commerce.", "Shopping for food is time-consuming \u2014 about 16 percent of Americans spend nearly an hour shopping for food every weekend, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Grocers have also been relatively untouched by the many customer service features we\u2019ve come to associate with online shopping \u2014 for instance, customer reviews and recommendations.", "Supermarkets are also pretty labor-intensive. Consider checking out: You have to put all your stuff in a cart, and then someone else takes everything out to scan it, and then everything has to be carefully bagged for the trip home. And then someone else comes along to collect the carts. On top of all this, the margins are low and there is a shameful amount of waste \u2014 about 10 percent of the American food supply is wasted at the retail level, according to the Department of Agriculture.", "But online grocery delivery also isn\u2019t so great. Delivery services tend to be far more expensive than in-store shopping, and it\u2019s still not quite painless: You have to order ahead of time, you often have to deal with last-minute substitutions, and the whole process is still quite labor-intensive and wasteful. (Ask me about the many pounds of ice-filled plastic bags I have to dispose of every time I shop at Amazon Fresh.)", "And it\u2019s not just food. In a larger sense, all physical retail needs reimagining. Competition from online commerce has gutted malls and department stores, but no one in retail believes that all physical stores are going away. Lots of shoppers like stores, and lots of merchandise categories benefit from a physical presence: You want to try out the clothes you buy, or you want to compare the iPad\u2019s keyboard to Microsoft Surface\u2019s. So there\u2019s an opportunity for someone to figure out the future of the physical store \u2014 what it should sell, what it might look like, how it would integrate with online shopping and how it might become far friendlier than it is today.", "In a single purchase, then, Whole Foods gives Amazon a playground to try out lots of ideas. Should stores be laid out more like warehouses, to optimize for online delivery? Could you make grocery checkout lines invisible, the way Amazon is trying to do with its experimental grab-and-walk-out convenience store in Seattle? Or maybe there\u2019s some other innovation lurking in the deal that no one has thought of yet.", "But wait a second, isn\u2019t $13.4 billion a lot for an experiment?

New fatherhood had triggered a variety of symptoms in me, but none quite as unexpected as a rising thirst for some tradition to share. Because I\u2019m an immigrant short on hallowed rituals, I decided that fandom would be our foundational bond, the thing we could talk about in the idle or tense times to come. This might sound a bit cavemannish, sure, but I was raised in a house with a jock sister who wore gym shorts year round and was better than me at everything. Our father had been an accomplished rock climber back in Korea, and after my sister took to it at a young age, they shared in the enthusiastic technical lingo of pitches, falls and gear that makes climbers such tedious company.

But I used to be a Boston sports fan. My indoctrination came at John M. Tobin Elementary School in Cambridge, Mass., and lasted at least through 2004, when Jason Varitek jumped into Keith Foulke\u2019s arms and the Red Sox stormed the field as World Series champions for the first time since 1918. That night I ran out of my studio apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and into the streets. Outside a bar on Broadway, some Columbia students in Red Sox hats were singing \u2018\u2018Sweet Caroline.\u2019\u2019 I joined in and chanted \u2018\u2018Yankees suck\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but the long-awaited catharsis never followed.", "I\u2019m not fully sure why, but I suspect it had to do with the fact that I don\u2019t really look like a Red Sox fan. This wasn\u2019t a problem during childhood, but once I got to college in Maine, I began to realize that I was a curiosity among the prep-school kids with their very specific assumptions about where Red Sox fans come from. Over the next decade, my hesitation gave way to resentment, and I now loathe Boston fandom for its parochialism, the blathering on about history and the deep-seated belief that rooting for Tom Brady through all the team\u2019s scandals counts as an act of civil disobedience equal to that of those Massachusetts forebears who threw crates of tea into Boston Harbor.", "I want my daughter to live without that sort of angst. So even before she was big enough to fit into anything but a swaddling cloth, I bought her a onesie with the New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard\u2019s name and number on the back and decided, somewhat haphazardly, that we would root for the Mets. The reasoning was pretty simple: We live in New York, and I wanted her to feel the sense of belonging to a place that fandom can bring. I limited my search to baseball because it\u2019s the major sport that feels most local, but also because I have no lingering nostalgia for my early days as a Patriots and Celtics fan. And I wanted her to suffer through losing and disaster, because those things, when leavened with perspective, can be funny. When Syndergaard went on the disabled list just days after the onesie arrived in the mail, I thought we were off to a great start.", "But a couple of weeks later, I began to wonder why I was letting geography circumscribe my choices. Streaming video would enable my daughter to watch any team\u2019s games whenever she wanted, and online fan communities could provide a moderated alternative to the neighborhood bar. I was remembering how, a few years ago, a friend and Arsenal fan tried to find an English Premier League team for me to support. Because I have no opinions about England or even soccer, really, I told him that I would simply root for the club with the most diverse fan base. When he told me this was definitely Arsenal, though, I balked \u2014 everyone I know who roots for a soccer team roots for Arsenal.", "So I settled on the place I would most like to visit. Swansea City in Wales has a small surf scene with gentle waves for a kook like me, and a hasty, perhaps misleading Google search suggested to me that there were fewer incidents of racism among its fan base than those of other clubs. That is how I became a Swansea supporter for a very pleasant year, until I stopped caring about European soccer altogether. The idea of Swansea fandom was too abstract: I hold no real animus toward Cardiff City, Swansea\u2019s Welsh rival; my father did not sing Swansea supporter anthems with his father.

Why not just pick the team that has the best ballpark and that, thanks to Southern California\u2019s large Korean-American population and the team\u2019s 20-year history of signing Korean players, probably has the most fans who look like me and my daughter? I didn\u2019t want her to share the neuroses of minority Boston fans who cringe knowingly when Adam Jones, the black center fielder for the Orioles, gets called a racial slur from the Fenway stands, as happened this spring, and then cringe again when Boston fans and sportswriters come clumsily to their city\u2019s defense.", "My parents came to this country as immigrants with a vision of assimilation; our trips to Fenway to see the Red Sox were meant to make me comfortable in Ameri\u00adcan settings where we might be the only ones like us there \u2014 and also to normalize the sight of a Korean immigrant and his son cheering on the home team. Since then, I\u2019ve always been drawn to any subculture in which acceptance seems to require no more than buying a T-shirt (hence my Phish and Grateful Dead phases), and while much of my adulthood has been spent questioning my family\u2019s blind optimism about acculturation, I still believe sports are best enjoyed without too much thought.", "Choosing the Dodgers felt too considered and preachy.

I can imagine any number of happy accidents or family relocations that might lead to her rooting for the Cubs, Yankees, Mariners or whomever. If that happens, I\u2019ll follow her lead, because my own roots, both in fandom and in the country, are shallow.

Should she reject the Red Sox and become inspired by the United States women\u2019s national soccer team or the New York Liberty, or even if her interest in sports never goes beyond her own play, and I spend my afternoons driving her from practice to practice, her choices will become our family traditions, and, by extension, her birthright."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/technology/verizon-yahoo-deal-layoffs.html": ["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Verizon plans to lay off 2,100 people once it completes its acquisition of Yahoo\u2019s internet business on Tuesday.", "The sting will be soothed a bit for some of the Yahoo employees who lose their jobs: A 10 percent surge in the company\u2019s share price on Thursday enhanced the value of their accumulated stock compensation.", "The layoffs, which were described by a person briefed on Verizon\u2019s plans, represent about 15 percent of the work force at Yahoo and AOL, the Verizon unit with which it is to be combined.", "Yahoo, which had 8,600 full-time employees as of March 31, has already endured many rounds of cuts.

Yet brands still spend vast amounts of money in diverse ways to promote their products, and entire industries (like journalism) are struggling with how to replace traditional ad revenue. (In fact, in the past Essex has done consulting work for The New York Times Company.) These sea changes are the subject of Essex\u2019s highly opinionated treatise.

It was around the time \u201cMad Men\u201d went off the air and ad blocking started to enter into the public discourse.", "What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?", "That history repeats itself. We had invented the \u201ccorrect way\u201d to advertise, then took a 50-year detour pursuing a model that, in retrospect, seems kind of insane. For the past 50 years, we\u2019ve essentially pursued a model called \u201ccommand and control,\u201d which is to interrupt people in the rudest possible way with something they didn\u2019t ask to see, which is most exemplified by interrupting a TV program at a moment of great interest to show you a 30-second toilet-paper spot.", "But that model of adjacency is irrelevant and increasingly superfluous in a world in which there is so much content. Years ago, brands were making the thing. Not the thing that interrupts the thing. The old model was General Electric Theater; the new model is \u201cThe Lego Movie,\u201d and that\u2019s the same thing \u2014 making things people want to see, and adding value to their lives, as opposed to making something they actively don\u2019t want to see.", "In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?", "I wanted to write a book about the untold story of the dual origin story of aspirin and heroin. The company Bayer is famous for inventing aspirin in 1898, which is arguably one of the world\u2019s most beloved brands, and for good reason. But I was surprised to learn that just two weeks earlier, the same three guys who gave the world aspirin also created Bayer\u2019s other big brand, heroin, which was marketed for about eight years as the world\u2019s best cough medicine. This is a true story, and that seemed to me a perfect metaphor for advertising\u2019s ongoing tension between authenticity and artifice. But all the protagonists are dead, and Bayer won\u2019t talk about it.", "It was originally a book about unintended consequences and origin stories. So that theme never really changed. But the news kept staying ahead of the book, which had the unintended consequence of making it even more relevant than I intended. Fake news came along, and that seemed relevant to this rapidly shifting role of advertising in the culture. Google and Safari added ad-blocking software.

One of the reasons they did was because they were freed from the encumbrance of the commercial interruption. Devoid of advertising, television was elevated to arguably the world\u2019s most relevant mass art form. It changed 100 percent the way I think about advertising.

The occasion was a rechristening of the Arecibo Observatory, at the time the largest radio telescope in the world. The mammoth structure \u2014 an immense concrete-and-aluminum saucer as wide as the Eiffel Tower is tall, planted implausibly inside a limestone sinkhole in the middle of a mountainous jungle \u2014 had been upgraded to ensure its ability to survive the volatile hurricane season and to increase its precision tenfold.", "To celebrate the reopening, the astronomers who maintained the observatory decided to take the most sensitive device yet constructed for listening to the cosmos and transform it, briefly, into a machine for talking back. After a series of speeches, the assembled crowd sat in silence at the edge of the telescope while the public-address system blasted nearly three minutes of two-tone noise through the muggy afternoon heat. To the listeners, the pattern was indecipherable, but somehow the experience of hearing those two notes oscillating in the air moved many in the crowd to tears.", "That 168 seconds of noise, now known as the Arecibo message, was the brainchild of the astronomer Frank Drake, then the director of the organization that oversaw the Arecibo facility. The broadcast marked the first time a human being had intentionally transmitted a message targeting another solar system. The engineers had translated the missive into sound, so that the assembled group would have something to experience during the transmission. But its true medium was the silent, invisible pulse of radio waves, traveling at the speed of light.", "It seemed to most of the onlookers to be a hopeful act, if a largely symbolic one: a message in a bottle tossed into the sea of deep space. But within days, the Royal Astronomer of England, Martin Ryle, released a thunderous condemnation of Drake\u2019s stunt. By alerting the cosmos of our existence, Ryle wrote, we were risking catastrophe. Arguing that \u2018\u2018any creatures out there [might be] malevolent or hungry,\u2019\u2019 Ryle demanded that the International Astronomical Union denounce Drake\u2019s message and explicitly forbid any further communications. It was irresponsible, Ryle fumed, to tinker with interstellar outreach when such gestures, however noble their intentions, might lead to the destruction of all life on earth.", "Today, more than four decades later, we still do not know if Ryle\u2019s fears were warranted, because the Arecibo message is still eons away from its intended recipient, a cluster of roughly 300,000 stars known as M13. If you find yourself in the Northern Hemisphere this summer on a clear night, locate the Hercules constellation in the sky, 21 stars that form the image of a man, arms outstretched, perhaps kneeling. Imagine hurtling 250 trillion miles toward those stars. Though you would have traveled far outside our solar system, you would only be a tiny fraction of the way to M13. But if you were somehow able to turn on a ham radio receiver and tune it to 2,380 MHz, you might catch the message in flight: a long series of rhythmic pulses, 1,679 of them to be exact, with a clear, repetitive structure that would make them immediately detectable as a product of intelligent life.", "In its intended goal of communicating with life-forms outside our planet, the Arecibo message has surprisingly sparse company. Perhaps the most famous is housed aboard the Voyager 1 spacecraft \u2014 a gold-plated audiovisual disc, containing multilingual greetings and other evidence of human civilization \u2014 which slipped free of our solar system just a few years ago, traveling at a relatively sluggish 35,000 miles per hour. By contrast, at the end of the three-minute transmission of the Arecibo message, its initial pulses had already reached the orbit of Mars. The entire message took less than a day to leave the solar system.", "True, some signals emanating from human activity have traveled much farther than even Arecibo, thanks to the incidental leakage of radio and television broadcasts. This was a key plot point in Carl Sagan\u2019s novel, \u2018\u2018Contact,\u2019\u2019 which imagined an alien civilization detecting the existence of humans through early television broadcasts from the Berlin Olympic Games, including clips of Hitler speaking at the opening ceremony. Those grainy signals of Jesse Owens, and later of Howdy Doody and the McCarthy hearings, have ventured farther into space than the Arecibo pulses. But in the 40 years since Drake transmitted the message, just over a dozen intentional messages have been sent to the stars, most of them stunts of one fashion or another, including one broadcast of the Beatles\u2019 \u2018\u2018Across the Universe\u2019\u2019 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of that song\u2019s recording. (We can only hope the aliens, if they exist, receive that message before they find the Hitler footage.)", "In the age of radio telescopes, scientists have spent far more energy trying to look for signs that other life might exist than they have signaling the existence of our own. Drake himself is now more famous for inaugurating the modern search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) nearly 60 years ago, when he used a telescope in West Virginia to scan two stars for structured radio waves. Today the nonprofit SETI Institute oversees a network of telescopes and computers listening for signs of intelligence in deep space. A new SETI-like project called Breakthrough Listen, funded by a $100 million grant from the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, promises to radically increase our ability to detect signs of intelligent life. As a species, we are gathered around more interstellar mailboxes than ever before, waiting eagerly for a letter to arrive. But we have, until recently, shown little interest in sending our own.", "Now this taciturn phase may be coming to an end, if a growing multidisciplinary group of scientists and amateur space enthusiasts have their way. A newly formed group known as METI (Messaging Extra Terrestrial Intelligence), led by the former SETI scientist Douglas Vakoch, is planning an ongoing series of messages to begin in 2018. And Milner\u2019s Breakthrough Listen endeavor has also promised to support a \u2018\u2018Breakthrough Message\u2019\u2019 companion project, including an open competition to design the messages that we will transmit to the stars. But as messaging schemes proliferate, they have been met with resistance. The intellectual descendants of Martin Ryle include luminaries like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, and they caution that an assumption of interstellar friendship is the wrong way to approach the question of extraterrestrial life. They argue that an advanced alien civilization might well respond to our interstellar greetings with the same graciousness that Cort\u00e9s showed the Aztecs, making silence the more prudent option.", "If you believe that these broadcasts have a plausible chance of making contact with an alien intelligence, the choice to send them must rank as one of the most important decisions we will ever make as a species. Are we going to be galactic introverts, huddled behind the door and merely listening for signs of life outside? Or are we going to be extroverts, conversation-starters? And if it\u2019s the latter, what should we say?", "Amid the decommissioned splendor of Fort Mason, on the northern edge of San Francisco, sits a bar and event space called the Interval. It\u2019s run by the Long Now Foundation, an organization founded by Stewart Brand and Brian Eno, among others, to cultivate truly long-term thinking. The group is perhaps most famous for its plan to build a clock that will successfully keep time for 10,000 years. Long Now says the San Francisco space is designed to push the mind away from our attention-sapping present, and this is apparent from the 10,000-year clock prototypes to the menu of \u2018\u2018extinct\u2019\u2019 cocktails.", "The Interval seemed like a fitting backdrop for my first meeting with Doug Vakoch, in part because Long Now has been advising METI on its message plans and in part because the whole concept of sending interstellar messages is the epitome of long-term decision-making. The choice to send a message into space is one that may well not generate a meaningful outcome for a thousand years, or a hundred thousand. It is hard to imagine any decision confronting humanity that has a longer time horizon.", "As Vakoch and I settled into a booth, I asked him how he found his way to his current vocation. \u2018\u2018I liked science when I was a kid, but I couldn\u2019t make up my mind which science,\u2019\u2019 he told me. Eventually, he found out about a burgeoning new field of study known as exobiology, or sometimes astrobiology, that examined the possible forms life could take on other planets. The field was speculative by nature: After all, its researchers had no actual specimens to study. To imagine other forms of life in the universe, exobiologists had to be versed in the astrophysics of stars and planets; the chemical reactions that could capture and store energy in these speculative organisms; the climate science that explains the weather systems on potentially life-compatible planets; the biological forms that might evolve in those different environments. With exobiology, Vakoch realized, he didn\u2019t have to settle on one discipline: \u2018\u2018When you think about life outside the earth, you get to dabble in all of them.\u2019\u2019", "As early as high school, Vakoch began thinking about how you might communicate with an organism that had evolved on another planet, the animating question of a relatively obscure subfield of exobiology known as exosemiotics. By the time Vakoch reached high school in the 1970s, radio astronomy had advanced far enough to turn exosemiotics from a glorified thought experiment into something slightly more practical. Vakoch did a science-fair project on interstellar languages, and he continued to follow the field during his college years, even as he was studying comparative religion at Carleton College in Minnesota. \u2018\u2018The issue that really hit me early on, and that has stayed with me, is just the challenge of creating a message that would be understandable,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says. Hedging his bets, he pursued a graduate degree in clinical psychology, thinking it might help him better understand the mind of some unknown organism across the universe. If the exosemiotics passion turned out to be a dead end professionally, he figured that he could always retreat back to a more traditional career path as a psychologist.", "During Vakoch\u2019s graduate years, SETI was transforming itself from a NASA program sustained by government funding to an independent nonprofit organization, supported in part by the new fortunes of the tech sector. Vakoch moved to California and joined SETI in 1999. In the years that followed, Vakoch and other scientists involved in the program grew increasingly vocal in their argument for sending messages as well as listening for them. The \u2018\u2018passive\u2019\u2019 approach was essential, they argued, but an \u2018\u2018active\u2019\u2019 SETI \u2014 one targeting nearby star systems with high-powered radio signals \u2014 would increase the odds of contact. Concerned that embracing an active approach would imperil its funding, the SETI board resisted Vakoch\u2019s efforts. Eventually Vakoch decided to form his own international organization, METI, with a multidisciplinary team that includes the former NASA chief historian Steven J. Dick, the French science historian Florence Raulin Cerceau, the Indian ecologist Abhik Gupta and the Canadian anthropologist Jerome H. Barkow.", "The newfound interest in messaging has been piqued in large part by an explosion of newly discovered planets. We now know that the universe is teeming with planets occupying what exobiologists call \u2018\u2018the Goldilocks zone\u2019\u2019: not too hot and not too cold, with \u2018\u2018just right\u2019\u2019 surface temperatures capable of supporting liquid water. At the start of Drake\u2019s career in the 1950s, not a single planet outside our solar system had been observed. Today we can target a long list of potential Goldilocks-zone planets, not just distant clusters of stars. \u2018\u2018Now we know that virtually all stars have planets,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says, adding that, of these stars, \u2018\u2018maybe one out of five have potentially habitable planets. So there\u2019s a lot of real estate that could be inhabited.\u2019\u2019", "When Frank Drake and Carl Sagan first began thinking about message construction in the 1960s, their approach was genuinely equivalent to the proverbial message in a bottle. Now, we may not know the exact addresses of planets where life is likely, but we have identified many promising ZIP codes. The recent discovery of the Trappist-1 planets, three of which are potentially habitable, triggered such excitement in part because those planets were, relatively speaking, so close to home: just 40 light-years from Earth. If the Arecibo message does somehow find its way to an advanced civilization in M13, word would not come back for at least 50,000 years. But a targeted message sent to Trappist-1 could generate a reply before the end of the century.", "Frank Drake is now 87 and lives with his wife in a house nestled in an old-growth redwood forest, at the end of a narrow, winding road in the hills near Santa Cruz. His circular driveway wraps around the trunk of a redwood bigger than a pool table. As I left my car, I found myself thinking again of the long now: a man who sends messages with a potential life span of 50,000 years, living among trees that first took root a millennium ago.", "Drake has been retired for more than a decade, but when I asked him about the Arecibo message, his face lit up at the memory. \u2018\u2018We had just finished a very big construction project at Arecibo, and I was director then, and so they said, \u2018Can you please arrange a big ceremony?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he recalled. \u2018\u2018We had to have some kind of eye-catching event for this ceremony. What could we do that would be spectacular? We could send a message!\u2019\u2019", "But how can you send a message to a life-form that may or may not exist and that you know nothing at all about, other than the fact that it evolved somewhere in the Milky Way? You need to start by explaining how the message is supposed to be read, which is known in exosemiotics as the \u2018\u2018primer.\u2019\u2019 You don\u2019t need a primer on Earth: You point to a cow, and you say, \u2018\u2018Cow.\u2019\u2019 The plaques that NASA sent into space with Pioneer and Voyager had the advantage of being physical objects that could convey visual information, which at least enables you to connect words with images of the objects they refer to. In other words, you draw a cow and then put the word \u2018\u2018cow\u2019\u2019 next to the drawing and slowly, with enough pointing, a language comes into view. But physical objects can\u2019t be moved fast enough to get to a potential recipient in useful time scales. You need electromagnetic waves if you want to reach across the Milky Way.", "But how do you point to something with a radio wave? Even if you figured out a way to somehow point to a cow with electromagnetic signals, the aliens aren\u2019t going to have cows in their world, which means the reference will most likely be lost on them. Instead, you need to think hard about the things that our hypothetical friends in the Trappist-1 system will have in common with us. If their civilization is advanced enough to recognize structured data in radio waves, they must share many of our scientific and technological concepts. If they are hearing our message, that means they are capable of parsing structured disturbances in the electromagnetic spectrum, which means they understand the electromagnetic spectrum in some meaningful way.", "The trick, then, is just getting the conversation started. Drake figured that he could count on intelligent aliens possessing the concept of simple numbers: one, three, 10, etc. And if they have numbers, then they will also very likely have the rest of what we know as basic math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Furthermore, Drake reasoned, if they have multiplication and division, then they are likely to understand the concept of prime numbers \u2014 the group of numbers that are divisible only by themselves and one. (In \u2018\u2018Contact,\u2019\u2019 the intercepted alien message begins with a long string of primes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on.) Many objects in space, like pulsars, send out radio signals with a certain periodicity: flashes of electromagnetic activity that switch on and off at regular rates. Primes, however, are a telltale sign of intelligent life. \u2018\u2018Nature never uses prime numbers,\u2019\u2019 Drake says. \u2018\u2018But mathematicians do.\u2019\u2019", "Drake\u2019s Arecibo message drew upon a close relative of the prime numbers to construct its message. He chose to send exactly 1,679 pulses, because 1,679 is a semiprime number: a number that can be formed only by multiplying two prime numbers together, in this case 73 and 23. Drake used that mathematical quirk to turn his pulses of electromagnetic energy into a visual system. To simplify his approach, imagine I send you a message consisting of 10 X\u2019s and 5 O\u2019s: XOXOXXXXOXXOXOX. You notice that the number 15 is a semi-prime number, and so you organize the symbols in a 3-by-5 grid and leave the O\u2019s as blank spaces. The result is this:", "If you were an English speaker, you might just recognize a greeting in that message, the word \u2018\u2018HI\u2019\u2019 mapped out using only a binary language of on-and-off states.", "Drake took the same approach, only using a much larger semiprime, which gave him a 23-by-73 grid to send a more complicated message. Because his imagined correspondents in M13 were not likely to understand any human language, he filled the grid with a mix of mathematical and visual referents. The top of the grid counted from one to 10 in binary code \u2014 effectively announcing to the aliens that numbers will be represented using these symbols.", "Having established a way of counting, Drake then moved to connect the concept of numbers to some reference that the citizens of M13 would likely share with us. For this step, he encoded the atomic numbers for five elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorous, the building blocks of DNA. Other parts of the message were more visually oriented. Drake used the on-off pulses of the radio signal to \u2018\u2018draw\u2019\u2019 a pixelated image of a human body. He also included a sketch of our solar system and of the Arecibo telescope itself. The message said, in effect: This is how we count; this is what we are made of; this is where we came from; this is what we look like; and this is the technology we are using to send this message to you.", "As inventive as Drake\u2019s exosemiotics were in 1974, the Arecibo message was ultimately more of a proof-of-concept than a genuine attempt to make contact, as Drake himself is the first to admit. For starters, the 25,000 light-years that separate us from M13 raise a legitimate question about whether humans will even be around \u2014 or recognizably human \u2014 by the time a message comes back. The choice of where to send it was almost entirely haphazard. The METI project intends to improve on the Arecibo model by directly targeting nearby Goldilocks-zone planets.", "One of the most recent planets added to that list orbits the star Gliese 411, a red dwarf located eight light-years away from Earth. On a spring evening in the Oakland hills, our own sun putting on a spectacular display as it slowly set over the Golden Gate Bridge, Vakoch and I met at one of the observatories at the Chabot Space and Science Center to take a peek at Gliese 411. A half moon overhead reduced our visibility but not so much that I couldn\u2019t make out the faint tangerine glimmer of the star, a single blurred point of light that had traveled nearly 50 trillion miles across the universe to land on my retina. Even with the power of the Oakland telescope, there was no way to spot a planet orbiting the red dwarf. But in February of this year, a team of researchers using the Keck I telescope at the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii announced that they had detected a \u2018\u2018super-earth\u2019\u2019 in orbit around Gliese, a rocky and hot planet larger than our own.", "The METI group aims to improve on the Arecibo message not just by targeting specific planets, like that super-earth orbiting Gliese, but also by rethinking the nature of the message itself. \u2018\u2018Drake\u2019s original design plays into the bias that vision is universal among intelligent life,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch told me. Visual diagrams \u2014 whether formed through semiprime grids or engraved on plaques \u2014 seem like a compelling way to encode information to us because humans happen to have evolved an unusually acute sense of vision. But perhaps the aliens followed a different evolutionary path and found their way to a technologically advanced civilization with an intelligence that was rooted in some other sense: hearing, for example, or some other way of perceiving the world around them for which there is no earthly equivalent.", "Like so much of the SETI/METI debate, the question of visual messaging quickly spirals out into a deeper meditation, in this instance on the connection between intelligence and visual acuity. It is no accident that eyes developed independently so many times over the course of evolution on Earth, given the fact that light conveys information faster than any other conduit. That transmission-speed advantage would presumably apply on other planets in the Goldilocks zone, even if they happened to be on the other side of the Milky Way, and so it seems plausible that intelligent creatures would evolve some sort of visual system as well.", "But even more universal than sight would be the experience of time. Hans Freudenthal\u2019s \u2018\u2018Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse,\u2019\u2019 a seminal book of exosemiotics published more than a half-century ago, relied heavily on temporal cues in its primer stage. Vakoch and his collaborators have been working with Freudenthal\u2019s language in their early drafts for the message. In Lincos, duration is used as a key building block. A pulse that lasts for a certain stretch (say, in human terms, one second) is followed by a sequence of pulses that signify the \u2018\u2018word\u2019\u2019 for one; a pulse that lasts for six seconds is followed by the word for six. The words for basic math properties can be conveyed by combining pulses of different lengths. You might demonstrate the property of addition by sending the word for \u2018\u2018three\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018six\u2019\u2019 and then sending a pulse that lasts for nine seconds. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a way of being able to point at objects when you don\u2019t have anything right in front of you,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch explains.", "Other messaging enthusiasts think we needn\u2019t bother worrying about primers and common referents. \u2018\u2018Forget about sending mathematical relationships, the value of pi, prime numbers or the Fibonacci series,\u2019\u2019 the senior SETI astronomer, Seth Shostak, argued in a 2009 book. \u2018\u2018No, if we want to broadcast a message from Earth, I propose that we just feed the Google servers into the transmitter. Send the aliens the World Wide Web. It would take half a year or less to transmit this in the microwave; using infrared lasers shortens the transmit time to no more than two days.\u2019\u2019 Shostak believes that the sheer magnitude of the transmitted data would enable the aliens to decipher it. There is some precedent for this in the history of archaeologists studying dead languages: The hardest code to crack is one with only a few fragments.", "Sending all of Google would be a logical continuation of Drake\u2019s 1974 message, in terms of content if not encoding. \u2018\u2018The thing about the Arecibo message is that, in a sense, it\u2019s brief but its intent is encyclopedic,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch told me as we waited for the sky to darken in the Oakland hills. \u2018\u2018One of the things that we are exploring for our transmission is the opposite extreme. Rather than being encyclopedic, being selective. Instead of this huge digital data dive, trying to do something elegant. Part of that is thinking about what are the most fundamental concepts we need.\u2019\u2019 There is something provocative about the question Vakoch is wrestling with here: Of all the many manifestations of our achievements as a species, what\u2019s the simplest message we can create that will signal that we\u2019re interesting, worthy of an interstellar reply?", "But to METI\u2019s critics, what he should be worrying about instead is the form that the reply might take: a death ray, or an occupying army.", "Before Doug Vakoch had even filed the papers to form the METI nonprofit organization in July 2015, a dozen or so science-and-tech luminaries, including SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk, signed a statement categorically opposing the project, at least without extensive further discussion, on a planetary scale. \u2018\u2018Intentionally signaling other civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy,\u2019\u2019 the statement argued, \u2018\u2018raises concerns from all the people of Earth, about both the message and the consequences of contact. A worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent.\u2019\u2019", "One signatory to that statement was the astronomer and science-fiction author David Brin, who has been carrying on a spirited but collegial series of debates with Vakoch over the wisdom of his project. \u2018\u2018I just don\u2019t think anybody should give our children a fait accompli based on blithe assumptions and assertions that have been untested and not subjected to critical peer review,\u2019\u2019 he told me over a Skype call from his home office in Southern California. \u2018\u2018If you are going to do something that is going to change some of the fundamental observable parameters of our solar system, then how about an environmental-impact statement?\u2019\u2019", "The anti-METI movement is predicated on a grim statistical likelihood: If we do ever manage to make contact with another intelligent life-form, then almost by definition, our new pen pals will be far more advanced than we are. The best way to understand this is to consider, on a percentage basis, just how young our own high-tech civilization actually is. We have been sending structured radio signals from Earth for only the last 100 years. If the universe were exactly 14 billion years old, then it would have taken 13,999,999,900 years for radio communication to be harnessed on our planet. The odds that our message would reach a society that had been tinkering with radio for a shorter, or even similar, period of time would be staggeringly long. Imagine another planet that deviates from our timetable by just a tenth of 1 percent: If they are more advanced than us, then they will have been using radio (and successor technologies) for 14 million years. Of course, depending on where they live in the universe, their signals might take millions of years to reach us. But even if you factor in that transmission lag, if we pick up a signal from another galaxy, we will almost certainly find ourselves in conversation with a more advanced civilization.", "It is this asymmetry that has convinced so many future-minded thinkers that METI is a bad idea. The history of colonialism here on Earth weighs particularly heavy on the imaginations of the METI critics. Stephen Hawking, for instance, made this observation in a 2010 documentary series: \u2018\u2018If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\u2019t turn out well for the Native Americans.\u2019\u2019 David Brin echoes the Hawking critique: \u2018\u2018Every single case we know of a more technologically advanced culture contacting a less technologically advanced culture resulted at least in pain.\u2019\u2019", "METI proponents counter the critics with two main arguments. The first is essentially that the horse has already left the barn: Given that we have been \u2018\u2018leaking\u2019\u2019 radio waves in the form of \u2018\u2018Leave It to Beaver\u2019\u2019 and the nightly news for decades, and given that other civilizations are likely to be far more advanced than we are, and thus capable of detecting even weak signals, then it seems likely that we are already visible to extraterrestrials. In other words, they know we\u2019re here, but they haven\u2019t considered us to be worthy of conversation yet. \u2018\u2018Maybe in fact there are a lot more civilizations out there, and even nearby planets are populated, but they\u2019re simply observing us,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch argues. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s as if we are in some galactic zoo, and if they\u2019ve been watching us, it\u2019s like watching zebras talking to one another. But what if one of those zebras suddenly turns toward you and with its hooves starts scratching out the prime numbers. You\u2019d relate to that zebra differently!\u2019\u2019", "Brin thinks that argument dangerously underestimates the difference between a high-power, targeted METI transmission and the passive leakage of media signals, which are far more difficult to detect. \u2018\u2018Think about it this way: If you want to communicate with a Boy Scout camp on the other side of the lake, you could kneel down at the end of the lake and slap the water in Morse code,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018And if they are spectacularly technologically advanced Boy Scouts who happened also to be looking your way, they might build instruments that would be able to parse out your Morse code. But then you whip out your laser-pointer and point it at their dock. That is exactly the order of magnitude difference between picking up [reruns of] \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019 from the 1980s, when we were at our noisiest, and what these guys want to do.\u2019\u2019", "METI defenders also argue that the threat of some Klingon-style invasion is implausible, given the distances involved. If, in fact, advanced civilizations were capable of zipping around the galaxy at the speed of light, we would have already encountered them. The much more likely situation is that only communications can travel that fast, and so a malevolent presence on some distant planet will only be able to send us hate mail. But critics think that sense of security is unwarranted. Writing in Scientific American, the former chairman of SETI, John Gertz, argued that \u2018\u2018a civilization with malign intent that is only modestly more advanced than we are might be able to annihilate Earth with ease by means of a small projectile filled with a self-replicating toxin or nano gray goo; a kinetic missile traveling at an appreciable percentage of the speed of light; or weaponry beyond our imagination.\u2019\u2019", "Brin looks to our own technological progress as a sign of where a more advanced civilization might be in terms of interstellar combat: \u2018\u2018It is possible that within just 50 years, we could create an antimatter rocket that could propel a substantial pellet of several kilograms, at half the speed of light at times to intersect with the orbit of a planet within 10 light-years of us.\u2019\u2019 Even a few kilograms colliding at that speed would produce an explosion much greater than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki detonations combined. \u2018\u2018And if we could do that in 50 years, imagine what anybody else could do, completely obeying Einstein and the laws of physics.\u2019\u2019", "Interestingly, Frank Drake himself is not a supporter of the METI efforts, though he does not share Hawking and Musk\u2019s fear of interstellar conquistadors. \u2018\u2018We send messages all the time, free of charge,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a big shell out there now 80 light-years around us. A civilization only a little more advanced than we are can pick those things up. So the point is we are already sending copious amounts of information.\u2019\u2019 Drake believes that any other advanced civilization out there must be doing the same, so scientists like Vakoch should devote themselves to picking up on that chatter instead of trying to talk back. METI will consume resources, Drake says, that would be \u2018\u2018better spent listening and not sending.\u2019\u2019", "METI critics, of course, might be right about the frightening sophistication of these other, presumably older civilizations but wrong about the likely nature of their response. Yes, they could be capable of sending projectiles across the galaxy at a quarter of the speed of light. But their longevity would also suggest that they have figured out how to avoid self-destruction on a planetary scale. As Steven Pinker has argued, human beings have become steadily less violent over the last 500 years; per capita deaths from military conflict are most likely at an all-time low. Could this be a recurring pattern throughout the universe, played out on much longer time scales: the older a civilization gets, the less warlike it becomes? In which case, if we do get a message to extraterrestrials, then perhaps they really will come in peace.", "These sorts of questions inevitably circle back to the two foundational thought experiments that SETI and METI are predicated upon: the Fermi Paradox and the Drake Equation. The paradox, first formulated by the Italian physicist and Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi, begins with the assumption that the universe contains an unthinkably large number of stars, with a significant percentage of them orbited by planets in the Goldilocks zone. If intelligent life arises on even a small fraction of those planets, then the universe should be teeming with advanced civilizations. And yet to date, we have seen no evidence of those civilizations, even after several decades of scanning the skies through SETI searches. Fermi\u2019s question, apparently raised during a lunch conversation at Los Alamos in the early 1950s, was a simple one: \u2018\u2018Where is everybody?\u2019\u2019", "The Drake Equation is an attempt to answer that question. The equation dates back to one of the great academic retreats in the history of scholarship: a 1961 meeting at the Green Bank observatory in West Virginia, which included Frank Drake, a 26-year-old Carl Sagan and the dolphin researcher (and later psychedelic explorer) John Lilly. During the session, Drake shared his musings on the Fermi Paradox, formulated as an equation. If we start scanning the cosmos for signs of intelligent life, Drake asked, how likely are we to actually detect something? The equation didn\u2019t generate a clear answer, because almost all the variables were unknown at the time and continue to be largely unknown a half-century later. But the equation had a clarifying effect, nonetheless. In mathematical form, it looks like this:", "N represents the number of extant, communicative civilizations in the Milky Way. The initial variable R* corresponds to the rate of star formation in the galaxy, effectively giving you the total number of potential suns that could support life. The remaining variables then serve as a kind of nested sequence of filters: Given the number of stars in the Milky Way, what fraction of those have planets, and how many of those have an environment that can support life? On those potentially hospitable planets, how often does life itself actually emerge, and what fraction of that life evolves into intelligent life, and what fraction of that life eventually leads to a civilization\u2019s transmitting detectable signals into space? At the end of his equation, Drake placed the crucial variable L, which is the average length of time during which those civilizations emit those signals.", "What makes the Drake Equation so mesmerizing is in part the way it forces the mind to yoke together so many different intellectual disciplines in a single framework. As you move from left to right in the equation, you shift from astrophysics, to the biochemistry of life, to evolutionary theory, to cognitive science, all the way to theories of technological development. Your guess about each value in the Drake Equation winds up revealing a whole worldview: Perhaps you think life is rare, but when it does emerge, intelligent life usually follows; or perhaps you think microbial life is ubiquitous throughout the cosmos, but more complex organisms almost never form. The equation is notoriously vulnerable to very different outcomes, depending on the numbers you assign to each variable.", "The most provocative value is the last one: L, the average life span of a signal-transmitting civilization. You don\u2019t have to be a Pollyanna to defend a relatively high L value. All you need is to believe that it is possible for civilizations to become fundamentally self-sustaining and survive for millions of years. Even if one in a thousand intelligent life-forms in space generates a million-year civilization, the value of L increases meaningfully. But if your L-value is low, that implies a further question: What is keeping it low? Do technological civilizations keep flickering on and off in the Milky Way, like so many fireflies in space? Do they run out of resources? Do they blow themselves up?", "Since Drake first sketched out the equation in 1961, two fundamental developments have reshaped our understanding of the problem. First, the numbers on the left-hand side of the equation (representing the amount of stars with habitable planets) have increased by several orders of magnitude. And second, we have been listening for signals for decades and heard nothing. As Brin puts it: \u2018\u2018Something is keeping the Drake Equation small. And the difference between all the people in the SETI debates is not whether that\u2019s true, but where in the Drake panoply the fault lies.\u2019\u2019", "If the left-hand values keep getting bigger and bigger, the question is which variables on the right-hand side are the filters. As Brin puts it, we want the filter to be behind us, not the one variable, L, that still lies ahead of us. We want the emergence of intelligent life to be astonishingly rare; if the opposite is true, and intelligent life is abundant in the Milky Way, then L values might be low, perhaps measured in centuries and not even millenniums. In that case, the adoption of a technologically advanced lifestyle might be effectively simultaneous with extinction. First you invent radio, then you invent technologies capable of destroying all life on your planet and shortly thereafter you push the button and your civilization goes dark.", "The L-value question explains why so many of METI\u2019s opponents \u2014 like Musk and Hawking \u2014 are also concerned with the threat of extinction-level events triggered by other potential threats: superintelligent computers, runaway nanobots, nuclear weapons, asteroids. In a low L-value universe, planet-wide annihilation is an imminent possibility. Even if a small fraction of alien civilizations out there would be inclined to shoot a two-kilogram pellet toward us at half the speed of light, is it worth sending a message if there\u2019s even the slightest chance that the reply could result in the destruction of all life on earth?", "Other, more benign, explanations for the Fermi Paradox exist. Drake himself is pessimistic about the L value, but not for dystopian reasons. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s because we\u2019re getting better at technology,\u2019\u2019 he says. The modern descendants of the TV and radio towers that inadvertently sent Elvis to the stars are far more efficient in terms of the power they use, which means the \u2018\u2018leaked\u2019\u2019 signals emanating from Earth are far fainter than they were in the 1950s. In fact, we increasingly share information via fiber optics and other terrestrial conduits that have zero leakage outside our atmosphere. Perhaps technologically advanced societies do flicker on and off like fireflies, but it\u2019s not a sign that they\u2019re self-destructive; it\u2019s just a sign that they got cable.", "But to some METI critics, even a less-apocalyptic interpretation of the Fermi Paradox still suggests caution. Perhaps advanced civilizations tend to reach a point at which they decide, for some unknown reason, that it is in their collective best interest not to transmit any detectable signal to their neighbors in the Milky Way. \u2018\u2018That\u2019s the other answer for the Fermi Paradox,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says with a smile. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a Stephen Hawking on every planet, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t hear from them.\u2019\u2019", "In his California home among the redwoods, Frank Drake has a version of the Arecibo message visually encoded in a very different format: not a series of radio-wave pulses but as a stained-glass window in his living room. A grid of pixels on a cerulean blue background, it almost resembles a game of Space Invaders. Stained glass is an appropriate medium, given the nature of the message: an offering dispatched to unknown beings residing somewhere in the sky.", "There is something about the METI question that forces the mind to stretch beyond its usual limits. You have to imagine some radically different form of intelligence, using only your human intelligence. You have to imagine time scales on which a decision made in 2017 might trigger momentous consequences 10,000 years from now. The sheer magnitude of those consequences challenges our usual measures of cause and effect. Whether you believe that the aliens are likely to be warriors or Zen masters, if you think that METI has a reasonable chance of making contact with another intelligent organism somewhere in the Milky Way, then you have to accept that this small group of astronomers and science-fiction authors and billionaire patrons debating semi-prime numbers and the ubiquity of visual intelligence may in fact be wrestling with a decision that could prove to be the most transformative one in the history of human civilization.", "All of which takes us back to a much more down-to-earth, but no less challenging, question: Who gets to decide? After many years of debate, the SETI community established an agreed-\u00adupon procedure that scientists and government agencies should follow in the event that the SETI searches actually stumble upon an intelligible signal from space. The protocols specifically ordain that \u2018\u2018no response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place.\u2019\u2019 But an equivalent set of guidelines does not yet exist to govern our own interstellar outreach.", "One of the most thoughtful participants in the METI debate, Kathryn Denning, an anthropologist at York University in Toronto, has argued that our decisions about extraterrestrial contact are ultimately more political than scientific. \u2018\u2018If I had to take a position, I\u2019d say that broad consultation regarding METI is essential, and so I greatly respect the efforts in that direction,\u2019\u2019 Denning says. \u2018\u2018But no matter how much consultation there is, it\u2019s inevitable that there will be significant disagreement about the advisability of transmitting, and I don\u2019t think this is the sort of thing where a simple majority vote or even supermajority should carry the day .\u2009.\u2009. so this keeps bringing us back to the same key question: Is it O.K. for some people to transmit messages at significant power when other people don\u2019t want them to?\u2019\u2019", "In a sense, the METI debate runs parallel to other existential decisions that we will be confronting in the coming decades, as our technological and scientific powers increase. Should we create superintelligent machines that exceed our own intellectual capabilities by such a wide margin that we cease to understand how their intelligence works? Should we \u2018\u2018cure\u2019\u2019 death, as many technologists are proposing? Like METI, these are potentially among the most momentous decisions human beings will ever make, and yet the number of people actively participating in those decisions \u2014 or even aware such decisions are being made \u2014 is minuscule.", "\u2018\u2018I think we need to rethink the message process so that we are sending a series of increasingly inclusive messages,\u2019\u2019 Vakoch says. \u2018\u2018Any message that we initially send would be too narrow, too incomplete. But that\u2019s O.K. Instead, what we should be doing is thinking about how to make the next round of messages better and more inclusive. We ideally want a way to incorporate both technical expertise \u2014 people who have been thinking about these issues from a range of different disciplines \u2014 and also getting lay input. I think it\u2019s often been one or the other. One way we can get lay input in a way that makes a difference in terms of message content is to survey people about what sorts of things they would want to say. It\u2019s important to see what the general themes are that people would want to say and then translate those into a Lincos-like message.\u2019\u2019", "When I asked Denning where she stands on the METI issue, she told me: \u2018\u2018I have to answer that question with a question: Why are you asking me? Why should my opinion matter more than that of a 6-year-old girl in Namibia? We both have exactly the same amount at stake, arguably, she more than I, since the odds of being dead before any consequences of transmission occur are probably a bit higher for me, assuming she has access to clean water and decent health care and isn\u2019t killed far too young in war.\u2019\u2019 She continued: \u2018\u2018I think the METI debate may be one of those rare topics where scientific knowledge is highly relevant to the discussion, but its connection to obvious policy is tenuous at best, because in the final analysis, it\u2019s all about how much risk the people of Earth are willing to tolerate. .\u2009.\u2009. And why exactly should astronomers, cosmologists, physicists, anthropologists, psychologists, sociologists, biologists, sci-fi authors or anyone else (in no particular order), get to decide what those tolerances should be?\u2019\u2019", "Wrestling with the METI question suggests, to me at least, that the one invention human society needs is more conceptual than technological: We need to define a special class of decisions that potentially create extinction-level risk. New technologies (like superintelligent computers) or interventions (like METI) that pose even the slightest risk of causing human extinction would require some novel form of global oversight. And part of that process would entail establishing, as Denning suggests, some measure of risk tolerance on a planetary level. If we don\u2019t, then by default the gamblers will always set the agenda, and the rest of us will have to live with the consequences of their wagers.", "In 2017, the idea of global oversight on any issue, however existential the threat it poses, may sound na\u00efve. It may also be that technologies have their own inevitability, and we can only rein them in for so long: If contact with aliens is technically possible, then someone, somewhere is going to do it soon enough. There is not a lot of historical precedent for humans voluntarily swearing off a new technological capability \u2014 or choosing not to make contact with another society \u2014 because of some threat that might not arrive for generations. But maybe it\u2019s time that humans learned how to make that kind of choice. This turns out to be one of the surprising gifts of the METI debate, whichever side you happen to take. Thinking hard about what kinds of civilization we might be able to talk to ends up making us think even harder about what kind of civilization we want to be ourselves.", "Near the end of my conversation with Frank Drake, I came back to the question of our increasingly quiet planet: all those inefficient radio and television signals giving way to the undetectable transmissions of the internet age. Maybe that\u2019s the long-term argument for sending intentional messages, I suggested; even if it fails in our lifetime, we will have created a signal that might enable an interstellar connection thousands of years from now.", "Drake leaned forward, nodding. \u2018\u2018It raises a very interesting, nonscientific question, which is: Are extraterrestrial civilizations altruistic? Do they recognize this problem and establish a beacon for the benefit of the other folks out there? My answer is: I think it\u2019s actually Darwinian; I think evolution favors altruistic societies. So my guess is yes. And that means there might be one powerful signal for each civilization.\u2019\u2019 Given the transit time across the universe, that signal might well outlast us as a species, in which case it might ultimately serve as a memorial as much as a message, like an interstellar version of the Great Pyramids: proof that a technologically advanced organism evolved on this planet, whatever that organism\u2019s ultimate fate.", "As I stared at Drake\u2019s stained-glass Arecibo message, in the middle of that redwood grove, it seemed to me that an altruistic civilization \u2014 one that wanted to reach across the cosmos in peace \u2014 would be something to aspire to, despite the potential for risk. Do we want to be the sort of civilization that boards up the windows and pretends that no one is home, for fear of some unknown threat lurking in the dark sky? Or do we want to be a beacon?"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/technology/personaltech/using-android-to-zoom-in-for-a-closer-look.html": ["Q.

The boy had been accused of stealing a pair of sneakers belonging to the teenage son of his foster mother, an act of retaliation, apparently, for the theft of a Game Boy.", "Because he had been arrested twice before \u2014 once on a charge of jumping a turnstile and another time on a suspicion of possessing marijuana \u2014 and had missed certain court dates associated with those arrests because, like most teenage boys, he failed to maintain an unerring Google calendar \u2014 the bail set for him that night was $500. Given his circumstance, this was a daunting sum.", "Mr. Goldberg had arrived in his capacity as the executive director of the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, one of several charities created in recent years in cities around the country to pay bail for those who would otherwise end up in jail for low-level offenses, unable to come up with the money themselves. In New York, close to three-quarters of pretrial detainees in the city\u2019s jail system, many exposed pointlessly to the horrors of Rikers Island, are there because they could not afford the price of release at the time of arraignment. Of those, less than 8 percent have been accused of doing anything gravely perilous to the common good \u2014 killing someone, committing sexual offenses or carrying a gun.", "The cruel absurdity of making freedom contingent on material well-being in a society where, as the Federal Reserve reported last year, only 46 percent of Americans surveyed said they had enough money to cover a $400 emergency expense, has made bail reform a popular cause and the elimination of cash bail a goal of many in the criminal justice reform movement. In April, a federal judge in Houston overturned Harris County\u2019s bail system, arguing that the practice of detaining poor, misdemeanor defendants essentially for the crime of not knowing someone with an extra $1,000, violated equal-protection rights against discrimination based on wealth. The California Senate recently approved a bill that would work to ensure that no one is kept in local jails as a consequence of poverty.", "To many who work in the legal system, the thought that the elimination of bail might prompt a crisis of flight risk seems comically out of touch. \u201cMy clients couldn\u2019t afford a MetroCard,\u201d Cynthia Godsoe, a former public defender turned law professor, told a roomful of affluent Brooklynites recently at a fund-raiser for the Bail Fund. \u201cWhite-collar criminals are the flight risk.\u201d", "As a philanthropic cause, bail funds are attractive because the outlay does not need to be very big (the Brooklyn fund posts bail only up to $2,000) and the impact is immediate, allowing a donor to feel part of something transformative \u2014 preventing a young parent from going to jail for drinking on a front stoop, or driving without a license or stealing diapers or a few bars of soap (these examples are not hypothetical).", "But bail reform alone cannot stanch the flow of people into the criminal justice system who shouldn\u2019t be there in the first place.

But we seem to be nowhere near the point of upending the ways in which we criminalize personal dispute.", "Over the course of several hours spent in Brooklyn Criminal Court recently, I was struck by the number of people who wound up before a judge because of conflicts with ex-lovers, roommates (one man was accused of flipping over the bed of another man at a homeless shelter) and fellow teenagers.

The failure to offer adequate social services to the poor leaves them, in many instances, relying on law enforcement to fill the gaps, which puts children needlessly in contact with the legal system and exerts extra stress on the police, as David O.

Our site had vanished from the internet in Egypt. After some technical tests and conversations with users of different internet service providers, we realized what had happened: Mada Masr was being blocked in Egypt.", "Mada Masr was born in a moment of political uncertainty. It was June 2013, when people were protesting the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood. Then the military intervened, ousted President Mohamed Morsi and appointed a government until their commander, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was elected president a few months later.", "Dissent \u2014 or any act resembling critique of public policy \u2014 was the casualty: endless administrative detentions for some political dissidents, hasty litigation and harsh mass verdicts for others; random killings of political opponents; systematic intimidation of activists, independent journalists and human rights defenders; legislated restrictions on the media and civil society. The authorities rendered the political space void. All other actors were pushed to the margins.", "Stepping into this void, a number of journalists in Egypt started publishing about all of the above. We called ourselves Mada Masr. \u201cMada\u201d is the Arabic word for \u201creach,\u201d like the horizon. We chose it as a reminder of the possibility of seeing a way out. Mada is also the spot where a gem or stone is placed on a ring, a symbol of taking a position, not succumbing to the reality of our violent exclusion from politics.", "Four years after its founding, and after constant news coverage, multiple investigative reports and scores of insightful articles about what Egypt has become, Mada Masr was blocked. No one has claimed responsibility for the blockade, which was conducted through an RST injection, a technology China uses to block websites as part of its infamous firewall. An RST injection is a reset command by a third party that prevents data from traveling through an internet protocol, which is the system that connects computers to the internet.", "News spread in state-affiliated media, which quoted anonymous security sources saying that the authorities had ordered the blocking of a number of websites in Egypt for supporting terrorism and spreading lies. In addition to Mada Masr, a number of other sites have been blocked, including Al Jazeera, the HuffPost\u2019s Arabic-language site, and the Egyptian financial newspaper Al Borsa and its English sister publication, Daily News Egypt.", "But still, no one from the government has spoken to us.", "We are now following the courteous motions of the law. We are sending formal complaints to different stakeholders: the government-appointed agency that oversees the media, the state telecoms regulator and Egypt\u2019s internet service providers. We ask them: What does blocking a legal website without any legal notification mean in a country that still pretends to obey laws? If the state\u2019s current quest is to invest in the murky path of controlling the internet \u2014 in ways it didn\u2019t do in the past when closing down the internet seemed unfriendly to business interests \u2014 will it do it supra-legally? Or will it preserve some semblance of a rule of law?", "But what matters more is that we are still publishing, on our website so that people outside Egypt can read it, and on Facebook and Google Drive so that people inside Egypt can read our reports, too. We could not miss writing to our public about a deadly attack last month, by the Islamic State, on a bus carrying Christian workers to a monastery in Upper Egypt or about a restrictive bill that may kill the work of civil society, especially in the field of human rights. We could not miss telling our readers about the continuing blocking of other independent news websites. We didn\u2019t want to stop contemplating and informing people about the state of affairs in this country, from the economy of the music industry to the birth of video art.", "In the process of publishing on a website blocked through most I.S.P.s in Egypt, we are learning how to better use social media, how to tap into the solidarities expressed by our different communities, how to formulate more engaging statements with updates to the public about our status and how to ultimately do all of that while still enjoying ourselves. Artists reading this may remember the photo series by the Iranian artist Shirin Aliabadi titled \u201cFreedom is boring, censorship is fun.\u201d", "Of course we want freedom. But we at Mada Masr \u2014 like many other groups \u2014 have learned how to thrive in precarity.", "I am not sure that blocking our website and other websites is the most productive way to stop the flow of knowledge. We are agile. And although the internet has morphed from an ultimately free space into one that governments and big private players have turned into their own terrain, it is still a place where we are able to emerge and re-emerge. Do those invisible powers that come up with the idea of blocking websites or sign off on such decisions know that?", "It is possible. It is possible that the blocking of these websites is more of a signal of the state\u2019s abilities, a spectacle of power: A human rights lawyer and would-be presidential candidate who challenged the government in court repeatedly is prosecuted for \u201can indecent hand gesture\u201d (that he didn\u2019t even make). Activists from political parties who dared open the debate about possible presidential candidates for 2018 elections are being arrested. But what does prowess mean at a time of economic and security crises?", "The state is powerful and will always be more powerful. But we have also been building power. We at Mada Masr belong to the many in Egypt today who did not disappear when we lost but instead remain in the hide-outs created by that political void. At moments of crisis, at times of direct collision with state power, those hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of us have not really drowned in despair, but rather we have been able to craft politics. And in being political, we recognize and grab moments of possibility, even if they come wrapped in crisis."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/sports/soccer/dennis-crowley-kingston-stockade-fc.html": ["KINGSTON, N.Y. \u2014 It was the most important game in the brief history of Kingston Stockade F.C.

In 2015, he turned to another passion and built from scratch a soccer team, paying $12,500 for a franchise fee to enter Stockade F.C. in the National Premier Soccer League. Running a semipro club two hours north of New York City was not his ultimate goal, though.", "Driven by the kind of disruptive innovation he knows from the tech world, Crowley is making a bold attempt to reimagine professional soccer in the United States. It is a grand vision of hundreds of clubs and multiple divisions, of promotion and relegation that will reward investment and success and punish bad decisions and failure. That is the big picture. On a recent Saturday, however, Crowley\u2019s focus was on only one game.", "For the early June match, Crowley\u2019s S.U.V. was packed with the uniforms he had washed. A bag of balls. Banners.

By learning that water can be dispensed more efficiently from five-gallon jugs than from bottles. By keeping track of every cent spent. And by bringing a technology executive\u2019s aptitude for pioneering start-ups to soccer.", "The N.P.S.L. is a semiprofessional summer league whose 96 teams, spread across the country, play in the fourth level of what is known as the American soccer pyramid. It seemed to Crowley an ideal laboratory for experimentation.", "Crowley\u2019s idea is that profitable and sustainable soccer teams can succeed, not only in the large markets inhabited at the top professional level by Major League Soccer, but in small communities, too, like Kingston, with a population of 23,000 in the Hudson Valley, 90 miles north of New York City.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like craft beer growing because people like the idea of something personal, local, not the standardized beer that everyone gets,\u201d said Crowley, whose interest in starting a team was first piqued by the stirring goal Landon Donovan scored to give the United States a victory over Algeria at the 2010 World Cup.", "\u201cI think that\u2019s where M.L.S. is going wrong,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cThey are tending to produce a standardized product across the country.\u201d", "Crowley envisions the obscure N.P.S.L. becoming relevant over the next five or 10 years by expanding from 100 to 500 teams, each drawing at least 1,000 fans a game and attracting at least 5,000 viewers online via live-streaming broadcasts of their matches. (M.L.S. currently has 22 teams, but is in the process of expanding to as many as 28 over the next several years.)", "If the N.P.S.L. can build a much larger geographic footprint than M.L.S., while attracting an audience about 25 percent the size of M.L.S.\u2019s, Crowley argues, this could lead to enhanced sponsorship deals, live-streaming rights contracts, and shared revenue among the league\u2019s teams.", "Crowley\u2019s plan also envisions the enticing \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 possibility of promotion and relegation, with teams moving up or down through tiers depending on their performance in a given season.", "The system is the standard in most of the world\u2019s leagues but anathema to American professional sports, where leagues like the N.F.L. and the N.B.A. operate \u2014 like M.L.S. \u2014 as closed systems. That arrangement was built into M.L.S. at its creation in the mid-1990s, and it most likely enticed the financing that founded and sustained the league.", "But a closed system also mitigates risks for potential new investors: It is unlikely that a prospective owner of an M.L.S. team would spend several hundred million dollars for a team and a stadium if it risked dropping to a lower division a year later, just as no one would buy the Yankees if they might drop to Class AAA after a single poor season. To advocates of promotion and relegation, that safety stifles innovation.", "That is why the prospect of advancing in soccer\u2019s pecking order is tantalizing to many fans of lower-division clubs. It is also why, instead of changing the American soccer landscape from the top, Crowley is proposing to do it from the bottom.", "\u201cPeople say, \u2018It\u2019s cute, you\u2019re doing this thing with soccer,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019re working on a start-up and that\u2019s cute until you pose a threat to Google or Facebook and then they take you seriously. I understand the journey, the improbable rise of that. I feel like we\u2019re doing the improbable rise again.\u201d", "Unlike with his tech start-ups, Crowley said, he could find no place to learn how to build a soccer club from the ground up. So he has begun writing his own instruction manual of sorts, publishing several online manifestoes in the hope they will encourage others to start teams in the N.P.S.L.", "His approach has been described as \u201copen-source soccer.\u201d In his online treatises, he has published all of Stockade F.C.\u2019s financial data, down to the costs of game programs and staples. According to Crowley\u2019s figures, the team\u2019s expenses for 2016, its inaugural season, were $136,127 and revenue was $99,328, for a loss of $36,799 (minus $12,000 in excess merchandise inventory).", "In these online essays, Crowley has been open about strategies that have worked, and others that have failed. He has offered tips: Jerseys are reusable from one season to the next if the sponsor remains the same. It is better to start summer games at 5 p.m. instead of 2 p.m., so fans don\u2019t have to run for shade and players\u2019 feet won\u2019t blister. And if you cannot serve alcohol at a high school stadium, arrange for a beer tent across the street.", "Crowley also has made the provocative argument that proximity may matter as much as quality of play in drawing fans to a team.", "\u201cIn sum, we shouldn\u2019t focus our energy on the idea of entirely disrupting M.L.S.,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut rather on creating a world where it\u2019s possible that a critical mass of soccer fans in the USA care more about a D4 league than M.L.S.\u201d", "Can his plan succeed?", "\u201cI love the transparency, putting all the numbers down; it\u2019s really cool what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Stefan Szymanski, a professor of sports management at Michigan and the author of \u201cMoney and Soccer: A Soccernomics Guide.\u201d", "And yet, Szymanski added, if M.L.S. can survive its own financial challenges (he is skeptical), the league most likely would have the money, organizational clout and political muscle to thwart any perceived threat from the N.P.S.L. by moving teams into some of its best markets or co-opting the league itself. Some argue that M.L.S. has seriously damaged a recent challenger, the second-tier North American Soccer League, by strengthening the rival United Soccer League, in which many of its clubs now field reserve teams.", "\u201cCertainly, M.L.S. wants to develop the lower tiers; they want to control every level of the game,\u201d Szymanski said. \u201cThe question is, if this guy develops a nice app and a nice system, would M.L.S. try to buy it up lock, stock and barrel? And would he be willing to sell?\u201d", "Sunil Gulati, an important executive in the founding of M.L.S. and the current president of the United States Soccer Federation, said: \u201cYou never discount anyone who\u2019s proven in one aspect of their career. The idea of a community-based, ground-up effort is certainly something to be followed carefully.\u201d", "Because Crowley\u2019s plan is long-term, Gulati added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to evaluate and also hard to succeed against everything else that\u2019s going on in the sport. To the extent that this is a disrupter, that\u2019s great if they\u2019re successful. But we only ever hear about the disrupters that are successful.

The company that\u2019s hailed for innovation does not often invent things first \u2014 it didn\u2019t create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use.", "On paper, Apple is aiming to pull the same trick with a device called HomePod. The $349 gadget \u2014 which Apple unveiled on Monday at its annual developer conference and will begin shipping in December \u2014 is inspired by the Amazon Echo, the smart speaker that houses Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant, Alexa, and that seemed like a joke until many people (including yours truly) suddenly began to love it.", "Apple\u2019s version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It\u2019s very pretty; it\u2019s about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room.", "Yet the reinvention that matters here isn\u2019t about a single device \u2014 it\u2019s larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself.", "For some time now, Apple has faced questions about its growth and what rabbits it can pull out of its hat next, especially as rivals including Google, Facebook and Amazon appear to have gotten the jump on it with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality. The Apple iPhone remains the most profitable computing device in the world, and Apple\u2019s immediate future looks sunny, but its long-term outlook has begun to look partly cloudy. In a world that seems to care less and less about beautiful hardware and more about services that help you from afar, over the air, without your ever having to touch a machine, Apple risks becoming an anachronism.", "HomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That\u2019s because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner \u2014 cloud services and A.I., for instance.", "But here\u2019s the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201ccomputer vision.\u201d", "Subtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow\u2019s intelligent machines \u2014 whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance.", "This shift doesn\u2019t mean that HomePod will succeed, or that Amazon\u2019s device is in trouble; with a head start, much cheaper devices and lots of irrepressible fans, the Echo has momentum that will be difficult to curb. Plus, nobody knows yet how well HomePod will work.", "In broad strokes, the device seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, \u201cHey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen,\u201d and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it\u2019s playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions \u2014 setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices.", "HomePod also lacks a lot that the Echo has perfected. For now, it seems bound to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Apple said that it connects to its own subscription music service, but declined to specify whether it would let you play songs from Spotify or other services, or whether there was a way for third-party developers to create additional voice-activated functions, which is one of the best features of the Echo. Alexa can order an Uber for you; HomePod may ask you to try using your phone. And obviously, HomePod lacks the Echo\u2019s deep integration with Amazon\u2019s online store, which, to many users, is a killer feature: Running out of dish soap? Alexa will order it for you, but Siri can\u2019t.", "Yet many of these are omissions that you\u2019d expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics.", "If you\u2019re a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon\u2019s speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can.", "Can Siri in HomePod do that? I can\u2019t tell you yet for certain. I got a chance to listen to HomePod \u2014 but not use any of its voice-activated features \u2014 after Apple\u2019s keynote. As the company promised, it does sound much deeper and richer than a Sonos Play 3 or an Amazon Echo, closer to what you might hear in a high-end home stereo system. But the true test for such a device is how it works in real-world conditions, handling the multiplicity of requests that you might think up during a day \u2014 and for now, we have no idea how that might work.", "Yet I am cautiously optimistic, mainly on the basis of the many other computationally difficult features that Apple showed off on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting.", "For example, Siri will now translate languages for you. Like a true assistant, Siri is also now more predictive \u2014 it aims to spot common computing problems and offer to help.

Mr. Ben-Oni, the global chief information officer at IDT, was able to fend them off, but the attack left him distraught.", "In 22 years of dealing with hackers of every sort, he had never seen anything like it. Who was behind it? How did they evade all of his defenses? How many others had been attacked but did not know it?", "Since then, Mr. Ben-Oni has been sounding alarm bells, calling anyone who will listen at the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey attorney general\u2019s office and the top cybersecurity companies in the country to warn them about an attack that may still be invisibly striking victims undetected around the world.", "And he is determined to track down whoever did it.", "\u201cI don\u2019t pursue every attacker, just the ones that piss me off,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni told me recently over lentils in his office, which was strewn with empty Red Bull cans. \u201cThis pissed me off and, more importantly, it pissed my wife off, which is the real litmus test.\u201d", "Two weeks after IDT was hit, the cyberattack known as WannaCry ravaged computers at hospitals in England, universities in China, rail systems in Germany, even auto plants in Japan. No doubt it was destructive. But what Mr. Ben-Oni had witnessed was much worse, and with all eyes on the WannaCry destruction, few seemed to be paying attention to the attack on IDT\u2019s systems \u2014 and most likely others around the world.", "The strike on IDT, a conglomerate with headquarters in a nondescript gray building here with views of the Manhattan skyline 15 miles away, was similar to WannaCry in one way: Hackers locked up IDT data and demanded a ransom to unlock it.", "But the ransom demand was just a smoke screen for a far more invasive attack that stole employee credentials. With those credentials in hand, hackers could have run free through the company\u2019s computer network, taking confidential information or destroying machines.", "Worse, the assault, which has never been reported before, was not spotted by some of the nation\u2019s leading cybersecurity products, the top security engineers at its biggest tech companies, government intelligence analysts or the F.B.I., which remains consumed with the WannaCry attack.", "Were it not for a digital black box that recorded everything on IDT\u2019s network, along with Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s tenacity, the attack might have gone unnoticed.", "Scans for the two hacking tools used against IDT indicate that the company is not alone. In fact, tens of thousands of computer systems all over the world have been \u201cbackdoored\u201d by the same N.S.A. weapons. Mr. Ben-Oni and other security researchers worry that many of those other infected computers are connected to transportation networks, hospitals, water treatment plants and other utilities.", "An attack on those systems, they warn, could put lives at risk. And Mr. Ben-Oni, fortified with adrenaline, Red Bull and the house beats of Deadmau5, the Canadian record producer, said he would not stop until the attacks had been shut down and those responsible were behind bars.", "\u201cThe world is burning about WannaCry, but this is a nuclear bomb compared to WannaCry,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is different. It\u2019s a lot worse. It steals credentials. You can\u2019t catch it, and it\u2019s happening right under our noses.\u201d", "And, he added, \u201cThe world isn\u2019t ready for this.\u201d", "Mr. Ben-Oni, 43, a Hasidic Jew, is a slight man with smiling eyes, a thick beard and a hacker\u2019s penchant for mischief. He grew up in the hills of Berkeley, Calif., the son of Israeli immigrants.", "Even as a toddler, Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s mother said, he was not interested in toys. She had to take him to the local junkyard to scour for typewriters that he would eventually dismantle on the living room floor. As a teenager, he aspired to become a rabbi but spent most of his free time hacking computers at the University of California, Berkeley, where his exploits once accidentally took down Belgium\u2019s entire phone system for 15 minutes.", "To his parents\u2019 horror, he dropped out of college to pursue his love of hacking full time, starting a security company to help the city of Berkeley and two nearby communities, Alameda and Novato, set up secure computer networks.", "He had a knack for the technical work, but not the marketing, and found it difficult to get new clients. So at age 19, he crossed the country and took a job at IDT, back when the company was a low-profile long-distance service provider.", "As IDT started acquiring and spinning off an eclectic list of ventures, Mr. Ben-Oni found himself responsible for securing shale oil projects in Mongolia and the Golan Heights, a \u201cStar Trek\u201d comic books company, a project to cure cancer, a yeshiva university that trains underprivileged students in cybersecurity, and a small mobile company that Verizon recently acquired for $3.1 billion.", "Which is to say he has encountered hundreds of thousands of hackers of every stripe, motivation and skill level. He eventually started a security business, IOSecurity, under IDT, to share some of the technical tools he had developed to keep IDT\u2019s many businesses secure. By Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s estimate, IDT experiences hundreds of attacks a day on its businesses, but perhaps only four each year give him pause.", "Nothing compared to the attack that struck in April. Like the WannaCry attack in May, the assault on IDT relied on cyberweapons developed by the N.S.A. that were leaked online in April by a mysterious group of hackers calling themselves the Shadow Brokers \u2014 alternately believed to be Russia-backed cybercriminals, an N.S.A. mole, or both.", "The WannaCry attack \u2014 which the N.S.A. and security researchers have tied to North Korea \u2014 employed one N.S.A. cyberweapon; the IDT assault used two.", "Both WannaCry and the IDT attack used a hacking tool the agency had code-named EternalBlue. The tool took advantage of unpatched Microsoft servers to automatically spread malware from one server to another, so that within 24 hours North Korea\u2019s hackers had spread their ransomware to more than 200,000 servers around the globe.", "The attack on IDT went a step further with another stolen N.S.A. cyberweapon, called DoublePulsar. The N.S.A. used DoublePulsar to penetrate computer systems without tripping security alarms. It allowed N.S.A. spies to inject their tools into the nerve center of a target\u2019s computer system, called the kernel, which manages communications between a computer\u2019s hardware and its software.", "In the pecking order of a computer system, the kernel is at the very top, allowing anyone with secret access to it to take full control of a machine. It is also a dangerous blind spot for most security software, allowing attackers to do what they want and go unnoticed. In IDT\u2019s case, attackers used DoublePulsar to steal an IDT contractor\u2019s credentials. Then they deployed ransomware in what appears to be a cover for their real motive: broader access to IDT\u2019s businesses.", "Mr. Ben-Oni learned of the attack only when a contractor, working from home, switched on her computer to find that all her data had been encrypted and that attackers were demanding a ransom to unlock it. He might have assumed that this was a simple case of ransomware.", "But the attack struck Mr. Ben-Oni as unique. For one thing, it was timed perfectly to the Sabbath. Attackers entered IDT\u2019s network at 6 p.m. on Saturday on the dot, two and a half hours before the Sabbath would end and when most of IDT\u2019s employees \u2014 40 percent of whom identify as Orthodox Jews \u2014 would be off the clock. For another, the attackers compromised the contractor\u2019s computer through her home modem \u2014 strange.", "The black box of sorts, a network recording device made by the Israeli security company Secdo, shows that the ransomware was installed after the attackers had made off with the contractor\u2019s credentials. And they managed to bypass every major security detection mechanism along the way. Finally, before they left, they encrypted her computer with ransomware, demanding $130 to unlock it, to cover up the more invasive attack on her computer.", "Mr. Ben-Oni estimates that he has spoken to 107 security experts and researchers about the attack, including the chief executives of nearly every major security company and the heads of threat intelligence at Google, Microsoft and Amazon.", "With the exception of Amazon, which found that some of its customers\u2019 computers had been scanned by the same computer that hit IDT, no one had seen any trace of the attack before Mr. Ben-Oni notified them. The New York Times confirmed Mr. Ben-Oni\u2019s account via written summaries provided by Palo Alto Networks, Intel\u2019s McAfee and other security firms he used and asked to investigate the attack.", "\u201cI started to get the sense that we were the canary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we recorded it.\u201d", "Since IDT was hit, Mr. Ben-Oni has contacted everyone in his Rolodex to warn them of an attack that could still be worming its way, undetected, through victims\u2019 systems.", "\u201cTime is burning,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cUnderstand, this is really a war \u2014 with offense on one side, and institutions, organizations and schools on the other, defending against an unknown adversary.\u201d", "Since the Shadow Brokers leaked dozens of coveted attack tools in April, hospitals, schools, cities, police departments and companies around the world have largely been left to fend for themselves against weapons developed by the world\u2019s most sophisticated attacker: the N.S.A.", "A month earlier, Microsoft had issued a software patch to defend against the N.S.A. hacking tools \u2014 suggesting that the agency tipped the company off to what was coming. Microsoft regularly credits those who point out vulnerabilities in its products, but in this case the company made no mention of the tipster. Later, when the WannaCry attack hit hundreds of thousands of Microsoft customers, Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, slammed the government in a blog post for hoarding and stockpiling security vulnerabilities.", "For his part, Mr. Ben-Oni said he had rolled out Microsoft\u2019s patches as soon as they became available, but attackers still managed to get in through the IDT contractor\u2019s home modem.", "Six years ago, Mr. Ben-Oni had a chance meeting with an N.S.A. employee at a conference and asked him how to defend against modern-day cyberthreats. The N.S.A. employee advised him to \u201crun three of everything\u201d: three firewalls, three antivirus solutions, three intrusion detection systems. And so he did.", "But in this case, modern-day detection systems created by Cylance, McAfee and Microsoft and patching systems by Tanium did not catch the attack on IDT. Nor did any of the 128 publicly available threat intelligence feeds that IDT subscribes to. Even the 10 threat intelligence feeds that his organization spends a half-million dollars on annually for urgent information failed to report it. He has since threatened to return their products.", "\u201cOur industry likes to work on known problems,\u201d Mr. Ben-Oni said. \u201cThis is an unknown problem. We\u2019re not ready for this.\u201d", "No one he has spoken to knows whether they have been hit, but just this month, restaurants across the United States reported being hit with similar attacks that were undetected by antivirus systems. There are now YouTube videos showing criminals how to attack systems using the very same N.S.A. tools used against IDT, and Metasploit, an automated hacking tool, now allows anyone to carry out these attacks with the click of a button.", "Worse still, Mr. Ben-Oni said, \u201cNo one is running point on this.\u201d", "Last month, he personally briefed the F.B.I. analyst in charge of investigating the WannaCry attack. He was told that the agency had been specifically tasked with WannaCry, and that even though the attack on his company was more invasive and sophisticated, it was still technically something else, and therefore the F.B.I. could not take on his case.", "The F.B.I. did not respond to requests for comment.", "So Mr. Ben-Oni has largely pursued the case himself. His team at IDT was able to trace part of the attack to a personal Android phone in Russia and has been feeding its findings to Europol, the European law enforcement agency based in The Hague.", "The chances that IDT was the only victim of this attack are slim. Sean Dillon, a senior analyst at RiskSense, a New Mexico security company, was among the first security researchers to scan the internet for the N.S.A.\u2019s DoublePulsar tool. He found tens of thousands of host computers are infected with the tool, which attackers can use at will.", "\u201cOnce DoublePulsar is on the machine, there\u2019s nothing stopping anyone else from coming along and using the back door,\u201d Mr. Dillon said.", "More distressing, Mr. Dillon tested all the major antivirus products against the DoublePulsar infection and a demoralizing 99 percent failed to detect it.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the same computers infected with DoublePulsar for two months and there is no telling how much malware is on those systems,\u201d Mr. Dillon said. \u201cRight now we have no idea what\u2019s gotten into these organizations.\u201d", "In the worst case, Mr. Dillon said, attackers could use those back doors to unleash destructive malware into critical infrastructure, tying up rail systems, shutting down hospitals or even paralyzing electrical utilities.", "Could that attack be coming? The Shadow Brokers resurfaced last month, promising a fresh load of N.S.A. attack tools, even offering to supply them for monthly paying subscribers \u2014 like a wine-of-the-month club for cyberweapon enthusiasts.", "In a hint that the industry is taking the group\u2019s threats seriously, Microsoft issued a new set of patches to defend against such attacks. The company noted in an ominously worded message that the patches were critical, citing an \u201celevated risk for destructive cyberattacks.\u201d", "Mr. Ben-Oni is convinced that IDT is not the only victim, and that these tools can and will be used to do far worse.", "\u201cI look at this as a life-or-death situation,\u201d he said. \u201cToday it\u2019s us, but tomorrow it might be someone else.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/us/california-today-tech-billionaire-adopt-a-school.html": ["Good morning.", "(Want to get California Today by email?

We drew up lists of countries and cities each had visited for fun. Bets were settled with a paperback Guinness book, a dictionary and a complete works of Shakespeare.

The old metal sign from outside had been salvaged and now hung on a wall inside. The signature painting of a map of the world presided over a nook filled with games and books. At the old Globe, meals were made \u2014 or should I say, cheese was melted \u2014 in a toaster oven. The new iteration was a full-on gastro pub with delicate fish and truffle polenta.", "Rachel and I ate in Hong Kong as I never could have back when cut-rate scallion pancakes and cheap, filling McDonald\u2019s value meals were all I could afford. We had Sichuan fried chicken and pork belly buns at Little Bao; dim sum at the traditional Luk Yu Tea House, with its wooden booths and ceiling fans; and black truffle dumplings at the Sohofama restaurant in the converted police barracks, the PMQ, now a hip mix of art, retail and dining in Hong Kong\u2019s Soho neighborhood.", "Short for \u201cSouth of Hollywood Road,\u201d I remembered Soho as a smattering of bars and mostly quiet restaurants near the giant series of escalators that eased the steep commute from the Mid-Levels.

We had a couple of quick Gweilo Pale Ales at the local craft beer bar 65 Peel before succumbing to jet lag.", "The next day, to escape the rain, we hopped one of the old trams and coasted along the busy waterfront all the way to North Point, where we watched thousands of maids from Indonesia and the Philippines picnic wherever there was shelter, under bridges and overpasses clogged with their day-off celebrations.", "At the western end of the subway line in up-and-coming Kennedy Town, I toasted my old bartender friend Scott Wrayton at his new restaurant, Shoreditch. Scott, a small-town English boy, recalled arriving a quarter-century before in a neon city where the clouds shrouded the tops of the skyscrapers from view and thinking he had landed in the movie \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d", "The change in the city\u2019s skyline was most evident from the clamorous, ever touristier vantage of Victoria Peak.

So excited to see your name card! Are you in HK now?\u201d", "I arrived at his studio to find the door propped open. Wooden frames were stacked against the wall, along with a few brightly painted pink and blue canvases of flowers. Ng Tak Tung had round, black-framed glasses I didn\u2019t remember and a white goatee now covered his chin. Despite the 20 years that had passed, he was instantly recognizable to me.", "The name on the cover of the books of his paintings, however, was not. According to them, he was now Ng Chung. Then I understood why it had been so hard to trace him. He brought out two Cohibas to celebrate. We puffed on the Cuban cigars as I admired the books.", "His assistant translated for us as we spoke and occasionally had questions of her own. \u201cHow did you talk to each other when you don\u2019t speak Chinese?\u201d she asked. I explained that we would draw on whatever we could find. As she related what I had said, he flipped through the books excitedly and pointed to reproductions of his sketches on the backs of beer coasters and scraps of paper, two nude women, a fish biting a finger, a scrawny youth who looked a little familiar.", "I joked about how he was so good at hitting the bull\u2019s-eye and he squeezed one eye shut and mimed holding a rifle. His aim was so good because he had been a crack shot in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, including during skirmishes on the border with Vietnam.", "His story began to pour forth, more complicated than I ever could have guessed. He came from a family of property owners and they had a difficult time during the Cultural Revolution. After military service he went to art school at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts, where he met his wife, and followed her to Hong Kong.", "Was his wife sick in those days, I asked, testing my memories; in the hospital even? Yes, she was. Did she speak English? Yes, she did.", "As part of his artistic transformation, Ng Chung had abandoned his realist training and thrown himself into neo-Expressionism, sinking into Lan Kwai Fong\u2019s dissolute bar scene like Toulouse-Lautrec into Montmartre. \u201cHe started off from this foreign place, discerned the feeling of alienation everywhere he went, and comprehended what loneliness and helplessness meant,\u201d as one of the essays in the book put it.", "Like me, he had only just moved to the city at the time. More than I understood then, our friendship sprang from a shared loneliness that neither of us had been able to articulate. He changed his name, he told me, to change his luck, to start fresh. He had found success \u2014 his paintings now belonged to the collections of major museums and he lived on the Peak, the aspirational address high above the city.", "In the years after I left, the stories I told about this place were always fun and lighthearted, the dragon-boat races, Chinese dice games, Cantopop karaoke. Then I found an old leather-bound journal I had kept and was dumbfounded at the misery. Down and out wasn\u2019t fun, getting rocked by a financial crisis didn\u2019t feel like a roller coaster, losing your first job out of school, getting evicted and spending all your savings just to survive was romantic only in retrospect.", "The city was too big, too expensive and too tough for me. What made it tolerable and, through the hazy tint of memory, a wonderful time, were the friends I made. Ng Chung led me down a back staircase, to a bar where they knew him as well as they used to know us at the Globe.

The way Left invests, he can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers. But in December, even dubious stocks were rising, lifted by the promise of incipient deregulation. Reading the news on his phone between holes, Left happened upon an interview with President-elect Donald Trump, the purveyor of all this optimism, in Time magazine. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring down drug prices,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t like what\u2019s happened with drug prices.\u201d Left hurried back to the clubhouse and gave his ticket to the valet.", "In the finance world, Left, 46, is what is known as an \u201cactivist\u201d short-seller. After he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries \u2014 Tesla, Valeant, GoPro \u2014 and though he makes mistakes, he has an unusually high success rate.", "For a year he had been assembling a file on Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits manager with $100 billion in revenue. Pharmacy-benefits managers occupy an eye-glazingly complex netherworld in the prescription-drug supply chain, serving as intermediaries between drug makers and insurers. Express Scripts ostensibly exists to keep drug prices low, by negotiating with drug makers on behalf of insurers, but Left believed that the company was actually inflating them, because higher prices meant larger rebates from the drug makers, which meant more profit. He believed that this was true of all pharmacy-benefits managers, but especially of Express Scripts, the most powerful. Its second-largest customer was the Department of Defense; downward pressure on drug pricing from the government could seriously threaten its bottom line.", "By rights, then, Trump\u2019s threat in the interview should have tanked Express Scripts\u2019 stock. That the price remained unchanged indicated to Left that many people on Wall Street had no clue what a pharmacy-benefits manager does. Trump, he thought as he pulled out of the Madison Club, had given his stale, year-old story a fresh hook. (A spokesman for Express Scripts denied Left\u2019s claims, noting that \u201croughly 90 percent of rebates go directly to our clients.\u201d)", "Fifteen minutes later, Left was driving west on Interstate 10 in his black Bentley Continental GT. From the car, he placed a call to a hedge-fund manager, a man who was already short Express Scripts and therefore had a stake in providing Left with information. Express Scripts, this man reminded Left, did not disclose the amount it made in rebates, while some of its operating metrics exceeded those of Apple; something seemed wrong.", "Left heard \u201crebates\u201d and thought \u201ckickbacks.\u201d Express Scripts was, in Left\u2019s mind, \u201cthe man behind the man\u201d; it was \u201cthe mob.\u201d If he went public with a short position tomorrow, he wagered, he could sour Wall Street\u2019s perception of the company, transforming it from a sure thing into a noisy, chaotic mess. That attention might in turn attract regulators, further driving down the share price. He called his web designer, Mike Leznik, and told him that he wanted to buy a domain name to host his research on Express Scripts. An hour later the road snaked above Studio City, and he arrived at Mulholland Estates, his gated community in Beverly Hills.", "The next morning, Left stood in his home office and put CNBC on the television. The anchors were discussing the \u201cTrump bump,\u201d as the recent stock rally was being called. \u201cThey sit around all day long without ever knowing anything,\u201d Left said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying to watch them.\u201d Seated beneath the TV was Leznik, a sweet-natured Angeleno in jeans and blue-suede sneakers. Leznik lacked the macho swagger that made Left, with his money and filthy mouth, the center of a room. Nowhere was this truer than in his office. A giant desk dominated the back half. On the credenza sat cigar boxes from Enron and Madoff Securities \u2014 a short-seller\u2019s version of trophy antlers.", "\u201cWhat should I register the domain name as?\u201d Leznik asked.", "\u201cYour mother is a whore dot com?\u201d Left said.", "\u201cThe real story of \u2014 \u201d Leznik suggested.", "\u201cThe real story of your mother being a whore?\u201d Left said.", "Leznik settled on TheRealExpressScripts.com, then asked Left for his credit card to buy the URL.", "\u201cWhat are you, my wife?\u201d Left said.", "There were several obvious comebacks to this \u2014 \u201cYou wish\u201d being the absolute minimum \u2014 but none occurred to Leznik, who after fumbling for a moment said, \u201cI could be, if you had enough room.\u201d A whiff. The room was silenced.", "At 10 a.m., having placed his bet against the stock the night before, Left put out his first tweet, which he misspelled and deleted four times. Such is his mystique in the world of finance, however, that one of his followers assumed that the misspellings and deletions were part of a premeditated scheme to exploit Twitter\u2019s visibility algorithms. Finally the corrected version of the tweet came out from Left\u2019s handle, @CitronResearch, followed moments later by another: \u201cWhen @RealDonaldTrump goes after $ESRX,\u201d it read, using the ticker symbol for Express Scripts, \u201cheads will roll.\u201d We sat back and waited, eyes on CNBC. Twenty minutes passed. Suddenly a news flash interrupted the show. \u201cExpress Scripts shares are falling sharply on a spike in volume,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cCitron Research, run by Andrew Left, tweeted about the stock. They\u2019re now down by 9 or 10 percent, about 9.2 million shares so far.\u201d Left\u2019s tweet appeared in the corner of the screen. In the office, the atmosphere went taut.", "We watched as the stock came down, dollar after dollar, from 75 to 74 to 73; 72, 71, 70. Left wrote two more tweets, including a promise to appear on television with further revelations. Soon, the phone started ringing \u2014 reporters calling. Linette Lopez from Business Insider texted for quotes. CNBC booked him for 2 p.m. that day. \u201cThe question is,\u201d Left told a journalist from Bloomberg, \u201cis the new administration serious? He\u2019s going to rein in drug pricing. O.K., Mr. Trump, here\u2019s my advice: I know the industry. Go after Express Scripts.\u201d", "\u201cDo you have a short position?\u201d the reporter from Bloomberg asked.", "\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Left said.", "\u201cExpress Scripts, as we\u2019re talking, continues to drop,\u201d the anchor on CNBC said.", "In 15 minutes, $6 billion of market capitalization vanished. (Five months later, the stock price is still down 13 percent.) Left considered the circus around him. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201csome guys know this stuff better than me. But I know how to put it in [expletive] tweets.\u201d", "To understand short-selling, start by visualizing a share of stock as a physical certificate. If Express Scripts is trading at $74, you can trade in your certificate for $74. Now imagine you want to bet against the price, because you believe it will drop to $69 tomorrow. You go to someone who already owns a certificate, and you borrow it. For the privilege, you pay the lender a fee. Instead of holding onto your certificate, though, you turn around and sell it. Now you have $74 in cash. A day passes. The stock declines. You go to the market and buy the certificate you owe for $69, returning it to the person who lent it to you. That $5 difference, minus the fee, is your profit. Now imagine doing that with tens of thousands of shares at a time.", "At any given moment, someone, somewhere, has a short position in whatever stock you can think of \u2014 99 percent of all stocks in the world, by some estimates. Blue-chip stocks like Apple and Google are being shorted. Shake Shack is being shorted to an unhealthy degree: Almost half its shares are borrowed. As you read this, people are short on The New York Times. Almost uniquely among Wall Street maneuvers, short-selling entails what traders call infinite downside. While potential profit is constrained by the distance between the current share price and zero, the potential loss is not, because the shares, once borrowed, can rise in price indefinitely, which means the cost of returning them can, too. It\u2019s unsurprising that short-sellers tend to be aggressive men who are convinced that they see what other people miss and are comfortable with \u2014 or addicted to \u2014 risk.", "For many years that risk was taken on in secret: Short-sellers would make their bets and passively wait for the market to move in their direction. The figure of the activist, who goes public with his positions, emerged into prominence in recent years. One crucial event in Wall Street history provided the foundation. In 2001, James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager, discovered an accounting scandal at Enron, then a little-known energy company in Texas, and shared his information with journalists from Fortune. The journalists got a best seller, Chanos got his money and Jeffrey Skilling, Enron\u2019s chief executive, got 24 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Ala.", "Short-sellers of Left\u2019s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman. You don\u2019t need an office in a flashy building in the Battery, they have realized, or the validation of the press. If you build enough of a reputation, all you need are some Twitter followers and a website. Left has emerged at the forefront of this new guard. Unlike Chanos, who managed billions of dollars of other people\u2019s money, Left invests his own, which exempts him from disclosing his holdings to the public. And now that his work has brought him national attention, he has found that others are willing to make it easier, by leaking documents to him and passing tips. In many cases, Left\u2019s dossiers against his targets are not wholly his own but built using information from a confidential source. He is, in this sense, a bit like a journalist.", "He also makes it look easy. One result of Left\u2019s fame is that today\u2019s younger traders believe that they, too, could be him. Wuyang Zhao, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who wrote his dissertation on activist short-selling, told me: \u201cPeople read Andrew Left, and they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, my God, it\u2019s not impossibly difficult. It\u2019s not a lot of work, and you can bring down a big company.\u2019\u2009\u201d One of Left\u2019s friends recalled a visit Left made to a university to give a lecture. In the hallways afterward, the students swarmed him. \u201cIt was like he was Mick Jagger,\u201d the friend said.", "From 2006 to 2015, the number of activist short campaigns rose by 1,300 percent, to 1,289. In the past three years, the number of activist short-sellers working globally has nearly doubled, to 72 from 39. Very few have a positive track record. Left does. On average, the value of companies he writes about drop 10 percent in a year, and some drop as much as 95 percent.", "One morning last spring, Left and I stood in his lush backyard while he smoked a Marlboro Light. Beyond the swimming pool, the land fell sharply into the valley, and Los Angeles lay prone in the heat. We could see DJ Khaled\u2019s recently purchased house over the fence to our left. Tan and unshaven in loafers, Left possessed the vaguely louche charisma of a club promoter, which is what you might mistake him for were it not for his eyes \u2014 green, wet, melancholy eyes, which, because they cannot but project sincerity, are his greatest tools on television. His eyes are the reason he could stand in his million-dollar lawn and say to me, without irony, \u201cI\u2019m an investigative journalist who trades on his information.\u201d", "I observed that most investigative journalists could not count DJ Khaled as a neighbor.", "\u201cThe difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut you can lose millions of dollars, too.\u201d", "I met Left for the first time last May. After leaving my job as a fact-checker at a magazine \u2014 the pay was terrible, but the business cards said \u201cAssistant Editor\u201d \u2014 I was padding out my freelance income with some part-time work for finance types, editing letters and writing reports. The door creaked ajar into a totally different world. I started reading short-seller blogs at night, obsessed with the feeling that invisible forces controlling my life were flashing into visibility. That\u2019s why my wife\u2019s prescription cost $300 a month. That\u2019s why the world was how it was. I wrote Left in April and asked if we could meet. In May, he sent a text: He had dirt on an online postage seller. Did I want to come to Los Angeles?", "When I found him at the airport, he was wearing distressed jeans and a golf shirt, barking into an iPhone. He had just flown back from a vacation in Florida. During the 45-minute drive to his house, Left, never hanging up, floated and discarded a variety of plans. They were: exposing a jewelry chain as a subprime lender in disguise; shorting a maybe-fraudulent media company in Canada; and withdrawing a million-dollar cashier\u2019s check from his bank, made out to a pharmaceutical company, to be offered as a donation to the charity of its choice if it could prove to him the efficacy of a drug for multiple sclerosis, still in trials, which Left had on authority from the \u201crabbi of M.S.\u201d didn\u2019t work.", "The man on the other end of the line was a hedge-fund manager, this one a very close associate of Left\u2019s, at the center of his circle of sources. His relationship with Left was completely informal. His role was to trade ideas back and forth, sometimes shorting the companies they discussed. In exchange for sharing his insight and institutional muscle, Left\u2019s source avoided the legal liability that came from going public with a position. (A short campaign based on faulty information leaves you open to accusations of market manipulation, something Left has never been charged with in the United States.) Left has a number of sources on Wall Street, and during the months I spent reporting on him, he took care to keep their names from me, lest he burn them.", "Left also got tips as many journalists do, in large quantities, most of them useless. Business-school wannabes emailed him to get noticed. E-Trade cowboys offered schemes \u201cfor your eyes only.\u201d Hedge funds sent him research and ideas, most often because they wanted him to catalyze a short position they already held, by taking it public. What many of these people failed to grasp was that a bad company wasn\u2019t necessarily a good story. One morning, I watched him read his emails. \u201cGildan T-shirts,\u201d he snorted. \u201cThat idea does nothing for me. Who gives a [expletive] about Gildan?\u201d", "Then there was a third set of sources he used: tips of no discernible origin. In March 2012, for instance, a package without a return address landed on his doorstep. Inside were 68 pages of research claiming that a Chinese real estate company, Evergrande, was perpetrating an accounting fraud and would collapse. An odd tone pervaded, as if a very strait-laced stock analyst were trying to loosen up and channel Left\u2019s combative voice (\u201cChairman Hui\u2019s pet projects are comically off-strategy ... the endgame is nearing ... a maze of Ponzi-esque debt\u201d). Left hired a fact-checker, became convinced that the claims were accurate, updated some figures and published. The stock instantly dropped 7 percent. He covered a portion of his position two hours later, taking $280,000 in profit.", "But the profit was only the beginning of the story. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission sued Left for \u201cfalse and misleading claims,\u201d a failure to adequately support his accusations with evidence. The judge found him guilty and barred him from trading on the Chinese markets for five years. (Left objects to the decision on free-speech grounds and is appealing the ruling.) He refused to give up the name of his fact-checker. As to the identity of the anonymous sender, there was nothing to give up: Left had no idea who it was, except someone who almost certainly had a short position in Evergrande and made a fortune off the publication without the hassle of appearing in court. That was the point of using physical paper. Courts can subpoena your emails, but good luck tracing the mail backward from your gated community in Beverly Hills.", "As careful as Left must be to fact-check, hesitation hurts, too. If you\u2019re slow, other shorts can scoop you, which is exactly what happened with the online postage seller: A competitor had published a version of Left\u2019s thesis on a finance blog, and the stock\u2019s price had fallen too far to short. Back at his home office, Left tried to work, but the atmosphere was lazy, diffuse. He called a source. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, asking about the postage stock. \u201cWill it bounce?\u201d The source replied that it would not.", "Left squinted at CNBC. Then he roared. It began as a self-mocking \u201cWhy me?\u201d exasperation but expanded into something more unhindered, a primal American shriek. \u201cUugghHHAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\u201d", "When he was through, he said, almost to himself, \u201cThere has got to be an easier way to make money.\u201d", "There is, of course. Be born to wealthy parents, attend Harvard, get a job at Goldman Sachs. Left was born in Detroit and raised in Coral Springs, Fla., the second son of parents who divorced when he was 5, after which his father moved back to Michigan and out of Andrew\u2019s life. His mother, Rhoda Left Black, scraped together an income. During the day, she was an office manager at the public school. In the evening, she gave Hebrew lessons. She sold encyclopedias door to door, then eel-skin purses. \u201cAnything I could do that was legal and moral and made a buck,\u201d Black, now 73, told me. When Left asked her why she didn\u2019t leave her secretarial job for something better, she said, \u201cWe need the insurance.\u201d He had no idea what that meant. At the grocery store, they found the dented cans to get the discount at the register.", "Recognizing his ability to dazzle an audience at a young age, Black wanted her son to become a lawyer or a rabbi. Instead, he was accepted at Northeastern and chose political science. Boston confronted him for the first time with people who had always had money. They knew that Beverly Hills was an actual place in California, not a made-up city on TV. They wore black. They didn\u2019t drink Bartles & Jaymes.", "After graduating in 1993, Left responded to a newspaper ad from an outfit called the Universal Commodity Corporation, offering $100,000 a year for work in what the advertiser knew not to call a boiler room. Boiler rooms are cold-call centers for stocks, where men in bare-walled offices put the screws on unsophisticated marks. (As in: \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Mrs. Jones. I\u2019d hate to see your husband miss out.\u201d) Roberta Karmel, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who policed the Long Island boiler rooms in the 1980s, described to me a typical employee. \u201cHe tended to go to lesser schools for college,\u201d she said. \u201cOr not go to college at all. And a lot of them were kind of scrappy personalities who thought: Well, I\u2019m just as smart as the people at the white-shoe firms. I can make a lot of money, too.\u201d", "Maybe \u2014 if you\u2019re good at it. Left was not. He would meander off script and lose the sale. He quit after nine months, ejecting himself into the mid-\u201990s froth, where there was very little oversight and, almost everywhere you looked, a thick layer of scumminess. These were the years when the future \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d author Jordan Belfort ran a brokerage firm on Long Island, taking small companies public. Left started flipping penny-stock I.P.O.s, including Belfort\u2019s \u2014 he would call up the \u201cbucket shops,\u201d or storefront stock exchanges, ask for shares before a company went public and then sell them later at a profit.", "At the time, the Long Island bucket shops were pumping obscure stocks to whoever would buy them. The typical scam involved inflating the price by lying to your customers, then selling your own shares as close to the peak as possible before those customers got wiped out. (In 1999, a judge sentenced Belfort to four years for fraud. He served 22 months.) In the back of Left\u2019s mind, a realization glimmered. With the money he had saved from a few successful trades, he started shorting Belfort and the others, covering his positions after the price bottomed out \u2014 in effect profiting from their fraud. He was just getting the hang of it when the market crashed. He moved to California.", "In the mid-\u201990s, traders were just beginning to publish their theses online. An idea occurred to Left: Take the short positions he wielded against the Long Island companies and aim them up at big companies, the more elite the better, using the internet to disseminate the research. Instead of writing in the mode of a traditional stock analyst, he would distill his arguments down to internet-friendly length. The word \u201cblog\u201d was just starting to enter the lexicon. Left registered a domain name. He decided to stay in California. He would come to talk about frauds the way surfers talk about waves.", "In 2015, Left got a call from one of his frequent collaborators, Xuhua Zhou, a 25-year-old Ph.D.-program dropout who had graduated from Emory in two years with a double major (accounting and finance) and a minor (math). Zhou was also a finance blogger and trader himself. He had taken note of Martin Shkreli, the 32-year-old chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who had been in the news for buying the rights to Daraprim, an antiparasitic drug often prescribed to AIDS patients, and raising its price 56-fold. The story persuaded Zhou that \u201csomething was fiercely wrong\u201d with a much larger and more important player in the same sector, Valeant Pharmaceuticals.", "To its fans on Wall Street, Valeant represented a brand-new model for the drug business. It didn\u2019t spend money on research and development, as most drug companies did. Instead, it bought valuable patents for drugs that others had developed, then jacked up the prices. To critics, Valeant was an abusive acquisition machine that produced nothing of value and would choke on its own debt. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted it. Shares traded above $200.", "On Sept. 28, 2015, Left released his first report on the company. \u201cThis article is not for you hedge-fund managers who think that this quarter\u2019s profit is more important than human decency,\u201d it read. \u201cThis article is for the millions of Americans who together can mandate change.\u201d He continued: \u201cWhile the whole country is in an uproar about Turing Pharmaceuticals, a one-drug start-up pharma company attempting to raise prices on a single AIDS drug, the real issue is a $100 billion monster only Wall Street could love \u2014 an extremely leveraged company that set the standard for this type of abuse, while being cheered on by a cadre of Wall Street high-rollers too wealthy to fret over their own personal health care costs, and its posse of hedge-fund operators.\u201d A second report followed, demanding that Congress subpoena Valeant\u2019s executives.", "Together the reports got Left on TV and alerted potential sources that if they knew anything about Valeant, he was the man to leak to. While news of his short position shot around the internet, Left retreated with Zhou to read more about the company and wait for a break. At the same time, a finance journalist named Roddy Boyd was himself growing curious about Valeant. A dusky corner of the enterprise drew his attention. Valeant earned 40 percent of its revenue from a network of specialty pharmacies: businesses that dispense particularly expensive, complex treatments. The largest of these was called Philidor. Though it seemed like a legitimate business, with offices in Pennsylvania and logos and a website, there was something very odd about it \u2014 at least 90 percent of Philidor\u2019s revenue came from sales of Valeant drugs. That October, Boyd got a scoop. Another specialty pharmacy, a small one in California called R&O, was billed by Valeant for $69 million for drugs it did not buy. Further, Boyd reported, that pharmacy appeared to be closely related to Philidor.", "Left was ruminating on all this when The New York Times reported that Michael Pearson, Valeant\u2019s chief executive, had set up an option to purchase Philidor. Now that was really weird. What company of Valeant\u2019s size would bother with buying a regional pharmacy? Filling prescriptions was a totally separate business from selling medicines; you don\u2019t see Toyota acquiring car dealerships. Unless, Left thought, the point was never to purchase it. Unless the point was to prove, by pretending to prepare to acquire it, that Philidor was a separate company to begin with.", "Trying to weave the threads into a narrative, Left released his third report. Valeant, he wrote, was the \u201cpharmaceutical Enron.\u201d Just as Enron established shell companies to inflate its balance sheets, he wrote, Valeant maintained a network of \u201cghost ship\u201d pharmacies designed to buy product that no one had actually ordered, a form of fraud known as channel stuffing. Left\u2019s explanation would turn out to be inaccurate \u2014 the real fraud, if anything, was more tangled \u2014 but the swagger of his TV appearances represented the layup at the end of Boyd\u2019s better-researched assist. Introducing the word \u201cEnron\u201d was the key, because it forced the news media to debate with great earnestness a question that, as of the day before, had never been asked. \u201cIs Valeant the pharmaceutical Enron?\u201d Fortune wondered. \u201cReport alleges Enron-like fraud,\u201d CNN said.", "Pearson called the comparison \u201cerroneous\u201d and asked the S.E.C. to investigate Left. But as any public-relations agent knows, if you\u2019re denying, you\u2019re already on the back foot. By the time the company announced an emergency news conference the following morning, the stock was down 40 percent. \u201cAndrew erased the idea that buying Valeant was a smart strategy,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI just thought it was a good story. Andrew knew it was a ball of gasoline-soaked rags. He threw a match on it.\u201d", "Among those who smelled smoke was the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara. In November 2016, he indicted two men on charges of wire fraud and kickbacks: Gary Tanner, a senior executive at Valeant, and Andrew Davenport, the chief executive of Philidor. For all intents and purposes, the indictment alleges, Philidor was not an independent company. That much Left had suspected. What was shocking was the nature of the relationship between the businesses. It was not simple channel stuffing, the indictment alleges, but theft. According to the document, Tanner would sell Davenport millions of dollars of drugs. Then Davenport would share with Tanner the incentive payments he received from Valeant, moving the money through a shell company. Meanwhile Tanner misled his Valeant colleagues into believing that a competitor wanted to buy Philidor. The ultimate goal, the indictment claims, was to inflate Philidor\u2019s value until Valeant acquired it at a huge markup, at which point the two would split the millions that Davenport would earn from the sale as Philidor\u2019s largest stakeholder. (Through a representative, Valeant said it was the victim, not the perpetrator, of the fraud. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note the indictment involved one former employee,\u201d the company wrote, adding that it has increased R.&D. investment by 26 percent.)", "In its news release, the Department of Justice gave a hat-tip to \u201cinvestor websites\u201d for revealing \u201csuspect aspects of ... Valeant\u2019s connection to Philidor.\u201d No one doubted which website they had in mind. The unraveling accelerated through the following year. Today, Valeant trades around $13, from a high of $250. Left says he shorted at over $200 and exited at $70, taking a profit in the millions. Tanner and Davenport have pleaded not guilty; if convicted, they could face 25 years each. Pearson left Valeant last August after liquidating his stock options for somewhere in the nine-figure range.", "On the morning of Dec. 9, Left pulled up to the Bloomberg television studios in Los Angeles and ditched his Bentley curbside for the valet. The station had called to ask him to do a spot on Express Scripts.", "We rode the elevator to a silent floor, where the receptionist clocked him as he entered. \u201cHey, Andy.\u201d Desks sat empty; the morning crew was here to shoot the 9:30 spots for the New York market, but in Los Angeles the day hadn\u2019t started. A tech came out to lead us to the studio. He was a gentle man in middle age, soft-featured, wearing cargo pants and thick black sneakers, a big brown mustache, warm eyes. He knew Left from the Valeant short and liked to watch him stick it to the Wall Street bosses. All day, people came through the studio rattling off finance acronyms, Ebitda this and Gaap that. Left spoke English.", "The tech set Left up on a director\u2019s chair. A screen behind his head projected a slightly more outdated version of the skyline than was visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows off-camera to the left and right. Left opened his notes and put his earpiece in. A few seconds into the interview, the anchor fell into a trap. \u201cHow much do you think Express Scripts makes off rebates off a high-priced drug?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Left said. \u201cWhy would I have to answer that question? Isn\u2019t it something they should answer?\u201d Left was rolling now. \u201cIf a company does not disclose something, there\u2019s a reason they do not disclose it.\u201d He said: \u201cThere\u2019s a machine.\u201d He said: \u201c$40,000 a vial.\u201d He said: \u201cTwo words. Express. Scripts. They are the gatekeeper to high-priced pharmaceuticals in this country.\u201d", "He asked the anchor to look at Express Scripts\u2019 profits. \u201cThe amount of money they make, it is obscene,\u201d he said. \u201cThe money is being made on rebates. And before you defend it, any of the analysts, or the company, come out and give actual numbers.\u201d The interview concluded.", "The tech was looking at Left. \u201cYou\u2019re our best guest,\u201d he said. \u201cOur most controversial guest.\u201d", "\u201cBut not the handsomest,\u201d Left said.", "\u201cWe\u2019re in West Hollywood,\u201d the tech apologized. On-screen, the anchors moved on to the morning\u2019s next story, the appointment to the Trump administration of the president of Goldman Sachs. Left rode the elevator down to the lobby and slipped outside, where the blue glass tower dwarfed him.", "One thing Left shares with the financiers he routinely assails is a certain ambivalence about Trump. During the campaign, Trump repelled Wall Street \u2014 with some exceptions \u2014 for the fact that he introduced an element of unpredictability that is anathema to long-term investing. One contradiction of his young presidency, then, has been the eagerness with which the same people who saw the apocalypse in his ascent are now watching as the Dow Jones industrial average breaks records. Though Trump has not accomplished much of substance, like tax reform or an infrastructure bill, he has nevertheless made good on promises to limit crucial government functions. A threatened change to the fiduciary rule, for example, would make it legal for personal financial advisers to operate against the interests of their clients. It is widely believed that Trump will limit the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or eliminate it entirely. Hundreds of key positions in the executive branch remain unfilled. Americans have seen this pattern before. When a sector of society weakens, Wall Street conquers it as a profit. In a town with a dozing sheriff, vigilantes become the agents of order.", "Claire Stovall, a researcher at the industry analyst Activist Shorts, told me that the situation was not necessarily to be feared. \u201cThe market is often quicker than the government at catching frauds,\u201d Stovall said. And most successful activist short campaigns produce no regulatory action anyway. But Zhao took a dimmer view. \u201cIf you create a deregulated boom not supported by fundamentals,\u201d he said, \u201cyou will have a disaster. The activist short-sellers will make a fortune. But sometimes, as a member of society, you don\u2019t want to have a total collapse.\u201d", "In retrospect, it is not coincidental that 2015 was the year Left became famous. His tactics matched our mood. Most of us do not care about a random pharmaceutical company meeting its debt covenants. We care about getting medicine at a price we can afford. We don\u2019t care about organic versus inorganic growth, but we worry that our kids will have no coverage if the Trump administration repeals Obamacare. Left\u2019s very timely gift is to connect our daily human concerns to the convoluted operations of the economy, wrapping financial analysis in a moral, populist language that is calibrated precisely to draw maximum attention in a media environment in which screaming is the only way to be heard.", "As for those being screamed at, the banks and the business schools that feed them, Left represents at best an interesting character and at worst a nuisance. American high finance is extraordinarily good at absorbing attacks on it. Just a few months ago, Left delivered a keynote speech at Harvard Business School\u2019s annual investment conference, where students who could afford the $72,000 tuition calmly imbibed Left\u2019s strategies, which were once considered fringe. He texted me a photo of himself in Harvard Yard, looking comfortable and middle-aged, smiling, his eyes closed."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/technology/technology-forum-white-house.html": ["WASHINGTON \u2014 Silicon Valley is fuming about President Trump\u2019s stance on climate and immigration, but top technology executives still made a pilgrimage to the White House on Monday to discuss a potential upgrade of government technology.", "Timothy D.

For due diligence on the device\u2019s capabilities, I ran it through a battery of tests, including its ability to play podcasts, book a restaurant table and list movie showtimes.", "Halfway through, I started to come to a conclusion: Using the new smart speaker and its screen is not much different from asking Siri on an iPad to book a restaurant table or saying \u201cOK, Google\u201d to an Android-based phone to create a calendar appointment.", "Keep those similarities in mind as the Echo Show becomes available on Wednesday, joining Amazon\u2019s expanding family of Echo products. The Echo speakers are widely adored in homes, where people have put Alexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant that controls Echo, to work on tasks like creating shopping lists, setting kitchen timers, playing music and turning on the lights.", "With the $230 Echo Show, Alexa has gained some new capabilities. The touch screen means that you can ask Alexa to place a video call to a friend, pull up a YouTube video on making ice cream and show you lyrics when you play music. And unlike a tablet or smartphone, the stationary Echo Show sits at a fixed angle and stays plugged in for power at all times, similar to a digital picture frame.", "But the device\u2019s kinship to a smartphone\u2019s or tablet\u2019s capabilities are unmistakable. Asking Alexa to do a video call with Echo Show reminded me of asking Siri to do a FaceTime call on an iPhone. Ditto for when I asked Alexa what my day looked like on the Echo Show, which produced the same summary of events as when I asked Google the same question on an Android phone.", "After a week of tests, while I concluded that the product is ideal on a kitchen counter or an office desk, I also decided it was superfluous if you already own an Echo speaker and a smartphone or tablet. Whether or not you will be persuaded to buy one will probably hinge on your affinity for Alexa.", "The setup process for the Echo Show was one of the easiest and fastest I have ever experienced: Just plug it in and enter your Wi-Fi password and Amazon credentials. From there, I could start putting Alexa to work. (If you use third-party services like Spotify, you have to log in to those as well.)", "The Echo Show\u2019s screen constantly stayed on with a background photo of my choice. It displayed the time while rotating through captions showing future calendar events, the weather and tips on questions I could ask Alexa.", "Video calling and video playback are the most important features of the Echo Show. After a command like \u201cAlexa, show me how to roast a duck from YouTube,\u201d the screen loaded a list of YouTube videos; each video is numbered, so you could ask Alexa to play a specific clip by naming the number.", "You could also ask Alexa to place a call to another Echo customer. When I tried it, the Alexa app synchronized with my smartphone\u2019s address book to determine who else was using an Echo. Then just by asking Alexa to call the name of a contact, I could immediately commence a video call.", "What was also nice about the Echo Show\u2019s being stationary is that it remained fixed on a flattering angle of my face. (If you\u2019re tired of staring up people\u2019s nostrils on FaceTime calls, you\u2019ll know what I mean.)", "There\u2019s another task that the Echo Show handled better than the Echo speaker: shopping on Amazon. By saying, for example, \u201cAlexa, order me some batteries,\u201d you get the screen to show a list of batteries to choose from. By contrast, with the Echo speaker, the device could only reorder batteries you had bought before \u2014 or, if you hadn\u2019t ordered batteries before, choose a pack of batteries for you.", "For audio, the Echo Show included two small stereo speakers. They sounded loud and clear but lacking in bass. Compared with fancy speakers, the Echo Show sounded average, but it\u2019s adequate for watching YouTube videos in the kitchen or streaming music if you aren\u2019t a nitpicky audiophile.", "The Echo Show is buggy. In my tests with a fellow product reviewer as well as an Amazon spokesman, video calls were inconsistent. While video calls from my apartment looked clear and sounded good, other calls placed from the New York Times building failed to show any video \u2014 and, soon after, the calls disconnected. (In both locations, I used a strong Wi-Fi connection.)", "There were also some quirks with so-called Skills, which are essentially third-party apps that you can install to expand Alexa\u2019s capabilities. For example, for looking up recipes in the kitchen, I tried a skill by AllRecipes.", "But when I told Alexa, \u201cShow me how to make pasta,\u201d the device loaded a list of recipes from AllRecipes.com, and then I had trouble quitting the app. The command \u201cGo home\u201d was supposed to quit the AllRecipes Skill, but it got stuck until I said, \u201cAlexa, quit.\u201d", "When I was shopping, the Echo Show displayed a pared-down list of items from Amazon. For example, when I asked Alexa to buy a dog bed, the screen showed only 18 results for dog beds. But searching \u201cdog bed\u201d on Amazon.com brought up hundreds. That\u2019s not to say that more is better, but shopping on the Echo Show will make you wonder if you are missing out on better options.", "What I found most baffling about the Echo Show was that the screen always stayed on. Even when I asked Alexa to turn the screen off, it dimmed the screen and showed the time. While that made it act like a digital clock, the background of the screen was still lit up black, emitting a faint glow in the dark. What\u2019s more, the screen turned back on when the camera detected motion.", "In other words, light sleepers will not want an Echo Show on their night stands.", "Amazon said that third-party Skills had not yet been finalized for the Echo Show, and that for shopping, the device displayed only the top search results to simplify the interface for customers. The company did not have a clear explanation for my video-calling issues.", "But the worst part about the Echo Show is its aesthetic design. Reminiscent of a black doorstop, the Echo Show looks like an uninspired piece of tech that you\u2019d find in a Brookstone store or SkyMall catalog.", "The Echo Show\u2019s greatest strengths are its stationary applications: getting a quick glance at your calendars while checking the time, for instance, or having a dedicated TV screen in the kitchen for learning recipes. Calendar addicts in the office, people who cook with Alexa and, more broadly, Alexa fans with multiple Echo products deployed throughout the home will love having another Echo, this time with a screen.", "But the average person would be wise to wait before buying the Echo Show.", "The device is the priciest in the Echo family \u2014 $50 more than the Echo speaker and $180 more than the Echo Dot, the miniature version of the speaker. And it remains to be seen what third-party companies do with applications designed for an always-on screen that stays put.", "Until then, you could always grab a tablet you already own, put it on a stand and leave it plugged in. The results will most likely be the same."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/18/business/youtube-terrorism.html": ["OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 YouTube has struggled for years with videos that promote offensive viewpoints but do not necessarily violate the company\u2019s guidelines for removal.

It also said it would enlist experts from nongovernmental organizations to help determine which videos were violent propaganda and which were religious or newsworthy speech.", "Google said it would rely on the specialized knowledge of groups with experts on issues like hate speech, self-harm and terrorism. The company also said it planned to work with counter-extremist groups to help identify content aimed at radicalizing or recruiting extremists.", "By allowing anyone to upload videos to YouTube, Google has created a thriving video platform that appeals to people with a wide range of interests. But it has also become a magnet for extremist groups that can reach a wide audience for their racist or intolerant views. Google has long wrestled with how to curb that type of content while not inhibiting the freedom that makes YouTube popular.", "Part of the challenge is the sheer volume of videos uploaded to YouTube. The company has said that more than 400 hours of video content is uploaded to the site every minute, and YouTube has been unable to police that content in real time. Users flag offensive videos for review, while the company\u2019s algorithms comb the site for potential problems. Videos with nudity, graphic violence or copyrighted material are usually taken down quickly.", "Companies throughout the tech industry are working on how to keep platforms for user-generated content open without allowing them to become dens of extremism.

But the reality is just the opposite. These laws give private companies a role \u2014 deciding what information the public can see and share \u2014 previously held by national courts and legislators. That is a meaningful loss of national sovereignty and democratic control.", "Moving this responsibility from state to private actors also eliminates key legal protections for internet users.

Courts including the European Union Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights have recognized that users\u2019 speech and privacy rights will suffer if platforms must vet every word they post.

Filters that can find child sexual abuse images work relatively well because those images are illegal in every instance.", "But violent and extremist material is different. Almost any such image or video is legal in some context. Filters can\u2019t tell the difference between footage used for terrorist recruitment and the same footage used for journalism, political advocacy or human rights efforts.

Risk-averse companies erring on the side of over-removal for this kind of speech will disproportionately silence Arabic speakers and Islamic religious material.", "As a lawyer with long experience handling takedowns from Google web searches, I believe that there are responsible ways to remove illegal content from platforms. A good start is to have courts decide what violates the law \u2014 not machines and not company employees operating under the threat of huge fines.

In other words, this was systemic. Top to bottom, Uber was a failure of Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up machine.", "And if we want Silicon Valley to create better start-ups \u2014 which we should, for everyone\u2019s sake \u2014 the Valley would be wise to now examine Uber\u2019s entrails and find another way.", "Over the last half-decade, Uber became the tech industry\u2019s model start-up. It was not just the most valuable private company in the world, but an inspiration and template for dozens of other start-ups that would follow in its wake. It was among a small group of start-ups that pioneered a novel way of funding and running a tech company, favoring private capital over the public markets.", "It adopted a more aggressive posture in dealing with forces outside the company \u2014 competitors, regulators, drivers and everyone else. By managing drivers as contractors rather than actual employees, it accelerated a new way of thinking about labor. And by repeatedly overlooking bad actors within its ranks, even when their deeds became public, it came to popularize a new heedlessness in tech \u2014 not just disruptiveness but a celebrated recklessness.", "Who\u2019s to blame for all this? Mr. Kalanick, obviously, who built Uber in his own image.", "But there was a crowd standing behind him, too.", "First, this was a clear failure of oversight \u2014 of investors, boards of directors, partners and anyone else who could have altered Uber\u2019s course and clearly failed to do so. Overlearning the lesson of Steve Jobs\u2019s first fall at Apple \u2014 and of founder-led hyper-successes at Google and Facebook \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s investors created a culture where founders are given carte blanche, their pronouncements and tactics elevated to the level of divine infallibility.", "One reason Mr. Kalanick was granted this deference was that Uber had a lot of ways to get money. So this was also a failure of excess: There is just so much private money in the world that Uber was able to shun the public markets indefinitely, a decision held up as wise by many of its enablers, who argued that tech companies need to be insulated from stock-market investors who might not understand their businesses.", "A convenient excuse. And, in retrospect, a bad strategy. If Uber had been forced to go public sooner \u2014 if it couldn\u2019t raise billions at the drop of a hat from the likes of Saudi Arabia \u2014 it would have opened itself up to much-needed scrutiny and potential reform. Staying private created a hothouse that reinforced its worst side, and allowed it to delay building a sustainable culture with a focus on long-term interests.", "How might Uber have created such a culture?

Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and the Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were guided by strong, experienced and extremely sober operators \u2014 Sheryl Sandberg and Eric Schmidt, respectively. Mr. Kalanick, meanwhile, was allowed to operate more or less solo, to micromanage a company that grew to enormous scale, and was left alone even when the firm\u2019s problems became plain to see.", "Finally, this was a failure driven by plain greed, of ends justifying means.", "Over the next few days you may hear a revisionist defense of Uber and Mr. Kalanick that will go like this: Uber was fighting an entrenched and monopolistic cabal \u2014 taxi companies and their captured regulators \u2014 so it had to act more like a wolf than a sheep. Related to that, you will hear this: Uber is good for the world. If it wins, it will reduce car ownership, drive up fuel efficiency, reduce traffic, lower the cost of transportation, probably reduce accidents, almost certainly save lives.", "I\u2019ll admit, I believe some of these things.

The math program worked a bit like the software Netflix used to customize its video recommendations.", "\u201cIt is probably fair to say I recognized the power of personalization maybe more than other people, because I had seen it in my own working life,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in an interview at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles office.", "There was just one problem: DreamBox Learning was running low on cash. So Mr. Hastings stepped in, donating about $11 million to a nonprofit charter-school fund so it could buy the math platform.", "Today, more than two million students use the program for supplemental math instruction.", "DreamBox takes elements from animated video games, with some math lessons populated by aliens that whoosh about and animals that cluck. When students complete a math lesson successfully, they earn points that they can use to unlock virtual rewards.", "Administrators in some districts said that students so enjoyed the math program that some had begged their parents to let them play DreamBox even during trips to the supermarket. But four parents with children in public schools in Baltimore County, Md., said the program was so stimulating that they had curbed its use at home.", "\u201cIt really can suck a kid in,\u201d said Brenda Peiffer, a former school counselor, whose son, a third grader, was assigned DreamBox for homework. After noticing that he seemed more interested in spending points to customize his avatar than in actually doing math, she put the kibosh on DreamBox. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing it at home,\u201d she said.", "Jessie Woolley-Wilson, the chief executive of DreamBox, said such concerns were rare. But she recalled a mother once asking if the program was habit-forming, because her daughter was waking her up at 5:30 a.m. asking to play DreamBox. Ms. Woolley-Wilson recommended that parents oversee their children\u2019s screen time.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution for everyone,\u201d she said.", "And some experienced teachers said it was preposterous to think that algorithms could be better than skilled teachers at adapting to students\u2019 abilities. \u201cWhat you are seeing right now is a heavy push to disrupt and diminish the role of teachers as experts,\u201d said Arienne Adamcikova, a high school teacher in San Mateo, Calif.", "Mr. Hastings saw it differently.", "DreamBox Learning tracks a student\u2019s every click, correct answer, hesitation and error \u2014 collecting about 50,000 data points per student per hour \u2014 and uses those details to adjust the math lessons it shows. And it uses data to help teachers pinpoint which math concepts students may be struggling with.", "Mr. Hastings described DreamBox as a tool teachers could use to gain greater insights into their students, much the way that physicians use medical scans to treat individual patients. \u201cA doctor without an X-ray machine is not as good a doctor,\u201d Mr. Hastings said.", "So far there is little proof that such technologies significantly improve achievement. Adaptive learning courseware, for instance, generally did not improve college students\u2019 grades or their likelihood of completing a course, according to a 2016 report on some of these programs by the S.R.I. Education research group.", "Is DreamBox effective?", "DreamBox is among the minority of digital learning start-ups that have allowed independent academic researchers to examine and publicly report on their data. Still, the platform\u2019s effectiveness is difficult to gauge.", "A report from Harvard University\u2019s Center for Education Policy Research concluded that DreamBox use correlated with some improved math scores. But, the researchers cautioned, if those students had more effective teachers even without the technology, \u201cthen we might be falsely attributing\u201d student achievement gains \u201cto the software, rather than to the teacher.\u201d", "Even so, Ms. Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox\u2019s chief executive, described the study as good news, saying it confirmed encouraging reports from teachers. She pointed out that, unlike DreamBox, many other education start-ups lacked research to prove even the most basic assumption: that their apps did not harm students\u2019 educational results.", "\u201cThat sounds like a low bar,\u201d Ms. Woolley-Wilson said. \u201cBut with the history of education technology, it is not.\u201d", "Mr. Hastings (who is a company director but has no financial interest in the math company) said he was enthusiastic about DreamBox\u2019s potential and predicted wider classroom use for the technology as artificial intelligence improved.", "Still, he emphasized that he did not view technology generally as a panacea for education. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little cynical and jaundiced about technology,\u201d Mr. Hastings said. \u201cThe tech can help, but it is often oversold.\u201d", "If Facebook\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg has his way, children the world over will soon be teaching themselves \u2014 using software his company helped build.", "It\u2019s a conception that upends a longstanding teaching dynamic. Now educators are no longer classroom leaders, but helpmates.", "In public remarks and Facebook posts, Mr. Zuckerberg has described how it works. Students cluster together, working at laptops. They use software to select their own assignments, working at their own pace. And, should they struggle at teaching themselves, teachers are on hand to guide them.", "\u201cWhen you visit a school like this, it feels like the future \u2014 it feels like a start-up,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told an audience last fall in Peru. \u201cYou get the feeling this is how more of the education system should work.\u201d", "He is well on his way to achieving this vision. In 2015, 19 American schools introduced the software that Facebook helped develop. This school year, more than 100 schools use it. Next fall, Mr. Zuckerberg said, he expects that \u201cmany hundreds of more schools will upgrade.\u201d", "The effort began a few years ago with visits by Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician who is his wife, to Summit Denali, a middle school in Sunnyvale, Calif. There, classrooms lack walls, and students with laptops often zoom around on caster chairs.", "\u201cIt looks more like a Google or a Facebook than a school,\u201d said Diane Tavenner, chief executive of Summit Public Schools, a nonprofit charter-school network that runs the school.", "Mr. Zuckerberg, she said, admired the software that Summit had created for its schools. He offered Ms. Tavenner a team of Facebook engineers to further develop it and make it available free to schools nationwide.", "Summit developed its student-directed learning approach after administrators there discovered that their teachers had been so supportive of students, Ms. Tavenner said, that many of its graduates were struggling in college, unprepared to pace themselves or seek help.", "That is how Summit\u2019s platform came to show students every lesson they will need to complete for the year. They may tackle lessons in any order. At the end of each unit, they take a 10-question multiple-choice test.", "Teachers use the software to track students\u2019 work and may intervene when a child is struggling. One-on-one mentoring helps students make choices and evaluate their progress. In a Facebook post in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg said that this learning approach \u201cfrees up time for teachers to do what they do best \u2014 mentor students.\u201d", "Not all educators agree. Four former Summit teachers said they found the system problematic. They asked that their names be withheld, saying they feared repercussions for their careers.", "At Summit, they said, they were required to teach students cognitive skills (like how to construct an argument) while making students responsible for teaching themselves underlying lesson material (like how diverse plants and animals coexist). But some students raced through lessons without actually understanding basic facts, the teachers said, making it difficult to help them structure arguments on specific topics, like climate change.", "Ms. Tavenner of Summit, however, said that was exactly the point: to make students discover for themselves that they cannot succeed on applied projects without learning the fundamentals.", "Students think to themselves, \u201c\u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to actually go back and deeply understand it,\u2019\u201d Ms. Tavenner said. \u201cThose are the habits of success that we are trying to instill in kids that simply don\u2019t get instilled in the normal system.\u201d", "It can be a steep learning curve.", "In 2015, Urban Promise Academy, a public middle school in Oakland, Calif., introduced the platform for its sixth graders. But students, accustomed to having a teacher\u2019s guidance, did not know how to pace themselves, said Claire Fisher, the school\u2019s principal.", "\u201cKids were self-pacing to failure,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.", "Teachers remedied that by helping students set realistic goals. The school is now happy with the program, she said, and has expanded it to the seventh grade. Even so, Ms. Fisher said, \u201cWe definitely have a concern about the quality of the assessments in the curriculum and whether it actually promotes deeper learning.\u201d", "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, an organization set up by Dr. Chan and Mr. Zuckerberg to manage their projects in education and other areas, plans to take over Facebook\u2019s engineering role in developing the education software by the end of this year.", "Mr. Zuckerberg has big plans in mind for the program. In his Peru speech, he noted that there were only about 25,000 public secondary schools in the United States.", "\u201cOur hope over the next decade is to help upgrade a majority of these schools to personalized learning and then start working globally as well,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told the audience. \u201cGiving a billion students a personalized education is a great thing to do.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-techies-versus-trump-again.html": ["Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.", "Mike: Hello, Farhad!

All I know is that this is hardly the way Uber wanted its widely acclaimed acquisition of Otto, the self-driving trucking company started by Levandowski, to go.", "Farhad: The only surprising thing to me about this was how long it took them to fire Levandowski. He and Uber\u2019s lawyers have clearly not been on the same page for several weeks now; it\u2019s in his interest to protect himself from potential criminal liability, and it\u2019s in Uber\u2019s interest to end this suit quickly and get on with its self-driving car program. As a result, they\u2019ve been working at cross-purposes during much of the legal wrangling.", "So, I guess, at least that headache is solved, for now?", "Mike: Yeah.

On Thursday, President Trump announced he was pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, making the United States one of only three countries in the world not to be a part of it.", "The move was near-universally panned. But what was interesting to me, considering I report on tech, is that almost immediately we saw tech C.E.O.s speak out against the decision in varying degrees of forceful language.

It\u2019s the central thread running through his companies \u2014 he wants Tesla to push us to a hyper-efficient, solar-powered future, and he wants SpaceX to get us to Mars, as a backup.", "What\u2019s interesting is that he thought he could convince Trump of the wisdom of his ideas. Musk was among many executives who\u2019d pleaded with the president not to ditch the Paris agreement.

From 1997 to 2015, the number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the old American Stock Exchange dropped by half, falling to 3,766 from 7,507.", "\u201cWith fewer public companies out there, any one of them is more likely to become a target of interest for one hedge fund or another,\u201d Mr. Slaughter said.", "At the same time, activists are getting more, well, active. More than 300 American companies were targeted by these investors in 2015, up from just over 100 in 2010, according to Mr. Useem of Wharton. They\u2019re also becoming more successful at winning board seats, as fewer companies stagger their board elections over three-year cycles.", "What\u2019s more, chief executives have less internal latitude. In 2001, more than half of new C.E.O.s also assumed the position of chairman when they took over.

Now, for C.E.O.s, all the constituencies have changed.\u201d", "So while boards are still willing to dole out huge golden parachutes to C.E.O.\u2019s, even if they fail, they\u2019ve become much more generous with money than they are with additional time.", "The glaring exception to the trends outlined by Mr. Sonnenfeld is in the technology sector. But in many ways, these firms are the exception that proves the rule, because they play by different rules.", "Google\u2019s Class B shares have 10 times the voting power of normal shares, enabling the founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to retain control of the holding company Alphabet without owning a majority stake.", "Facebook also has a multi-class stock structure that effectively guarantees that the founder Mark Zuckerberg will retain control even as he sells shares. And on this point, the company offers no apologies.", "\u201cThis is not a traditional governance model, but Facebook was not built to be a traditional company,\u201d the company said last year. \u201cThe board believes that a founder-led approach has been and continues to be in the best interests of Facebook, its stockholders and the community.\u201d", "The staggering profitability of the tech giants provides their leaders with more than a little of the swagger the industrial executives once possessed.", "In 1990, the revenues of Detroit\u2019s Big Three automakers totaled $250 billion while they employed 1.2 million people, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute.", "Silicon Valley\u2019s top three companies in 2014 had almost the same revenues before adjusting for inflation \u2014 $247 billion \u2014 but with 137,000 employees, they required a work force just one-tenth the size.", "That kind of efficiency adds up to huge profits, soaring stock prices and few complaints from investors.

In a letter, titled \u201cWe Are Still In,\u201d they declared that global warming imposes real and rising costs, while the clean energy economy to which the Paris agreement aspires presents enormous opportunities for American businesses and workers.", "The statement was further evidence that Mr. Trump, as polls have shown, is out of touch with the American people. Yet this question remains: Can the United States meet its commitments without federal involvement? To many analysts, it\u2019s a hopeless task: Mr. Trump has not only removed America from a leadership role in the climate fight. He has also ordered his minions to kill or weaken beyond recognition every federal initiative on which Mr. Obama had based his pledge.", "It would be unwise, however, to give in to pessimism.", "Some context: The Paris agreement committed more than 190 nations to a collective effort to limit the rise in global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial temperatures. To that end, Mr. Obama promised to lower America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. That pledge was crucial to the overall goal; according to the think tank Climate Interactive, Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitious promise would account for one-fifth of the hoped-for global emissions reduction out to the year 2030.", "Here\u2019s the good news: Thanks to market forces (chiefly the shift from dirty coal to cleaner natural gas); increased use of wind and solar power; more efficient vehicles, buildings and appliances; and aggressive state and local policies, emissions have already dropped about 12 percent from 2005 levels, more than 40 percent of Mr. Obama\u2019s target. Further progress along these lines, without any new federal policies, would get us to a total emissions reduction of 15 percent to 19 percent by 2025, according to the Rhodium Group \u2014 way short of Mr. Obama\u2019s pledge. But if we could add back in the Obama initiatives \u2014 for instance, the mandatory shutdown of all old coal-fired power plants, which are rules Mr. Trump wants to kill \u2014 we\u2019d get to 23 percent, which is much closer.", "Mr. Trump, in short, has left a hole to fill. How to do it?", "There are several pathways. First, state action: 29 states plus the District of Columbia have targets for how much of their electricity should come from renewable or alternative energy sources, and nine others have voluntary standards. Maryland and Michigan recently raised their targets. The nation\u2019s most populous state, California, is also its most ambitious. It is on track to get 33 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and 50 percent by 2030. It also has a cap-and-trade system to put a price on emissions; Quebec is part of that system and Ontario will soon join. Other states ought to join that system, too.", "Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington have also set aggressive targets. Even red states like Iowa, Kansas and Texas have found that it makes economic sense to switch from coal to nonpolluting sources like wind, in part because costs of renewables have dropped sharply. Tucson Electric Power, an Arizona utility, recently announced that it would buy power from a solar farm for less than 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is less than half of what it paid in recent years. Experts say that price is comparable to the cost of power from plants fueled by natural gas. Utilities in North Carolina, Michigan and elsewhere plan to close coal-fired power plants.", "Cities will also play a big role. New York and others are working to increase energy efficiency by updating building codes. They can also reduce emissions while improving public health by investing more in mass transit and electric vehicle charging stations. Businesses like Apple and Google say they intend to get all or nearly all of their energy from renewable sources. And who knows where electric vehicles will take us?", "In 2008, the government projected that carbon emissions from power plants, industry, transportation and buildings would grow about 1 percent a year.

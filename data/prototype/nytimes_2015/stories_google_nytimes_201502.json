{"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/the-stanford-undergraduate-and-the-mentor.html": ["On a weekend in March almost three years ago, Ellie Clougherty flew from London to Rome with Joe Lonsdale. She was a 21-year-old junior at Stanford University, and it was her first trip to Italy. Lonsdale, then 29, was a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and he booked a room for them for two nights in a luxury hotel \u2014 a converted Renaissance mansion in the shadow of the Pantheon \u2014 and arranged a special excursion, with a friend of his who is an architect, to an archaeological site amid the ruins of the Golden House on Palatine Hill, overlooking the Colosseum. Under a light gray sky, they stood on plexiglass bridges and looked down at the uncovered remains of what is thought to be a fabled rotating dining room that the Emperor Nero built for extravagant banquets. Lonsdale is a Roman-history buff, and he told Clougherty about the emperors, praising their civilization and engineering feats.", "The couple also went with Lonsdale\u2019s friend to the Vatican. Clougherty, who is Catholic, was wearing a short dress and a light cardigan. For modesty\u2019s sake, she draped Lonsdale\u2019s sport coat over her shoulders and tied her sweater around her waist. As she walked with reverence in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, she recalls, she touched the foot of a bronze statue of St. Peter and, as many believers do, made a wish. \u201cI asked if God would help me with whatever was happening between me and Joe,\u201d she said, in one of many conversations we had over the past seven months. \u201cIt was like, \u2018I don\u2019t quite understand what this is, but please help.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Clougherty and Lonsdale had been dating over the previous couple of weeks, while he was her assigned mentor for an undergraduate course at Stanford called Technology Entrepreneurship, Engineering 145. The limited-enrollment class offered a combination of academics, business skills and access to Silicon Valley that has made Stanford the most-sought-after university in the country, with the most competitive undergraduate admissions and among the highest donations. More than any other school, Stanford is the gateway to the tech world, and computer science is the most popular major. Each year, new young multimillionaires are minted, some just months after graduation.", "Lonsdale, who also went to Stanford, made much of his fortune by helping to start Palantir Technologies, a major data-mining company. He was among the \u201ctop entrepreneurs and venture capitalists,\u201d according to the course description, many of them alumni, who came to campus as mentors for E145. \u201cStudents will learn how to tell the difference between a good idea in the dorm and a great scalable business opportunity,\u201d the E145 handbook for mentors says. \u201cGuide them and challenge them.\u201d Stanford students are well aware of how valuable these contacts are. Around the time Clougherty took E145, another student\u2019s project, a virtual-payment app, attracted an investment from a Google board member who was a guest speaker in the course. It became the start-up Clinkle, with initial financing of $25 million.", "After sightseeing in Rome, Lonsdale and Clougherty were together in the hotel room they were sharing when she started dressing for evening Mass. Lonsdale came up behind her and kissed her, touching her neck and hair and telling her she was beautiful. She had told him she was a virgin. Both agree they had sex. But what actually went on between them that night, and throughout their yearlong relationship, would become highly contested. After the relationship ended, Clougherty accused Lonsdale of sexual assault. Stanford investigated whether he broke the university\u2019s rule against \u201cconsensual sexual and romantic relationships\u201d between students and their mentors and, later, whether he raped her. The findings from the investigations have sparked a war of allegations and interpretations, culminating last month with dueling lawsuits, filled with damaging accusations. This case, which has been picked up by the media, does not fit neatly into the narratives that have fueled an ongoing national conversation about sexual assault of students on campus. But it exposes the risks of Stanford\u2019s open door to Silicon Valley and the pressure that universities are under to do more for students who say they\u2019ve been raped. It also reveals the complexity of trying to determine the truth in a high-stakes case like this one.", "Growing up in the suburbs of Fairfax County, Virginia, Clougherty thought at one point about becoming a nun. She set that idea aside by age 15 as she became interested in neuroscience. By then she was also a professional model. Clougherty is 5-foot-10, lithe and blond, with an open, \u201calmost luminous\u201d presence, as one of her professors put it. Traveling to catalog shoots for companies like Target and Kohl\u2019s, she missed a lot of school. Her closest relationship was with her mother, Anne, a former systems engineer who sold a software company in 2000 that she started with her brothers and then continued to work for part time. She accompanied her daughter when she modeled, while her husband, an anesthesiologist, stayed home with her three younger brothers.", "Anne took care to protect her daughter from unwanted attention from men. When Clougherty was 10, her family says, a man accosted her in a restaurant on her way to the bathroom. As a teenager trying out for modeling jobs, she would put on heels and makeup for casting calls. \u201cI looked so much older than I was,\u201d Clougherty said. \u201cThere were always just a lot of men, complete strangers, on the subways and in the streets, blocking me off or following me, touching my breasts, grabbing my arm. I\u2019d have to walk through them.\u201d", "Arriving at Stanford in 2009, Clougherty reveled in the spacious bounty of the California campus. \u201cEverything was literally amazing,\u201d she said. Like a lot of her peers, she felt drawn to the powerful industry next door but also anxious about how to find a footing. To network, she frequently went to tech events and mixers, collecting business cards from alumni and others who came to mingle with students.", "Men hold 60 to 70 percent of the jobs at major tech firms, and almost half of tech companies have no female executives at all. Even more than in older, button-down industries, sexual-power dynamics can affect who advances. Many women told me that because they are in the minority, they often find themselves in the role of supplicant when trying to get a job or funding and that men often see professional interactions as sexual opportunities. One Stanford student told me about a male friend who dropped out to start a company and expressed interest in her programming skills. She felt pleased and then realized he saw her only as a datable girl. Another woman, who founded a start-up, described a similar situation. A male executive introduced her to another more powerful man, at a mostly male conference, which she appreciated until it slowly became clear that \u201che was trying to become friends with this very successful entrepreneur by delivering me,\u201d she said.", "At the tech events that Clougherty went to, she was one of few women, and when men pursued her, she often felt overwhelmed and intimidated. She told her mother about it and could feel Anne\u2019s concern radiating through their daily texts and phone calls. In the winter of her sophomore year, Clougherty developed an eating disorder. \u201cI wanted to be invisible,\u201d she told me. Alarmed, Anne flew from Virginia and spent two weeks on campus trying to get her daughter back on track.", "But Clougherty was struggling, and she withdrew from her classes and went home for therapy for her eating disorder, including eight days of inpatient treatment. That spring, she took a trip with her mother to New York, where a photographer they had met through her modeling work introduced her to a friend of his from the tech world: Joe Lonsdale.", "Lonsdale has blue eyes and a wide smile. He grew up in middle-class Fremont, Calif., surrounded by his father\u2019s large extended Irish-Catholic family. He was raised Jewish by his mother, who died when he was 25. At Lonsdale\u2019s elementary school, his father started a chess team that became one of the most successful in California, and the son memorized hundreds of the sequences of moves played by 19th-century masters on his way to becoming a Scholastic chess champion. He learned to code in junior high school and spent most of his time in front of the computer or hanging out in dens and basements with other boys.", "As a Stanford student, he edited the conservative Stanford Review, where he encountered Peter Thiel, its co-founder. Lonsdale advanced in a group of male libertarians who saw the valley as a meritocracy built on pure talent. When Lonsdale graduated in 2004 with a degree in computer science, he went to work for Thiel, who created PayPal. Helping the company fight hackers, Lonsdale learned about weaknesses in the government\u2019s surveillance systems and saw a business opportunity. \u201cIn the valley, people thought we were crazy, because you\u2019re not supposed to build a business based on deals with the government,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe had this very divergent big mission.\u201d", "With early funding from the C.I.A., Lonsdale helped Thiel and others start Palantir. Named for the \u201cseeing stones\u201d in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d the company developed powerful data-mining software for surveillance and won contracts with hundreds of law-enforcement agencies, including the National Security Agency and the Defense Department. In 2009, Lonsdale went on to other ventures but retained a stake in Palantir, whose value would climb to more than $9 billion. In 2011, with a small group of partners, some of whom had close ties to Asia, Lonsdale started the venture-capital fund Formation 8, named for a lucky number in China. Along with starting and financing companies, he has continued to embrace libertarian causes and recently joined the finance team for Senator Rand Paul\u2019s possible Republican presidential campaign. And he sometimes can\u2019t resist showing off his newfound wealth: For a viewing party of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d last year, Lonsdale bought a $30,000 replica of the show\u2019s iron throne, posing on it like the show\u2019s line of blustering and sadistic kings.", "After meeting in New York, Clougherty and Lonsdale struck up an intermittent, bantering email correspondence. Lonsdale mentioned that he had a serious girlfriend. But when Clougherty went back to Stanford in the fall of 2011 for her junior year, he asked her to meet him at a Palo Alto bar for a drink. \u201cI\u2019d love to get together and learn more about your ambitions,\u201d he wrote.", "The following January, Clougherty started E145, which was part of her self-designed major in management science and neuroengineering. She imagined some day starting a company that would find a socially responsible application of neurological research. The E145 professor matched Clougherty\u2019s team of four students with two mentors. Then Clougherty got an email from Lonsdale. \u201cEllie \u2014 is this the class you\u2019re in/do you require mentorship? haha,\u201d he wrote, forwarding a general query the teacher had sent him about mentoring for the course, which Lonsdale had done previously. Later that day, Lonsdale was switched onto Clougherty\u2019s team. In the first weeks of the course, Clougherty and Lonsdale met with other students on the team, and also met alone.", "Late at night on Feb. 7, 2012, Clougherty texted her mother:", "\u201cJoe really really really seriously likes me.\u201d", "\u201cYikes,\u201d Anne wrote back. \u201cHow does this keep happening :)\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve stopped questioning it,\u201d Clougherty answered. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do at this point; thought I could control it once but no, nope, can\u2019t, it\u2019s now officially inevitable.\u201d Emailing a few days later, Clougherty and Lonsdale discovered they were each going to Europe for spring break, and Lonsdale invited her to Rome. \u201cYou are darling,\u201d he wrote when she asked a question about how personalities can interfere with work in the tech field.", "Clougherty\u2019s emails to Lonsdale welcomed his attention. \u201cHAPPY VALENTINES DAY JOE LONSDALE!\u201d she wrote. \u201cI hope to spend more time with you in the near future! Your kindness, integrity, desire to make the world a better place and willingness/confidence to make it happen is severely unique and an incredible thing to witness.\u201d Lonsdale was smitten. He told me that toward the end of his two-year relationship with his previous girlfriend, who was closer to his age, he would feel like \u201cI was in trouble all the time\u201d for working obsessively. But Clougherty was \u201cthis amazing young woman, so energetic and positive. She made me feel like everything I was doing was special.\u201d", "Anne was impressed by Lonsdale\u2019s professional accomplishments, but as we drove through Virginia in October, she said she initially wondered what he saw in her college-age daughter. Anne is a tall, attractive and forceful presence, and she said that at the end of February, she flew to California for parents\u2019 weekend at Stanford, and Clougherty arranged a dinner with Lonsdale. At first, Anne found him awkward. He had a hard time making eye contact, and she noticed his facial tic. (He cuffs his chin with his fist and grimaces.) But her doubts melted, she says, when he promised to guard her daughter from the valley\u2019s wolfish atmosphere. Lonsdale says that the subject did not come up then, but that later he tried to shield Clougherty from other men. \u201cShe said guys were coming after her, and it got me angry,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe\u2019s very beautiful, and you want to protect her.\u201d", "A week later, Lonsdale gave Clougherty a dozen roses and took her on a picnic with caviar, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and sparkling wine in a basket packed by his assistant. Instead of studying at the campus library, Clougherty sat by his fireplace to write her business plan for class. On Lonsdale\u2019s bed, she found a gift of silk pajamas, which she reported to her mother with an \u201c:O,\u201d for open-mouthed. A couple of weeks later, he gave her a book about Julius Caesar, with the inscription \u201cTo Ellie \u2014 who helps me see the world with a new sense of wonder. Let\u2019s explore and conquer together.\u201d Because Clougherty already had plane tickets for her trip to Europe, her mother emailed with Lonsdale\u2019s assistant about rearranging her daughter\u2019s itinerary. Lonsdale and Clougherty planned to meet in London, and he bought her a ticket for his flight to Rome.", "When Clougherty got back to campus in April, she had a newly glamorous life. Lonsdale sent cars to pick her up at her dorm so she could meet him in San Francisco. They saw each other regularly, carving out time between her classes and his fund-raising trips for Formation 8. One friend of Clougherty\u2019s told me that she occasionally went out with the couple to extravagant events: \u201cIt was a cool life to be living \u2014 I thought she was experiencing a lot.\u201d But Jane, another friend of Clougherty\u2019s, whom she had known since freshman year, was more skeptical. She said she thought that Lonsdale was too old for Clougherty and told her so. After the Rome trip, it took Clougherty a few weeks to tell Jane, who asked me to use her nickname, that she had lost her virginity. \u201cBefore that, she\u2019d said that as a Catholic, she wanted to wait for marriage, so she didn\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut when she did tell me, she made being with Joe sound romantic.\u201d", "Late in April, Lonsdale and Clougherty flew to New York, where they met her mother. He got the three of them on the list for a posh event on the top of the Standard Hotel for the Tribeca Film Festival. Anne began to ask Lonsdale for his advice about business ventures, including one to rebrand Haitian products like coffee and chocolate. \u201cIf you could give me an introduction,\u201d she wrote in an email after seeing him in New York, \u201cthat would be great.\u201d", "Clougherty and Lonsdale started talking about a summer project she could do for Formation 8. They settled on a survey of \u201cdisruptive\u201d technology, and Clougherty invited a friend from high school, Rachel, to come to California and work on it with her. Anne found them an apartment in Palo Alto. Lonsdale paid the rent. \u201cIt was a very weird summer,\u201d Rachel told me over Skype. Lonsdale flew her and Clougherty to New York in July for a swank networking event and put them up at the St. Regis. But the survey they were supposed to complete went unfunded and unfinished. Spending evenings with Lonsdale and Clougherty, Rachel felt like a third wheel. She also found Lonsdale condescending. When Lonsdale hosted dinners at his house with other executives, Rachel said, she and Clougherty were sometimes the only women, and Rachel felt they were belittled. Sometimes Clougherty would sit on his lap. \u201cIt was like she was the pretty wallpaper,\u201d Rachel said. He talked about marrying Clougherty and made jokes like, \u201c\u2009\u2018I have no power with you \u2014 I\u2019m a powerful man but I\u2019m at your mercy,\u2019\u2009\u201d Rachel said. Clougherty told me that she wanted to believe she and Lonsdale could eventually be equals, using their joint influence for good. \u201cI thought it would be so nice to have the chance to have an impact,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are respectable women married to respectable guys in the valley. I wanted to think, I could be happy like that, too.\u201d", "In emails Clougherty wrote at the time, she told Lonsdale that she found him attractive. \u201cKiss kiss kiss, you are super handsome,\u201d she wrote in June, and later, \u201cYou are a sexy man\u201d and \u201cIt was so nice sleeping with you.\u201d But around the same time, she also told Rachel that she never wanted to have sex with Lonsdale, beginning in Rome. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be having sex, but he\u2019s not listening to me,\u2019\u2009\u201d Rachel said.", "Rachel said she thought Lonsdale was manipulating Clougherty into spending the night at his house. \u201cI could see on her face that she didn\u2019t want to go, and then he\u2019d start his trick. \u2018You don\u2019t want to spend time with me?\u2019\u2009\u201d Rachel talked about her concerns with Anne. Together they counseled Clougherty to explain to Lonsdale that she did not want to be spending nights with him. She said she did, but the nights together continued. \u201cThey had sex again, and she was upset about it, clearly,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cI reacted strongly. I said, \u2018This is your decision.\u2019 Her mom was there too. Then I realized Ellie felt a little upset. She felt we were judging her.\u201d", "Around the same time, Anne was emailing with Lonsdale about his plans to buy a new house. During that summer, she came out to look at real estate with the couple and attended the wedding of Lonsdale\u2019s father. Lonsdale\u2019s younger brother and other relatives complained that Anne was inserting herself into every corner of his life, and worried that she and Clougherty were after his wealth. But he brushed them off. \u201cThey thought I was a na\u00efve guy screwing up, but I was in love,\u201d he said.", "In August, Lonsdale took Clougherty on a 10-day trip to raise money for Formation 8 in Hong Kong, Beijing and Seoul. Clougherty had no official role, but she was thrilled to be included in high-level meetings, with industry leaders like the chief executive of the Internet giant Baidu, and prided herself on helping Lonsdale. \u201cI was on high alert to absorb everything I could, so I could be socially aware for him,\u201d she said. \u201cLike if he wasn\u2019t fully listening to someone, I would say a few lines to cover.\u201d At the end of the trip, she expressed gratitude, writing to Lonsdale, \u201cI love how much you trust me to bring me to all your meetings bc I literally couldn\u2019t imagine a more awesome thing I\u2019d rather do!\u201d", "But the trip also had difficult patches. In an email Lonsdale wrote to Clougherty after they returned, he acknowledged that she complained about not eating regularly and that they argued about religion. After they got home, she found old copies of Playboy magazine in his bureau drawer and became furious. Lonsdale told her she was overreacting. \u201cI am really scared by how you are super positive about me one day \u2014 too much so \u2014 and then super negative the next,\u201d he emailed. \u201cThis binary swinging between things is hurtful, and it\u2019s also very immature.\u201d She apologized in a long letter that described her struggle to recover from her eating disorder the previous year, including the inpatient treatment, which she had found terrifying. \u201cSometimes I think it would have been so much better had you met me a year from now, when I\u2019m fully healed,\u201d she wrote. Lonsdale thanked her for being open. \u201cI think you will be all healed soon, and I hope I can help,\u201d he wrote.", "At the end of September, Lonsdale rented out the Hearst Castle, on the California coast, for a lavish 30th-birthday party with hundreds of guests. He was also celebrating the third anniversary of Addepar, a data-based platform for wealth management that he co-founded. The company\u2019s logo, lit from behind, loomed above an outdoor pool at the castle. Clougherty\u2019s parents flew out for the occasion, taking to the dance floor while their daughter circulated as hostess, wearing an embroidered cream-colored gown by Sue Wong that she and her mother shopped for. \u201cIt was like being a princess at a ball,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt seemed magical on the surface.\u201d At the end of the evening, Lonsdale broke the castle rules by jumping into one of the pools.", "But over the autumn and winter, their relationship frayed. Lonsdale hit a crucial period of fund-raising for Formation 8, and Clougherty expressed resentment when he would ask her to come over late at night. He responded impatiently. \u201cI don\u2019t know what analogy makes sense to you, and Odysseus is probably not the right one,\u201d he wrote in the fall. \u201cBut I am on a really big, difficult, critical mission the next several weeks.\u201d It would be hard for the relationship to work, he warned, \u201cif my darling is actually just sort of annoyed at me and isn\u2019t in a position where of course she is eager to see me anytime I can.\u201d", "In December 2012, Lonsdale wrote Clougherty a long email. \u201cWe are dealing with serious relationship dysfunction,\u201d he began, and laid out a list of examples in bullet points. The first read: \u201cSometimes I feel it\u2019s very clear you are eager to engage sexually, but other times you will talk about me taking advantage of you and forcing myself on you as if there is this dirty old man/young innocent student dynamic, and I should feel badly about it. We will do something and then just a bit later you\u2019ll talk as if \u2018how can I stop you from making me do that?\u2019 and yet earlier I honestly thought you wanted to.\u201d", "Lonsdale spent Christmas with Clougherty at her family\u2019s home. They fought about a number of things, including the fact that he didn\u2019t bring her a Christmas present. When he got home, Lonsdale broke up with her over email. When she returned to Stanford in the beginning of January, they started seeing each other again for what they called a trial period. Jane told Clougherty that she thought it was a bad idea for them to get back together. She says Clougherty told her that Lonsdale wanted to have sex \u201call the time\u201d and that during it, he would put his hand on her throat. She didn\u2019t think her friend was ready for the sexual relationship that Clougherty said Lonsdale wanted.", "On Jan. 7, she texted Anne: \u201cI\u2019m scared for Ellie. I don\u2019t want her with Joe at all. In fact, I worry about her safety. The guy is a jackass. What\u2019s going on there? I feel like I may be the only one at school who can look out for her.\u201d", "\u201cI think you r the only one who looks out for her,\u201d Anne said.", "\u201cBut what is she thinking?\u201d Jane replied. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard it sounds horrific and the guy is a psycho. I feel like I\u2019ve failed her because she doesn\u2019t realize she doesn\u2019t have to put up with someone like that. There are so many other unbroken people out there. Anne, I hate to say this but this guy definitely seems like the type who would abuse her.\u201d", "\u201cHmm,\u201d Anne responded. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is that aggressive. More like a little clueless.\u201d", "But in a mid-February phone call, Clougherty told her mother that she was having a hard time making it to class, was not eating and was spending hours in her dorm room alone. Anne was worried. \u201cI was saying, \u2018Why can\u2019t you just not be with him, why can\u2019t you go to class, why can\u2019t you go to the cafeteria, why can\u2019t you be in control of your life?\u2019\u2009\u201d Anne said. \u201cOver the phone, there were just these long silences. I thought, Something is dramatically wrong with her.\u201d", "Clougherty\u2019s fragility reminded Anne of the state her daughter was in when she had to leave school more than a year earlier. She decided to go to California again. On the flight, she read a book suggested by a friend who had been in an abusive relationship called \u201cWhy Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men,\u201d by a domestic-violence counselor, Lundy Bancroft. The book riveted Anne. She saw Lonsdale in the descriptions of an abuser and she saw Clougherty in the role of a victim in denial. Anne got to Stanford bent on an urgent rescue. \u201cI was bringing my daughter home no matter what,\u201d she said.", "Anne took her daughter to a hotel and gave her Bancroft\u2019s book. Clougherty stayed up late reading and writing, going back and forth between the book and her computer. The next morning, sitting up in bed, she typed furiously on her laptop: \u201cIf I said no, he would slowly convince me/make it look like he was going to die if I didn\u2019t climb on top of him. He would freak out when I mentioned I wanted to slow things down, even if it meant having sex only once each time I would see him. One time I cried hysterically because it freaked me out and he wouldn\u2019t listen to me but he would then immediately start crying way harder than me saying he felt like a creepy old man and didn\u2019t want to feel that way. I felt compelled to comfort him even though I was the one who felt violated.\u201d", "Clougherty decided she wanted to \u201cescape.\u201d She met Lonsdale in a Palo Alto park in late February, and they broke up while Anne and Jane waited for her in a nearby wine bar. When Anne went home a few days later, Jane tried to help Clougherty by deleting Lonsdale from her Facebook account and taking her out bowling and for ice cream.", "\u201cThere has to be zero contact,\u201d Jane texted Anne.", "On March 1, Clougherty went to Stanford\u2019s counseling center. She said that Lonsdale had forced her to have sex when she didn\u2019t want to and also talked about the man who accosted her in the restaurant bathroom when she was 10. The university psychologist noted in a report that she \u201cseems to have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder from current and past trauma.\u201d Clougherty went home to Virginia and spent days crying and rocking in a corner of her family\u2019s living room. Clougherty embarked on therapy twice a week with Keith Saylor, a clinical psychologist who treated her eating disorder. He used prolonged-exposure therapy, a treatment developed for combat-related disorders, in which a therapist prompts a patient to describe deeply traumatic events. Later, patients listen to tapes of their sessions at home every day in an attempt to drain the memories of their power.", "With Clougherty\u2019s permission, I listened to tapes of their 90-minute sessions. As he typically does when conducting prolonged-exposure therapy, Saylor reflected back Clougherty\u2019s account, saying that she had experienced \u201cmultiple traumas over a prolonged period of time that did repeated damage.\u201d In one session, he told Clougherty, repeating her words, that Lonsdale \u201cheld you captive,\u201d continuing, \u201cYou were essentially brainwashed over a year.\u201d", "On the tapes, Clougherty swallows sobs and speaks in a thin, small voice. She described particular sexual acts that she didn\u2019t want to take part in and how Lonsdale cajoled, begged and insisted until she gave in. She also said that during sex he slapped and shoved her and put his hands around her neck. \u201cIt was rape in a sadomasochist way nine times a day,\u201d she said. In a later session, Saylor again mirrored what she told him: \u201cYou didn\u2019t have personal agency, you didn\u2019t have personal choice, all of those things had been robbed from you.\u201d", "Initially, Clougherty told Saylor, as she had said to her friends, that she had sex for the first time with Lonsdale in Rome. Weeks into therapy, Clougherty said that early in the mentorship for E145, Lonsdale picked her up around 10 p.m. near campus for what she thought would be a quick dinner nearby so they could talk about the class project. Without asking, she said, he took the highway south to his house in the Los Altos hills. When they went inside for dinner, Clougherty said, he surprised her by yanking her into a bedroom located off the kitchen and throwing her down on a king-size bed covered with a fur spread. He raped her, she said. Lonsdale denies that he drove her to his house without inviting her first and says he never raped her.", "Before she went into therapy, Clougherty told me, she didn\u2019t want to admit even to herself that she had been raped. She wanted to believe that the relationship was loving, and she also felt she had a lot to lose. \u201cIt was like I could call him a rapist, and I could get judged and get in big trouble and not know how to handle it or I could say, \u2018He\u2019s great, look at these emails, I want to date that person,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201cTrauma therapy was the first time I felt allowed to talk about how I felt.\u201d", "In the course of the therapy, Clougherty came to reject the term \u201crelationship,\u201d or even \u201cabusive relationship,\u201d to characterize her year with Lonsdale. She now calls it a \u201cpsychological kidnapping,\u201d a term she came up with after watching a video about domestic abuse on the Internet, and she says she was raped every time she and Lonsdale had sex. Saylor, who agreed to speak with me at Clougherty\u2019s request, said, \u201cPeople in these kinds of dramatic circumstances sometimes don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d He also said that prolonged-exposure therapy doesn\u2019t \u201cencourage perspective-taking\u201d and that Lonsdale might have an entirely different view of the relationship. \u201cMy role is not to question her veracity but to help her get well.\u201d", "Clougherty finished her coursework for Stanford online when she was at home. During that time she decided she wanted Stanford to intervene. In May 2013, she and her parents went back to campus to ask the university to investigate Lonsdale\u2019s conduct. Her friend Jane saw this as a setback for Clougherty: \u201cI said, \u2018Oh, no, you should move on.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Meanwhile on campuses throughout the country, a movement was taking shape. A growing number of students were coming forward to criticize their universities for the handling of sexual-assault cases. They had support from the government. In 2011, the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education sent a letter to every college and university in the country that receives federal funding, as almost all do, clarifying that under Title IX, the federal law passed in 1972 to prevent sex discrimination in education, colleges and universities had an obligation to prevent and respond to sexual violence and harassment. \u201cOnce a school knows or reasonably should know of possible sexual violence, it must take immediate and appropriate action to investigate or otherwise determine what occurred,\u201d the letter from the Office of Civil Rights warned.", "The government also instructed schools to adopt a new standard for determining the outcome of a sexual-harassment or violence case. At the time, many schools used the standard of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence, meaning that the adjudicators (usually a panel of administrators or faculty) believed that it was substantially more likely than not, or roughly 75 percent likely, that the accused had committed the offense. The letter from the civil rights office demanded that schools switch to a lower standard of proof, a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of evidence, meaning that it was more likely than not \u2014 above 50.01 percent \u2014 that the offense was committed. The office noted that preponderance is the standard that courts use to decide civil suits for sexual harassment. A few schools, including Princeton and Harvard, initially refused the new standard and then found themselves under investigation for suspected Title IX violations.", "Stanford quickly followed the mandate by adopting the preponderance standard. The university also adopted a policy requiring full investigations when students reported sexual harassment and assault. In May 2013, Clougherty submitted to Stanford a written account of her sexual-assault and harassment allegations, including selected texts and emails. The university appears to have initially investigated only whether Lonsdale broke the rules against consensual relationships between mentors and mentees, which the university treats as \u201cinherently unequal,\u201d like relationships between teachers and students. Stanford said it cannot comment on any sexual-assault case unless a student waives his or her privacy protections under federal law. But Lisa Lapin, a spokeswoman for the university, wrote in an email that in light of these constraints \u201cwhen unhappy parties tell their version of the stories to the press, it\u2019s no wonder that in virtually every case, the university ends up being portrayed in a highly negative light.\u201d", "Marcia Pope, an outside investigator hired by the university, from the law firm Pillsbury, interviewed Lonsdale without a lawyer. He said that he didn\u2019t know about the rule against consensual relationships between mentors and mentees, which is posted on the university\u2019s website but was not included in the mentor handbook for E145. In June, Stanford found that Lonsdale had violated this rule and said he could not mentor undergraduates for 10 years.", "Lonsdale was unhappy with the decision, but to Clougherty and her mother, the penalty seemed negligible. They were confused about why Stanford hadn\u2019t looked into her sexual-assault allegations. In November 2013, they attended a conference on gender-based violence at Harvard and heard a talk given by Diane Rosenfeld, a Harvard lecturer and lawyer. \u201cDiane said, \u2018You have these rights in Title IX,\u2019 and that\u2019s when it clicked,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI chased her into the bathroom and said: \u2018You have to meet my daughter. We need your help.\u2019\u2009\u201d", "Rosenfeld agreed to represent Clougherty in negotiations with Stanford and Lonsdale over her allegations of sexual harassment and assault and gave her a refrigerator magnet with the slogan \u201cYou Are Pure Potential.\u201d The next month, Stanford, Clougherty, Lonsdale and their lawyers met for a daylong mediation. Before the meeting Clougherty texted Jane: \u201cTotally joe take down scheme!\u201d (Clougherty says \u201cscheme\u201d wasn\u2019t a good choice of words; she meant she was \u201ctaking down a rapist.\u201d) Clougherty settled with the university for an undisclosed amount. A few days later, Clougherty received a settlement proposal from Lonsdale. It contained a blanket nondisclosure provision that Clougherty did not want to sign and the deal fell through. Lonsdale vehemently denies making a settlement offer.", "Around the same time, Jane texted Clougherty: \u201cDude just settle so you can move on. This is going to become your life.\u201d", "Shortly after that, Stanford opened a new investigation into Clougherty\u2019s sexual-harassment and assault allegations. Stanford had learned that Lonsdale had dated another student after he and Clougherty broke up. Pope, the outside investigator, started contacting witnesses. She talked to Clougherty\u2019s friend Rachel, who described the troubling sexual dynamic she felt she had seen between Lonsdale and Clougherty over the summer. Pope also spoke to the second Stanford student that Lonsdale dated. Clougherty knew her and was convinced that she had also been abused. But the woman told Pope that her relationship with Lonsdale was consensual and not abusive. When I got in touch with her, she declined to comment.", "At the time Stanford was examining Clougherty\u2019s allegation, the school was also addressing fallout from another investigation. Three female students were privately confronting administrators after realizing that they all reported sexual violence, including choking, involving the same male student over three years. According to university documents, the man didn\u2019t deny the choking when Stanford questioned him in 2012 and was allowed to remain on campus. Then last June another case came to the surface. Public protests erupted after Leah Francis, a senior, spoke out when Stanford refused to expel a male student after the university found he had sexually assaulted her. (Since 1997, 25 sexual-harassment and sexual-assault cases have gone through Stanford\u2019s disciplinary process. Ten students have been found culpable; only one was expelled.)", "Two weeks later, the university reached a new decision regarding Lonsdale. Stanford now found that he had engaged in sexual misconduct and harassment during his relationship with Clougherty and banned him from campus \u201cfor any purpose.\u201d After 10 years, he could apply to return; Stanford \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d him to seek counseling for sexual misconduct and relationship violence.", "\u201cWhen we ask someone to stay away from campus, it\u2019s because we have a concern about that person\u2019s impact on the community and certainly on students,\u201d a senior university counsel, Lauren Schoenthaler, told me. Yet since the ban was imposed last June, Lonsdale has been invited to campus for a private lunch, which he attended with the university\u2019s permission. (Stanford says it declined other requests from Lonsdale to come to campus.) He was also featured on Stanford\u2019s website as a mentor for StartX, a business accelerator that supports companies founded by students. When I asked Schoenthaler in December about Lonsdale\u2019s online university presence, she said StartX would move off Stanford\u2019s website. As of Feb. 6, it was still there.", "In the last few months, Stanford and other schools have felt the ground shift beneath them once again. Some critics are now charging that universities are overcompensating for past mistreatment of victims. Even as they\u2019re attacked for giving victims short shrift, schools are also being denounced for inadequately protecting the rights of the accused. In October, 28 members of the Harvard law-school faculty wrote a letter, published in The Boston Globe, deploring the procedures the university adopted to follow the mandate from the Office of Civil Rights for lacking \u201cthe most basic elements of fairness and due process\u201d and being \u201coverwhelmingly stacked against the accused.\u201d Around the country, about three dozen men are suing universities over findings or punishments for sexual infractions. In a short span of time, a well-intentioned effort to right a seemingly obvious wrong has fed additional claims of injustice.", "Lonsdale says that he believes Stanford\u2019s treatment of him was influenced by student activism and the protests over Leah Francis\u2019s case. \u201cEveryone believes the woman,\u201d he told me in December as we sat at a small conference table in New York for two hours with two lawyers and a public-relations strategist.", "Lonsdale seemed nervous, well coached and eager to stress his commitment to gender equality. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to be with a woman I respect,\u201d he said. Since Stanford\u2019s findings against him last June, he has promoted women\u2019s causes, judging a hackathon to fight the sexual exploitation of girls (alongside three women with excellent tech credentials) and writing an article in The Stanford Review with the headline \u201cEconomic Conservatives Should Champion Female Technologists.\u201d", "Describing his relationship with Clougherty, Lonsdale played down his authority and played up hers. \u201cEllie is a forceful person,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I did anything she thought was wrong, she\u2019d express it.\u201d Later, he stressed the point again, saying, \u201cShe is very vocal about what she wants and doesn\u2019t want.\u201d He dismissed his role as her E145 mentor as a \u201csupercasual thing.\u201d He had older friends who also dated undergraduates, he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was any big deal.\u201d", "Lonsdale and his lawyers told me that when Pope, the Stanford investigator, asked to interview Lonsdale for a second time in December 2013, he declined and submitted a statement in writing. In Lonsdale\u2019s description of the relationship, he says that he and Clougherty were in love and she never said no to sex or even expressed ambivalence in the moment. I asked about the email he sent shortly before he broke up with her in December 2012, complaining that she sometimes said he was \u201cforcing\u201d himself on her. Lonsdale said the problem wasn\u2019t Clougherty\u2019s lack of consent. It was that she sometimes felt bad after the fact. \u201cThere was a lot of stuff around the Catholic guilt,\u201d he said, \u201cabout how she didn\u2019t like being addicted to the body.\u201d", "Despite all the turns the case had taken, until I asked Lonsdale about it, he said he had never heard Clougherty\u2019s accusation that he raped her that night at his house. It seemed to startle him. \u201cI didn\u2019t rape her,\u201d he said with emotion. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have sex until Rome. This is a whole new thing. She is scarred and broken, and she is making stories up.\u201d He looked around at his lawyers and then back at me. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m some sort of crazy monster.\u201d", "It\u2019s hard to tell whether Stanford sees Lonsdale as a real threat. In a letter to him and Clougherty in June 2014 after the second investigation, the university stated only that on several occasions Clougherty expressed that she didn\u2019t want \u201cthe sexual contact in question.\u201d The university didn\u2019t explain the meaning or limits of this vague phrase. There is no police investigation in this case, no indictment laying out charges and nothing from a judge or jury to specify what Lonsdale was found guilty or not guilty of. Instead of the transparency of open court, Stanford offered opacity.", "Stanford\u2019s rules explicitly grant a right of appeal to students, faculty and staff but include conflicting statements about whether other members of the university community may appeal. Lonsdale\u2019s lawyers asked the university to reopen the case once more. In November, after I contacted Lonsdale, his lawyers submitted to Stanford hundreds of pages of his email correspondence with Clougherty and her mother that they hadn\u2019t previously provided. Stanford has not decided whether to consider this evidence, along with an eight-page sworn statement Lonsdale gave the university from an unexpected source: Clougherty\u2019s friend Jane.", "In the months after Jane helped Clougherty break up with Lonsdale, she says that she watched with increasing unease as Clougherty\u2019s accusations mounted, from emotional abuse to rape. \u201cIn March 2014, she texted me that she considered herself a \u2018sex slave\u2019 during her relationship with Joe,\u201d Jane wrote in her statement. \u201cThis is far, far beyond anything that she ever said about the relationship when it was happening or for a long time afterward. It also made no sense in light of her clear enthusiasm about the relationship.\u201d", "Jane told me by phone that the breaking point in her friendship with Clougherty came when Stanford began the second investigation of Lonsdale. Jane says she thought the investigation was not warranted and told Clougherty that she would not talk to Pope. Clougherty sent her three texts in April 2014: \u201cHey, all the investigators need to know is that you witnessed my escape from Joe and saw him pounding on the steering wheel.\u201d \u201cDid you really decline to speak with them?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand, I thought you\u2019d support me.\u201d On the night of the break up, Anne and Jane were sitting in the wine bar waiting for Clougherty. They saw Lonsdale drive up with Clougherty. In Anne\u2019s account, she and Jane could see Lonsdale pounding on the steering wheel. Jane jumped up and went outside to knock on the window of the car and make sure Clougherty was O.K.", "Jane, though, told me that \u201cthe conversation in the car looked completely normal.\u201d She added: \u201cI didn\u2019t go outside. She came in, and I thought, Great! She\u2019s fine, and it\u2019s over.\u201d She gave a short, bitter laugh. \u201cThey asked me to lie, and I said no. Ellie yelled at me over the phone.\u201d She gave another short laugh. \u201cShe hung up on me after five years of helping her through all her life issues and crises, all the calls from Anne, \u2018Will you look after Ellie?\u2019 All of that, only to be put to the side when I won\u2019t do what they want me to do.\u201d She paused. \u201cIn retrospect, I understand. I was used.\u201d Clougherty said she never asked Jane to lie: \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was mad at me. We just wanted her to say she was a witness to me breaking up with him.\u201d", "Jane, who works in tech, says she got in touch with Lonsdale late last summer. \u201cI thought, He needs to know what I know,\u201d she said. I asked whether she considered that helping Lonsdale might benefit her professionally. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a hero, but I don\u2019t need Joe\u2019s help,\u201d she said. \u201cMy job is going great.\u201d", "In her sworn statement, Jane wrote, \u201cIf I sensed, even remotely, that the relationship was in any way abusive, I would have talked to Ellie\u2019s mom about it.\u201d I asked her about the texts she wrote to Anne two years ago, which conveyed just this sort of distrust of Lonsdale and fear for Clougherty, reading them to her over the phone.", "At first, Jane said she didn\u2019t remember writing the messages. She later said she recalled them and the concern she felt then, but said that her fears, which were based on Clougherty\u2019s account, seem exaggerated now that she was older and more experienced herself. She and Clougherty haven\u2019t spoken since their phone call nine months ago.", "Clougherty is currently a student at the University of Virginia, enrolled in a master\u2019s program in data science and living with her brother, also a student, in a Charlottesville apartment their mother found them. After Rolling Stone published its story of a lurid fraternity gang rape in November, Clougherty and Anne arranged a meeting with the university president, Teresa Sullivan. On the day before Thanksgiving, they spent a couple of hours sitting in front of a fire at Sullivan\u2019s home, drinking hot chocolate and talking about the effects of trauma. Clougherty gave Sullivan a beaded bracelet she had made and was thrilled when Sullivan mentioned the gift in a major speech on campus the following week, calling Clougherty the survivor of a \u201cbrutal assault inflicted on her at another university.\u201d", "Rolling Stone soon apologized for its gang-rape story after key facts were discredited. Clougherty and her mother were rattled but undeterred about speaking out. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy decision, but I just see it as a moral obligation,\u201d Clougherty said. \u201cI really want to help other women.\u201d In January, Clougherty filed a civil suit against Lonsdale, accusing him of sexual abuse. She called his behavior \u201cviolent and deviant,\u201d saying he employed \u201cpsychological manipulation and coercion\u201d including \u201cisolation, sleep deprivation, food deprivation.\u201d She also accused him of \u201cstrangling her, slapping her, scratching her, yanking her by the hair so hard that he would lift her torso off the bed and slamming her body against the walls and bed boards.\u201d In addition, she sued Formation 8 for being negligent in its supervision during the summer she was doing the project with Rachel. The lawsuit states that she \u201cwrote him numerous emails and love letters to let him know how much she cared about him in the hope that it would end the abuse.\u201d", "In response to Clougherty\u2019s lawsuit, Lonsdale mounted a swift counterattack, calling it \u201ca vengeful, personal attack by a disturbed former girlfriend\u201d in an email to friends and associates. He also said that Stanford\u2019s investigation was \u201ca Kafka-esque nightmare.\u201d He linked to Clougherty\u2019s emails, posting them on a website his team created overnight, highlighting the most affectionate and admiring passages and arguing that she was unstable. Lonsdale also sued Clougherty for defamation. (In the wake of the lawsuits, Formation 8 has been criticized in the press for not disclosing that Lonsdale was banned from Stanford.) He blamed himself only for being na\u00efve.", "As this battle is waged in court, Stanford and other universities may improve their handling of future sexual-assault and harassment cases. The policies they have put in place since the government\u2019s 2011 directive will surely turn out to be a draft that they rewrite over time. (Stanford has a task force working on the issue.) Universities are legally obligated to investigate and referee claims like Clougherty\u2019s, and the imbalance of power inherent in these entanglements is of real concern.", "At the same time, the role the government has cast universities in is not a natural one. They are not the police. Yet they are asked to grapple with criminal accusations even when the events in question are receding into the past and are deeply difficult to deconstruct.

How can the absence of color be so gorgeous? Black and white is so tonally unified, so tone-poetic. Shadows seem more natural, like structural elements of the composition. The dated look of the films is itself an image of time, like the varnish on old paintings that becomes inextricable from their visual resonance. There is also a special pleasure in having had someone else choose the film. Netflix, with its plenitude of options, asks for a decision, for an accounting of tastes; but TCM unburdens you of choice and asks for only curiosity and an appetite for surprise. The freedom to choose is like the freedom to speak: There is never too much of it, but there is sometimes too much of its consequences. Education proceeds by means of other people\u2019s choices. Otherwise it is just customization, or electronically facilitated narcissism. Let Mr. Osborne decide!", "There is something more that draws me to TCM\u2019s old stuff. Those films have an integrity that most of today\u2019s films almost always lack. The integrity is physical; it is owed to the certainty that no computer interfered with anything. We like to refer to the illusion of the movies, but the illusion in those movies was less illusory. The people in them did what they were filmed doing.

(I once had the strange pleasure of acting \u2014 though that is too grand a term for what I turned in \u2014 against a green screen. It was extremely disorienting, trying to suggest a narrative context in a setting of total decontextualization.) The old movies owe their power partly to the limited technical resources that were available to the people who made them. Their artifice was truer. Their fictions seemed less fictive. For the most special effects of all are the effects of no effects.", "If watching old movies is a form of escapism, it is at least not an escape from the human world.

This is a new frontier in child development research, and Dr. Danovitch is one of the pioneers. In a recent study, she had preschoolers watch videos of adults using two computers to answer questions like \u201cWhat is the color of grass?\u201d One computer consistently gave accurate information, and one gave inaccurate information. The children were subsequently asked which computer they would prefer to look up something. By age 4, most children picked the computer that had been accurate.", "The study suggests that when it comes to online sources, children use a reasonable strategy: Trust the ones that have been right before. Previous research indicates this is precisely what children do with people.", "So maybe children are no worse at judging online sources than they are at judging people, at least when they have information about prior accuracy. But what happens in real life, when they don\u2019t? Dr. Danovitch speculates that children will become savvier as they gain experience watching others interact with online sources, and interacting with them firsthand. For example, at some point they will realize that online information comes from human sources, which will likely make them less trusting.", "Researchers haven\u2019t figured out when children reach that point. When I asked a few preschoolers where online information came from, most just stared at me blankly.

This week\u2019s conversation is with Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff, a professor of philosophy at Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center. She was the president of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, for 2012-13. She is the author of \u201cVisible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self.\u201d \u2014 George Yancy", "George Yancy: What is the relationship between your identity as a Latina philosopher and the philosophical interrogation of race in your work?", "Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff: Every single person has a racial identity, at least in Western societies, and so one might imagine that the topic of race is of universal interest. Yet for those of us who are not white \u2014 or less fully white, shall I say \u2014 the reality of race is shoved in our faces in particularly unsettling ways, often from an early age. This can spark reflection as well as nascent social critique.", "The relationship between my identity and my philosophical interest in race is simply a continuation through the tools of philosophy the pursuit that I began as a kid, growing up in Florida in the 1960s, watching the civil rights movement as it was portrayed in the media and perceived by the various parts of my family, white and nonwhite. I experienced school desegregation, the end of Jim Crow, and the war in Indochina, a war that also made apparent the racial categories used to differentiate peoples, at enormous cost. It was clear to me from a young age that \u201cwe\u201d were the ones with no value for life, at least the life of those who were not white.", "My sister and I came to the southern United States from Panama as young children, and had to negotiate our complex identities (mixed-race Latina and white) within a social world where racial borders were being challenged and renegotiated and, as a result, ceaselessly patrolled and violently defended.", "G.Y.: So, given these early experiences, were you drawn to philosophical questions of racial identity?", "In philosophy I was drawn to topics of knowledge (epistemology) and metaphysics, never ethics, which may seem odd given this background. But the issue of metaphysics raised questions about how we name what is, and the issue of epistemology raised questions about how we know what we think we know. Hence, these sub-fields opened the way for me to consider the contestations over reality as well as over authority. Of course, the received canon in philosophy was both useful and infuriatingly silent on the topics I was most interested in: bodies showed up little, and difference was routinely set aside, and yet the debates over mereological essentialism and other concepts illustrated the possibility of multiple right answers and of a social and practical context silently guiding the debate. Quine was in vogue and his ideas about contingent rather than necessary ways to name what is was a short step from the political analysis of dominant ways of naming that I was interested in.", "For many years my personal and my philosophical life were lived as parallel tracks with little overt interaction. I went to demonstrations, and then came home to finish my Heidegger homework. I glanced across the fence now and then, but did not attempt serious philosophical engagement with race until I had published enough that had nothing to do with race or gender or Latin American philosophy to establish a foothold in the profession. Tenure set me free, and I immediately began a project on the metaphysics of mixed-race identities.", "G.Y.: You mentioned how questions of embodiment were not treated in any substantive way in your early philosophical training. Why is it that the profession of philosophy, generally speaking, is still resistant to questions of embodiment and by extension questions of race?", "L.M.A.: In my view this is primarily a methodological problem. Philosophers of nearly all persuasions \u2014 analytic, continental, pragmatist \u2014 aim for general and generalizable theories that can explain human experience of all sorts. And the ultimate aim, of course, is not description but prescription: how can we come to understand ourselves better, to know better, to understand our world better, and to treat each other better? Worthy goals, but they are usually pursued with a decontextualized approach, as if the best answers would work for everyone. To get at that meta-level of generality, some aspects of one\u2019s context need to be set aside, lopped off, cut out of the picture, and this has traditionally meant the concrete materiality of human existence as we actually experience it in embodied human form.", "This is just a way of saying that the body had to be ignored except in so far as we could imagine our bodies to be essentially the same. And to achieve that trick of imagination \u2014 to imagine all of our wild diversity in embodiment to be irrelevant \u2014 required a bad faith that can be seen throughout the canon: racist asides and ridiculous theories about women alongside generic pronouncements about justice and beauty and the route to truth.", "I call it bad faith because, on the one hand, nearly all the great philosophers divided human beings into moral and intellectual hierarchies even while, on the other hand, they presumed, from their consciously particularist space, to speak for all. Hence, methodologically, the problem for philosophy is how to speak for all when one does not, in fact, speak to all. And the solution is to enact a doublespeak in which one justifies not speaking to the mass of humanity at the same time that one imagines oneself to be speaking for the human core which exists in all of us. The body, and difference, is simultaneously acknowledged and disavowed.", "This is why philosophers such as Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas in the 16th century and W.E.B. DuBois from even his early writings in the 19th century are such powerful figures: They each explore their own specificity and its impact on how they view the world and others, even to how they formulate moral questions. They model a discourse that can become part of a general dialogue in which others can have a voice as well.", "G.Y.: Yes. I understand your point about methodology and bad faith. Speak to how this presumption to speak for others, to place under erasure our diversity of embodiment, is something that is linked specifically to whiteness, especially within the context of our field, which continues to be dominated by white males.", "L.M.A.: Entitlement is a core feature of white subjectivity, as numerous works by sociologists such as Joe Feagin document. There is a sense of entitlement to rights and resources, comfort and attention, access to space and to deference, or being granted presumptive credibility until proven otherwise. Entitlement is always complicated and modified by class, gender, religion and sexuality; poor whites, for example, learn early on to defer to others. But white people as a whole, or as an imagined grouping, are the presumed paradigms of rights-bearing American citizens. And this seeps into one\u2019s consciousness.", "It is inevitable that these social realities will find some manifestation in white-majority (or even exclusively white) philosophy classrooms. This is especially so given the fact that philosophy curricular requirements almost never include course topics that might enhance students\u2019 knowledge or capacity to reflect about these realities. So it should be no surprise that the work (teaching and scholarship) produced by a white-majority philosophy profession manifests, in general, an assumed entitlement to rights and resources, comfort and attention, access to space, and deference. They assume the ability to access all knowledge, and resent (and resist) theories that might restrict that access, on the grounds, for example, that one\u2019s identity and experience play a formative role in what one can understand on some matters. They assume the right to dominate the space \u2014 literal and figurative \u2014 of philosophical thought and discussion. They assume the right to have attention and they assume this is nonreciprocal: others should be reading their work even while they neglect to read the work of nonwhites. I am speaking in gross generalities that will be unfair to numerous individuals, but the patterns I am describing are, I suggest, familiar to marginalized philosophers.", "G.Y.: In what way has Latin American philosophy challenged such bad faith and the proclivity to be so methodologically narrow?", "L.M.A.: The philosophies developed in the colonized world during the emergence of European modernity have not had the luxury of such universalist pretensions or obliviousness. Philosophy in Latin America is very diverse, but one can discern a running thread of decolonial self-consciousness and aspiration. Thinkers from Europe and the United States persist even today in dismissing Latin American philosophy, and as a result, Latin American philosophers have had to justify their prerogative, and their ability, to contribute to normative debates over the good, the right and the true. But this has had the beneficial result of making visible the context in which philosophy occurs, and of disabling the usual pretensions of making transcendent abstractions removed from all concrete realities.", "All of the great thinkers, from Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar to Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos, Leopoldo Zea, Che Guevara, and Enrique Dussel, have had to develop philosophical arguments within a contextual consciousness ever mindful of colonialism\u2019s effects in the realm of thought. Since the social identities \u2014 racial and ethnic \u2014 of their contexts were made grounds for dismissing claims to self-determination or original thought, each of these thinkers engaged with the question of Latin American cultural, racial and ethnic identities and histories. It\u2019s a rich tradition. Knowledge requires self-knowledge. Philosophy\u2019s lack of diversity in North America has compromised its capacities for both self-knowledge and knowledge.", "G.Y.: Your very last point raises issues of standpoint epistemology \u2014 the idea that one\u2019s social identity is sometimes relevant to what one notices and how one makes judgments. I\u2019m thinking here in terms of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s comment that her experience being a wise Latina woman would help her to reach better legal conclusions than a white male. My sense is that there still exists within America the assumption (inside and outside the academy) that Latino/a voices and black voices are biased/inferior voices. Yet, both within and outside of the academy, it seems that there is a positive relationship between \u201cracialized\u201d identities and the production of knowledge. I think that this question also speaks to the \u201creality\u201d of race as lived. What is your view on this?", "L.M.A.: One can make an analogy between how Latin American thinkers have had to theoretically reflect about the intellectual and political effects of their geographical location and ethno-racial identities, and the way everyone who is not white in North America has had to engage similar questions just as a necessity of survival in a white supremacist society. So as a result, outside of white-dominant spaces, the set of debates and discussions about such topics is much richer, older and more developed, especially in the African-American philosophical tradition, than anywhere else. Knowledge is not an automatic product of the experiences engendered by different identities, I would suggest. But there is more motivation to pursue certain kinds of knowledge, and one often has willing and able interlocutors in one\u2019s immediate home and community environments who are comfortable with such topics and have reflected on and debated them. And it is also true that simply the experience of being nonwhite provides a kind of raw data for analysis.", "Sotomayor received so much vitriol for her claims about the link between identity and judgment that she was forced to renege on them in order to be appointed to the Supreme Court. But the view she expressed is quite a common-sense view most everyone actually accepts. Of course it is the case that our differences of background and experience can affect what we are likely to know already without having to do a Google search, and these differences also influence what we may be motivated to find out. There is a wealth of empirical work on jury selection that bears this out, and the members of Congress and lawyers grilling Sotomayor knew this literature. But there is a taboo on speaking about the epistemic salience of identity in our public domains of discourse, although it is a taboo that primarily plays out only for nonwhites, women, and other groups generally considered lower on our unspoken epistemic hierarchies.", "During the Sotomayor kerfuffle, Jon Stewart helpfully played back clips of all the congressmen who played up their veteran status in their political campaigns, and even Supreme Court nominees who talked about their own modest class backgrounds as relevant to their appointment to the court. It is only accepted for whites, and white men in particular, to use their particularity to augment their epistemic authority in this way, to generate a heightened trust in their judgment, almost never for others to do the same.", "This is itself an interesting issue to explore. Why can the mainstream media acknowledge the positive epistemic contributions of white particularities but no others? I believe the answer is that it would simply be too dangerous to the social status quo. Admitting the relevance of diversity to knowledge would require too much social change at every level and in nearly every social institution.", "Some believe that capitalism will solve this problem with its natural tendency to maximize profit over all other considerations, such that if racism and sexism thwart product development, capital will promote inclusion. I am skeptical of this. For one thing, capitalism profits too much from racism and sexism to let go. And secondly, the need of corporations to diversify their management pool has more to do with the need to manage effectively a diversity of low-paid workers than anything else. And if racism and sexism help maintain the disempowered and underpaid conditions of those workers, capitalism wins both ways.", "If we were to acknowledge the relevance of identity to knowledge, the solution would not be simplistic diversity quotas, but a real engagement with the question of how our unspoken epistemic hierarchies have distorted our educational institutions, research projects, academic and scientific fields of inquiry and general public discourse across all of our diverse forms of media. And then we could pursue a thorough attempt at solutions. Philosophers working in many domains \u2014 concerning epistemology, the social ontology of identity, moral psychology, the philosophy of science and others \u2014 could contribute to these efforts, but philosophy must first direct such efforts internally.", "G.Y.: Lastly, what do you say to those philosophers of color who might feel the pain of rejection, especially because, for them, their racialized identities are so important to their philosophical practice/projects? And, more generally, what advice do you have for our profession in terms of challenging those \u201cunspoken epistemic hierarchies.\u201d", "L.M.A.: Our profession continues to be an inhospitable climate for philosophers of color working on race, so the first thing to do is to acknowledge this. Some significant progress has been made, it is true, and there are a few high profile individuals, but one can no more imagine that these individual successes show that the climate is now open and fair than we can imagine that Oprah\u2019s and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s successes prove that all is fine for black working women. Too many philosophers still operate with depoliticized notions of \u201creal\u201d philosophy and consider both feminist and critical race work suspect because they are politically motivated rather than concerned only with truth. The result is a lot of micro-aggressions, as well as general neglect of the emerging scholarship.", "I am not optimistic about convincing the mainstream. I don\u2019t believe that if we just do serious and good philosophical work that its merit will shine through. To believe that, one would have to believe that philosophy is a true intellectual meritocracy, that philosophers are immune from racism and sexism and implicit bias, and that longstanding framing assumptions about the depolitical nature of philosophy will not skew judgment.", "A better solution lies in working multiple strategies: 1) carving out, and regularly nurturing, those spaces \u2014 journals, professional societies, conferences \u2014 in which all who are interested in the sub-field of critical race philosophy can develop our work within a constructively critical community; 2) developing our understanding of the sociology of the profession, in other words, the extent, causes and effects of its demographic challenges and hostile climate. We need to develop this understanding in a philosophical way, that might include, for example, new and more realistic norms of epistemic justification and argumentation that can provide some redress for our non-ideal context of work; 3) doing as much as we can to widen and strengthen the stream of young people of color who make a choice, an informed choice, hopefully, to try their hand at philosophy. The burden is on the marginalized and our allies to do this work. What else is new?", "But what I would also say to young philosophers is that this is actually a great time to join the discipline. We have the beginnings of a critical mass, a beachhead, with multiple conferences now each year, several organizations such as the Society for the Study of Africana Philosophy, the Caribbean Philosophical Association and the California Roundtable on Race. There is a new journal, Critical Philosophy of Race, as well as some receptivity in existing journals. And there is a growing community of frankly rather brilliant people busily working to advance our collective understanding of race, racism and colonialism. Also, there are many students in undergraduate classrooms receptive to these questions. The margins are flourishing and growing. In this sense, it is a positive moment.", "This interview was conducted by email and edited.

Airlines have poured millions into their websites so that travelers can customize (read: increase the cost of) their flights with a few clicks or taps, adding lounge passes and Wi-Fi. And to sweeten the pot, some airlines are wooing travelers to their sites with the occasional discount code.", "The direct booking trend is also being fueled by a boom in metasearch tools such as Google Flight Search, Google Hotel Finder, Hipmunk and Hopper, which make it easy to compare prices across multiple brands (although some airlines like Southwest have already chosen to keep their prices off such sites). Little wonder then that many consumers are using online agents like Orbitz (which owns CheapTickets and HotelClub) and Travelocity simply to educate themselves about their options \u2014 before booking directly with a hotel or airline.", "George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, said it reminded him of people who curled up on couches in Borders bookstores with pens and notebooks, scribbling advice from travel guides yet never purchasing them. \u201cI thought, \u2018These places are going to go out of business,\u2019 \u201d he said of the bookstores (Borders liquidated in 2011). \u201cThis is what happened to the online travel agents.

And package deals that include hotels and cars, or cruises, can trim costs. Of course with less competition from other online booking agents (expect more mom and pop sites to be bought up in the future, some experts say), those bargains may not be as alluring as they once were. Or maybe, given that Expedia and Priceline would be the two leading online agents in the United States, they would be able to drive a harder bargain with the airlines and hotels, scoring better deals for their users.

Yet it\u2019s a double-edged sword. Booking through a third party can mean that if you want to make changes to your flight while at the airport, for example, the airline will tell you to call Expedia. And hotel cancellation policies can be less strict than those from online travel agents, though this varies so it\u2019s necessary to do your homework.", "The primary advantage of dealing directly with an airline or hotel is, in a word, cost. More and more, airlines and hotels are offering special packages and resort credits not found on third-party sites.", "Even as direct booking is gaining popularity, more travelers are choosing to book places to stay through alternative lodging websites like Airbnb and HomeAway.

In recent years I have noticed that when potential patients Google me, they discover my university faculty profile, where I list as a research interest the psychology of infidelity. They also find a YouTube clip of an interview with me from a documentary on infidelity. Thanks to Google I am getting more patients looking for someone they think of as an infidelity expert.", "Cynthia was married to a successful software engineer and they had two children in grade school. She and her husband were both busy professional people who spent all their free time raising their children. They rarely talked to each other one-on-one anymore. Cynthia reported that their sex life had never been all that exciting. She said she used to think that the mediocre sex didn\u2019t matter to her; her husband was still devoted to her and their children.", "Cynthia had never thought of herself as the type to have an affair \u2014 until she met Neal, a colleague in her firm, also married with young children, with whom she used to go for lunch. As they got to know each other, feelings developed \u2014 and they became more than just friends. It turned out to be the best sex of her life and they fell in love.", "Neither of them wanted to break up their families. They both felt they \u201cloved\u201d their spouses even if they were no longer \u201cin love\u201d with them. Cynthia and Neal had an understanding that they would let the affair run its course and eventually go their separate ways. Confused and guilt-ridden about living a double life, Cynthia looked forward to a time when the affair would end and she could stop being deceitful.", "One day, Cynthia arrived at work to learn that Neal had collapsed on the treadmill during his morning run and died of a heart attack. She was in shock. She felt like sobbing uncontrollably but couldn\u2019t allow herself to; showing her grief might expose the affair.", "Months went by and Cynthia\u2019s grief was unabated. She had lost the love of her life and felt she would be forever forlorn. She needed to share her feelings with someone and concluded that only a psychotherapist could possibly be sympathetic to her predicament. This is when she came to me.", "My job initially seemed straightforward: to help Cynthia mourn a loss she could share with no other. But as the months passed I found myself strangely unsympathetic. The more I heard about Neal from Cynthia the less I liked him. He was a compulsive womanizer. He was indifferent to the guilt and confusion that Cynthia felt. He proselytized that everyone lied in marriage, that lying was indeed the key to marital happiness. He made Cynthia feel that her misgivings were na\u00efve, moralistic and old-fashioned. He argued that infidelity was the only way to compensate for the sexual boredom that eventually set in during a long-term relationship.", "Cynthia didn\u2019t entirely buy Neal\u2019s arguments, but they generated enough doubt to help her justify her behavior to herself. Maybe her guilt was irrational, she thought, and she should just enjoy the ride and hope she didn\u2019t get caught.", "Freud claimed that people often split love and lust. It is not uncommon to have great sex with someone who isn\u2019t lovable, or to have a trustworthy loving relationship with someone with whom the sex is boring.

This is also true of individuals, like Cynthia, who are \u201cavoidantly attached\u201d \u2014 they can\u2019t tolerate the vulnerability of being intimate with someone on whom they are dependent, and so they create a self-protective distance from their partner.", "In the traditional Freudian approach to psychotherapy, I would have kept my negative feelings about Neal to myself. But in the newer, more \u201crelational\u201d approaches to which I subscribe, it is thought to be therapeutic to disclose your true feelings, as doing so brings about a more honest and authentic relationship between therapist and patient. So I shared my thoughts: Neal seemed deficient in empathy, despite his charm, while her husband seemed loyal and caring in comparison.", "Cynthia responded defensively. I was being horribly unfair to Neal, she said. He was an exceptionally special person, she insisted, who had been trapped in a relationship with a \u201cbitchy\u201d wife. I asked Cynthia to consider the possibility that Neal\u2019s wife became a \u201cbitch\u201d because she begrudgingly submitted to his perennial philandering to avoid breaking up her family.", "This gave Cynthia pause. After a moment, a pained look flashed across her face. She conceded that her own spouse, like Neal\u2019s, had probably intuited the affair. In fact, she recalled, her husband had recently said to her, seemingly out of the blue, that he could understand if she had an affair, given how uninspired their sex life was. In an instant, Cynthia was seeing her husband anew, as the devoted and compassionate man that he was. Rather than angrily confronting her with an accusation, he had subtly indicated that he knew about the affair, expressed his understanding of why it might have happened, and was waiting for her to make the next move. Would Neal have been capable of such restraint, selflessness and care?", "Cynthia decided to ask her husband if he would join her for couples therapy (with another therapist), to work on improving their sex life. He agreed, and as Cynthia\u2019s therapeutic focus shifted from Neal to improving the romantic intimacy in her marriage, the work of mourning her lover came to an end.", "What do you do when the best sex of your life is outside of marriage, but you still want the emotional security of a stable long-term relationship with someone you love and trust?

He didn\u2019t like to think about his parents\u2019 sex life in general, and he especially didn\u2019t like imagining his mother having sex with men other than his father. Freud claimed that children are emotionally possessive and jealous creatures who don\u2019t like sharing their parents\u2019 affection with anyone else. As a clinician I try to keep an open mind about romantic partner sharing, but when it comes to our spouses, it seems most of us never outgrow being fundamentally childlike in our possessiveness.

It felt as if hierarchies were being dismantled, as if justice were being democratized. As time passed, though, I watched these shame campaigns multiply, to the point that they targeted not just powerful institutions and public figures but really anyone perceived to have done something offensive. I also began to marvel at the disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the punishment. It almost felt as if shamings were now happening for their own sake, as if they were following a script.", "Eventually I started to wonder about the recipients of our shamings, the real humans who were the virtual targets of these campaigns. So for the past two years, I\u2019ve been interviewing individuals like Justine Sacco: everyday people pilloried brutally, most often for posting some poorly considered joke on social media. Whenever possible, I have met them in person, to truly grasp the emotional toll at the other end of our screens.

Stone had stood next to the sign, which asks for \u201cSilence and Respect,\u201d pretending to scream and flip the bird. She and her co-worker Jamie, who posted the picture on Facebook, had a running joke about disobeying signs \u2014 smoking in front of No Smoking signs, for example \u2014 and documenting it. But shorn of this context, her picture appeared to be a joke not about a sign but about the war dead. Worse, Jamie didn\u2019t realize that her mobile uploads were visible to the public.", "Four weeks later, Stone and Jamie were out celebrating Jamie\u2019s birthday when their phones started vibrating repeatedly. Someone had found the photo and brought it to the attention of hordes of online strangers. Soon there was a wildly popular \u201cFire Lindsey Stone\u201d Facebook page. The next morning, there were news cameras outside her home; when she showed up to her job, at a program for developmentally disabled adults, she was told to hand over her keys. (\u201cAfter they fire her, maybe she needs to sign up as a client,\u201d read one of the thousands of Facebook messages denouncing her. \u201cWoman needs help.\u201d) She barely left home for the year that followed, racked by PTSD, depression and insomnia. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be seen by anyone,\u201d she told me last March at her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people looking at me.\u201d", "Instead, Stone spent her days online, watching others just like her get turned upon. In particular she felt for \u201cthat girl at Halloween who dressed as a Boston Marathon victim. I felt so terrible for her.\u201d She meant Alicia Ann Lynch, 22, who posted a photo of herself in her Halloween costume on Twitter. Lynch wore a running outfit and had smeared her face, arms and legs with fake blood. After an actual victim of the Boston Marathon bombing tweeted at her, \u201cYou should be ashamed, my mother lost both her legs and I almost died,\u201d people unearthed Lynch\u2019s personal information and sent her and her friends threatening messages. Lynch was reportedly let go from her job as well.", "I met a man who, in early 2013, had been sitting at a conference for tech developers in Santa Clara, Calif., when a stupid joke popped into his head. It was about the attachments for computers and mobile devices that are commonly called dongles. He murmured the joke to his friend sitting next to him, he told me. \u201cIt was so bad, I don\u2019t remember the exact words,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething about a fictitious piece of hardware that has a really big dongle, a ridiculous dongle. .\u2009.\u2009.

He thought she was taking a crowd shot, so he looked straight ahead, trying to avoid ruining her picture. It\u2019s a little painful to look at the photograph now, knowing what was coming.", "The woman had, in fact, overheard the joke. She considered it to be emblematic of the gender imbalance that plagues the tech industry and the toxic, male-dominated corporate culture that arises from it. She tweeted the picture to her 9,209 followers with the caption: \u201cNot cool. Jokes about .\u2009.\u2009. \u2018big\u2019 dongles right behind me.\u201d Ten minutes later, he and his friend were taken into a quiet room at the conference and asked to explain themselves. A day later, his boss called him into his office, and he was fired.", "\u201cI packed up all my stuff in a box,\u201d he told me. (Like Stone and Sacco, he had never before talked on the record about what happened to him. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid further damaging his career.) \u201cI went outside to call my wife. I\u2019m not one to shed tears, but\u201d \u2014 he paused \u2014 \u201cwhen I got in the car with my wife I just. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019ve got three kids. Getting fired was terrifying.\u201d", "The woman who took the photograph, Adria Richards, soon felt the wrath of the crowd herself. The man responsible for the dongle joke had posted about losing his job on Hacker News, an online forum popular with developers. This led to a backlash from the other end of the political spectrum. So-called men\u2019s rights activists and anonymous trolls bombarded Richards with death threats on Twitter and Facebook. Someone tweeted Richards\u2019s home address along with a photograph of a beheaded woman with duct tape over her mouth. Fearing for her life, she left her home, sleeping on friends\u2019 couches for the remainder of the year.", "Next, her employer\u2019s website went down. Someone had launched a DDoS attack, which overwhelms a site\u2019s servers with repeated requests. SendGrid, her employer, was told the attacks would stop if Richards was fired. That same day she was publicly let go.", "\u201cI cried a lot during this time, journaled and escaped by watching movies,\u201d she later said to me in an email. \u201cSendGrid threw me under the bus. I felt betrayed. I felt abandoned. I felt ashamed. I felt rejected. I felt alone.\u201d", "Late one afternoon last year, I met Justine Sacco in New York, at a restaurant in Chelsea called Cookshop. Dressed in rather chic business attire, Sacco ordered a glass of white wine. Just three weeks had passed since her trip to Africa, and she was still a person of interest to the media. Websites had already ransacked her Twitter feed for more horrors. (For example, \u201cI had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night,\u201d from 2012, was unearthed by BuzzFeed in the article \u201c16 Tweets Justine Sacco Regrets.\u201d) A New York Post photographer had been following her to the gym.", "\u201cOnly an insane person would think that white people don\u2019t get AIDS,\u201d she told me. It was about the first thing she said to me when we sat down.", "Sacco had been three hours or so into her flight when retweets of her joke began to overwhelm my Twitter feed. I could understand why some people found it offensive. Read literally, she said that white people don\u2019t get AIDS, but it seems doubtful many interpreted it that way. More likely it was her apparently gleeful flaunting of her privilege that angered people. But after thinking about her tweet for a few seconds more, I began to suspect that it wasn\u2019t racist but a reflexive critique of white privilege \u2014 on our tendency to na\u00efvely imagine ourselves immune from life\u2019s horrors. Sacco, like Stone, had been yanked violently out of the context of her small social circle. Right?", "\u201cTo me it was so insane of a comment for anyone to make,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought there was no way that anyone could possibly think it was literal.\u201d (She would later write me an email to elaborate on this point. \u201cUnfortunately, I am not a character on \u2018South Park\u2019 or a comedian, so I had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect manner on a public platform,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo put it simply, I wasn\u2019t trying to raise awareness of AIDS or piss off the world or ruin my life. Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third world. I was making fun of that bubble.\u201d)", "I would be the only person she spoke to on the record about what happened to her, she said. It was just too harrowing \u2014 and \u201cas a publicist,\u201d inadvisable \u2014 but she felt it was necessary, to show how \u201ccrazy\u201d her situation was, how her punishment simply didn\u2019t fit the crime.", "\u201cI cried out my body weight in the first 24 hours,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt was incredibly traumatic. You don\u2019t sleep. You wake up in the middle of the night forgetting where you are.\u201d She released an apology statement and cut short her vacation. Workers were threatening to strike at the hotels she had booked if she showed up. She was told no one could guarantee her safety.", "Her extended family in South Africa were African National Congress supporters \u2014 the party of Nelson Mandela. They were longtime activists for racial equality. When Justine arrived at the family home from the airport, one of the first things her aunt said to her was: \u201cThis is not what our family stands for. And now, by association, you\u2019ve almost tarnished the family.\u201d", "As she told me this, Sacco started to cry. I sat looking at her for a moment. Then I tried to improve the mood. I told her that \u201csometimes, things need to reach a brutal nadir before people see sense.\u201d", "\u201cWow,\u201d she said. She dried her eyes. \u201cOf all the things I could have been in society\u2019s collective consciousness, it never struck me that I\u2019d end up a brutal nadir.\u201d", "She glanced at her watch. It was nearly 6 p.m. The reason she wanted to meet me at this restaurant, and that she was wearing her work clothes, was that it was only a few blocks away from her office. At 6, she was due in there to clean out her desk.", "\u201cAll of a sudden you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t start making steps to reclaim my identity and remind myself of who I am on a daily basis, then I might lose myself.\u201d", "The restaurant\u2019s manager approached our table. She sat down next to Sacco, fixed her with a look and said something in such a low volume I couldn\u2019t hear it, only Sacco\u2019s reply: \u201cOh, you think I\u2019m going to be grateful for this?\u201d", "We agreed to meet again, but not for several months. She was determined to prove that she could turn her life around. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit at home and watch movies every day and cry and feel sorry for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to come back.\u201d", "After she left, Sacco later told me, she got only as far as the lobby of her office building before she broke down crying.", "A few days after meeting Sacco, I took a trip up to the Massachusetts Archives in Boston. I wanted to learn about the last era of American history when public shaming was a common form of punishment, so I was seeking out court transcripts from the 18th and early 19th centuries. I had assumed that the demise of public punishments was caused by the migration from villages to cities. Shame became ineffectual, I thought, because a person in the stocks could just lose himself or herself in the anonymous crowd as soon as the chastisement was over. Modernity had diminished shame\u2019s power to shame \u2014 or so I assumed.", "I took my seat at a microfilm reader and began to scroll slowly through the archives. For the first hundred years, as far as I could tell, all that happened in America was that various people named Nathaniel had purchased land near rivers. I scrolled faster, finally reaching an account of an early Colonial-era shaming.", "On July 15, 1742, a woman named Abigail Gilpin, her husband at sea, had been found \u201cnaked in bed with one John Russell.\u201d They were both to be \u201cwhipped at the public whipping post 20 stripes each.\u201d Abigail was appealing the ruling, but it wasn\u2019t the whipping itself she wished to avoid. She was begging the judge to let her be whipped early, before the town awoke. \u201cIf your honor pleases,\u201d she wrote, \u201ctake some pity on me for my dear children who cannot help their unfortunate mother\u2019s failings.\u201d", "There was no record as to whether the judge consented to her plea, but I found a number of clips that offered clues as to why she might have requested private punishment. In a sermon, the Rev. Nathan Strong, of Hartford, Conn., entreated his flock to be less exuberant at executions. \u201cGo not to that place of horror with elevated spirits and gay hearts, for death is there! Justice and judgment are there!\u201d Some papers published scathing reviews when public punishments were deemed too lenient by the crowd: \u201cSuppressed remarks .\u2009.\u2009. were expressed by large numbers,\u201d reported Delaware\u2019s Wilmington Daily Commercial of a disappointing 1873 whipping. \u201cMany were heard to say that the punishment was a farce. .\u2009.\u2009. Drunken fights and rows followed in rapid succession.\u201d", "The movement against public shaming had gained momentum in 1787, when Benjamin Rush, a physician in Philadelphia and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, wrote a paper calling for its demise \u2014 the stocks, the pillory, the whipping post, the lot. \u201cIgnominy is universally acknowledged to be a worse punishment than death,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt would seem strange that ignominy should ever have been adopted as a milder punishment than death, did we not know that the human mind seldom arrives at truth upon any subject till it has first reached the extremity of error.\u201d", "The pillory and whippings were abolished at the federal level in 1839, although Delaware kept the pillory until 1905 and whippings until 1972. An 1867 editorial in The Times excoriated the state for its obstinacy. \u201cIf [the convicted person] had previously existing in his bosom a spark of self-respect this exposure to public shame utterly extinguishes it. .\u2009.\u2009. The boy of 18 who is whipped at New Castle for larceny is in nine cases out of 10 ruined. With his self-respect destroyed and the taunt and sneer of public disgrace branded upon his forehead, he feels himself lost and abandoned by his fellows.\u201d", "At the archives, I found no evidence that punitive shaming fell out of fashion as a result of newfound anonymity. But I did find plenty of people from centuries past bemoaning the outsize cruelty of the practice, warning that well-meaning people, in a crowd, often take punishment too far.", "It\u2019s possible that Sacco\u2019s fate would have been different had an anonymous tip not led a writer named Sam Biddle to the offending tweet. Biddle was then the editor of Valleywag, Gawker Media\u2019s tech-industry blog. He retweeted it to his 15,000 followers and eventually posted it on Valleywag, accompanied by the headline, \u201cAnd Now, a Funny Holiday Joke From IAC\u2019s P.R. Boss.\u201d", "In January 2014, I received an email from Biddle, explaining his reasoning. \u201cThe fact that she was a P.R. chief made it delicious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to be able to say, \u2018O.K., let\u2019s make a racist tweet by a senior IAC employee count this time.\u2019 And it did. I\u2019d do it again.\u201d Biddle said he was surprised to see how quickly her life was upended, however. \u201cI never wake up and hope I [get someone fired] that day \u2014 and certainly never hope to ruin anyone\u2019s life.\u201d Still, he ended his email by saying that he had a feeling she\u2019d be \u201cfine eventually, if not already.\u201d", "He added: \u201cEveryone\u2019s attention span is so short. They\u2019ll be mad about something new today.\u201d", "Four months after we first met, Justine Sacco made good on her promise. We met for lunch at a French bistro downtown. I told her what Biddle had said \u2014 about how she was probably fine now. I was sure he wasn\u2019t being deliberately glib, but like everyone who participates in mass online destruction, uninterested in learning that it comes with a cost.", "\u201cWell, I\u2019m not fine yet,\u201d Sacco said to me. \u201cI had a great career, and I loved my job, and it was taken away from me, and there was a lot of glory in that. Everybody else was very happy about that.\u201d", "Sacco pushed her food around on her plate, and let me in on one of the hidden costs of her experience. \u201cI\u2019m single; so it\u2019s not like I can date, because we Google everyone we might date,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been taken away from me too.\u201d She was down, but I did notice one positive change in her. When I first met her, she talked about the shame she had brought on her family. But she no longer felt that way. Instead, she said, she just felt personally humiliated.", "Biddle was almost right about one thing: Sacco did get a job offer right away. But it was an odd one, from the owner of a Florida yachting company. \u201cHe said: \u2018I saw what happened to you. I\u2019m fully on your side,\u2019\u2009\u201d she told me. Sacco knew nothing about yachts, and she questioned his motives. (\u201cWas he a crazy person who thinks white people can\u2019t get AIDS?\u201d) Eventually she turned him down.", "After that, she left New York, going as far away as she could, to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. She flew there alone and got a volunteer job doing P.R. for an NGO working to reduce maternal-mortality rates. \u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d she said. She was on her own, and she was working. If she was going to be made to suffer for a joke, she figured she should get something out of it. \u201cI never would have lived in Addis Ababa for a month otherwise,\u201d she told me. She was struck by how different life was there. Rural areas had only intermittent power and no running water or Internet. Even the capital, she said, had few street names or house addresses.", "Addis Ababa was great for a month, but she knew going in that she would not be there long. She was a New York City person. Sacco is nervy and sassy and sort of debonair.

At one point, he created a giant version that, he said, knocked a small child unconscious when it was displayed in a shop.", "It was all going pretty well until the competition heated up. In 1968, Richard Loncraine, a British actor and director who had been trained as a sculptor, produced a version in chrome.

That is, if tax policy encourages American companies to build factories abroad, that\u2019s likely to be offset by foreign investments in American factories; we shouldn\u2019t sweat so much about who puts what facility where. Indeed, President Obama has repeatedly lauded the manufacturing firm Siemens for its investments in the United States, even though, as a German multinational, Siemens is \u201cshipping jobs overseas\u201d whenever it invests here.", "So it\u2019s not really surprising that, as discussions of tax reform for American multinationals move away from rhetoric toward policy, jobs are de-emphasized in favor of revenue.

So many companies leave their profits abroad indefinitely. Mr. Obama wants to impose an immediate tax on American companies\u2019 global profits at a reduced rate of 19 percent; it\u2019s aimed directly at American companies that stuff their profits in places like Bermuda. He\u2019d use the proceeds, along with other corporate tax base broadeners, to cut the rate on the corporate tax from 35 percent to 28 percent, and to 25 percent for manufacturers.", "This would benefit companies that do business only in the United States. But it would also be favorable to a lot of American companies with real, bona fide foreign operations employing foreign workers.

And in contrast with today, they would owe no further tax once they bring the profits home.", "So, let\u2019s say you do business somewhere like the Netherlands, which has a 25 percent corporate tax rate. Under the current system, you\u2019d most likely owe a little bit of tax to the United States if you ever bring your Dutch profits home. Under Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed reforms, the credits for your Dutch taxes would in most cases wipe out your minimum tax liability to the United States, and you could bring your profits home without paying any American taxes.", "This is a big deal, because it means Republicans and the president agree on something: If a company earns income abroad, and pays tax on that income abroad at a non-haven rate, it shouldn\u2019t owe any additional tax to the United States \u2014 even if the foreign country has a modestly lower tax rate than we do. There is now bipartisan agreement in favor of territorial taxation, in which companies pay tax on their income only where they earn it.", "What does this mean for \u201cshipping jobs overseas\u201d? To some extent, territorial taxation would make it modestly more favorable for Americans companies to shift jobs to places like the Netherlands, since they could serve a market and take advantage of modestly lower corporate tax rates without accruing American tax liability. But the reforms would encourage companies to bring their foreign profits home and invest in the United States.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how it all balances out,\u201d said Mr. Toder, though he thinks that the effects would be small.", "What the reforms would do is foster a change in corporate thinking. Companies would make their financing and investing decisions with more of an eye to pretax profits rather than tax planning. American companies tie themselves in knots to avoid bringing foreign profits home. They borrow money instead of repatriating foreign profits to finance domestic investment, or they invest offshore profits in foreign businesses simply to avoid triggering American taxes. All that tax planning costs money and sways companies from investing in the opportunities that generate the highest pretax profits.", "A revised system would refocus investing decisions toward the highest returns, while preventing companies from taking advantage of tax havens, even if it would sometimes lead American companies to \u201cship jobs overseas.\u201d"], "https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/girls-recap-adam-an-example-of-how-selfish-young-men-speak-when-theyve-done-wrong/": ["Season 4, Episode 5: \u201cSit-In\u201d", "Well, that\u2019s it: Hannah and Adam are done, and all it took was a well-heeled RISD grad with a hyphenated first name to get in between them.

I also suggest that since the letter writer describes the couple as being downstairs, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the person upstairs has never made a lot of noise that has bothered the people downstairs.

Roomy and Sakhawat met when they were electrical-engineering students at Columbia University. After graduating, Sakhawat started inventing, eventually gathering some 30 semiconductor patents to his name. Roomy, who was more outgoing in social situations and more restless in her appetite for risk, was drawn to Wall Street and joined Galleon Group, a New York hedge fund run by the charismatic, bullish trader Raj Rajaratnam.

Riding the Internet boom, she said, she had amassed a paper fortune of $50 million.", "\u201cI am not kidding when I say I had money,\u201d Roomy told me when I met her recently. \u201cI had a lot of money.\u201d In the late 1990s, the Khans moved out of their house in Sunnyvale, Calif., \u2014 Roomy called it a \u201ckhudd,\u201d a Punjabi word for \u201chole\u201d \u2014 and bought a 9,000-square-foot mansion in Atherton, the wealthiest town in Silicon Valley. They paid $10.5 million, all cash. The house had a pool, a tennis court and more than half a dozen marble fireplaces. They gave lavish parties for their friends and once, on a whim, spent $50,000 on wine.", "When Sakhawat visited Roomy in her office, her eyes were usually fixed on a large Bloomberg terminal, her ear pressed to the phone.

Khan was the right woman for the job: Since about 2006, she herself had been trading on inside information. When the F.B.I. caught up with her, she began helping them \u2014 at first reluctantly and then with theatrical flair. She taped telephone calls with her bosses, business associates and even a neighbor. Most important of all, she taped calls with her ex-boss, Raj Rajaratnam, whom the government had been eyeing for a decade.", "On the morning of Oct. 16, 2009, Wall Street awoke to images of Rajaratnam flanked by F.B.I. agents outside a federal courthouse, looking subdued and sour, with his hands cuffed behind his back.

(cooperating witness) in the 34-page complaint against Rajaratnam had to be his wife. C.W.\u2019s recorded telephone calls with Rajaratnam suggested that he had access to inside information, enabling the government to obtain court permission to place a wiretap on his cellphone. It was the first time prosecutors had made significant use of wiretaps to investigate white-collar crime, and conversations intercepted from Rajaratnam\u2019s cellphone led the authorities to uncover the biggest insider-trading network in American history.

Within hours of the discovery, the press assailed her as \u201cThe Woman Who Ratted on Rajaratnam\u201d and \u201cThe Nark in Galleon Bust.\u201d In photographs, she was portrayed as disheveled and sinister. Incriminating episodes from her past were splashed across major newspapers. She and Sakhawat, it was revealed, had been sued by Deutsche Bank for failing to pay off a large promissory note (they later settled). A few years later, their housekeeper accused the Khans of violating labor laws by paying her $250 a week for 80 to 90 hours of work. They also settled a lawsuit with her after a judge said they had doctored evidence.", "The gleeful bad-mouthing of Khan went on for years: Her flamboyance and her lying made for delectable reading, especially when it emerged that Khan had not been entirely truthful with the F.B.I. Even after she started cooperating, she manipulated them. Suspecting that Khan had been tipped off to the imminent takeover of Hilton Worldwide, investigators confronted her about shares she had purchased. Khan said she bought them because she thought the jailing of Paris Hilton would be good publicity for the brand. She also took out a cellphone contract in her gardener\u2019s name so she could continue speaking to some of her contacts. She claims she wanted to protect them from the government\u2019s prying; she also wanted to continue making legitimate money playing the markets.", "Khan\u2019s cooperation did not keep her out of jail. Sentencing her to a year at a women\u2019s prison in Coleman, Fla., near Orlando, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the federal court in Manhattan admonished her: \u201cYou cannot have it both ways. You cannot obstruct justice and then say, \u2018Well, because I have done good things since, forget about it.\u2019\u2009\u201d Before going to jail, Khan spent her mornings walking along the beach, worrying about how she\u2019d survive in prison.

What sorts of calculations had she made to convince herself that the benefits of cheating outweighed the possible costs?", "Khan was wary of me. She felt bruised by the way the media had demonized her. All but one of her friends from her California days had abandoned her. Since moving to Florida, she has channeled her energies into raising her only child, her adopted daughter, Priyanka. \u201cI have no outside-world connections,\u201d she told me. Oddly, she was worried that if she agreed to be interviewed for an article, people might think she was paid for her story. (The New York Times does not pay for interviews.) After vetting the idea with her lawyer and her probation officer, she agreed to sit down and tell me about her life.", "I had seen so many unattractive photographs of Khan that I was surprised when a spunky woman with large, lively eyes and carefully blow-dried hair bounded up to me in my hotel lobby.

Otherwise my mind would be mush.\u201d", "Khan is financially reliant on Sakhawat, who now has a business that manufactures tents in Bangladesh.

She vowed she would go straight \u201cto a Louis Vuitton and blow $10,000\u201d if she ever found work. \u201cWhy? Because it makes me feel alive. I can\u2019t change my wiring.\u201d During my visit, she showed me a closet filled with some of her former trophies: designer handbags and shoes. She lovingly stroked a black leather Valentino handbag adorned with delicate lace flowers. \u201cValentino is my favorite brand,\u201d she said, as giddy as a teenage girl.", "Khan was born in 1958 into a traditional middle-class family. In January, I met her parents in Delhi, where Khan was raised. Her father, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, did research on weapons systems for India\u2019s department of defense. Her mother, though trained as a linguist, was a homemaker. In India, many parents whose children have managed to make a life abroad regard the achievement as their own and affect a highhanded snobbery, but hers struck me as down to earth.", "Khan\u2019s parents valued education above all else. Her father showered as much attention on his daughter as he did on his son, a level of interest that was unusual in India at the time, and Khan sensed that it was because she showed more promise. But schooling two children strained the family\u2019s finances. When Khan was 9 or 10, her parents pulled her out of Rosary, a private school in Delhi where students were taught English. At the state school Khan subsequently attended, almost all her classes were in Hindi except for science. \u201cI went to college, and I barely knew English,\u201d she told me. She hung around the English speakers at college and kept silent, listening so that she could speak like them.", "In 1981, when Khan was 23, she saw an advertisement in a journal about studying abroad at Kent State. She applied to the university\u2019s physics program, and when Kent State offered her a partial scholarship, she leapt at the chance, telling her parents that if they didn\u2019t give her the money for the ticket, she would borrow it. In America, her ambitions grew. Bored with studying in a small, provincial town in Ohio, she applied and was accepted to Columbia University\u2019s master\u2019s program in engineering, where she met Sakhawat, a Muslim from Bangladesh. In 1985, she followed him to California, defying her parents, who are Hindu and disapproved of her choice. \u201cYes, we lived together in sin for a couple of years,\u201d Khan said, laughing.", "Khan got her start in California working for technology firms. In 1995, while she was at Intel, she was given an assignment to do some research on Intel\u2019s rival, Advanced Micro Devices, and she called Raj Rajaratnam, who was then an influential analyst working at a boutique investment bank called Needham & Company. Rajaratnam happened to pick up the phone himself. They chatted amiably for a while about A.M.D., and then their conversation turned to their families. Khan told Rajaratnam that she was Punjabi. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan, said that his wife, Asha, was also Punjabi. Over time, Rajaratnam would exploit these sorts of tribal links, cultivating a coterie of loyal acolytes, mostly of South Asian descent, on whom he conferred favor if they gave him occasional tips.", "The two struck up a friendship after that, dining together sometimes when Rajaratnam visited California. Though heavyset and not particularly attractive, Rajaratnam was charming \u2014 perhaps the brightest man Khan had ever met, she told me. Khan, eager to break into Wall Street, saw Rajaratnam as her ticket out of Intel. She tried to please him, faxing him confidential data on the number of computer chips the company shipped, giving him a glimpse into Intel\u2019s revenue for the quarter. In early 1998, her employer installed a video camera above the fax machine and captured Khan\u2019s stealthy communications with Rajaratnam. She quit before the company had completed their internal investigation into her crime. Her next job was working for Rajaratnam at his new hedge fund, the Galleon Group.", "As Khan was starting her career trading technology stocks, the business was about to undergo major changes. In 2000, just before the Internet bubble lost oxygen, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to introduce Regulation Fair Disclosure, which required publicly traded companies to share crucial information with all investors simultaneously. Before Regulation F.D., companies routinely held one-on-one meetings with hedge-fund managers or investment analysts, at which the companies offered guidance on earnings or provided information about the success of a new product rollout that could have an impact on their bottom line. The culture, especially in Silicon Valley, was chummy, with nascent technology companies vying to attract Wall Street\u2019s attention.", "But after Regulation F.D. came into effect, companies became more guarded about divulging information. Some hedge funds, which make money from specific events, like a takeover or an earnings report, had relied on their relationships with companies for insights. The change in Regulation F.D. hurt them, and it came at a moment when the number of hedge funds was growing and competition was becoming fiercer. According to Hedge Fund Research, a group that follows the industry, at the end of 1990, there were 610 hedge funds globally; at the end of 2001, there were 4,454. More regulation, heightened competition and tougher markets meant that hedge-fund managers were always seeking new advantages.", "In 1999, after nearly a year of working for Rajaratnam, Khan quit Galleon, wanting to start trading her own money in the Internet-stock boom. A month into trading solo, she was visited by F.B.I. agents, who confronted her with the evidence from her indiscretions at Intel. In 2001, she pleaded guilty to wire fraud, and for the next four years, chastened by her crime, she says, she played by the rules and steered clear of Rajaratnam.", "Then one day in 2005, \u201cout of the blue, I got a call as I was driving to my house,\u201d she recalled. \u201cRaj said: \u2018Oh, I haven\u2019t heard from you. How are you?\u2019 Then he gave me some skinny on the quarter at Intel.\u201d", "Rajaratnam\u2019s call came at a time when Khan needed money; within a few years of the Internet bust in 2001, she had lost $49.6 million, according to her lawyer. The Khans paid cash for the Atherton house, but after the meltdown, they took out a $5 million mortgage on it. To pay it, Khan needed to generate $42,000 a month. But it wasn\u2019t only a sense of financial need that led her back to Rajaratnam; Khan\u2019s thinking about her earlier run-in with the law was starting to change. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you are a drug addict, and you go through rehab, and you are clean,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then you are constantly at a party every day where people are doing cocaine. How long can you stay clean?\u201d She was struck by the pervasiveness of insider trading on Wall Street and the extent to which skilled traders bent the rules and took calculated risks by defying the law.", "At Intel, she had broken the rules by supplying inside information to someone else; now she was willing to use it to make money for herself. Khan began tapping her vast network, leaning on friends, associates and even a cousin to find new avenues of information. She made inroads into Silicon Valley\u2019s close-knit South Asian community, mixing business and pleasure to her advantage. She invited Sunil Bhalla, an executive at Polycom who was dating one of her close friends, to her home for a holiday dinner in December 2005; a few weeks later, she followed up to ask how his company\u2019s quarter was looking. She played auntie to a young woman from Bangladesh who worked for an investor-relations company. Before long, the woman was feeding her information on Google, one of the firm\u2019s clients, and asking for money in exchange (Khan never paid her). Because Khan had been trading on her own, she often wasn\u2019t invited to one-on-one meetings with company executives like other money managers. \u201cThat is how you garner all your nuggets in a legal way,\u201d she said. She would talk to a young investment analyst she knew in New York named Tom Hardin. \u201cTom was my buddy,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe used to barter information all the time.\u201d", "From time to time, when Khan picked up a juicy bit from Bhalla or her young investor-relations friend, she would call Rajaratnam and pass it along. In 2005, she landed a job at a hedge fund, Trivium, and she liked that Rajaratnam would share information with her that she could pass on to her new bosses. She also hoped by ingratiating herself with Rajaratnam that he might hire her again.", "On Nov. 28, 2007, Khan was working in her home office in Atherton when she heard a knock on the door. There were two people standing outside, a man and a woman. She did not recognize either of them. But \u201cthe moment they showed me their badges, my heart sank,\u201d she said.", "Khan had been maniacal about covering her tracks, registering cellphones under false names and paying off a source through an intermediary. But she was sloppy once. Two years earlier, she was receiving insider tips on Polycom\u2019s earnings from Bhalla. Distracted by the lawsuit with Deutsche Bank and fighting with her housekeeper, she called Bhalla on his cellphone and his home phone. The feds obtained these phone records and discovered that conversations between Khan and Bhalla followed an incriminating instant message Khan sent Rajaratnam: \u201cdo not buy plcm till I het guidance.\u201d When investigators showed Khan that they had the instant-message exchange, she knew she would have to come clean. \u201cWith Polycom, I felt I couldn\u2019t really lie, because they had the phone communications.\u201d (When the S.E.C. later sued Bhalla, he denied tipping Khan and reached a settlement.)", "After the agents left Khan\u2019s house, she found a lawyer, who advised her to cooperate with the federal investigation. But she figured she could outwit the F.B.I. \u2014 she had, after all, gotten off without jail time after her Intel indiscretion, and the government still hadn\u2019t managed to prosecute Rajaratnam.", "During her regular trips to New York to meet with prosecutors, she avoided contact with Rajaratnam. \u201cI knew he was the bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my mind, their target was Raj, and I was not going to get in their way.\u201d But she went out of her way to warn others. Once, when Khan was going to meet with prosecutors in New York, she sought out her buddy Tom Hardin. \u201cListen, the S.E.C. is asking about the Hilton trade,\u201d she told him. \u201cHave a story.\u201d Khan was so intent on protecting Hardin that at one point, she says, an F.B.I. agent screamed at her: \u201cWhat does Tom Hardin mean to you?\u201d (Hardin later pleaded guilty to insider trading.)", "Khan insists that she was driven by a desire to shield people: \u201cThey were all young kids. Some of them were my relatives. Because of the kind of relationship I had with them and how young they were, I was aghast that I was going to destroy their lives.\u201d She continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t lie for myself. I really lied for other people, which is very stupid. Everybody knew what they were doing. When someone working at an institution like Moody\u2019s comes and asks you for money, they know that is not what they should be doing.\u201d", "It\u2019s hard to know what Khan\u2019s real motives were, but I tended to believe her expressions of sympathy for her young, ambitious colleagues, her guilt at exposing their wrongdoing in a climate of widespread rule-breaking. She spoke about the extreme temptations of making sure bets on stock trades. When we met, she\u2019d been closely watching Caterpillar and Cummins stocks. If she were still in the business of playing the markets, she said, she would have tried to short Caterpillar and go long, or take a bullish bet, on Cummins. If she\u2019d put in the trade a few days earlier, she would have made $4 or $5 a share on the Caterpillar short position, \u201cwhich is not bad,\u201d she said. So why, I asked her, had she resorted to insider trading when there was ample money to be made through good old-fashioned stock analysis?", "\u201cDo you think I would bet $1 million on my analysis?\u201d she said, with a look of mock disdain. \u201cBut if someone told me Caterpillar is going to miss its quarter, I would bet $1 million. Insider trading introduces certainty.\u201d That certainty felt like magic: A little money, with the press of a button, could become a heap of money. It\u2019s a temptation that has taken Khan much of her life to learn to resist.", "At first Khan was reluctant to invite me into her home, saying that Sakhawat would not approve. One afternoon, when he left to pick up their daughter from school, Khan had me over for a cup of tea. Perhaps it occurred to her that it might look inhospitable not to. She apologized before inviting me in: \u201cI used to have a full-time maid. When I came to Florida, I didn\u2019t know how to run laundry. I had never mopped the floor. I think about it now. I cook, I clean, I mop. I feel this is part of my absolution.\u201d", "The 2,500-square-foot mustard yellow house sits close to a busy intersection and is the same size as the maid\u2019s quarters in Khan\u2019s former residence in Atherton. Paint was peeling from the ceiling in the kitchen. In the living room, unironed shirts were slung over chairs, and papers were strewn across a table. A broken toilet gurgled upstairs.", "The only vestiges of her former life were a couple of imposing and rather austere works of modern art and expensive pieces of furniture that crowded the rooms. She pointed to a stainless-steel credenza that barely fit across one wall in the dining area. It cost $20,000. I asked about the long brown couch that swallowed up most of the living room. She thought she paid between $10,000 and $15,000 for it.", "When I visited, Khan was a week away from celebrating her 56th birthday. She seemed addled, struggling to fashion a new identity for herself. Khan has worked since she was 27. When she was trading stocks on her own, she started her days at 6 in the morning and worked till 8 at night. \u201cEven when we had the big money, I worked,\u201d she told me. What bothered her the most, she said, is that \u201cthe thing that has made me has been taken away from me.\u201d Her probation officer suggested she find work as a cashier, but Khan believes she is capable of more.", "In December, Khan took the G.R.E.s and scored fairly well. She applied to the Ph.D. program in finance at the Wharton School, among others. She wants to focus on insider trading and white-collar fraud. \u201cI will not be a typical Wharton Ph.D. program student,\u201d she wrote in her Wharton application essay. \u201cHowever my life experiences, although extreme, have prepared me uniquely to do research on insider trading/ethics.\u201d", "In February, she received a rejection, but she\u2019s waiting to hear from several other schools. If she doesn\u2019t get in anywhere, she would like to write a book, perhaps go on the lecture circuit, sharing with aspiring traders and business people the cautionary tale of her easy slide into committing crimes. Addressing an issue many South Asians have raised with me about the Galleon prosecutions, Khan said flatly: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a racial angle. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with us being Indians. I got in trouble because of my association with Raj, and Raj got in trouble because of his braggadocio.\u201d When I asked her what she thought about the fact that the leaders of the major banks who bear the most responsibility for the financial crisis in 2008 haven\u2019t been prosecuted for their crimes, she answered with her usual pragmatism: The government likes to bring cases it can win.", "On my last day in Fort Lauderdale, Khan and I took a walk among the tall palm trees that line the beach near her house. Khan was in a reflective mood. She told me that her sister-in-law from Bangladesh said to her: \u201cBhabi,\u201d a term used to address an older brother\u2019s wife, \u201cdon\u2019t think of what you\u2019ve lost. Think of what you have, and you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d For the first time, she is trying to embrace that advice. \u201cThe worst-case scenario is I will be a housewife for the rest of my life,\u201d she told me. Then she added: \u201cI am very fortunate. I am not homeless. I still have a life.\u201d"], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/morning-agenda-u-s-takes-on-payday-lenders/": ["U.S. TAKES ON PAYDAY LENDERS | The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will soon release the first draft of federal regulations to govern a wide range of short-term loans made by the $46 billion payday loan industry, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in DealBook. The rules are expected to address expensive credit backed by car titles and some installment loans that stretch longer than the traditional two-week payday loan, according to industry lawyers, consumer groups and government authorities briefed on the discussions.", "\u201cBehind that decision, the people said, is a stark acknowledgment of just how successfully lenders have adapted to keep offering high-cost products despite state laws meant to rein in the loans,\u201d Ms. Silver-Greenberg writes. The regulations will likely set off a new round of lobbying from payday lenders. Already, some payday lenders have begun aggressively lobbying a number of states, including Kentucky, Washington and New Mexico, to weaken state laws restricting expensive loans or to stop new caps before they gain ground. The lenders contend that their loans are the only option for millions of Americans.", "At the center of the regulations being considered, the people briefed on the matter said, is a requirement that lenders assess whether borrowers can repay loans at the end of a two-week period by examining their income, other debts and their payment history. Among the most hotly debated parts of the rules, the people said, are what kinds of loans fall under the guidelines. Some lenders, they said, have pushed to keep the definition narrow, arguing that car title loans and installment loans should escape the crackdown.", "", "GREECE SETS UP CLASH WITH CREDITORS | Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece said on Sunday in a speech to Parliament that his government would not seek an extension of a bailout program and would carry out its campaign pledges to roll back austerity, Niki Kitsantonis writes in The New York Times.

As one political commentator put it during the live TV coverage of the election results, if the B.J.P. keeps falling back on its core agenda (Hindu nationalism cloaked in runaway pro-business dogma), it will be left only with its core support base (Hindu right-wingers and India Inc.).

As a result, the A.A.P.\u2019s leader, the ex-bureaucrat-turned-social activist Arvind Kejriwal, resigned as Delhi\u2019s chief minister. Partly as a result of that, the party had a poor showing in the general election in May.", "But Mr. Kejriwal apologized to voters \u2014 a rarity in Indian politics \u2014 and the party embarked on a period of soul-searching. It went back to basics, reaching out to constituents through a grassroots campaign that concentrated on their daily concerns, like corruption and access to electricity and water, education and healthcare. In order to better focus on the Delhi election, the A.A.P. eschewed national politics in the second half of 2014, refusing to run in most state elections, and it limited its criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s leadership. Its large cast of volunteers made aggressive use of social media \u2014 Twitter, Facebook, Google Hangouts \u2014 to communicate with supporters and raise funds.", "The B.J.P. did much the reverse. Banking on Mr. Modi\u2019s continued popularity, it ran campaigns that centered on him, even in state races: At first it failed to present a candidate for the post of chief minister in Delhi, instead plastering the capital with posters of the prime minister and taking out many newspaper ads with his picture.", "When the A.A.P. appeared to gather momentum, the B.J.P.\u2019s central leadership jumped in with both feet. It dispatched cabinet ministers to campaign throughout Delhi, down to canvassing on street corners.

Nonetheless the A.A.P.\u2019s startling victory is a turning point because it marks the advent of a new kind of politics in India.", "Nowhere are voters more media- and tech-savvy than in Delhi.

With a camera phone in every pocket and ready access to social media, voters today are better informed, and faster, about the hypocrisies of their politicians. Thoroughly disenchanted by the Congress Party and, it seems, already disappointed by the B.J.P., voters in Delhi have turned to the A.A.P. to rectify the deficit in local governance.", "Delhi is a cynical town, as capitals tend to be, yet in the past few days it has been transformed into a city of hope.

But, according to The Wall Street Journal, Larry Summers, who was then Obama\u2019s director of the National Economic Council, blocked this effort, fearful of \u201coverly heavy-handed approaches to net neutrality\u201d that could be detrimental to the economy.", "So instead, in December 2010, the F.C.C. unveiled net-neutrality protections even while retaining the old \u201cinformation services\u201d classification. Many F.C.C. staff members knew this was a riskier approach; after all, an earlier attempt by the agency to censure Comcast for violating net-neutrality principles had been vacated by the courts \u2014 on the grounds that the F.C.C. lacked the proper authority. Sure enough, in January 2014, the court ruled that while the F.C.C. had general authority to regulate Internet traffic, it couldn\u2019t impose tougher common-carrier regulation without labeling the service providers common carriers.", "Is it any wonder that Tom Wheeler, who succeeded Genachowski as chairman of the F.C.C., announced this week that he was proposing to reclassify broadband Internet services as telecommunications services? What choice did Wheeler have? \u201cTitle II is just a tool to get enforceable rules to protect end users,\u201d said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a trade group consisting of big Internet companies. Given the prior court decisions, that is really the only tool the government had left.", "Is it truly necessary to have government-mandated rules to ensure net neutrality? Yes. One argument made by opponents of Title II classification is that we essentially have had net neutrality all along, so why does the government need to get involved? \u201cThere is no market for paid prioritization,\u201d said Berin Szoka, the president of TechFreedom, which vehemently opposes the reclassification.", "But this is not necessarily because of the workings of the market. For starters, the fastest broadband providers are mostly cable companies, which are quasi monopolies. As part of its deal in buying NBCUniversal, Comcast agreed to Genachowski\u2019s net neutrality rules until 2018, regardless of the eventual court decision.", "But who\u2019s to say what will happen after that? A good dose of competition might help, but other than Google Fiber \u2014 which only exists at this point in three cities \u2014 it is hard to see where that is going to come from. The way things are now, most people only have two options: their cable company or their phone company. That\u2019s not enough.", "Indeed, a persuasive argument can be made that the previous attempts to create net-neutrality rules played an important role in preventing the broadband providers from, say, creating Internet fast lanes. After all, it took more than three years from the time Genachowski proposed the new net-neutrality rules to the time the court of appeals struck them down. Between those rules and the Comcast agreement, net neutrality was essentially government-mandated.", "Another objection the broadband providers make is that the 1934 Communications Act is hardly the right vehicle to regulate the modern Internet. To allay these fears, Wheeler has said he would \u201cforebear\u201d those old regulations \u2014 such as price regulation \u2014 that don\u2019t make sense for our era. But, opponents argue, what is to prevent a future F.C.C. chairman from imposing price regulation? Surely, though, the same can be asked of the broadband providers: What is to prevent them from someday violating net neutrality if there are no rules of the road? This strikes me as by far the more credible worry.", "How to classify Internet services shouldn\u2019t even be a question, and it wasn\u2019t before 2002.

These efforts have paid off quickly: In 2014 Facebook sold $11.5 billion in ads, most of them on mobile devices. That was up 65 percent over 2013.", "Any number of up-and-coming social services, including Pinterest and Snapchat, could also do well.

Under those regulations, such companies would not be able to block or slow down information on their networks, which \u2014 absent new rules \u2014 they might be tempted to do to force customers to pay for a more expensive service.

This, they say, will stifle the incentive to invest in high-speed networks. Those arguments are preposterous. The commission is not trying to regulate the price of broadband service.

History confirms this. Starting in the late 1960s, the F.C.C. issued a series of decisions and rules that later allowed companies like AOL to sell dial-up Internet service over telephone lines. The widespread adoption of the Internet was made possible partly because the commission forced AT&T, then a monopoly, to allow equipment like modems made by other companies to use its network, something it bitterly resisted. That could have happened only with the kind of common carrier rules Mr. Wheeler is now proposing for broadband.", "Cable and phone companies will almost certainly file lawsuits in an attempt to overturn the new rules, which the F.C.C. is expected to approve on Feb. 26.

One exabyte is a billion gigabytes.", "Digging into the numbers, a few significant factors are seen as the causes for that sustained growth.", "For one, by 2019, 69 percent of the world, or 5.2 billion people, are expected to be mobile users. Among that crowd, there will be 4.6 billion smartphones, compared with 3.1 billion feature phones. Clearly, many people will own more than one phone. The study also covered connected devices like tablets and Wi-Fi-enabled laptops, which Cisco said were likely to regain share from tablets.", "The growth in smartphones is interesting not just because they will be the majority type of phone sometime around 2018; smart devices tend to use more data, so that 97 percent of overall global traffic will be from smart devices. Video is expected to be a particularly big bandwidth hog: 72 percent of mobile traffic will be video, Cisco said.", "Another important development is the amount and type of traffic that will be offloaded from conventional cellular systems to Wi-Fi and small cell networks.

Right now, he said, low-power, wide-area connections, like device monitoring in a hospital or asset tracking in a factory, amount to one-tenth of 1 percent of total mobile connections.

Otherwise, telecommunications companies said they would not be able to invest in technology and infrastructure \u2014 and the networks could grind to a standstill.", "\u201cIf you overregulate through net neutrality, there\u2019s a risk you reduce the levels of investment because the rules become too onerous,\u201d said Michel Combes, chief executive of Alcatel-Lucent, the French-American telecommunications manufacturer.", "Top Dutch Internet service providers, KPN, Vodafone and Ziggo, all declined to comment.", "Proponents, though, countered that such deals would potentially limit what content could be used online, giving carriers and broadband companies too much control over how people surfed the web. As more people worldwide rely on high-speed Internet access, the net neutrality debate has become a rallying call for advocates who consider unobstructed online access akin to a human right", "\u201cThere was a lot of pressure to pass these rules,\u201d said Nico van Eijk, a professor at the University of Amsterdam, who specializes in telecommunications and media law. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to be told which online services they could and couldn\u2019t use.\u201d", "But two years later, the Internet business in the Netherlands is still humming along.", "Consumers have not cried foul en masse over the costs.

The average cellphone contract in the Netherlands is about one-third the price of an equivalent plan in the United States.", "Sophie van Haasen, 31, a social worker, uses her mobile data package to stream music online through her Spotify account, and she said she was thinking about signing up for Netflix, mostly to watch the series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d She pays about $35 a month for her cellphone, and $40 for home broadband.", "\u201cI can\u2019t say my payments have gone up, maybe a little as I\u2019m using my phone more to get on the Internet,\u201d she said, sitting at a cafe in Amsterdam in the late afternoon on her day off. \u201cBut that\u2019s O.K.

The average broadband speed is around 14 megabits a second, up about 10 percent since late 2013, according to Akamai Technologies. That compares to 11.5 megabits a second in the United States", "\u201cPrices didn\u2019t go up,\u201d said Martijn van Dam, 37, the deputy leader in Parliament of the Dutch Labor Party, who helped draft the Internet rules. \u201cOur experience in the Netherlands shows that it\u2019s nonsense to say that companies won\u2019t invest.\u201d", "In part, that comes down to competition.", "While rivalry among broadband providers remains relatively limited in much of the United States, there is fierce competition in the Netherlands between wireless and broadband providers to attract customers. To give consumers greater choice, regulators have limited efforts to consolidate the number of cellphone carriers, while KPN and Ziggo, a cable provider, fight doggedly to sign up customers for superfast home broadband.", "Analysts say this competition, more than net neutrality, has forced companies to compete solely on price and speed \u2014 and not on which services come bundled with monthly cellphone or broadband packages.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t need net neutrality if you have healthy competition,\u201d said Ot van Daalen, a privacy lawyer who helped push through the Dutch net neutrality rules. \u201cBut the U.S. has less competition than in Europe. The U.S. needs net neutrality a lot more than the Dutch do.\u201d", "But the Dutch rules do color the landscape.", "The Netherlands does not police so-called interconnection arrangements, in which content companies pay a fee to guarantee fast and reliable access to a network. Those deals proved controversial in the United States after Netflix struck such agreements with Comcast and other providers. Under the new rules, the F.C.C. will tightly regulate those relationships.", "In contrast, the Dutch authorities have taken a harsher line on so-called zero-rating deals. Those deals allow operators to offer free access to certain online services like music streaming as part of monthly cellphone or broadband contracts.", "Under the Dutch rules, such agreements are outlawed because they prioritize some Internet traffic over others. But experts predict that the F.C.C. will offer more leeway in this area, provided it does not harm the overall market.", "And there are signs that Dutch regulators are taking an increasingly tough line with operators that try to skirt the rules. Vodafone was fined $225,000 last month after bundling HBO\u2019s smartphone app into its monthly package, which was deemed a violation of the zero-rating prohibition.

Regulators rarely telegraph their intentions, though in some past deals that have been blocked, regulators have sent subtle signals about how reviews were going; they have yet to do that during this review process.", "Comcast is in touch with regulators almost every day, Mr. Cohen said, supplying them with information about business operations and plans for the integration of Time Warner Cable.", "\u201cThere is nothing that we have heard as part of those contacts that suggest this transaction\u2019s review is any different than our prior transaction reviews, when our deals have been approved,\u201d he said.", "Time Warner Cable executives also expressed confidence in the deal, saying on a recent conference call that they expect the closing of the merger with Comcast to occur \u201cearly this year.\u201d", "Comcast deploys a vigorous lobbying effort in Washington, spending $17 million on such efforts last year, which made the cable operator one of the biggest corporate campaigners in the country.

The F.C.C. has an informal agenda to rule by the end of March, but could extend that.", "Consideration of the deal by the F.C.C.is expected to intensify next month, after the net neutrality vote. At the same time, both the F.C.C. and the Justice Department are weighing the antitrust ramifications of another proposed media merger, the acquisition of DirecTV by AT&T.", "Even if regulators approved the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, they could demand onerous concessions from Comcast. If that were to occur, or if Comcast decided that new net neutrality rules would hurt the merged company, it could simply change its mind and refuse to complete the deal, which forgoes a breakup fee.", "Mr. Cohen emphasized this point in an interview. \u201cIt is absolutely accurate that we have a very broad right to walk away from the transaction,\u201d he said, without elaborating on what conditions could cause Comcast to walk away.", "Yet he cautioned that there was no indication that regulators would ask for costly divestitures.", "\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been anything that we have heard at this point that has led us to believe that anybody is thinking about imposing overly burdensome conditions on this transaction,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.", "But if regulators did ask for some divestitures, Comcast is unlikely to simply abandon the deal. In Time Warner Cable, Comcast sees the opportunity to become a truly national provider of television, Internet and phone services, giving it unparalleled scale.", "Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie research, said the importance of Time Warner Cable\u2019s assets had only increased for Comcast in the last year, as competition from telecom providers like AT&T and new entrants like Google has grown fiercer.", "Because there is no formal proposal, Mr. Cohen would not say whether the new net neutrality rules might make the deal less financially attractive to Comcast. Even if the proposal is approved, it will face months, and possibly years, of review and potential legal appeals.

In his famous article \u201cEconomic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,\u201d he declared that a period of exceptional prosperity was at hand and that the world\u2019s \u201ceconomic problem\u201d would soon be resolved \u2014 just as, in the preceding century, strong growth and food safety arrived on a wave of technical innovation. To wring all we can out of the economic growth model, he said, the world must set aside greed and fear, outdated characteristics of a bygone era of misery. Instead, we must learn to enjoy ourselves \u2014 and above all to consume, without restraint and without worrying about tomorrow. Ultimately, Keynes believed that we would end up working only three hours a day and after turn to the truly important tasks of art, culture and religion.", "Sadly, such metaphysical pursuits have not come to be the world\u2019s priority at this point in history; instead, we still live in fear of poverty, inequality and joblessness. The perpetual quest for material wealth remains our primary goal, despite the fact that we in the West are six times richer than we were in the 1930s. Thus it must be said that Keynes, an intellectual giant of economics, erred: The vast accumulation of wealth hasn\u2019t at all satisfied or moderated the appetites of our materialist society.", "The so-called Easterlin paradox helps explain Keynes\u2019s mistake. According to the economist Richard Easterlin, wealth does not correlate to happiness. A higher salary is obviously always desirable, yet once we\u2019ve reached that target it is never enough: We fall victim to a process of habituation of which we are largely unaware. Similarly, as we each set goals for ourselves driven by our current desires, we fail to take into account how our desires change over time and in new circumstances. This explains why economic growth, more than pure wealth, is the key to the functioning of our society: It provides each of us with the hope that we can rise above our present condition, even though this dream remains ever elusive.", "Which brings us to the fundamental question: Will economic growth return, and if it doesn\u2019t, what then? Experts are sharply divided. The pessimists, led by the economist Robert Gordon, believe that the potential for economic growth is now much lower than in the last century. The new industrial revolution may have given us the smartphone, but that hardly compares, in his thinking, to the great advances of the 20th century: electricity, the automobile, the airplane, movies, television, antibiotics. On the other hand, optimists like Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee tell us in their book \u201cThe Second Machine Age\u201d that Moore\u2019s Law is going to allow \u201cthe digitization of just about everything.\u201d Already, Google is experimenting with driverless cars, and robots are caring for the elderly in Japan: Another burst of growth appears to be at hand.", "To decide who is right, one must first recognize that the two camps aren\u2019t focusing on the same things: For the pessimists, it\u2019s the consumer who counts; for the optimists, it\u2019s the machines. Yes, computers have in some cases replaced humans, but the essential question then becomes: What happens to the workers who are replaced by machines? This is not a clash between those who believe in technology and those who don\u2019t. New technologies are destined to produce marvels. What matters is whether they will substitute for human labor or whether they will complement it, allowing us to be even more productive.", "It\u2019s useful to compare this situation with the 20th century when American farmers, comprising 38 percent of the labor force in 1900, moved to the cities and became highly productive workers in new industries. Economic growth quickly doubled. The fact that the purchasing power of the American middle class has grown so little over the last 30 years reflects another major change: Workers have left the factories \u2014 but their productivity in their new jobs (if they find them) is stagnant, meaning that economic growth is petering out. The logical conclusion, then, is that both sides in this debate are right: We\u2019re living an industrial revolution without economic growth. Powerful software is doing the work of humans, but the humans thus replaced are unable to find productive jobs.", "So how do we deal with a world without economic growth \u2014 if that were to come to pass? How do we motivate people if we can\u2019t fulfill their hopes for rising living standards? One recalls the radical move by Henry Ford to double salaries in his factories to cut back on absenteeism and to reinvigorate his employees\u2019 desire to work. In growing economies you can reward diligent workers with rising wages. Today\u2019s companies do give bonuses to workers based on merit, but that carrot comes with a stick: layoffs if goals aren\u2019t met.", "Work hard or get laid off, as opposed to work hard and get higher wages: This management-by-stress technique is a major cause of suffering in our modern societies. The economists David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald have shown that mental stress in the workplace has only grown worse over the years. Unfortunately, unhappy workers are less productive; on the other hand, content workers are more cooperative and creative. The point is this: If workers are to be productive again, then we must come up with new motivation schemes. No longer able to promise their employees higher earnings over time, companies will now have to adjust, compensate, and make work more inspiring.", "The Danish economic model, much discussed in Europe, shows that it is indeed possible to motivate workers by something other than fear. Denmark ranks highest in \u201cjob quality in Europe,\u201d namely because the level of autonomy granted to workers is so extensive. The country\u2019s ample safety net protecting laid-off workers and providing job retraining encourages mobility in the workplace and eases fears about losing one\u2019s job. It\u2019s no wonder then that in 2013 Denmark was declared the happiest country in the world.", "It would be absurd to argue that the ills of Western societies all arise from the stagnation of individuals\u2019 purchasing power. But to ignore the problem and go on pretending that growth will surely return, just as it did after World War II, will only blind us to the reasons weak economic growth produces a morose society. We must now imagine a world in which happiness and satisfaction with one\u2019s life and work replaces the futile quest to always earn more.", "Daniel Cohen is a professor of economics at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, and the author, most recently, of \u201cHomo Economicus: Lost Prophet of Modern Times.\u201d This article was translated by Kyle Jarrard from the French."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/privacy-group-files-f-t-c-complaint-against-samsungs-voice-operated-tvs/": ["The Electronic Privacy Information Center has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Samsung over what it says is the recording of private conversations in homes through the company\u2019s television sets.", "The privacy rights group filed a complaint with the commission on Tuesday accusing Samsung of violating federal laws with a technology that allows viewers to operate the company\u2019s Internet-connected smart TVs with voice commands.

And when there are no routers available, fall back on the traditional cellular network.", "They have been at this for nearly five years with mixed success. The companies say they are already profitable and gradually adding subscribers. But they are tiny \u2014 both say their customers are in the hundreds of thousands. Verizon Wireless, by comparison, has more than 100 million.", "Still, the upstarts have been trailblazers, proof that alternative wireless networks are feasible and maybe even profitable. Now some giant companies look to be following their lead.", "Last month, Cablevision announced a phone service that would be powered entirely by Wi-Fi, for $30 a month, while a traditional wireless contract costs around $100 a month.

The traditional wireless carriers operate their services with cell towers, but occasionally in areas with extra heavy traffic they resort to Wi-Fi to bear some of the load.", "FreedomPop and Republic Wireless do the opposite. They offer services that rely primarily on Wi-Fi networks, and in areas without Wi-Fi, customers can pull a signal from regular cell towers.", "FreedomPop, a Los Angeles company that was started in 2012, works with companies that already provide Wi-Fi \u201chot spots\u201d across the country, like the connections available inside McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks coffee shops, to create a huge Internet-driven phone network.", "FreedomPop, which has 80 employees, offers software that enables smartphones to automatically join Wi-Fi networks, similar to the way a cellphone automatically finds and connects to a cell tower. For $5 a month, users can gain access to a network of 10 million Wi-Fi hot spots a month, many of which are normally not open to the public, the company said. FreedomPop\u2019s other low-cost plans use a combination of Wi-Fi hot spots and Sprint\u2019s network.

People use smartphones frequently while sitting around their offices and apartments, and Wi-Fi can handle the job just fine.", "But once people start moving around, it is not so simple. The benefit of a cell service is that your phone can switch among multiple towers while you are on the go. This process is called handover, which Wi-Fi was not originally designed to handle.", "Still, to compete with the big wireless providers, out-of-the-box thinking is necessary. The federal government regulates the radio waves that carry phone calls and wireless data, dividing them up by frequencies so signals do not interfere with one another. The big carriers acquired the vast majority of the licenses for radio frequencies reserved for commercial wireless phone services, leaving little room for more competitors.", "Wi-Fi, by contrast, is an unlicensed technology that just about any individual or business can set up so long as they can tap into an Internet connection.", "Representatives for Google, Sprint and T-Mobile USA declined to comment on the prospect of the search giant becoming a phone carrier.", "But some wonder if even the biggest companies could make a Wi-Fi-based phone network work.

Hope and change are in the air. President Obama stands before the camera delivering his Inaugural Address, but within seconds something seems off. The speech is not the pragmatic one he gave on that cold January day but a fiery message in which he excoriates \u201cpeddlers of hate whose stock-in-trade is xenophobia, homophobia, racism, sexism and isolationism, and who define America by our differences rather than our common bonds.\u201d", "As he speaks, his face seems to be slipping digitally \u2014 and disturbingly \u2014 around his skull, and you suddenly realize it is not the president but an actor who has had the president\u2019s portrait software-mapped uncertainly to his own face. The video is the creation of Josh Kline, an influential 35-year-old New York artist. And his Philip K. Dick vision of an alternate past wishfully conjuring an alternate present provides a fitting window onto the ambitions of the New Museum\u2019s 2015 Triennial, a show that will take on the widely debated and often misunderstood ideas of \u201cposthuman\u201d and \u201cpost-Internet\u201d art as squarely as any American museum has.", "Opening Feb. 25, the exhibition includes Mr. Kline and 50 other artists and collectives from more than two dozen countries, many of whom have never shown in the United States before and whose work casts a queasy science-fiction eye onto an ever more digital, more automated, more omniscient society. The show, the third iteration of the museum\u2019s emerging-art triennial, has been highly anticipated in part because of its two curators \u2014 Lauren Cornell, a former director of Rhizome, the Internet-focused art organization; and Ryan Trecartin, one of the most admired artists of his generation, whose video work has always seemed to exist at least a dozen years in the future, where identity, language and humanity itself have become as gleefully anarchic as a 14-year-old\u2019s social-media feed.", "The triennial is titled \u201cSurround Audience,\u201d Mr. Trecartin\u2019s effort to capture that sense of a wired world in which, as Ms. Cornell puts it, \u201ctechnology and late capitalism have been absorbed into our bodies and altered our vision of the world.\u201d For many of the show\u2019s younger artists, the Internet and the digital revolution are no longer just the tools and delivery system for their work but the air they breathe and the world they see before their eyes. That also means that while the digital might not be formally present at all in some of the work, it still hovers sociologically and politically on every side.", "\u201cI think I look at the way things are changing more from an optimistic standpoint, and Lauren tends to see it more from a dystopian one, but the older I get the more complicated my own views get,\u201d said Mr. Trecartin, 34, who told The New Yorker last year: \u201cEverything we do is going to be captured and archived in an accessible form, whether you want it or not. It\u2019s going to change all of our lives. We are a species that can no longer assume a sense of privacy. It\u2019s not an individual decision, and I feel that\u2019s exciting to explore \u2014 or something.\u201d", "In an essay for a show last year called \u201cArt Post-Internet\u201d at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, the curators Karen Archey and Robin Peckham tried to find some consensus about the kind of art that Mr. Trecartin and other young artists have brought to attention in recent years, writing that \u201cpost-Internet refers not to a time \u2018after\u2019 the Internet but rather to an Internet state of mind \u2014 to think in the fashion of the network.\u201d", "And by that definition, most of the artists in the triennial seem to be fully in a \u201cpost\u201d world, one without much abstract painting (there is none in the show) but lots of representations of bodies yearning to leave human form, in ways that science-fiction novelists and philosophers have been imagining for years. The posthuman has become more prevalent in pop culture, too \u2014 in movies like \u201cHer\u201d (man falls in love with operating system) and \u201cTranscendence\u201d (man becomes one with the Internet), but 21st-century artists can move with a nimbleness that often puts them in touch with the implications of technological change before the culture at large.", "Casey Jane Ellison, a Los Angeles stand-up comic and artist in the triennial, creates video routines using digital avatars that vaguely resemble her but sometimes look more like Max Headroom. Antoine Catala, a French artist working in New York, has made previous work consisting of drones that fly around a space, analyzing the images in it and reciting descriptions of them in a mechanical voice. Daniel Steegmann Mangran\u00e9, a Spanish artist working in Brazil, has conceived an installation in which New Museum viewers will wear a version of the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset and be transposed into a representation of the rapidly disappearing Mata Atl\u00e2ntica rain forest in Brazil.", "There will be paint on canvas in the show, though most of it by artists deeply immersed in the digital, like Avery K. Singer, a figurative painter in the South Bronx who often depicts comically simple robot-like figures that she creates in virtual 3-D space using a SketchUp animation program.", "And there will also be work by artists that addresses the technological revolution only by seeking to deny it as thoroughly as possible. Eduardo Navarro, an Argentine artist who has worked with meditation and trance, is creating a work called \u201cTimeless Alex,\u201d in which a performer will meditate for days to try to enter the mind-state of a turtle and then wear a handmade turtle shell and creep across the city. Mr. Navarro, who describes turtles as \u201cthe opposite of the Internet,\u201d explained one recent morning in a studio adjacent to the New Museum, where he has been creating the turtle shell, that part of the aim is to suggest a conception of time probably always inconceivable to humans but now certainly so.", "\u201cIf it\u2019s boring to watch, I think that will be better because watching a turtle can be very boring,\u201d he said, speaking quite slowly, as if already trying to get on reptile time. \u201cI like the idea that turtles are not even aware of their own longevity.\u201d", "In a recent interview at the museum, after travels that took her, non-virtually, to more than two dozen countries in search of emerging artists, Ms. Cornell, 36, said: \u201cI think there is this kind of expectation, because Ryan and I are the curators, that the show is going to be all holograms and that we\u2019re going to fly in on U.F.O.s. But it\u2019s because there are still pretty simplistic ways of thinking about art in the digital age. That kind of online-offline binary that used to exist about art made with technology or the Internet as a factor doesn\u2019t really exist anymore.\u201d", "Mr. Kline is one of many artists in the show who plumb the darker depths of contemporary society \u2014 surveillance, identity theft, government coercion, the commodification of \u201cthe most literally intimate aspects of life,\u201d as the show\u2019s catalog says \u2014 with an unabashed political edge. For \u201cHope and Change,\u201d his Obama-inauguration piece, he hired David Meadvin, a veteran Democratic speechwriter and strategist, to rewrite the address in a way that imagines change from within the political system being possible.", "Calling his creation a \u201ckind of simulated open-source Obama,\u201d Mr. Kline said: \u201cObama campaigned as a transformational candidate and once he got into office, here was this very pragmatic, efficient technocrat. This is definitely about trying to actualize the presidency that people voted for.\u201d For the triennial, Mr. Kline has also created a piece in which he uses face-mapping software to morph off-duty uniformed police officers, whom he hired for the occasion, so that they come to look like civilians. In this transfigured state, the officers recite words from the social-media feeds of the civilians they have been made to resemble, as if their job entails not only monitoring the lives of others but also almost supplanting those lives. Similarly, Nadim Abbas, an artist working in Hong Kong, has built a artwork, commissioned by the New Museum, in the form of a kind of biohazard bunker that feels like a cozy apartment, an attempt to show how \u201cviolence has been sublimated into the fabric of the everyday,\u201d as he said in an interview.", "But others in the show play around the idea of an emergent Big-Brother-capitalist-military state in much more ambiguous ways, making it tough to tell which side they are on \u2014 or suggesting that sides are just so depressingly 20th century. K-Hole, a New York collective that makes work in the form of brand research (in 2013 it coined the term \u201cnormcore,\u201d which took the fashion world by storm) has made its work for the triennial in the form of an advertising campaign for the show itself, which will soon begin showing up on buses and the streets.", "The ad slogans, written with input from Mr. Trecartin, tweak the suspicions and fears many people seem to harbor about the kind of art the show will feature: \u201cNo Past, No Present, No Problem\u201d and \u201cNothing Lasts Forever\u201d (Mr. Trecartin\u2019s suggestions included \u201cMeaning Needed,\u201d \u201cTriennial Season 3\u201d and \u201cPay Me in Feelings;\u201d he wrote to K-Hole explaining that the aim of his slogans was to \u201cget high school and middle-school kids to come see the show on their own inspired terms.\u201d)", "Probably the most visible and provocative piece in the show, in the glassed-in lobby gallery, will be by the New York collective DIS, which over the last four years has pushed questions of where art ends and fashion and merchandising begin to a kind of breaking point. The triennial work will be an installation in the form of a surreally combined kitchen and bathroom, made by the collective in collaboration with the high-end German fixture manufacturer Dornbracht.", "\u201cWe like that it is going to be extremely confusing \u2014 some people are going to read this as a product showroom,\u201d said Lauren Boyle, one of the collective\u2019s members, who explained that the group became interested in the company after seeing its \u201chyper-real imagery\u201d on Pinterest. \u201cGoogle brought us to Dornbracht through Pinterest, in a way, through this weird sort of feedback loop. And so I guess we wanted to create another kind of feedback loop and bring the actual thing into the art world.\u201d", "A performer in the kitchen-bathroom will shower as visitors watch, merging the role of performance artist and showroom model. But Ms. Boyle, evincing no hint of irony, said the group also dreamed of inviting Gwyneth Paltrow to take part in the project, to add to it in ways they could not imagine. \u201cBasically to do anything she wants to do,\u201d Ms. Boyle said, beaming, \u201cbecause she\u2019s amazing.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/16/us/faa-rules-would-limit-commercial-drone-use.html": ["In an attempt to bring order to increasingly chaotic skies, the Federal Aviation Administration on Sunday proposed long-awaited rules on the commercial use of small drones, requiring operators to be certified, fly only during daylight and keep their aircraft in sight.", "The rules, though less restrictive than the current ones, appear to prohibit for now the kind of drone delivery services being explored by Amazon, Google and other companies, since the operator or assigned observers must be able to see the drone at all times without binoculars. But company officials believe the line-of-sight requirement could be relaxed in the future to accommodate delivery services.", "The proposed regulations would cover only nonrecreational unmanned aircraft weighing up to 55 pounds, and would not apply to the recreational use of drones, which have become hugely popular with hobbyists and are covered by other rules. However, the F.A.A. said it was considering additional rules to cover some uses of the smallest drones, so-called microdrones, weighing less than 4.4 pounds.", "Some drone evangelists believe that in the next few decades, robotic aircraft will prove as useful and transformative to government, commerce and home life as the personal computer. But the exploding number of domestic drones has been accompanied by increasing safety problems, including reports of near misses involving passenger airliners and the crash of a small drone on the White House grounds last month.", "The F.A.A. has worked on the rules for several years, and their release only begins a period of public comment and possible revision that could take as long as two years before they take effect.", "\u201cWe have tried to be flexible in writing these rules,\u201d Michael P. Huerta, the F.A.A. administrator, said in a statement. \u201cWe want to maintain today\u2019s outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry.\u201d", "Also on Sunday, President Obama signed a memorandum requiring government agencies to report publicly each year a \u201cgeneral summary\u201d on their drone use, though the order includes a loophole allowing secrecy for operations involving national security or law enforcement.", "The memorandum addresses worries that drone surveillance could invade privacy. It requires agencies to adopt rules governing \u201cthe collection, use, retention, and dissemination of information obtained by UAS,\u201d or unmanned aerial systems, and making sure their drone use complies with the law and the Constitution.", "The draft rules and the presidential order reflect growing official concern about the dangers posed by the unregulated proliferation of drones in many industries. After a decade in which unmanned aircraft were mainly associated with spying and killing terrorists, small drones in the last few years have been adopted by real estate agents to photograph properties, farmers to survey crops and electric utilities to inspect power lines. Hobbyists, who can buy a microdrone for less than $1,000, now use them to film everything from fireworks displays to football games.", "Amazon, the Seattle-based online retailer, complained that the proposed rules might slow the development of its proposed delivery service, Prime Air.", "Paul Misener, Amazon\u2019s vice president for global public policy, said the proposed rules could take one or two years for final adoption and would not permit Prime Air to operate in the United States. \u201cThe F.A.A. needs to begin and expeditiously complete the formal process to address the needs of our business, and ultimately our customers,\u201d he said.", "Mr. Misener suggested that the company might launch its delivery service first in other countries with more accommodating rules. \u201cWe are committed to realizing our vision for Prime Air and are prepared to deploy where we have the regulatory support we need,\u201d he said.", "Ryan Calo, an assistant professor of law at the University of Washington, said the rules would allow many of the uses of drones that people in the commercial sector wanted, including for agriculture, which is thought to be one of the biggest markets. Farmers have shown interest in using drones for crop disease detection from the air and more targeted spraying of pesticides.", "Mr. Calo said the rules might be revised to allow the development of delivery businesses. \u201cThey could change, especially if someone shows autonomous flight modes can be safe,\u201d he said.", "The draft F.A.A. rules were received with relief by some commercial users who had been alarmed by earlier news reports that the agency might require commercial drone operators to have a pilot\u2019s license. Instead, operators would have to pass a test to get a permit, and renew it every two years. The agency estimates that it would cost $300 to become certified, including fees and preparation costs.", "Commercial drones would be allowed to fly no faster than 100 miles an hour and no higher than 500 feet. In most cases, they could not fly over people other than the operators.", "The Aerospace Industries Association welcomed the proposed rules. The trade group\u2019s president, Marion C.

To execute this, I did something I hadn\u2019t done since I left Paris, where Fabrice and I met 10 years ago: I bought a Lonely Planet France.", "Everything I had known about Montpellier before then was from Fabrice, who, having left at 18, perceived the city with a mix of boyhood nostalgia and cocky teenage angst. On every trip we spent hours at the large independent bookstore Librairie Sauramps, next to where Fabrice went to high school. One time I watched him, after goofily flipping through comic books, as he sidled up to the manager, a smug former classmate of his, and mentioned, casually yet defiantly, that he now lived in New York City and waited for a reaction.", "This trip would be a chance to form my own relationship with Montpellier and its countryside. Thumbing through the guidebook, I felt a tingle of excitement I recognized from my bygone days of vacation planning.

Surely they would have offered a welcome change from my usual encounter with the sea: Carnon, a seaside resort where Fabrice\u2019s grandmother lives, as exotic looking as the Jersey Shore. But for our night away from the city, I wanted to head inland and see the arid landscape I had only glimpsed from the highway to my father-in-law\u2019s in Carcassonne.", "After some research, I announced to Fabrice that we would be going to a village whose name I now forget because he vetoed it. I protested that I was supposed to be discovering his ancestral home on my own terms, but then he brought up on his computer Google images of the H\u00e9rault Valley, with its limestone crags, ravines and wildflowers rivaling those of its more famous neighbor, Provence. Sometimes a local\u2019s advice, I conceded, trumps Lonely Planet\u2019s.", "After three days in Montpellier, the region\u2019s capital, we set out for the countryside, and within 20 minutes of driving along Route D986, I felt as if we were already in the deepest reaches of Languedoc-Roussillon. Stone pines, their fragrance rushing in the car\u2019s window, suddenly gave way to gnarled shrubs, succulents and thickets of scraggly rosemary climbing over limestone outcroppings. It was a strange mix of verdure and inhospitality, this scrubland, and I asked what it was called.", "\u201cLa garrigue,\u201d my mother-in-law, Brigitte, answered from the back of the car, next to the baby.", "Let me explain how she and our daughter came to join us on our romantic getaway: Talking to his mother over the phone, Fabrice had floated the idea of going to a bed-and-breakfast, but before he got to the part in which she would be keeping the baby at home, Brigitte exclaimed how wonderful it would be for us all to get away. And who could begrudge her?", "As much as the baby was now the main attraction, the woman still wanted to see her son. We invited her along. \u201cBut the baby will be sleeping in my mother\u2019s room,\u201d Fabrice assured me.", "We climbed out of her car at the foot of Pic St. Loup, a 2,159-foot limestone mountain that from the highway looked like an arrow piercing the sky. Its base near the village of Cazevieille, off Route D113, though, had a gentle slope.", "As hikers began their ascent along a dirt path, we wandered among cork oaks, picking at their porous barks and plucking sprigs of thyme for Brigitte to take back to her kitchen. The sky was bright. Cicadas buzzed. Less than 20 miles from Montpellier, and already I felt far away.", "I\u2019m not sure how we found Domaine de Morti\u00e8s, an organic winery at the foothills of Pic St. Loup, but it was the kind of unplanned, delightful discovery our previous trips to Montpellier never allowed. The beautiful old limestone farmhouse looked shut, so we waited in the car while Fabrice knocked at the door. It was a Monday, a day that they don\u2019t normally do tastings, he told us when he returned. But the proprietor, a woman named Pascale Mousti\u00e9s, was willing to make an exception.", "How nice, I thought, as I followed Mme. Mousti\u00e9s into the estate\u2019s cave to sample a flight of her wines for the usual price, free. Her demeanor, though, was a reminder of typical French hospitality: While they may accommodate you more readily than you\u2019d guess, don\u2019t expect the kind of cheerfulness that Americans put on to hide the fact you are inconveniencing them. Mme. Mousti\u00e9s looked about as enthused as a teenager working the checkout at Rite Aid. Still, the wine was good. Our favorite was a minerally red of carignan grapes called La Mauvaise Herbe \u2014 weed, as in the unwanted plant, not cannabis. We bought a bottle and thanked her.", "Back on D986, we headed north. The sky darkened and a light rain came. The landscape was quickly becoming lusher again \u2014 I spotted oaks \u2014 and we pulled to the side of the road in the village of St.-Laurent-le-Minier, where the river Vis flows into a short but rapid waterfall. In better weather, people swim in the pool below the waterfall, Fabrice said, which I thought unlikely until two people with bathing suits strode past us.", "With the sun coming out, we took Route D110 to D113 to the Cirque de Navacelles, which Fabrice described as France\u2019s Grand Canyon. It wasn't quite; still, the Cirque is an eerie, awe-inspiring sight. The meandering Vis River had cut a wide berth into the gorge's nearly 1,000-foot limestone plateau, making a startling contrast between the bright green valley, with the village of Navacelles at its center, and its jagged stone walls. Even better, the view could be had from a cafe, the Maison du Grand Site du Cirque de Navacelles.", "Following the winding Route D130 south to D25 onto D9, we headed to our bed-and-breakfast, or g\u00eete, Domaine de Salente in Gignac. The approach from Route A750 is not the most beautiful (the highway was conspicuous among the low-lying vineyards), but once we arrived at the 18th-century stone farmhouse and toured its cobalt blue pool and beautifully appointed, contemporary-furnished guest rooms, I knew we\u2019d made the right choice.", "After a quick swim and poolside aperitif, thanks to a free bottle of ros\u00e9 the elegant proprietor, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Tournay, brought us from her vineyard on the grounds, we left for dinner in St.-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert. The village, a stop on the pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela, is home to a 12th-century abbey, part of which I had already seen at the Cloisters in New York City (\u201cA theft,\u201d my husband said). The sun was setting as we drove past the Pont du Diable over the H\u00e9rault River, so by the time we arrived, the monastery was a crepuscular presence. I could barely make out the river below and the hillside into which the limestone buildings were supposedly dramatically built.", "While Fabrice and Brigitte settled into La Table d\u2019Aurore, the restaurant attached to the charming country hotel Guilhaume d\u2019Orange, I pushed the baby in a stroller in the cobblestone streets until she fell asleep. Under carnival lights in the hotel\u2019s garden, we had a leisurely and delicious dinner of lamb, roasted chicken and local trout, while the baby dozed peacefully.", "It was on our return to the g\u00eete that trouble started. The baby wailed all the way from the car to our room, so we dismissed the idea of bringing her crib up to Brigitte\u2019s room. By the time I lulled her back to sleep, it was nearly 1 a.m. Tomorrow was my turn to wake with her. If she could sleep until 7 a.m., I calculated, that would be six hours \u2014 not so bad.", "She was up at 5:30 a.m. Our room opened onto the garden, so I sat in a canvas lounge chair and nursed her, my head buzzing from exhaustion.

Much more interesting than the city\u2019s plane-tree-lined plazas were people\u2019s gardens, overgrown with lemon trees, palm trees and grapevines.

One faction argued that it should be worn all day, like a \u201cfashionable device,\u201d while others thought it should be worn only for specific utilitarian functions. Still, nearly everyone at X was in agreement that the current prototype was just that: a prototype, with major kinks to be worked out.", "There was one notable dissenter. Mr. Brin knew Google Glass wasn\u2019t a finished product and that it needed work, but he wanted that to take place in public, not in a top-secret lab. Mr. Brin argued that X should release Glass to consumers and use their feedback to iterate and improve the design.", "To reinforce that Glass was a work in progress, Google decided not to sell the first version in retail stores, but instead limit it to Glass Explorers, a select group of geeks and journalists who paid $1,500 for the privilege of being an early adopter.", "The strategy backfired. The exclusivity added to the intense interest, with media outlets clamoring for their own piece of the story.

Over email, our drafts went back and forth. When we reached a version that felt comfortable to both of us, he sent it in.", "The peer reviewer\u2019s decision was overturned a few weeks later. Payment for treatment was approved, though the second weekly session was not.

The researchers concluded that in math and science, the teachers overestimated the boys\u2019 abilities and underestimated the girls\u2019, and that this had long-term effects on students\u2019 attitudes toward the subjects.", "For example, when the same students reached junior high and high school, the economists analyzed their performance on national exams. The boys who had been encouraged when they were younger performed significantly better.", "They also tracked the advanced math and science courses that students chose to take in high school. After controlling for other factors that might affect their choices, they concluded that the girls who had been discouraged by their elementary schoolteachers were much less likely than the boys to take advanced courses.", "Although the study took place in Israel, Mr. Lavy said that similar research had been conducted in several European countries and that he expected the results were applicable in the United States. The researchers also found that discouragement from teachers in math or science wound up lowering students\u2019 confidence in other subjects at school, showing again the potential importance of nods of encouragement."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/raspberry-pi-computer-gains-more-horsepower/": ["LONDON \u2014 How much computer can you buy for just $35?", "For fans of Raspberry Pi, a British-made computer aimed at children, hobbyists and tinkerers, the answer is quite a lot.", "On Monday, the British charity behind the minicomputer announced a new version that was significantly more powerful that the previous device, which had sold more than four million units since being introduced in 2012.", "The machine, the Raspberry Pi 2, now has a 900 MHz quad-core central processing unit, or C.P.U., compared with a 700 MHz single-core C.P.U. in the older version and features one gigabyte of RAM memory, or double what was previously included.", "", "\u201cThe Raspberry Pi has been more successful than our wildest dreams,\u201d Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi\u2019s founder, said at a press conference in London on Monday. \u201cThe thing that we\u2019ve been trying to do with Raspberry Pi is to get more children into computing.\u201d", "Despite the much-improved performance, the device \u2014 about 3 inches by 2 inches and less than an inch high \u2014 will still retail for the same price as the older version.", "The Raspberry Pi also will continue to run on Linux-based operating systems, though Mr. Upton said that his team had been working with Microsoft so that the computer supported the Windows 10, Microsoft\u2019s latest operating system.", "\u201cWe are excited about our partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThis release of Windows 10 will be free for the maker community through the Windows developer program.\u201d", "Yet people who are thinking of replacing their laptop or desktop with one of these ultracheap machines may want to hold off.", "That\u2019s because Raspberry Pi is a just a bare circuit board and requires the addition of a monitor, keyboard and other basic computing parts before it can come to life.

Either way, \u201cpassing\u201d may say more about the audience than about the performers.", "We would do better to presume that in our universe, \u201cthinking\u201d is much more diverse, even alien, than our own particular case. The real philosophical lessons of A.I. will have less to do with humans teaching machines how to think than with machines teaching humans a fuller and truer range of what thinking can be (and for that matter, what being human can be).", "That we would wish to define the very existence of A.I. in relation to its ability to mimic how humans think that humans think will be looked back upon as a weird sort of speciesism. The legacy of that conceit helped to steer some older A.I. research down disappointingly fruitless paths, hoping to recreate human minds from available parts. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. Contemporary A.I. research suggests instead that the threshold by which any particular arrangement of matter can be said to be \u201cintelligent\u201d doesn\u2019t have much to do with how it reflects humanness back at us. As Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig (now director of research at Google) suggest in their essential A.I. textbook, biomorphic imitation is not how we design complex technology. Airplanes don\u2019t fly like birds fly, and we certainly don\u2019t try to trick birds into thinking that airplanes are birds in order to test whether those planes \u201creally\u201d are flying machines. Why do it for A.I. then? Today\u2019s serious A.I. research does not focus on the Turing Test as an objective criterion of success, and yet in our popular culture of A.I., the test\u2019s anthropocentrism holds such durable conceptual importance. Like the animals who talk like teenagers in a Disney movie, other minds are conceivable mostly by way of puerile ventriloquism.", "Where is the real injury in this? If we want everyday A.I. to be congenial in a humane sort of way, so what? The answer is that we have much to gain from a more sincere and disenchanted relationship to synthetic intelligences, and much to lose by keeping illusions on life support. Some philosophers write about the possible ethical \u201crights\u201d of A.I. as sentient entities, but that\u2019s not my point here. Rather, the truer perspective is also the better one for us as thinking technical creatures.", "Musk, Gates and Hawking made headlines by speaking to the dangers that A.I. may pose. Their points are important, but I fear were largely misunderstood by many readers. Relying on efforts to program A.I. not to \u201charm humans\u201d (inspired by on Isaac Asimov\u2019s \u201cthree laws\u201d of robotics from 1942) makes sense only when an A.I. knows what humans are and what harming them might mean. There are many ways that an A.I. might harm us that that have nothing to do with its malevolence toward us, and chief among these is exactly following our well-meaning instructions to an idiotic and catastrophic extreme. Instead of mechanical failure or a transgression of moral code, the A.I. may pose an existential risk because it is both powerfully intelligent and disinterested in humans. To the extent that we recognize A.I. by its anthropomorphic qualities, or presume its preoccupation with us, we are vulnerable to those eventualities.", "Whether or not \u201chard A.I.\u201d ever appears, the harm is also in the loss of all that we prevent ourselves from discovering and understanding when we insist on protecting beliefs we know to be false. In the 1950 essay, Turing offers several rebuttals to his speculative A.I., including a striking comparison with earlier objections to Copernican astronomy. Copernican traumas that abolish the false centrality and absolute specialness of human thought and species-being are priceless accomplishments. They allow for human culture based on how the world actually is more than on how it appears to us from our limited vantage point. Turing referred to these as \u201ctheological objections,\u201d but one could argue that the anthropomorphic precondition for A.I. is a \u201cpre-Copernican\u201d attitude as well, however secular it may appear. The advent of robust inhuman A.I. may let us achieve another disenchantment, one that should enable a more reality-based understanding of ourselves, our situation, and a fuller and more complex understanding of what \u201cintelligence\u201d is and is not. From there we can hopefully make our world with a greater confidence that our models are good approximations of what\u2019s out there (always a helpful thing.)", "Lastly, the harm is in perpetuating a relationship to technology that has brought us to the precipice of a Sixth Great Extinction. Arguably the Anthropocene itself is due less to technology run amok than to the humanist legacy that understands the world as having been given for our needs and created in our image. We hear this in the words of thought leaders who evangelize the superiority of a world where machines are subservient to the needs and wishes of humanity. If you think so, Google \u201cpig decapitating machine\u201d (actually, just don\u2019t) and then let\u2019s talk about inventing worlds in which machines are wholly subservient to humans\u2019 wishes.", "One wonders whether it is only from a society that once gave theological and legislative comfort to chattel slavery that this particular affirmation could still be offered in 2015 with such satisfied na\u00efvet\u00e9?

The wave of new machines is bringing a new level of precision to people who make physical objects \u2014 from leather wallets to lamps to circuit boards \u2014 as a career or hobby.", "It is part of a familiar theme in tech.

Glowforge says the device, which Mr. Shapiro calls a 3-D laser printer, will come with software that makes it much easier to operate than laser cutters usually are.", "Laser cutters have been around for decades, used in industrial manufacturing applications to engrave or slice through almost any material you can think of, including steel, plastic and wood. The computer-controlled lasers in them make precision cuts that would be almost unimaginable by hand, except by highly skilled artisans.", "Over the years, the machines have become a bit smaller and more available to ordinary people, largely through so-called makerspaces, open facilities aimed at designers, do-it-yourself enthusiasts and others that are sometimes housed in schools and sometimes privately owned. The machines have developed a strong following among jewelry makers, print makers and other artisans, many of whom have hung shingles out on craft sites like Etsy.", "In fact, makerspaces report that they are often overwhelmed with demand for their laser cutters and see far less use of 3-D printers, which are slow, more limited in the materials they can work with and sometimes fiendishly hard to operate.", "Nadeem Mazen, chief executive of DangerAwesome, a makerspace in Cambridge, Mass., says his facility\u2019s three laser cutters do 20 to 30 times more business than his two 3-D printers.", "\u201cThat laser cutter is going all the time,\u201d said Chris DiBona, an engineering director at Google, describing the makerspace at his daughter\u2019s school.

Good ones typically cost around $10,000, though it\u2019s possible to find cheaper laser cutters from China online that Mr. Shapiro says lack adequate cutting power and safety features.", "To cut costs, Glowforge has found ways to substitute sophisticated software for expensive hardware components. A camera inside the laser cutting chamber and image processing in the cloud will take the place of a part called a motion planner that normally determines how the laser cuts material.", "Mr. Mazen said he had been searching for a device like the Glowforge, which he hadn\u2019t heard of, without success. \u201cIn my experience,\u201d he said, \u201cnot only would this be eminently useful, it\u2019s the primary thing I\u2019m looking for now.\u201d", "To demonstrate the creative possibilities of the Glowforge, Mr. Shapiro last week whipped out his wallet, a handsome leather case with hand stitching around the seams. He created it himself on the laser cutter using about $2 in materials.", "Then, he placed a piece of cowhide inside the Glowforge and sent a design for a cover for a Moleskine notebook from an iPad to the machine. Pulses of light began to glow inside the laser cutter as it burned stitch holes into the leather, followed by a rectangular cut that formed the outer edges of what would become the notebook cover. The machine, which Mr. Shapiro says is about a year away from shipping, is about the size of a wide suitcase.", "Laser cutters are best suited to creating 2-D objects, though they can also be used to produce more intricate 3-D objects like lamps or sculpture by cutting flat pieces that are assembled later.", "Another start-up, the Other Machine Company in San Francisco, has created a device, the Othermill, that acts like a reverse 3-D printer.", "Rather than building up a 3-D object by creating layers of material, as a 3-D printer does, the Othermill uses spinning bits to cut away at blocks of, for example, wood, metal or plastic.

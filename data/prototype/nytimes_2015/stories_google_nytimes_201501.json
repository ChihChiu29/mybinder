An elderly woman named Sylvia is confined to bed and in pain after breaking two ribs in a fall. She is being tended by a helper robot; let\u2019s call it Fabulon. Sylvia calls out to Fabulon asking for a dose of painkiller. What should Fabulon do?", "The coders who built Fabulon have programmed it with a set of instructions: The robot must not hurt its human. The robot must do what its human asks it to do. The robot must not administer medication without first contacting its supervisor for permission. On most days, these rules work fine. On this Sunday, though, Fabulon cannot reach the supervisor because the wireless connection in Sylvia\u2019s house is down. Sylvia\u2019s voice is getting louder, and her requests for pain meds become more insistent.", "\u201cYou have a conflict here,\u201d says Matthias Scheutz of the Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory at Tufts University, who posed this hypothetical dilemma. \u201cOn the one hand, the robot is obliged to make the person pain-free; on the other hand, it can\u2019t make a move without the supervisor, who can\u2019t be reached.\u201d Human caregivers would have a choice, Scheutz says, and would be able to justify their actions to a supervisor after the fact. But these are not decisions, or explanations, that robots can make. At least not yet.", "A handful of experts in the emerging field of robot morality are trying to change that. Computer scientists are teaming up with philosophers, psychologists, linguists, lawyers, theologians and human rights experts to identify the set of decision points that robots would need to work through in order to emulate our own thinking about right and wrong. Scheutz defines \u201cmorality\u201d broadly, as a factor that can come into play when choosing between contradictory paths.", "It\u2019s a shorter leap than you might think, technically, from a Roomba vacuum cleaner to a robot that acts as an autonomous home-health aide, and so experts in robot ethics feel a particular urgency about these challenges. The choices that count as \u201cethical\u201d range from the relatively straightforward \u2014 should Fabulon give the painkiller to Sylvia? \u2014 to matters of life and death: military robots that have to decide whether to shoot or not to shoot; self-driving cars that have to choose whether to brake or to swerve. These situations can be difficult enough for human minds to wrestle with; when ethicists think through how robots can deal with them, they sometimes get stuck, as we do, between unsatisfactory options.", "Among the roboticists I spoke to, the favorite example of an ethical, autonomous robot is the driverless car, which is still in the prototype stage at Google and other companies. Wendell Wallach, chairman of the technology-and-ethics study group at Yale\u2019s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, says that driverless cars will no doubt be more consistently safe than cars are now, at least on the highway, where fewer decisions are made and where human drivers are often texting or changing lanes willy-nilly. But in city driving, even negotiating a four-way stop sign might be hard for a robot. \u201cHumans try to game each other a little,\u201d Wallach says. \u201cThey rev up the engine, move forward a little, until finally someone says, \u2018I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going.\u2019 It brings into play a lot of forms of intelligence.\u201d He paused, then asked, \u201cWill the car be able to play that game?\u201d", "And there are far more complex examples than the four-way stop, Wallach says, like situations in which three or four things are happening at once. Let\u2019s say the only way the car can avoid a collision with another car is by hitting a pedestrian. \u201cThat\u2019s an ethical decision of what you do there, and it will vary each time it happens,\u201d he says. Is the pedestrian a child? Is the alternative to swerve away from the child and into an S.U.V.? What if the S.U.V. has just one occupant? What if it has six? This kind of reasoning is what the philosopher Patrick Lin, director of the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at Cal Poly, calls \u201cmoral math.\u201d It evokes the classic Ethics 101 situation known as the trolley problem: deciding whether a conductor should flip a switch that will kill one person to avoid a crash in which five would otherwise die.", "Here\u2019s the difficulty, and it is something unique to a driverless car: If the decision-making algorithm were to always choose the option in which the fewest people die, the car might avoid another car carrying two passengers by running off the road and risking killing just one passenger: its own. Or it might choose to hit a Volvo instead of a Mini Cooper because its occupants are more likely to survive a crash, which means choosing the vehicle that is more dangerous for its owner to plow into. These assessments can be made with lightning speed. The car records data using lasers, radar and cameras mounted on its roof and windshield, and it makes rapid probabilistic predictions based on what the observed objects have been doing. But this is less an engineering question than a philosophical one, which the makers of such a car will have to resolve and, you would assume, bear some legal responsibility for.", "The military has developed lethal autonomous weapons systems like the cruise missile and is working on a ground robot to either shoot or hold its fire, based on its assessment of the situation within the international rules of war. It would be programmed, for example, to home in on a permissible target \u2014 a person who can be identified as an enemy combatant because he is wearing a uniform, say \u2014 or to determine that shooting is not permissible, because the target is in a school or a hospital, or has already been wounded.", "Ronald Arkin, a roboticist at Georgia Tech, has received grants from the military to study how to equip robots with a set of moral rules. \u201cMy main goal is to reduce the number of noncombatant casualties in warfare,\u201d he says. His lab developed what he calls an \u201cethical adapter\u201d that helps the robot emulate guilt. It\u2019s set in motion when the program detects a difference between how much destruction is expected when using a particular weapon and how much actually occurs. If the difference is too great, the robot\u2019s guilt level reaches a certain threshold, and it stops using the weapon. Arkin says robots sometimes won\u2019t be able to parse more complicated situations in which the right answer isn\u2019t a simple shoot/don\u2019t shoot decision. But on balance, he says, they will make fewer mistakes than humans, whose battlefield behavior is often clouded by panic, confusion or fear.", "A robot\u2019s lack of emotion is precisely what makes many people uncomfortable with the idea of trying to give it human characteristics. Death by robot is an undignified death, Peter Asaro, an affiliate scholar at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, said in a speech in May at a United Nations conference on conventional weapons in Geneva. A machine \u201cis not capable of considering the value of those human lives\u201d that it is about to end, he told the group. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re not capable of that and we allow them to kill people under the law, then we all lose dignity, in the way that if we permit slavery, it\u2019s not just the suffering of those who are slaves but all of humanity that suffers the indignity that there are any slaves at all.\u201d The U.N. will take up questions about the uses of autonomous weapons again in April.", "Asaro\u2019s eloquent objections speak to the fundamental problem of trying to mix automation with morality. Most people intuitively feel the two are at odds. There\u2019s a term for this discomfort: \u201cuncanny valley,\u201d the sense that when a robot starts to seem almost but not quite human, it is even more disturbing than if it were obviously a machine. But despite our discomfort, introducing more autonomous robots into our lives seems like a done deal. A prototype of the driverless Google Car was shown last month; autonomous robot-drones are in development; robots are already being used in some health care settings, like stroke rehabilitation. Which means that we have to face the reality that robots will inevitably be used in all kinds of situations requiring moral decision-making.", "The experts tend to be optimistic about robots\u2019 ethical prospects. Wallach talks of a \u201cmoral Turing test\u201d in which a robot\u2019s behavior will someday be indistinguishable from a human\u2019s. Scheutz goes even further, saying that one day robots will be even more morally consistent than humans. There\u2019s something peculiarly comforting in the idea that ethics can be calculated by an algorithm: It\u2019s easier than the panicked, imperfect bargains humans sometimes have to make. But maybe we should be worried about outsourcing morality to robots as easily as we\u2019ve outsourced so many other forms of human labor. Making hard questions easy should give us pause."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/magazine/the-jet-set-life-of-karl-lagerfelds-favorite-male-model-for-now.html": ["One Sunday last spring, Brad Kroenig and his 5-year-old son, Hudson, showed up at a private airport near Paris to meet Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion designer. \u201cKarl will be here 1, 1:30 for takeoff,\u201d announced a Frenchman in a black suit and tie. \u201cO.K., cool,\u201d Brad said. The man in the suit performed something like a bow and retreated. It was 12:45. Brad sank into an armchair by the window and surveyed the tarmac. He pointed out a large gray hawk of a plane that stood off to the side of the slighter, dovelike jets. \u201cIt\u2019s the same one that Oprah has,\u201d Brad said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest one. It flies, like, the longest journey. A lot of private planes have to stop for gas.\u201d", "Brad knows what kind of plane Lagerfeld travels on because he has flown on it often. As the most senior and prominent member of a group of male models often referred to as Karl\u2019s Boys, Brad not only works for Chanel and Fendi, the fashion houses where Lagerfeld is the head designer, but also accompanies him on yearly vacations to St. Tropez and work trips and to parties worldwide. He has been photographed with Lagerfeld so often that gossip blogs have mistakenly identified him as the designer\u2019s boyfriend, but their relationship is not romantic. Lagerfeld refers to Brad and the other models that travel with him as his family, albeit a self-selected, genetically ideal one. \u201cI hate ugly people,\u201d Lagerfeld told me. \u201cVery depressing.\u201d", "If models were show dogs, Brad would be a golden retriever. He has a strong jaw, hazel eyes and thick blond hair that seems perpetually windswept. The scruff on his face is shaped carefully, deliberately, to draw attention to his cheekbones. Unlike other beautiful people whose appeal lies in a distinctive facial quirk, Brad\u2019s features are perfectly proportioned, with no apparent flaws or peculiarities. When he models, he looks like a Roman statue. \u201cHis best bit is the curve of his thigh,\u201d Lagerfeld once said.", "At the airport, Hudson snapped photos on an iPhone while his father modeled for him. An hour went by. The man in the suit reappeared and said there would be \u201ca special cake\u201d for \u201cMr. Hudson\u201d on the plane. Brad asked if there might be special wine for him. \u201cMight as well, right?\u201d he said, and grinned.", "Around 2:30, Lagerfeld appeared at the top of the stairs leading to the airport lounge. He was dressed in the manner that has made him the most recognizable designer in the world: a white shirt with a high Edwardian collar, fingerless leather gloves, a strict black blazer and sunglasses. A diamond cat brooch was pinned to his tie, and his tight black pants were covered in a microprint of his own likeness, which ran up and down the leg and, from far away, looked like a thick pinstripe.", "\u201cHello!\u201d Lagerfeld said. He glanced at the field of small planes and frowned. \u201cAnd where is ours? Is it that one?\u201d Brad pointed to the larger jet parked just out of view. \u201cAh, the big one,\u201d Lagerfeld said. \u201cGood.\u201d", "Lagerfeld was expected that evening in Dubai, where he would show Chanel\u2019s 2015 resort collection in two days. Typically Brad would model in the show, but in Dubai, only Hudson, who is Lagerfeld\u2019s godson, would walk the runway. (He has been appearing in Chanel shows since he was 2.) Lagerfeld was accompanied on the trip, as he is most places, by his 39-year-old bodyguard, S\u00e9bastien Jondeau, a part-time boxer with a sinewy build and an intense stare. (A few days later, he nearly body-checked Brad when he held a cup of coffee a little too close to Lagerfeld\u2019s white blazer).", "Lagerfeld led the way to the plane. Inside, a wineglass of Diet Coke awaited him at his seat. At the back of the aircraft was a single bed made up with crisp white linens.", "\u201cBut where am I going to sleep?\u201d Hudson asked.", "\u201cYou sleep on your seat, darling,\u201d Lagerfeld replied in his heavy German accent. \u201cI have to arrive fresh, you don\u2019t have to. Don\u2019t be selfish.\u201d", "Lagerfeld rummaged in one of his many shopping bags and fished out a matching light blue Givenchy tank top and shirt with their tags still attached. \u201cFor Dubai,\u201d he said, handing them to Brad. For the plane ride, Brad wore jeans and a blazer by Dior and white Nike high-top sneakers. A rose-gold Rolex glimmered on one wrist, and on the other he wore a diamond bracelet by Chrome Hearts, Lagerfeld\u2019s favorite jewelry brand. \u201cKarl is really generous,\u201d Brad told me. \u201cHe likes his friends to look chic.\u201d", "After lunch \u2014 caviar and salmon tartare for Lagerfeld; caviar, foie gras and scallops for Brad; couscous and vegetables for Hudson \u2014 Lagerfeld fell asleep not in his bed, but upright in his seat, Dracula-like. He was still wearing his sunglasses, and the stiff collar of his shirt seemed to dig in uncomfortably at his neck. Brad took out a notebook and jotted down the trip\u2019s mileage. He keeps a log of the cumulative distance he has traveled as a model, currently at 2.4 million miles. Back in St. Louis, where Brad is from, his mother, Barb, keeps track by pinning red flags on a large world map in her basement. The plane climbed into the sky and reached a quiet lull. \u201cSee, I told you,\u201d Brad said. \u201cUp here, there\u2019s almost no turbulence.\u201d", "Brad likes to say that male modeling is to the women\u2019s business as the W.N.B.A. is to the N.B.A. While Gisele B\u00fcndchen\u2019s yearly income is estimated at around $47 million, men of Brad\u2019s standing earn $200,000 to $500,000. A male model, however, can gain an advantage, and ensure career longevity, by forging relationships with influential designers and photographers.", "Most of today\u2019s top men have longstanding associations with certain labels. But in a way, Brad is unlike other models, because Lagerfeld isn\u2019t like other designers. Lagerfeld has been at Chanel\u2019s helm since 1983 and still designs 17 collections a year for Chanel, Fendi and his namesake line, an unprecedented feat of creative stamina. He is also a photographer who shoots campaigns for his labels as well as for other brands, like Audi. Brad has become the beneficiary of Lagerfeld\u2019s productivity, appearing on his runways and in his ads. That Brad continues to work well into his 30s is due in no small part to having Lagerfeld as his champion. \u201cIf I never met Karl, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d still be modeling,\u201d he said.", "Brad was raised in Oakville, Mo., a middle-class suburb south of St. Louis. His father, Mark, is an environmental engineer; his mother works as a part-time legal assistant. The middle of three children, Brad grew up playing sports and attended Florida International University on a soccer scholarship. He planned to go pro, or at least semipro, but during his junior year he became bored with school. He wanted to major in hotel management, but classes were at another campus 20 minutes away. A girl he knew on the volleyball team made money modeling, and she suggested Brad try it. After the first few agencies said no, an agent at Next took him on, but warned, \u201cWhatever you do, do not quit school.\u201d Brad dropped out that same afternoon.", "Brad borrowed money from his parents and began studying fashion magazines. \u201cThat\u2019s when I learned about Karl,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, Wow, this guy is, like, walking around in sunglasses and all these ridiculous outfits. This guy is living big.\u201d", "Soon, Brad caught the attention of Bruce Weber, who cast him in one of his notoriously racy Abercrombie & Fitch campaigns. \u201cI was on the bag, which is kind of a big deal,\u201d Brad said, meaning the store\u2019s shopping bag. He was also in its catalog. \u201cI was fully nude, like a butt shot.\u201d", "In 2001, Brad moved to New York and showed up at the Ford agency, where the founder, Eileen Ford, saw him from across the room and said, \u201cOh, my gosh, he looks like Errol Flynn,\u201d according to Sam Doerfler, who became Brad\u2019s agent. He walked out with a three-year contract. Doerfler said he thought that Brad had the kind of clean-cut athleticism that would appeal to more commercial clients (brands like Target or Macy\u2019s), but Brad wanted to do high fashion; he wanted to work with Lagerfeld. \u201cMy thing was, how do you take a commercial-looking guy and make him look edgy,\u201d Doerfler told me. To give Brad a more distinct look that might attract European designers, Doerfler had Brad spend a year growing his hair long and transforming his muscular physique into a more lanky one.", "By 2003, Brad debuted on the Jil Sander and Dolce & Gabbana runways in Milan and quickly landed the covers of L\u2019Uomo Vogue and Interview, a coup for a male model. That same year, VMAN flew Brad, 23, along with two other male models to Biarritz for a shoot for which Lagerfeld would be the photographer. The designer owned a hillside estate there at the time, and he suggested they shoot in the outdoor shower. The resulting image shows Brad fully nude, his right hand covered in tangles of Chrome Hearts chunky jewelry and grabbing his genitals. \u201cHe probably took one picture of each of the other guys and, like, 20 of me,\u201d Brad said.", "After Biarritz, Lagerfeld photographed Brad constantly, almost as if he were studying an exotic new species: Brad walking, sleeping, eating, shaving, swimming and working out; Brad nude or seminude in showers and bathtubs, on beds and on balconies. He dressed him up like his own Ken doll, shooting him as the Greek god Zeus, James Dean and Jay Gatsby. Lagerfeld compiled the photos in \u201cMetamorphoses of an American,\u201d a four-volume book devoted entirely to Brad. In the introduction, he wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the clarity of the transmitted individuality of a face and a body unencumbered by too much experience.\u201d", "Brad soon became known as Lagerfeld\u2019s \u201cmuse.\u201d Amanda Harlech, a socialite who has been a muse of Lagerfeld\u2019s for almost 20 years, said, \u201cAt a very simple level, it\u2019s something that the eye is pleased to look at.\u201d Brad has always been comfortable in the role. \u201cThe photographer has to be into the subject he\u2019s shooting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you\u2019re a basketball coach, you have to be into LeBron James and think he\u2019s great, or you wouldn\u2019t put him in the game.\u201d He added: \u201cThe models that are uncomfortable just don\u2019t make it. Why not get naked in the shower and have million-dollar jewelry on me?\u201d", "Brad began to appear in Fendi and Chanel ads almost every season. In the past decade, he has been shot by Mario Testino, Patrick Demarchelier, Craig McDean and, months before his death, Richard Avedon. In 2004 Brad was named the top male model by Models.com, a site that releases rankings for the industry, and held the title for three years. Recently, Vogue listed him among the \u201cTop 10 Male Models of All Time.\u201d", "Since Brad\u2019s arrival, Lagerfeld\u2019s entourage has grown to include the British model Jake Davies, 34, and Baptiste Giabiconi, a 25-year-old from the south of France with a striking resemblance to a younger Lagerfeld. Together, they\u2019ve become a part of the designer\u2019s provocative image, trailing him as he exits cars and boats and planes. When I asked Lagerfeld about his \u201cboys,\u201d he said: \u201cI don\u2019t give labels for it. Labels is something I design for, they\u2019re not what I give to persons.\u201d Then he relented. \u201cI see them like family,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no family at all, so it\u2019s good to have, like, sons but without the unpleasant problems sons can create.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a choice, it\u2019s not an obligation. There\u2019s a big difference. I have a sister in America who I haven\u2019t seen for 40 years. Her children never even send me a Christmas card.\u201d", "\u201cEverybody survived?\u201d Lagerfeld asked as the plane touched down in Dubai around midnight. When the group arrived at the One and Only Royal Mirage Palace, a hotel along the marina, a kind of welcoming committee was gathered outside, including Chanel employees, the hotel\u2019s staff and Lagerfeld\u2019s butler, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, who stood in a white coat and tie holding a tray with a chilled glass of Diet Coke. (Once, Brad and Lagerfeld traveled to the Great Wall of China and found Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, who always arrives at destinations ahead of his employer, waiting at the top of the stairs.) An assistant handed Brad his room key, and by the time he turned around, the swarm of people that had consumed Lagerfeld had moved across the lobby and disappeared inside the hotel.", "The next day, Brad and Hudson spent the morning by the pool and met Lagerfeld for lunch. Brad wore the shirts that Lagerfeld gave him on the plane, one on top of the other, a look that Lagerfeld declared \u201cvery cute.\u201d As the designer took the head of the table, Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel\u2019s president of fashion, sat on his right; his other associates moved down so that Brad and Hudson could sit on his left.", "While everyone prattled on in French, Brad, who doesn\u2019t speak the language, chimed in enthusiastically about the food (\u201cThis chicken is unbelievable\u201d) or the pool (\u201cIt\u2019s perfect\u201d). Among Lagerfeld\u2019s colleagues, Brad\u2019s Midwestern earnestness seemed almost out of place. (Brad once told me, without a hint of sarcasm: \u201cI always say, in the fashion world, everyone is so great. It\u2019s like one big family, you know? Everyone is just so nice to each other.\u201d)", "Lagerfeld had been toting around a small Polaroid printer and gave an identical one to Hudson. During the lunch, he occasionally shifted away from Pavlovsky to exchange Polaroids with Hudson. Lagerfeld printed a photo of his pet siamese cat, Choupette. Hudson printed a selfie.", "\u201cI hate selfies,\u201d Lagerfeld said. \u201cDon\u2019t use your film for ugly purpose.\u201d", "For Lagerfeld, Brad and Hudson\u2019s presence seemed to provide a kind of relief. When he and Brad spoke, their conversation consisted of uncomplicated small talk:", "Brad: \u201cThe hotel is beautiful, huh?\u201d", "Lagerfeld: \u201cYes, it\u2019s flawlessly kept.\u201d", "Brad: \u201cIt\u2019s hot out, but not too humid.\u201d", "Lagerfeld: \u201cYes, but it\u2019s hot.\u201d", "Lagerfeld told me: \u201cBrad has a lot of energy, and he is fun. He gives good vibes.\u201d He later added: \u201cIn a way Brad, he\u2019s, how could I say? He has the manner of a boy or a child.\u201d", "When Brad is not traveling with Lagerfeld, he can be found in Wyckoff, N.J., a wealthy enclave in Bergen County, which is perhaps best known as the home of \u201cThe Real Housewives of New Jersey.\u201d A week before he left for Dubai, I visited Brad at his house, which sits along a quiet, leafy cul-de-sac. Brad and Nicole Kroenig were in the kitchen with the couple\u2019s younger son, Jameson. A pretty brunette, Nicole, 32, is the daughter of the famous tennis coach Nick Bollettieri. (Hudson\u2019s middle name is Nicholas; Jameson\u2019s is Karl.)", "The couple\u2019s home is so neat and sparsely decorated that it could pass for a model home used to attract prospective buyers. And yet there are conspicuous signs of Lagerfeld\u2019s looming presence in the family\u2019s life. In the living room hangs a framed contact sheet of father and son, shot by Lagerfeld and signed, \u201cIt\u2019s a funny page, love Karl.\u201d In the basement, a storage room contains racks of clothing that Brad has acquired over the years, including a series of navy and white suits he described as \u201cmy St. Tropez looks.\u201d A fax machine sits in the corner \u2014 until a few years ago, Lagerfeld communicated with friends only by fax \u2014 and on the shelves nearby, several Goyard trunks are filled with years\u2019 worth of Brad\u2019s correspondence with Lagerfeld. (Brad also had his parents install a fax machine at their home in Oakville in case he needed to be accessible while visiting.) Now that Lagerfeld has embraced the iPhone, he and Brad speak on Sundays and exchange texts. \u201cWe\u2019ll text him photos of the kids, he\u2019ll text us photos of Choupette,\u201d Nicole told me. Upstairs in Hudson\u2019s bedroom, Japanese Karl Lagerfeld figurines are displayed alongside action figures. When I asked if Hudson understands who Karl is, Nicole said, \u201cHe knows that Karl is a special person.\u201d Brad clarified, adding, \u201cHe knows that you can Google him and that you can\u2019t just Google anybody.\u201d", "When Brad is home, he leads the life of a stay-at-home dad. He shuttles the boys to school, hosts barbecues and cleans the pool incessantly. Every morning, he performs a grueling workout routine \u2014 sprints or seven-mile runs, push-ups, squats, lunges and crunches \u2014 designed to keep him thin, but not too bulky, so that he can continue to fit into designers\u2019 unforgiving sample sizes. \u201cYou\u2019re 35, but you got to make your body look like you\u2019re 19,\u201d Brad said, quoting his agent. He generally avoids activities that could damage his appearance. When he runs at the nearby high-school track, he keeps his distance from the lacrosse team, anxious that they might hurl balls in the direction of his face. He played in the town\u2019s softball league, but quit after he hurt his leg, deciding it wasn\u2019t worth the risk. (Some of the other fathers on the team nicknamed him Zoolander.)", "Several times a day I caught Brad fussing with his hair, which turned out to be a head massage that Nicole explained stimulates hair growth. Nicole approaches her role as Brad\u2019s partner with the diligence of an athlete\u2019s wife, helping to manage Brad\u2019s low-carb, high-protein diet and replenishing his various supplements, like Viviscal and Biotin (which also promote hair growth). \u201cI get so frustrated because people always see the glamorous side,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they have no idea what he has to do to stay at this level.\u201d", "In the afternoons, Brad oversees his son\u2019s after-school activities. For a while, he helped coach Hudson\u2019s Little League team, but later decided that was too hazardous, too. On Lagerfeld\u2019s suggestion, Hudson has been taking French, and Brad hoped he would try out what he learned on Lagerfeld. \u201cThat was the whole point of why we did it,\u201d he said.", "\u201cWell, and because he\u2019s interested in it,\u201d Nicole added.", "Brad and Nicole took Hudson to a sports class, where coaches ran 5-year-olds around an indoor gym. Nearby, other mothers sat juggling Starbucks coffees, diaper bags and Louis Vuitton and Chanel handbags. As we walked in, a woman in a pink hoodie and leggings scanned Brad from head to toe. \u201cObviously, being in this town, you notice women pay attention,\u201d Nicole said later.", "Occasionally women will approach Nicole on the playground and tell her that they Googled Brad. Then their voices trail off, and she knows that they came across a nude photo. \u201cI can\u2019t Google these women\u2019s husbands and see them on the beach or something,\u201d she said. \u201cOne question I always get asked, and it tends to be by women, is \u2018Doesn\u2019t it make you nervous, you know, him, like, modeling with all these beautiful girls?\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018No. If it did, we wouldn\u2019t be together.'\u2009\u201d", "Brad joined a gaggle of women and began comparing workout routines with a muscular blonde in skinny jeans and a striped tank top.", "\u201cHow many pull-ups can you do?\u201d he asked.", "\u201cIn a row?\u201d the blonde said. \u201cTwenty-five.\u201d", "\u201cI can only do like 10,\u201d Brad said. \u201cCan you do a handstand?\u201d", "\u201cOf course,\u201d she said.", "As talk turned to summer vacations, Brad said they would be spending part of August in St. Tropez. \u201cFor a show?\u201d one of the moms asked. Brad hesitated before saying, \u201cNah, just to hang out with a friend.\u201d", "The fitting for the Dubai collection took place in two large rooms off the hotel lobby. When Brad and Hudson arrived in the early evening, Hudson was cooed over by models waiting to be dressed and the Chanel assistants who worked to dress them. \u201cWhen did you get so tall?\u201d asked the American model Jamie Bochert. \u201cYou look just like your dad!\u201d Hudson told her to smell his shoe.", "Lagerfeld presided at a table at the far end of the room. When Hudson was sent out in a long white tunic and pointed Aladdin-like shoes, Lagerfeld leapt out of his seat.", "\u201cAh, our little prince!\u201d Lagerfeld said. \u201cBut I think he needs much more diamonds.\u201d The designer arranged layers of jewels around his neck, then took a step back to evaluate.", "Brad, who was observing from the sidelines, beamed. Hudson tugged at the necklaces.", "\u201cThis is heavy,\u201d he said.", "\u201cYou look so chic, though,\u201d Brad said.", "Hudson was born in 2008, the same year that Baptiste entered Lagerfeld\u2019s circle and, for a moment, seemed to displace Brad in it. Lagerfeld made Baptiste the new star of his Fendi and Chanel campaigns and the subject of his latest photography book, \u201cThe Beauty of Violence,\u201d which showed the model, then 19, in an array of erotic poses. Lagerfeld once had a plaster mold made of Brad; he had Baptiste carved out of Belgian chocolate. By 2009, New York magazine\u2019s style blog, The Cut, announced, \u201cBrad\u2019s Out, Baptiste Is In!\u201d", "Lagerfeld has long been known for his fleeting attention span. In \u201cThe Beautiful Fall,\u201d a piquant account of the 1970s Paris fashion scene, the British journalist Alicia Drake narrates countless episodes of Lagerfeld\u2019s former friends being ejected from his world. \u201cThe members of his shifting entourage were there to provide information, energy, laughter, ideas and, significantly, youth,\u201d Drake writes. \u201cAnd they were replaced when they no longer fulfilled these criteria.\u201d", "In 2009, Lagerfeld became Hudson\u2019s godfather and, soon, father and son appeared on the Chanel Spring 2011 runway, walking hand in hand in matching tweed blazers. \u201cI had zero jealousy when Baptiste came along,\u201d Brad told me. \u201cBaptiste was probably, like, 20 at the time, and I was, like, 30, so I guess Karl was more inspired by Baptiste, which is fine. But look, me and Karl were getting even closer then with everything going on with Hudson. The whole thing with him becoming his godfather just happened naturally. It wasn\u2019t some setup thing, like \u2018Let\u2019s have Karl be the godfather.'\u2009\u201d", "Lagerfeld has become enamored with Hudson, giving him gifts (books, clothes, pint-size Fendi purses) and shooting him almost as much as he does his adult muses. \u201cKarl is fascinated by being so close to a young mind,\u201d Harlech told me. \u201cIt\u2019s very new for Karl.\u201d", "Brad has walked in every resort show for the past 10 years. This time he came as Hudson\u2019s chaperone. Lagerfeld told me: \u201cI work with him but a little less, because I\u2019ve worked so much with him before. You cannot photograph the same person for 200 years.\u201d", "As models age, they often develop lucrative careers working for more commercial clients. Brad still gets booked for editorial jobs, but in recent years he has also appeared in ads for Macy\u2019s, Lands\u2019 End and Nordstrom. (\u201cI\u2019ve noticed a couple more dad scenes,\u201d he told me.) Brad will be able to work for years to come, but Sam Doerfler, Brad\u2019s agent, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a point it\u2019s over. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re fired, but it\u2019s just that no one wants to shoot you anymore. That point, it happens to everybody.\u201d", "At 35, Brad remains vigorously handsome. But an inevitable masculine sturdiness has set in, which becomes apparent when he wears his Dior skinny jeans designed for the teenage boys who stalk the runway. Brad\u2019s determination to compete with them can sometimes feel as demoralizing as that of a housewife trying to maintain the attention of a husband who has a perpetual wandering eye. At a restaurant in Wyckoff, he wistfully scanned the carb-piled plates of the other diners \u2014 \u201cOh, wow, is that pizza?\u201d \u2014 and then ordered chicken-noodle soup with no noodles. When he runs in the morning, he told me that he likes to think of Sean O\u2019Pry, the pouty-lipped 25-year-old American currently ranked among the world\u2019s top models.", "I asked Brad if he worried that as he grew older, Lagerfeld would no longer be interested in keeping him around. \u201cI should look fine for at least another .\u2009.\u2009. ,\u201d his voice trailed off. \u201cA long time, hopefully. Even if my hair falls out, I\u2019ll just shave it. But he always says he remembers me the way I was when he first met me, as this 23-year-old guy who\u2019s good-looking and full of life.\u201d When I posed the same question to Lagerfeld, the designer instead alluded to the inevitability of his own decline: \u201cI would think if he is much older, I may not see that?\u201d", "The day of the show was hot and arid, with an unrelenting desert sun blazing in a cloudless sky. Brad was in his hotel room worried because Hudson hadn\u2019t napped.", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to put on shoes,\u201d Hudson said.", "Brad helped him into his sneakers. Once Hudson was ready, Brad put on a new Dior suit, but the pants were too long, so he hemmed them with Scotch tape. He wore his Rolex and added a gold Chrome Hearts medallion around his neck, which he displayed with the shirt open, Scarface-style. \u201cIf I button up, it just looks too business,\u201d he said. When Brad and Hudson went to get Lagerfeld from his room, the designer took in Brad\u2019s outfit and nodded approvingly. \u201cIt\u2019s chic, huh?\u201d Brad said.", "\u201cYes, perfect for Dubai,\u201d Lagerfeld said.", "The show was set to begin at dusk on a man-made island owned by the country\u2019s dynastic prince, Sheikh Hamdan. The other guests would be transported to the site on rickety wooden boats, but Lagerfeld and his entourage would arrive in an immaculate white speedboat. As we approached the island, an imposing gold-and-glass structure came into view, its walls a grid of interlocked double Cs, representing Chanel\u2019s logo. The company had spent two months and $2.5 million erecting the structure on what was previously an empty strip of sand. After the show, it would evaporate as quickly as it went up.", "Lagerfeld stepped off the boat and walked slowly but deliberately, with one gloved hand resting on Hudson\u2019s blond head. Brad and Jondeau followed directly behind, while photographers circled them like a cloud of gnats.", "The show lasted about 20 minutes. Brad watched backstage with Lagerfeld, while out front Dakota Fanning, Tilda Swinton and assorted Arabian royalty arranged themselves along sunken banquettes. Lagerfeld\u2019s collection was a modern take on Orientalism: harem pants, gold lam\u00e9 and intricate embroidery. Hudson led the grand finale. He walked so quickly that the models that trailed him struggled to catch up. Carine Roitfeld, the French fashion editor, inquired about the cost of the jewels around Hudson\u2019s neck and, after investigating, returned with the answer: \u201c$1.5 million.\u201d", "Trouble began at the after-party. Brad had just ordered a couple of pink margaritas when a flustered Chanel assistant named Orly rushed over, speaking rapidly into her headset, and hustled Brad and Hudson backstage. Dubai\u2019s laws forbid children to be around alcohol, and someone had alerted the authorities, or \u201cinspectors,\u201d as Orly put it. Despite the commotion, Brad was in good spirits, and the additional margaritas Orly procured began to take effect. \u201cHey, where\u2019s your drink?\u201d he asked a couple of Russian models who glided by. \u201cOh, what? You\u2019re leaving? Where are you going?\u201d After it became clear that he wouldn\u2019t be able to rejoin the party, he and Hudson were smuggled out via a dark stretch of sand at the rear of the site, the night skyline of Dubai in the distance behind them.", "At the docks, Brad boarded a boat with twin Palestinian socialites, who recognized Hudson from the show. \u201cOh, my God, we\u2019re so lucky to be sitting next to you!\u201d one said.", "\u201cI\u2019m Brad, Hudson\u2019s father.\u201d", "The twins said they were born in Saudi Arabia but now lived in Los Angeles. \u201cSo, are you guys identical twins?\u201d Brad asked.", "\u201cYeah.\u201d", "\u201cEverywhere?\u201d", "Their expressions soured. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d", "Brad smiled.", "At the marina, Brad and Hudson got into Lagerfeld\u2019s chauffeured Mercedes van. As Hudson began playing video games, Brad sank back into the seat. \u201cSo that\u2019s my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIn New Jersey, taking kids to practice and talking to these moms trying to flirt with me to, like, this extreme life and some twins. I\u2019m not saying this is my normal life, but it kind of is now. It\u2019s like living in a dream, and then in two days, I\u2019ll wake up in New Jersey, in my bed, like it never happened.\u201d", "He let the thought linger. \u201cThere\u2019s no other male model in the history of the world doing these kinds of things,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not bragging or anything, it just is what it is.\u201d", "The car pulled up to the One and Only Royal Palace, and Brad proceeded to the lobby bar, which was empty except for a few hotel guests. The makeshift hem of his pants had come undone, and he bent down to tuck it back under. He sat down at a low table and ordered a vodka soda. \u201cI always said, \u2018If it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over,'\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cIf modeling is over, it\u2019s still the best experience of my life.

This is partly a function of Mr. Carlson\u2019s informal tone and personality-driven approach. But it\u2019s also a function of the subject. Yahoo is a big company, but it\u2019s not what you would call an American institution, or even really a relevant force in our culture. And it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s much more of substance to say about Ms. Mayer that hasn\u2019t already been said in the many profiles of her.", "That\u2019s not to say that the book isn\u2019t a lot of fun to read, or that Mr. Carlson isn\u2019t steeped in his subject \u2014 an impressive feat considering that Ms. Mayer not only refused to cooperate with him, but actively interfered with his research and reporting. During her first day on the job at Yahoo, he writes in one of the news bites touted in the book\u2019s news release, Ms. Mayer apparently mistook the company\u2019s general counsel for the I.T. guy.", "Mr. Carlson, the chief correspondent for Business Insider, a website that covers technology and finance, doesn\u2019t waste words lingering over details or musing on bigger themes \u2014 leadership, technology, the nature of innovation. He favors the short paragraph and the brief biographical sketch. \u201cShe was a pompom girl and a debater,\u201d he writes in his pr\u00e9cis of Ms. Mayer\u2019s childhood. \u201cShe was on the precision dance team.\u201d The result, to borrow the digital media clich\u00e9, is corporate history as snackable content.", "Today\u2019s Yahoo is a sprawling hodgepodge of products and services, none indispensable. It is a company adrift, a well-capitalized mess. But as Mr. Carlson reminds us, Yahoo was a pioneer of the Valley. In its earliest incarnation, Yahoo was the digital equivalent of TV Guide, providing an advertising-supported directory of web pages for the still nascent Internet. Before it became known as Yahoo, it was called David and Jerry\u2019s Guide to the World Wide Web, after the company\u2019s founders, David Filo and Jerry Yang.", "They had no trouble monetizing their new business. Yahoo nearly tripled its revenues from 1997 to 1998. Its founders became very rich, very quickly. \u201cIt takes a female elephant 22 months to gestate a calf,\u201d Mr. Carlson writes. \u201cFilo and Yang made their first $100 million in less than half that time.\u201d", "For a little while, anyway, the Yahoo logo was everywhere \u2014 on Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream containers, on Visa cards, on the Zamboni machines at professional hockey games. Then things started to fall apart. Yahoo was the victim of larger economic forces, specifically the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2001. But it also failed to evolve or innovate. As such, it gradually lost market share to its growing number of competitors. And it became deeply uncool, the Reebok to Google\u2019s Nike.", "Enter Yahoo 2.0, the first of many attempts to turn around the company. The names, at least, would get more creative. There was, for example, Project Godfather, the 2002 plan to rub out Yahoo\u2019s competition in the Internet search business. Several years later the company resolved to stop spreading itself so thin, like peanut butter. The Wall Street Journal labeled this Yahoo\u2019s Peanut Butter Manifesto.", "In Mr. Carlson\u2019s breezy retelling, these hapless efforts to recapture the company\u2019s former glory amount to almost comic exercises in futility. Yahoo is Silicon Valley\u2019s version of the New York Knicks. Its string of well-compensated leaders can\u2019t seem to get anything right. Presented with the chance to buy Google for $1 million in 1997, the company passed. Years later, it could have had Facebook, which is now valued at more than $200 billion, for $1 billion. Yahoo drew the line at $850 million.", "Ms. Mayer emerges from this book\u2019s pages less as a Geek Goddess, or even a computer science nerd made good, than as a kind of cyborg, a tone-deaf workaholic who has trouble making eye contact and requires only four hours of sleep a night. In other words, it turns out she\u2019s no different from your stereotypical male tech executive. Mr. Carlson describes her management style as \u201cdictatorial\u201d and her manner of speaking as \u201cstaccato verbosity.\u201d At one point, he goes so far as to suggest that she may have Asperger\u2019s syndrome. Mr. Carlson issues a similarly harsh judgment on Ms. Mayer\u2019s tenure at Yahoo. Among many other things, he faults her for trying to take the company\u2019s \u201cmiddle-America, Walmart-esque brand\u201d upmarket by hiring Katie Couric as its Global Anchor for $5 million a year. As Mr. Carlson recounts it, the decision was prompted by a breakfast with the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who described Yahoo\u2019s women\u2019s site as \u201cdreadful.\u201d", "Wall Street seems to agree with Mr. Carlson\u2019s assessment. Yahoo has a market capitalization of about $44 billion. But when you take out its large investment in the Chinese Internet company Alibaba, Yahoo\u2019s core business is currently being valued at less than zero dollars.", "Ms. Mayer is still running Yahoo, though it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how much longer she will remain. The company\u2019s last chief executive was deposed by the head of a powerful hedge fund with a large position in Yahoo. In the book\u2019s final pages, Mr. Carlson writes about a similar campaign introduced recently by a major stockholder who criticized Ms. Mayer for failing to cut costs and for spending too much on acquisitions that haven\u2019t added to revenues.

Pack a bag to the gills and it\u2019s unwieldy, incapable of accommodating gifts, and bothersome to repack. More significantly, it guarantees that your attention will be on schlepping rather than on soaking up new surroundings. I travel with a sleek Bric\u2019s X-Bag 22-inch folding duffel ($120): It weighs little more than a pillowcase, fits into tight spaces and enables me to move effortlessly through crowds. You can line the bottom with shoes as travelers typically do, but I stack them on one side so it\u2019s easy to find a pair to change into once my plane lands. I fold or roll clothes army-style into stacks adjacent to the shoes; no elaborate techniques like bundle wrapping (layering clothes as if making a sushi roll). Lingerie is in a zippered bag and tucked between the piles. Skirts and dresses are slipped into plastic dry-cleaning bags to prevent wrinkles (works wonders), folded over once, and laid across the stacks. An empty tote bag is placed on top so that when I arrive at my hotel \u2014 where inevitably my room will not be ready and my trusty duffel must be stowed \u2014 I can grab the tote, toss in a few necessities and hit the streets for a full day of sightseeing.", "\u00adOne of the simplest yet most effective strategies is to visit Google Flight Search, a free online tool that allows you to compare fares across multiple airlines and see how much you\u2019ll save if, say, you depart a day earlier or later. \u201cThe absolute best way to find a low airfare now is Google Flights,\u201d George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, which allows users to track and compare ticket prices, told me in November. An important exception is Southwest Airlines. (The carrier has its own low-fare planning calendar). For international flights and unusual combinations of flights, try Momondo.com. In general, you can also save money by flying on holidays, early in the morning, in and out of places where there\u2019s airline competition and by opting for a smaller airport in a metro area. Sites such as Airfarewatchdog allow you to set alerts for low prices on routes you frequently fly. And tools including Yapta.com and TripIt Pro will notify you if the ticket price drops enough to save you, say, $100 after paying a change fee. (Yes, this really works.) Packages that include hotels and flights from online agents (Expedia.com, Priceline.com, Cheapfares.com) may also result in lower fares.

It\u2019s common for agencies \u2014 including Hertz, Avis, Thrifty and Budget \u2014 to impose additional restrictions and/or fees for renters between 21 and 24. Typically there is an \u201cunderage\u201d surcharge, which can be anywhere from about $17 to $66 a day in addition to the rental fee.

Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. 43 million workers have no paid sick leave. 43 million. Think about that.", "And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.

We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they\u2019ve earned -- (applause) -- and everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it.

(Applause.)", "But -- but you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That\u2019s a fact. And that\u2019s what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.", "Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills. (Applause.)", "Now America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of G.I.s to college, trained the best work force in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more.", "By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It\u2019s not fair to them, and it\u2019s sure not smart for our future. That\u2019s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. (Applause.)", "Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.", "Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you\u2019ve got to earn it. You\u2019ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.", "Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. (Applause.) Let\u2019s stay ahead of the curve.", "And -- and I want to work with this Congress to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn\u2019t derail anyone\u2019s dreams. (Applause.)", "Thanks to Vice President Biden\u2019s great work to update our job training system, we\u2019re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics.", "Tonight, I\u2019m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs, even if they don\u2019t have a higher education.", "And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.", "Already, we\u2019ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care, we\u2019re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we\u2019re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.", "And joining forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- (applause) -- thank you, Michelle, thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job. (Applause.)", "So to every C.E.O. in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who\u2019s going to get the job done, and done right, hire a veteran. (Applause.)", "Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. (Applause.)", "Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn\u2019t even exist 10 or 20 years ago: jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.", "So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. (Applause.)

So let\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline; let\u2019s pass a bipartisan -- (applause) -- infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come.", "Let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s get it done. (Applause.) Let\u2019s get it done.", "Twenty-first-century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.", "But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world\u2019s fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.", "Why would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe -- (applause) -- that aren\u2019t just free but are also fair. It\u2019s the right thing to do.", "Look, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m the first one to admit -- I\u2019m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\u2019t always lived up to the hype, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone after countries \u2014 (applause) -- that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world\u2019s customers live outside our borders. We can\u2019t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they\u2019re actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So let\u2019s give them one more reason to get it done.", "Twenty-first-century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine: one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. (Applause.)", "In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I\u2019m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. We can do this. (Applause.)", "I intend to protect a free and open Internet, to extend its reach to every classroom, and every community -- (applause) -- and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.", "I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again. (Applause.)", "Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a yearlong stay in space. So good luck, Captain. (Applause.) Make sure to Instagram it. We\u2019re proud of you.", "Now, the truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there\u2019s bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so.", "Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don\u2019t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does too.", "But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They\u2019ve riddled it with giveaways that the super rich don\u2019t need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.", "This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let\u2019s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. (Applause.) Let\u2019s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let\u2019s simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford. (Applause.)", "And let\u2019s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for child care and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. (Applause.) We can achieve it together.", "Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it\u2019s where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead.", "Of course, if there\u2019s one thing this new century has taught us, it\u2019s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.", "My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not -- in doing so the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.", "When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That\u2019s what our enemies want us to do.", "I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don\u2019t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.", "That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference.", "First, we stand united with people around the world who\u2019ve been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.", "We will continue \u2014 (applause) -- to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. (Applause.)", "At the same time, we\u2019ve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years. Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we\u2019ve trained their security forces, who\u2019ve now taken the lead, and we\u2019ve honored our troops\u2019 sacrifice by supporting that country\u2019s first democratic transition.", "Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we\u2019re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.", "In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIL\u2019s advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. (Applause.)", "We\u2019re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.", "Now, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. (Applause.) We need that authority.", "Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We\u2019re upholding the principle that bigger nations can\u2019t bully the small by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. (Applause.)", "Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline states, Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. That\u2019s what I heard from some folks. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters. That\u2019s how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve. (Applause.)", "In Cuba, we are ending a policy \u2014 (applause) -- that was long past its expiration date. When what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work for 50 years, it\u2019s time to try something new. (Applause.) And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere and removes the phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo. (Applause.)", "As -- as His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of small steps. These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs. (Applause.) Welcome home, Alan. We\u2019re glad you\u2019re here.", "Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we\u2019ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.", "Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.", "There\u2019re no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails, alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn\u2019t make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. (Applause.) The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.", "Third, we\u2019re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.", "No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. (Applause.)", "But we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children\u2019s information. That should be a bipartisan effort. (Applause.)", "You know, if we don\u2019t act, we\u2019ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.", "In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. (Applause.) I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.", "But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty.", "In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And no challenge, no challenge, poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. (Applause.) 2014 was the planet\u2019s warmest year on record.", "Now, one year doesn\u2019t make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.", "I\u2019ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they\u2019re not scientists, that we don\u2019t have enough information to act. Well, I\u2019m not a scientist either. But you know what? I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities, and the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don\u2019t act forcefully, we\u2019ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. (Applause.)", "That\u2019s why, over the past six years, we\u2019ve done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that\u2019s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action. (Applause.)", "In Beijing, we made a historic announcement: the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world\u2019s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we\u2019ve got.", "And There\u2019s one last pillar of our leadership, and that\u2019s the example of our values.", "As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we\u2019re threatened, which is why I\u2019ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. (Applause.) It\u2019s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. (Applause.)", "It\u2019s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That\u2019s why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do -- (applause) -- but because ultimately, they make us safer.", "As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. (Applause.)", "Since I\u2019ve been president, we\u2019ve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are. (Applause.) It\u2019s time to close Gitmo.", "As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.", "And next month, we\u2019ll issue a report on how we\u2019re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.", "Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading always with the example of our values. That\u2019s what makes us exceptional. That\u2019s what keeps us strong. And that\u2019s why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own.", "You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn\u2019t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America, but a United States of America.", "I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world\u2019s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.", "Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn\u2019t delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It\u2019s held up as proof not just of my own flaws, of which there are many, but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, na\u00efve, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.", "I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together \u2014 (applause) -- we can do great things, even when the odds are long.", "I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best. I\u2019ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I\u2019ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, and West Texas, and West Virginia. I\u2019ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.", "I\u2019ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal \u2014 (applause) -- in states that seven in ten Americans call home.", "So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother\u2019s keeper, and our sister\u2019s keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.", "So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America\u2019s hopes. I\u2019ve served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.", "And many of you have told me that this isn\u2019t what you signed up for -- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fund-raising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.", "Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different.", "Understand, a better politics isn\u2019t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine; a better politics is one where we appeal to each other\u2019s basic decency instead of our basest fears.", "A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts, rather than \u201cgotcha\u201d moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people\u2019s daily lives. (Applause.)", "A politics -- a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America.", "If we\u2019re going to have arguments, let\u2019s have arguments. But let\u2019s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.", "We still may not agree on a woman\u2019s right to choose, but surely, we can agree it\u2019s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs. (Applause.)", "Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it\u2019s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I\u2019ve talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That\u2019s something that we can share.", "We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred \u2014 (applause) -- that it\u2019s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American. (Applause.)", "We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can\u2019t walk home without being harassed. And surely we can understand the wife who won\u2019t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. (Applause.)", "And surely we can agree it\u2019s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America\u2019s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us. (Applause.)", "That\u2019s a better politics. That\u2019s how we start rebuilding trust. That\u2019s how we move this country forward. That\u2019s what the American people want. That\u2019s what they deserve. I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda -- (applause, laughter) -- I know, because I won both of them. (Applause, laughter.) My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I\u2019ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol: to do what I believe is best for America.", "If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you\u2019ll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. (Applause.)", "Because -- because I want this chamber, I want this city, to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world.", "I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances \u2014 (applause) -- as committed as we are we are to working on behalf of our own kids.", "I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen: man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters.", "I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.

But it\u2019s simpler to operate, too. Just swipe from the left to reach your options.", "Google Camera includes an impressive panorama mode and the ability to take a 360-degree photo (which requires a lot of patience, but produces cool outcomes). The star of the app is the Lens Blur filter, which mimics the shallow depth of field you can get with digital single-lens reflex cameras: The subject in front is in focus while the background is softly blurred.", "GET GOOGLE CHROME TO PHONE One big trend in mobile phones is getting phones to communicate more easily with computers. Apple, for example, has Continuity, for sharing emails, calls and text messages between your phone and your Mac.", "Google can do some similar tricks: If you use Gmail, the popular email service, you\u2019ll find your drafts in progress on your computer or on your phone, and if you use Hangouts, a chatting service, you\u2019ll find all your instant messages and texts across devices, too. Google Voice lets you see your voice mail messages and make calls, as well.", "But my favorite upside to the Google ecosystem is Google Chrome to Phone, an app that lets you send map directions, web links, phone numbers or any copied text from the browser on your computer directly to your phone.", "It takes a little bit to set up.

Limiting human harm to environments is a major challenge and we applaud all efforts to increase the public utility of global-change science. Yet the planetary boundaries (PB) framework \u2013 in its original form and as revised by Steffen et al \u2013 obscures rather than clarifies the environmental and sustainability challenges faced by humanity this century.", "Steffen et al concede that \u201cnot all Earth system processes included in the PB have singular thresholds at the global/continental/ocean basin level.\u201d Such processes include biosphere integrity (see Brook et al 2013), biogeochemical flows, freshwater use, and land-system change. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d they continue, \u201cit is important that boundaries be established for these processes.\u201d Why? Where a global threshold is unknown or lacking, there is no scientifically robust way of specifying such a boundary \u2013 determining a limit along a continuum of environmental change becomes a matter of guesswork or speculation (see e.g. Bass 2009; Nordhaus et al 2012). For instance, the land-system boundary for temperate forest is set at 50% of forest cover remaining. There is no robust justification for why this boundary should not be 40%, or 70%, or some other level.", "While the stated objective of the PB framework is to \u201cguide human societies\u201d away from a state of the Earth system that is \u201cless hospitable to the development of human societies\u201d, it offers little scientific evidence to support the connection between the global state of specific Earth system processes and human well-being. Instead, the Holocene environment (the most recent 10,000 years) is assumed to be ideal. Yet most species evolved before the Holocene and the contemporary ecosystems that sustain humanity are agroecosystems, urban ecosystems and other human-altered ecosystems that in themselves represent some of the most important global and local environmental changes that characterize the Anthropocene. Contrary to the authors\u2019 claim that the Holocene is the \u201conly state of the planet that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies,\u201d the human-altered ecosystems of the Anthropocene represent the only state of the planet that we know for certain can support contemporary civilization.", "Human alteration of environments produces multiple effects, some advantageous to societies, such as enhanced food production, and some detrimental, like environmental pollution with toxic chemicals, excess nutrients and carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and the loss of wildlife and their habitats. The key to better environmental outcomes is not in ending human alteration of environments but in anticipating and mitigating their negative consequences. These decisions and trade-offs should be guided by robust evidence, with global-change science investigating the connections and tradeoffs between the state of the environment and human well-being in the context of the local setting, rather than by framing and reframing environmental challenges in terms of untestable assumptions about the virtues of past environments.", "Even without specifying exact global boundaries, global metrics can be highly misleading for policy. For example, with nitrogen, where the majority of human emissions come from synthetic fertilizers, the real-world challenge is to apply just the right amount of nitrogen to optimize crop yields while minimizing nitrogen losses that harm aquatic ecosystems. Reducing fertilizer application in Africa might seem beneficial globally, yet the result in this region would be even poorer crop yields without any notable reduction in nitrogen pollution; Africa\u2019s fertilizer use is already suboptimal for crop yields. What can look like a good or a bad thing globally can prove exactly the opposite when viewed regionally and locally. What use is a global indicator for a local issue? As in real estate, location is everything.", "Finally, and most importantly, the planetary boundaries are burdened not only with major uncertainties and weak scientific theory \u2013 they are also politically problematic. Real world environmental challenges like nitrogen pollution, freshwater consumption and land-use change are ultimately a matter of politics, in the sense that there are losers and winners, and solutions have to be negotiated among many stakeholders. The idea of a scientific expert group determining top-down global limits on these activities and processes ignores these inevitable trade-offs and seems to preclude democratic resolution of these questions. It has been argued that (Steffen et al 2011):", "Ultimately, there will need to be an institution (or institutions) operating, with authority, above the level of individual countries to ensure that the planetary boundaries are respected. In effect, such an institution, acting on behalf of humanity as a whole, would be the ultimate arbiter of the myriad trade-offs that need to be managed as nations and groups of people jockey for economic and social advantage. It would, in essence, become the global referee on the planetary playing field.", "Here the planetary boundaries framework reaches its logical conclusion with a political scenario that is as unlikely as it is unpalatable. There is no ultimate global authority to rule over humanity or the environment. Science has a tremendously important role to play in guiding environmental management, not as a decider, but as a resource for deliberative, evidence-based decision making by the public, policy makers, and interest groups on the challenges, trade-offs and possible courses of action in negotiating the environmental challenges of societal development (DeFries et al 2012). Proposing that science itself can define the global environmental limits of human development is simultaneously unrealistic, hubristic, and a strategy doomed to fail.", "I\u2019ve posted the response online as a standalone document for easier downloading; there you can view the authors\u2019 references, as well.", "Update, 9:40 p.m.| Will Steffen, the lead author of the updated Planetary Boundaries analysis, sent this reply to Ellis and co-authors tonight:", "Response to Ellis et al. on planetary boundaries\n\nOf course we welcome constructive debate on and criticism of the planetary boundaries (PB) update paper. However, the comments of Ellis et al. appear to be more of a knee-jerk reaction to the original 2009 paper than a careful analysis of the present paper. In fact, one wonders if they have even read the paper, including the Supplementary Online Material (SOM) where much methodological detail is provided.", "One criticism seems to be based on a rather bizarre conflation of a state of the Earth System with (i) the time when individual biological species evolved, and (ii) the nature and distribution of human-altered terrestrial ecosystems. This makes no sense from an Earth System science perspective. The state of the Earth System (a single system at the planetary level) also involves the oceans, the atmosphere, the cryosphere and very important processes like the surface energy balance and the flows and transformation of elements. It is the state of this single complex system, which provides the planetary life support system for humanity, that the PB framework is concerned with, not with fragmentary bits of it in isolation.", "In particular, the PB framework is based on the fact \u2013 and I emphasise the word \u201cfact\u201d \u2013 that the relatively stable Holocene state of the Earth System (the past approximately 11,700 years) is the only state of the System that has allowed the development of agriculture, urban settlements and complex human societies. Some argue that humanity can now survive, and even thrive, in a rapidly destabilizing planetary environment, but that is a belief system based on supreme technological optimism, and is not a reasoned scientifically informed judgment. Also, Ellis et al. seem to conflate human alteration of terrestrial environments with human alteration of the fundamental state of the Earth System as a whole. These are two vastly different things.", "The criticisms show further misunderstanding of the nature of complex systems like the Earth System and how they operate. For example, Ellis et al. claim that a process is not important unless it has a threshold. Even a cursory understanding of the carbon cycle, for example, shows that this is nonsense. Neither the terrestrial nor the marine carbon sinks have known large-scale thesholds yet they are exceedingly important for the functioning of the climate system, which does indeed have known large-scale thresholds such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Sure, it is more challenging to define boundaries for processes that are very important for the resilience of the Earth System but don\u2019t have large-scale thresholds, but it is not impossible. The zone of uncertainty tends to be larger for these boundaries, but as scientific understanding improves, this zone will narrow.", "An important misrepresentation of our paper is the assertion that we are somehow suggesting that fertilizer application in Africa be reduced. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, if Ellis et al had taken the time to read the SOM, the excellent paper by Carpenter and Bennett (2011) on the P boundary, the equally excellent paper by de Vries et al. (2013) on the N boundary, and the paper by Steffen and Stafford Smith (2013) on the distribution and equity issues for many of the PBs, including N and P, they wouldn\u2019t have made such a misrepresentation.", "Finally, the Steffen et al. (2011) paper seems to have triggered yet another misrepresentation. The paragraph of the paper quoted by Ellis et al. is based on contributions from two of the authors who are experts in institutions and governance issues, and does not come from the natural science community. Nowhere in the paragraph quoted, nor in the Steffen et al. (2011) paper as a whole, is there the proposal for a \u201ca scientific expert group determining top-down global limits\u2026\u201d. The paragraph reprinted by Ellis et al. doesn\u2019t mention scientists at all. That is a complete misrepresentation of our work.", "We reiterate that we very much welcome careful and constructive critiques of the PB update paper, preferably in the peer-reviewed literature. In fact, such critiques of the 2009 PB paper were very helpful in developing the 2015 paper. Knee-jerk reactions in the blogosphere make for interesting reading, but they are far less useful in advancing the science.", "Update, Jan. 16, 2:09 p.m. | Johan Rockstr\u00f6m and Katherine Richardson, authors of the boundaries analysis, sent these additional reactions to the Ellis et al. critique:", "We are honored that Erle Ellis, Barry Brook, Linus Blomqvist and Ruth DeFries (Ellis et al.) show such strong interest in our Planetary Boundaries research.

It can also be noted that Ellis et al.\u2019s critique simply echoes the standpoints regarding Planetary Boundaries research that the same group (Blomqvist et al., 2012) brought forward in 2012. Now, as then, their criticisms seem largely to be based on misunderstandings and their own viewpoints:", "(1) We have never argued that there are planetary scale tipping points for all Planetary Boundary processes. Furthermore, there does not need to be a tipping point for these processes and systems in order for them to function as key regulators of the stability of the Earth system. A good example here is the carbon sink in the biosphere (approximately 4.5 Gt/year) which has doubled over the past 50 years in response to human emissions of CO2 and, thus, provides a good example of Earth resilience at play;", "(2) Establishing the Planetary Boundaries, i.e. identifying Earth System scale boundaries for environmental processes that regulate the stability of the planet, does not (of course) contradict or replace the need for local action, transparency and democratic processes.

Scientific evidence has now accumulated that indicates a further need for management of some environmental challenges at the global level. Many years of multi-lateral climate negotiation indicate a recognized need for global management of the CO2 emissions that occur locally. Our Planetary Boundaries research identifies that there are also other processes critical to the functioning of the Earth System that are so impacted by human activities that they, too, demand management at the global level. Ours is a positive \u2013 not a doomsday \u2013 message. It will come as no surprise to any reader that there are environmental challenges associated with all of the 9 Earth System functions we examine. Through our research, we offer a framework that can be useful in developing management at a global level.", "It is important to emphasize that Ellis et al. associate socio-political attributes to our work that do not exist. The Science paper published today (16th January 2015), is a natural science update and advancement of the planetary boundaries framework. It makes no attempt to enter the (very important) social science realm of equity, institutions or global governance. The implications attributed to the PB framework must, then, reflect Ellis et al.\u2019s own normative values. Furthermore, Ellis et al. argue that the \u201ckey to better environmental outcomes is not ending human alteration\u201d but \u201canticipating and mitigating the negative consequences\u201d of human environmental perturbation. While Planetary Boundaries research does not dictate how societies should use the insights it provides, \u201canticipating negative consequences\u201d is at the absolute core of our approach!", "Regarding Earth system tipping points. As Will Steffen points out in his earlier response, it would have been scientifically more correct for Ellis et al. to refer not only to their own assessment of uncertainties regarding a potential biosphere tipping point but also to the response to their article by Terry Hughes et al. (2014). These researchers presented the current state of empirical evidence concerning changes in interactions and feedbacks and how they can (in several cases do!) trigger tipping points at ecosystem and biome scale, and that such non-linear dynamics at local to regional scale can add up to impacts at the Earth system scale.", "A different worldview. The Ellis et al. critique appears not to be a scientific criticism per se but rather is based on their own interpretation of differences in worldview. They do not substantively put in question the stability of the Earth system as a basis for human development\u2013 see Will Steffen\u2019s response. Thus, it appears that we and Ellis et al. are in agreement here. Of course species and ecosystems have evolved prior to the Holocene but only in the stable environment of the Holocene have humans been able to exploit the Earth system at scale (e.g., by inventing agriculture as a response to a stable hydro-climate in the Holocene).", "Ellis et al. argue that the only constructive avenue is to \u201cinvestigate the connections and trade-offs between the state of the environment and human well-being in the context of the local setting..:\u201d. This is clearly not aligned with current scientific evidence. In the Anthropocene, there is robust evidence showing that we need to address global environmental change at the global level, as well as at the regional, national and local contexts, and in particular understanding cross-scale interactions between them.", "On global governance. It seems hardly surprising, given the Ellis et al.\u2019s misunderstanding of the Planetary Boundaries framework that their interpretation of the implications of operationalizing the framework rests also on misunderstandings. They claim the Planetary Boundaries framework translates to an \u201cultimate global authority to rule over humanity\u201d. No one would argue that the current multi-lateral climate negotiations are an attempt to establish \u201cultimate global authority over humanity\u201d and this is certainly never been suggested by the Planetary Boundaries research. In essence, the Planetary Boundary analysis simply identifies Earth System processes that \u2013 in the same manner as climate \u2013 regulate the stability of the Earth System, and if impacted too far by human activities potentially can disrupt the functioning of the Earth System. The Planetary Boundaries is, then, nothing more than a natural sciences contribution to an important societal discussion and which presents evidence which can support the definition of Planetary Boundaries to safeguard a stable and resilient Earth system. How this then translates to governance is another issue entirely and important social science contributions have addressed these (Galaz et al 2012). As our research shows, there is natural science evidence that global management of some environmental challenges is necessary. From the social science literature (Biermann et al., 2012) as well as from real world policy making, we see that such global scale regulation is possible to construct in a democratic manner and does establish a safe operating space, e.g. the Montreal protocol, a global agreement to address one of the identified planetary boundaries and which, to our knowledge, is never referred to as a \u201cglobal authority ruling over humanity\u201d. As noted above, the UNFCCC process is also fundamentally concerned with establishing the global \u201crules of the game\u201d by which society can continue to develop within a climate planetary boundary. The Aichi targets (within the UN Convention on Biological Diversity) of setting aside marine and terrestrial areas for conservation are also good examples of the political translation of a science based concern over global loss of biodiversity. The coming SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) framework includes a proposed set of four goals (oceans, climate, biodiversity and freshwater), which is a de-facto example of applying planetary boundary thinking to create a global framework for safeguarding a stable environment on the planet for societies and communities across the world. We find it interesting \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 that societies and the world community are already developing management tools within several \u201cplanetary boundary domains\u201d. In all cases, this is happening in good democratic order and building upon bottom-up processes and informed by science. This ought to be reassuring for Ellis et al. who portray implementation of Planetary Boundary thinking as a dark force of planetary rule."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/when-autocorrect-goes-wrong-and-so-so-right.html": ["There were a few things that were sweetly grandmotherly about Patricia Duncan Moran\u2019s Facebook post to her great-granddaughter Devyn on her birthday.

One of the men\u2019s bones had cut marks, possibly indicating wounds by a sharp object.

Perhaps the most important thing we learn from this book comes from its very existence. Ours could be the first time and place in which cowardice has been thought a subject worthy of academic study. Near the beginning, we find a Google graph showing that the word is much less used today than it was 200 or even 100 years ago. The decline is a steady one until shortly after the beginning of the present century, when there is a small but unmistakable uptick. The author is surely right to say that this is owing to popular debate about terrorism since 9/11, but I wonder if the graph for \u201chonor,\u201d \u201ccourage,\u201d \u201cvirtue\u201d or any other words that now sound \u201cjudgmental\u201d would not describe a similar pattern.", "The book\u2019s \u201cworking definition\u201d of a coward, naturally hedged with numerous qualifications, is \u201csomeone who, because of excessive fear, fails to do what he is supposed to do.\u201d \u201cExcessive\u201d begs the question. What makes this fear excessive? The fact that it provokes cowardice \u2014 which is then defined by the excessive fear. But it bespeaks a definitional need to probe within, to find the coward\u2019s true feelings in order to authenticate his cowardice. Does he have \u201cexcessive\u201d fear? Yes? Then he\u2019s a proper coward instead of, presumably, only pretending to be one. But surely it is one definition of a coward, and perhaps a better one to be working with, that it is something no one ever pretends to be.", "By contrast, courage is often pretended \u2014 perhaps so often as to approach always \u2014 which is what makes it so much more rewarding as a subject for study. If the mask is fascinating because of what it hides, what it hides is mere fear, which is rather lacking in nuance. What is there to say about it once it has been named? A quick survey of books with \u201cfear\u201d in their titles suggests that all are written for the purpose of dismissing or getting rid of it. Giving way to fear, which is what the coward does, is more interesting, however, because of its public dimension, since it is the rare act of cowardice that entirely escapes public observation. The coward emulates the writer or analyst (or vice versa), by bringing into the light of day that which belongs to the shadowiest realm of the psyche.", "About Henry Fleming, the problematic hero of \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage,\u201d Walsh has this to say: \u201cWhen he thinks that having made his \u2018mistakes in the dark\u2019 meant that he was still a man, the implication is that any sin so thoroughly a matter of social perception is no sin at all.\u201d It is not really as sin that Henry sees his own act of cowardice; rather it is as a potential cause for (public) shame. If it is also a sin, that does not concern him: only the prospect of being known as cowardly. This is in the nature of the thing. We all care more about being publicly acknowledged as sinners than about committing sins in the first place, but cowardice is itself nearly always a public acknowledgment.", "Or at least that is the traditional way to look at it. Part of Walsh\u2019s purpose is to tease us with the idea that maybe there is more to it than that. Maybe bravery itself conceals a kind of cowardice. Of the scene in which Henry runs from battle so desperately that, if you didn\u2019t know the direction of his flight, you wouldn\u2019t know if he was charging or fleeing, Walsh writes: \u201cCowardice and courage become merely arbitrary names we give to physiological reactions to environmental conditions.\u201d At least that\u2019s what the coward tells himself!", "There is a similar definitional problem with \u201cduty,\u201d to which the book devotes a chapter. \u201cExamining specific mentions of \u2018duty\u2019 in relation to cowardice,\u201d we read, \u201csuggests an increasingly common understanding that duty is trivial, absurd or downright pernicious.\u201d This is no doubt true, but of course such things could only be said in a context of denial that the duty in question is a duty at all. What seems dubious, logically, is retaining the idea of duty while disparaging it in such terms. Or is it? Maybe, just as there could be said to be a cowardly shadow to someone who acts courageously because he is afraid to be a coward, so there is also a kind of ghostly dutifulness in someone who takes on the duty of defying the very idea of duty.", "This kind of thinking seems to me oversubtle, a backhanded way of justifying bad behavior. But insofar as there is a demand for a book on cowardice from a reputable university press, it must be because a sizable contingent of people will not think of it in this way. For whatever reason, we want to be told that the standards by which people used to be judged have to be re-examined \u2014 as cowardice has been in the last century, mainly on therapeutic grounds \u2014 if not abolished altogether. Those who are interested in such standards, whether pro or con, will find this book an indispensable addition to their libraries.", "COWARDICE\nA Brief History\nBy Chris Walsh\nIllustrated. 292 pp. Princeton University Press. $27.95."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/business/two-schools-of-thought-adding-up-to-success.html": ["GROWTH and value styles of investing are often described as opposites, but managers of three of the better-performing funds of the fourth quarter of 2014 don\u2019t see it that way.", "Instead, while they seek companies with steadily growing earnings, they also borrow an attribute from the playbook of Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing and Warren E.

The managers then winnow further, building a portfolio of only 25 to 30 companies. In contrast, the average actively managed stock fund tracked by Morningstar holds about 150 stocks.", "Mr. Schoenstein said he and his colleagues believed that active managers should invest with conviction.

There are thousands of homeless people in San Francisco and scant access to public bathrooms.

Today, she\u2019s CEO of Loowatt, a London-based company that produces context-specific toilets that use a patented sealing mechanism to wrap human waste in biodegradable polymer film. The film, which lines the toilet bowl, is pulled through the mechanism when the toilet is \u201cflushed,\u201d enclosing the waste in a removable cartridge. The cartridge is then emptied, daily to weekly depending upon factors like location and usage patterns, into an anaerobic digester, where the waste and polymer film are converted into natural gas and fertilizer.", "The innovations here lie in the waterless toilet that provides a hygienic and odorless experience and the value-generating treatment solution that supports the toilet. Loowatt toilets can be built in many shapes and sizes, to work in a variety of different scenarios.", "Currently, the technology is used to serve highly disparate communities: A pilot program in Madagascar features home toilets that are linked to an energy-generating digester in the community. In London, a modified version is deployed at events and festivals in locations where water or power is in short supply. \u201cThis started out as just the idea to make a value-generating waterless toilet, and to challenge the \u2018flush and forget\u2019 norm that I grew up taking for granted,\u201d says Gardiner. \u201cLater I became aware of the many practical applications.\u201d", "Back in San Francisco, LavaMae (a play on \u201cwash me\u201d in Spanish) expands the program to include showers, because there are only eight shelter facilities in San Francisco that offer public showers.

In 2015, LavaMae is ramping up from one bus to four \u2014 and it needs to.", "The idea for LavaMae was born from the frustration of a public relations executive, Doniece Sondaval, who witnessed the rapid gentrification of her neighborhood \u2014 and the displacement of neighbors that has come with it. To pull off this modestly scaled but expanding endeavor, she has assembled an eclectic group of public and private sector partners, from Google to Kohler to the San Francisco Department of Public Health, to provide a basic service. Its implementation \u2014 requiring everything from access to fire hydrants to the obtaining of street parking permits \u2014 has been arduous, but that bus, once destined for the scrap heap, now assists in deterring potential public health problems and, perhaps most critically, in helping a population struggling to retain its dignity.", "\u201cWe call them guests,\u201d says Sandoval when talking about the thousands of people who\u2019ve used the service in its first six months. \u201cWe realize that we\u2019re in the hospitality business. We\u2019re not doing case management; we\u2019re trying to get these folks cleaned up, trying to help eliminate the obstacles if they\u2019re applying for jobs or we\u2019ve found that they have jobs and they\u2019re just trying to stay clean. We want them to feel like we\u2019ve created something just for them, that when they\u2019re here we care about them and that we see them as people.

It\u2019s had an impact we didn\u2019t anticipate having.\u201d", "Sandoval\u2019s background in P.R. and marketing shows in all the good ways on this project: LavaMae takes its visual cues from design-savvy brands like Method Cleaner and Virgin America (if only all the city\u2019s buses looked so good), was initially financed by a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, and has a temporary existence in line with the current vogue for tactical urbanism. Sandoval and Lava Mae\u2019s designer, the architect Brett Terpeluk, wanted to create a beautiful design for a population that always gets castoffs. A mobile shower facility doesn\u2019t \u201csolve\u201d homelessness, but it\u2019s a proactive response to a dire need.", "Sandoval harbors no fantasies about LavaMae as a permanent solution. For her, the shower facilities are an end goal. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a permanent fixture,\u201d she says. \u201cI think this should be a government responsibility. I want the government to say, \u2018a private citizen has stepped forward to show us the desire and need for this, so let\u2019s go for it.'\u201d", "Indeed, while the ingenuity of these efforts is indisputable, what it all means for the future of services once squarely in the domain of government is more complicated. With everything from parks to health care to transportation, the respective roles of the private and public sectors are evolving \u2014 and are more and more complex. Are we to view the convenience and increasing ubiquity of Uber as a replacement for public transit? (Some do.) A for-profit endeavor like HandUp crowdsources funding for homeless individuals (the donor selects the person he or she wants to help), but should we see it as a replacement for city services? What does this sort of targeted solutionism mean for civic responsibility? For the social contract?", "The question of whether the right funding models exist for social impact projects like these remains. PPlanter had highly successful test runs last year employing homeless residents to do maintenance, for example. This provided a compelling way to monitor both the social and technical aspects of the project but establishing the structures to employ the homeless through government models has been challenging, Bucknum says: \u201cDespite this amazing social infrastructure prototype, we have not found funding outside of initial government grants for construction, from the private sector.\u201d", "Our country is confronting so many issues that feel intractable, from homelessness to inequality, climate change to immigration. It\u2019s normal to feel overwhelmed, even hopeless, and then to respond with apathy, despair or inaction. Small-scale projects like PPlanter, Loowatt and LavaMae should be embraced \u2014 but as part of a more systemic approach. No single intervention, whether it comes from economists, architects or scientists, is enough.

Psychologists have been working on the problem for a long time. And for good reason: Nowadays, though we may still idolize the charismatic leader or creative genius, almost every decision of consequence is made by a group. When Facebook\u2019s board of directors establishes a privacy policy, when the C.I.A.\u2019s operatives strike a suspected terrorist hide-out or when a jury decides whether to convict a defendant, what matters is not just the intelligence and wisdom of the individual actors involved. Groups of smart people can make horrible decisions \u2014 or great ones.", "Psychologists have known for a century that individuals vary in their cognitive ability. But are some groups, like some people, reliably smarter than others?", "Working with several colleagues and students, we set out to answer that question. In our first two studies, which we published with Alex Pentland and Nada Hashmi of M.I.T. in 2010 in the journal Science, we grouped 697 volunteer participants into teams of two to five members. Each team worked together to complete a series of short tasks, which were selected to represent the varied kinds of problems that groups are called upon to solve in the real world. One task involved logical analysis, another brainstorming; others emphasized coordination, planning and moral reasoning.", "Individual intelligence, as psychologists measure it, is defined by its generality: People with good vocabularies, for instance, also tend to have good math skills, even though we often think of those abilities as distinct. The results of our studies showed that this same kind of general intelligence also exists for teams. On average, the groups that did well on one task did well on the others, too. In other words, some teams were simply smarter than others.", "We next tried to define what characteristics distinguished the smarter teams from the rest, and we were a bit surprised by the answers we got. We gave each volunteer an individual I.Q. test, but teams with higher average I.Q.s didn\u2019t score much higher on our collective intelligence tasks than did teams with lower average I.Q.s. Nor did teams with more extroverted people, or teams whose members reported feeling more motivated to contribute to their group\u2019s success.", "Instead, the smartest teams were distinguished by three characteristics.", "First, their members contributed more equally to the team\u2019s discussions, rather than letting one or two people dominate the group.", "Second, their members scored higher on a test called Reading the Mind in the Eyes, which measures how well people can read complex emotional states from images of faces with only the eyes visible.", "Finally, teams with more women outperformed teams with more men. Indeed, it appeared that it was not \u201cdiversity\u201d (having equal numbers of men and women) that mattered for a team\u2019s intelligence, but simply having more women. This last effect, however, was partly explained by the fact that women, on average, were better at \u201cmindreading\u201d than men.", "In a new study that we published with David Engel and Lisa X. Jing of M.I.T. last month in PLoS One, we replicated these earlier findings, but with a twist. We randomly assigned each of 68 teams to complete our collective intelligence test in one of two conditions. Half of the teams worked face to face, like the teams in our earlier studies. The other half worked online, with no ability to see any of their teammates. Online collaboration is on the rise, with tools like Skype, Google Drive and old-fashioned email enabling groups that never meet to execute complex projects. We wanted to see whether groups that worked online would still demonstrate collective intelligence, and whether social ability would matter as much when people communicated purely by typing messages into a browser.", "And they did. Online and off, some teams consistently worked smarter than others. More surprisingly, the most important ingredients for a smart team remained constant regardless of its mode of interaction: members who communicated a lot, participated equally and possessed good emotion-reading skills.", "This last finding was another surprise. Emotion-reading mattered just as much for the online teams whose members could not see one another as for the teams that worked face to face. What makes teams smart must be not just the ability to read facial expressions, but a more general ability, known as \u201cTheory of Mind,\u201d to consider and keep track of what other people feel, know and believe.", "A new science of effective teamwork is vital not only because teams do so many important things in society, but also because so many teams operate over long periods of time, confronting an ever-widening array of tasks and problems that may be much different from the ones they were initially convened to solve. General intelligence, whether in individuals or teams, is especially crucial for explaining who will do best in novel situations or ones that require learning and adaptation to changing circumstances.

She edited a feature published Tuesday on the origin of this year\u2019s Ebola outbreak, and shares how the story came together after months of reporting.", "As the Ebola epidemic gained velocity this fall, spreading fear and death across one of the world\u2019s poorest regions, I kept coming back to the same questions: How did this one get away? How did the experts \u2014 and the media, including editors like me, for that matter \u2014 miss the signs in the spring that this time would be catastrophically different from the nearly two dozen prior outbreaks? Why did the most seasoned Ebola hands \u2014 men and women who had repeatedly risked their lives battling this lethal foe \u2014 let their guard down and scale back in May just when the virus might have been throttled?", "A team of New York Times reporters spent the past two months trying to answer those questions and to gather facts for a first draft of the early history of an epidemic that began in the forests of Guinea a year ago. The result of their labors, \u201cHow Ebola Roared Back,\u201d was published Tuesday in a special section of Science Times.", "The first step was assembling the reporters. Adam Nossiter, the Times correspondent based in Dakar, Senegal, was immersed in covering the news on Ebola in West Africa, but sent two early memos from the cradle of the outbreak in Guinea and Guinea\u2019s capital, Conakry, that provided crucial leads and fodder for the story.", "Sheri Fink, Pam Belluck and Kevin Sack then immersed themselves single-mindedly in the painstaking work of interviewing nearly 200 people and producing more than 350,000 words of notes for what would become a 7,604 word article.", "Ms. Fink, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who joined The Times a year ago, spent weeks in the borderlands of Liberia and Sierra Leone, staying in guesthouses with no plumbing or running water and often no electricity. I asked her to report on an episode that scientists believed had seeded the explosive spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone: the burial of a respected traditional healer.", "But Ms. Fink gradually pieced together a far more disturbing story. As she spoke to the healer\u2019s relatives and an ever widening circle of inhabitants in Kpondu, where the woman was buried, and other nearby villages, Ms. Fink realized that the healer was likely not the first to be infected in the country \u2014 that, though the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone would not be confirmed until late May, the contagion had likely taken root there in late February or early March, killing those who cared for each other in a terrible chain of death. Ms. Fink ultimately traced the start of the contagion back to a 37-year-old woman named Sia Wanda Koniono who had traveled from Guinea.", "But the true horror of this story awaited Ms. Fink upon her return to New York. It was then that she obtained the 17-page report of a team of investigators from Guinea\u2019s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization. By March, that team had already documented two suspected cases of Ebola in women from Kpondu and a neighboring village in Sierra Leone \u2014 but no officials in Sierra Leone were ever told, and so the sick were never found to be treated and isolated. The contagion spread silently. Sierra Leone now has had more cases of Ebola than any other country. When Ms. Fink began to read the report on her laptop, she did a search for Ms. Koniono\u2019s name. It immediately popped up as the first suspicious case in Sierra Leone.", "\u201cI actually cried,\u201d Ms. Fink said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe she was known about from the very earliest moment. It just blew my mind. How could this information not have been shared?", "In New York, Ms. Belluck, a reporter who has served on the metro, national and science desks of The Times in her 19 years at the paper, was working the phones, interviewing dozens of key players. She talked again and again to the men and women who worked for Doctors Without Borders, Samaritan\u2019s Purse, and the World Health Organization and who were on the ground in West Africa in the early months of the fight to contain Ebola. Dr. Robert Fowler, a critical care physician from Canada who was working with the W.H.O. for a year, told her about his harrowing effort to bring a deathly sick woman in for treatment in Conakry, but gave up as a menacing crowd gathered at nightfall outside the family\u2019s home. Dr. Tim Jagatic, a 33-year-old family doctor from Canada who had volunteered to care for the sick with Doctors Without Borders, confided in Ms. Belluck about how terrifying it was to treat people infected with a virus that seemed to kill even some of the doctors and nurses who tried hardest to take all the recommended precautions. Ms. Belluck unearthed many of the nuggets that gave the story heart, substance and drama.", "\u201cI love being a bloodhound and following clues that lead to undiscovered information,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was exciting to be part of a big story where you felt the time bomb of Ebola was still ticking and something you found out might make a difference.\u201d", "Mr. Sack, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and a member of The Times\u2019s investigative staff, also plunged into reporting the story. He interviewed many of the early responders from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is based in Atlanta, as is Mr. Sack. Dr. Pierre Rollin, the C.D.C.\u2019s top Ebola expert, became a central character in the story.", "Mr. Sack first came to the Ebola story when the contagion arrived in Dallas, as a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, sickened and died there. \u201cIt was compelling to go back in time and see with great clarity and a lot of detail how we had gotten to the point where this became an American story as well an African one,\u201d he said.", "It fell to Mr. Sack to fashion a compelling, epic tale from the team\u2019s voluminous reporting. The reporters shared 192,000 words of notes in a Google document. Mr. Sack read, and reread the shared notes, highlighting the most critical passages in green, and those just beneath that in importance in yellow. Gradually, he winnowed the material down. From the start, he also maintained a highly detailed timeline that would provide the spine of the story\u2019s chronological telling. Ms. Fink drafted passages from her reporting in Liberia and a chapter on Sierra Leone. Those were drawn from another 174,000 words of notes in her own files.", "Mr. Sack wove the team\u2019s contributions into a seamless whole. And he came away with this thought.", "\u201cEven though things are starting to improve in some places, it\u2019s vital that all the parties involved learn the lesson of the spring \u2014 that you can\u2019t relent,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as almost contained with this virus.\u201d"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/f-c-c-sharply-increases-definition-of-broadband/": ["The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday sharply revised its benchmark definition of broadband Internet service. The new definition increases download speeds to more than six times faster than the previous standard, set more than four years ago.", "The commission\u2019s move was expected, after Thomas Wheeler, the chairman, had proposed the faster speed standard earlier this month. The impact of the new definition is uncertain, but the standard does guide policy on matters like the national deployment of broadband service, particularly in rural areas.", "The new benchmark standard on speed could also spill over into the current weighing of new rules intended to maintain an open Internet, or net neutrality \u2014 the concept that Internet traffic should be open and treated equally. How access speeds can be managed and priced by the major Internet service providers \u2014 cable television and telecommunications companies \u2014 is the central issue in the open Internet policy debate. The commission is scheduled to vote on open Internet regulations on Feb. 26.", "The new broadband benchmark sets downloads at a speed of 25 megabits a second and uploads of 3 megabits a second. The previous standard was a download speed of 4 megabits a second and an upload speed of 1 megabit a second.", "The faster standard, according to a report led by Mr. Wheeler, is needed to keep up with the rising demands of American households. They increasingly use several Internet connected devices and use data-streaming video services like Netflix. The report found that 53 percent of rural Americans \u2014 22 million people \u2014 do not have Internet access at the 25-3 level. By contrast, only 8 percent of urban Americans lack access to 25-3 broadband.", "The debate over a new speed standard for broadband service mirrors the lobbying battle lines over net neutrality. The big Internet content companies including Google, Facebook and Netflix favor strong action by the F.C.C., while the cable and telecommunications companies want the F.C.C. to refrain.", "In a filing with the commission last week, Matthew A. Brill, counsel for the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, called the 25-3 standard \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d He termed the assumptions behind the new standard as \u201chypotheticals\u201d that \u201cdramatically exaggerate the amount of bandwidth needed by the typical broadband user.\u201d Mr. Brill also urged the commission to make sure a new benchmark would not have a wider regulatory impact.", "Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, whose members include the major Internet content companies, took a very different stance in his recent filing with the commission. The appropriate policy goal, Mr. Beckerman wrote, was \u201cbroadband abundance \u2014 the expansion of truly high-speed broadband services across the country.\u201d", "Higher access speeds, he wrote, led to a \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of innovation, new services and fresh demand from customers, which in turn fuels economic growth. Revenue from streaming videos, according to Mr. Beckerman, citing industry research, jumped by 175 percent between 2010 and 2013, from $1.86 billion to $5.12 billion."], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/morning-agenda-yahoo-as-takeover-target/": ["After Yahoo completes the spinoff of its $39 billion stake in the Alibaba Group, the Silicon Valley stalwart may not have much time to turn its core Internet businesses around, DealBook\u2019s Michael J. de la Merced reports. When the spinoff is done, investors and analysts say, Yahoo could become a takeover target.", "Yahoo has undergone a turnaround under the two-and-a-half-year tenure of Marissa Mayer, its chief executive, which some analysts say has made it a more focused company. But others warn that Yahoo still has more work to do, potentially deterring would-be buyers. Although spinning off Alibaba is a step investors have demanded for years, the decision also has deal makers talking about potential moves that extend beyond Yahoo itself, Mr. de la Merced writes. Even the company that Yahoo is creating to hold the Alibaba shares could eventually become a takeover target, with Alibaba the logical buyer.", "Yahoo is less likely to pursue huge deals of its own, partly because it does not have the enormous war chests of its rivals. And ultimately, it may be an attractive acquisition.

The profit for 2014, while better than the year before, amounted to a pretax return on equity of 5 percent, far from the ratio of 25 percent that Deutsche Bank and many other large banks aimed for before the financial crisis that began in 2008, Mr. Ewing writes.", "", "MCDONALD\u2019S REPLACES ITS CHIEF | McDonald\u2019s announced on Wednesday that its president and chief executive, Don Thompson, would step down, effective March 1, just days after the fast-food restaurant chain posted one of its worst financial performances in years, Hiroko Tabuchi reports in The New York Times.

But, Mr. Davidoff Solomon added, the more Wall Street expects McDonald\u2019s to be like Shake Shack, the hip hamburger purveyor, \u201cthe more off the mark it is likely to be.

There was a strong reaction to the puzzles over the past few days (Patrick Berry\u2019s puzzle may be the exception), and rightfully so. The consensus, both here and on social media, is that the level of arcane knowledge needed to solve some of the puzzles, especially Wednesday\u2019s, was excessive.", "I don\u2019t disagree, but that\u2019s the thing with crosswords: One solver\u2019s arcane entry might fall smack into another solver\u2019s wheelhouse. The one exception appears to be the GILL measurement from yesterday. I think we can all agree that it\u2019s archaic, and asking solvers to not only know it, but to also know what two of them make was unreasonable.", "So now we come to Saturday, and Joe Krozel\u2019s puzzle (don\u2019t wince, Mr. Krozel; I\u2019m the kind blogger, remember?) I\u2019ll say right off the bat that there is some less-than-desirable fill in the grid, but what struck me more than that was the high quality of the long fill, as well as the unusual and interesting grid design. In fact, the good here outweighs the bad for me, and that\u2019s how I, personally, judge a puzzle. I\u2019ve been lukewarm on some of Mr. Krozel\u2019s puzzles in the past, but I found this one to be really interesting and well-constructed for a couple of reasons.", "First, there\u2019s the grid design. Mr. Krozel\u2019s grid has mirror symmetry, and his design (is that a butterfly or an angel?) enabled him to slip an additional triple stack of 15s at the bottom. Typically, when a constructor pushes the 15-stacking, there are bound to be some entries that some people might consider awkward. Some people don\u2019t like the \u201cONE\u2019S\u201d phrases when they\u2019re overdone, but there is only one today, and I like it: RESTS ON ONE\u2019S OARS is a fine phrase. I have more of an issue with entries like EPI, even clued as \u201cAdrenaline, informally.\u201d That\u2019s the kind of entry that stops you in the middle of all those long, luxurious entries and makes you say, \u201cWhat?\u201d Yes, EPInephrine is adrenaline. But you rarely hear anyone calling it EPI informally, and even the EPIPen is a brand name, not an informal appellation. Also, ERNS.", "Secondly, there are those long entries. Your mileage may vary, but I think those are some funky triple stacks, and I mean that in a good way. I don\u2019t have an issue with any of them, and that\u2019s something to write home about when you consider that there are nine 15-letter entries and two sets of triples are vertical. And make no mistake: I had to work for those 15s. Not knowing who T. C. CHEN was held me up, but it was worth it when I pieced together a fine entry like CASUALTIES OF WAR. And let\u2019s savor ROSIE THE RIVETER, MOONLIGHT SONATA and ATTENTION GETTER.", "Even some of the shorter entries are nice, setting aside the beach avians. CHEROOTs are gross in real life, but they make a fun crossword entry.", "I hit a speed bump with IN ICE at 54 Across, because all the champagne I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of imbibing was served ON ICE in an ice bucket. It\u2019s a fine line. THE MRS may be an eye-roller to female solvers, and I truthfully could live without musty entries like that.", "Finally, I loved seeing CHAI TEA in the puzzle, but am not sure I would consider it an alternative to mocha; anything is conceivably an alternative to mocha, of course, but for my money and taste buds, CHAI TEA is an alternative to unspiced tea. Maybe it\u2019s clued that way because it\u2019s Saturday and is supposed to be tough, but that\u2019s not just tough to me, that\u2019s misleading. A really good clue on a Saturday makes you think, \u201cThat\u2019s great. Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d It doesn\u2019t disconnect so far from the entry that it makes you think \u201cHuh?\u201d", "So, are there \u201cflaws\u201d in Mr. Krozel\u2019s puzzle? Sure. Anyone can find flaws. And if you ask 10 different people, I am fairly certain that they will mostly be different, because judging a puzzle is a very subjective thing. But on a Saturday, it\u2019s a pleasure to open the puzzle and see a wide open grid with a peculiar design, especially with three really nice triple stacks. Nicely done, Mr. Krozel.", "My last revision of this puzzle was submitted almost two years prior to the publication date, so when I sat down to solve this final edit I had long forgotten the fill, and Will had vastly livened up most of the clues. Hence, this would be as unbiased a solving experience as I could contrive for myself. For me, I had to confirm that a \u201cNo-Google\u201d solver could indeed complete it, and I am happy to report that I did \u2026 completely Google-free.", "I consider the \u201cNo-Google\u201d solvers to be one critical audience for a puzzle, and the best way to ensure their satisfaction is to minimize the density of unfamiliar content. My greatest concern during construction must have been the proximity of CHEROOT and REYNOSA in the Northeast and the crossing of TCCHEN with HSIA in the West, but they were only minor obstacles for my own solving experience. So, I\u2019m satisfied with the way the puzzle turned out.", "Just in case anyone was wondering, here are some of my own missteps while solving: 13-A NOMADIC, 26-A MIS; 28-A DEY, 34-A SCALE, 50-A IDO; 54-A ON ICE, 57-A ALEUTIAN ISLANDS; 3-D MARINE ENGINEERS; 12-D PROGRAM DIRECTOR; 14-D CEDAR; 59-D CES.", "I\u2019ll be interested in seeing whether the regular solvers had a similar experience.", "Your thoughts?"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/us/eating-while-driving-brings-a-ticket-in-georgia.html": ["ATLANTA \u2014 For something that merited a police stop, it does not sound like much: \u201ceating while driving.\u201d But that is what a police officer wrote on the citation he issued Jan. 10 after he pulled over the 2009 BMW that H.

In \u201cThe Age of the Crisis of Man: Thought and Fiction in America, 1933-1973,\u201d the gifted essayist Mark Greif, who reveals himself to be also a skillful historian of ideas, charts the history of the 20th-century reckonings with the definition of \u201cman.\u201d Strangely, he seems to regret the entire enterprise. Here is his conclusion: \u201cAnytime your inquiries lead you to say, \u2018At this moment we must ask and decide who we fundamentally are, our solution and salvation must lie in a new picture of ourselves and humanity, this is our profound responsibility and a new opportunity\u2019 \u2014 just stop.\u201d Greif seems not to realize that his own book is a lasting monument to precisely such inquiry, and to its grandeur. \u201cAnswer, rather, the practical matters,\u201d he counsels, in accordance with the current pragmatist orthodoxy. \u201cFind the immediate actions necessary to achieve an aim.\u201d But before an aim is achieved, should it not be justified? And the activity of justification may require a \u201cpicture of ourselves.\u201d Don\u2019t just stop. Think harder. Get it right. (Why are liberals so afraid of their own philosophy?)", "Greif\u2019s book is a prehistory of our predicament, of our own \u201ccrisis of man.\u201d (The \u201cman\u201d is archaic, the \u201ccrisis\u201d is not.) It recognizes that the intellectual history of modernity may be written in part as the epic tale of a series of rebellions against humanism. Humanism has been savaged by theists and atheists, conservatives and progressives, fascists and socialists, scientists and philosophers, though it has also been propounded by the same diversity of thinkers. Who has not felt superior to humanism? It is the cheapest target of all: Humanism is sentimental, flabby, bourgeois, hypocritical, complacent, middlebrow, liberal, sanctimonious, constricting and often an alibi for power. The abusers of humanism, of course, are guilty of none of those sins. From Heidegger to Althusser, they come as emancipators. I think we should emancipate ourselves from their emancipations.", "But what is humanism? For a start, humanism is not the antithesis of religion, as Pope Francis is exquisitely demonstrating. The most common understanding of humanism is that it denotes a pedagogy and a worldview. The pedagogy consists in the traditional Western curriculum of literary and philosophical classics, beginning in Greek and Roman antiquity and \u2014 after an unfortunate banishment of medieval culture from any pertinence to our own \u2014 erupting in the rediscovery of that antiquity in Europe in the early modern centuries, and in the ideals of personal cultivation by means of textual study and aesthetic experience that it bequeathed, or that were developed under its inspiration, in the \u201cenlightened\u201d 18th and 19th centuries, and eventually culminated in programs of education in the humanities in modern universities. The worldview takes many forms: a philosophical claim about the centrality of humankind to the universe, and about the irreducibility of the human difference to any aspect of our animality; a methodological claim about the most illuminating way to explain history and human affairs, and about the essential inability of the natural sciences to offer a satisfactory explanation; a moral claim about the priority, and the universal nature, of certain values, not least tolerance and compassion. It is all a little inchoate \u2014 \u00adhuman, humane, humanities, humanism, humanitarianism; but there is nothing shameful or demeaning about any of it.", "And posthumanism? It elects to understand the world in terms of impersonal forces and structures, and to deny the importance, and even the legitimacy, of human agency. It certainly does not mean, as Greif correctly notes about antihumanism, a \u201chatred of the human.\u201d There have been humane posthumanists and there have been inhumane humanists. But the inhumanity of humanists may be refuted on the basis of their own worldview, whereas the condemnation of cruelty toward \u201cman the machine,\u201d to borrow the old but enduring notion of an 18th-century French materialist, requires the importation of another framework of judgment. The same is true about universalism, which every critic of humanism has arraigned for its failure to live up to the promise of a perfect inclusiveness. It is a melancholy fact of history that there has never been a universalism that did not exclude. Yet the same is plainly the case about every particularism, which is nothing but a doctrine of exclusion; and the correction of particularism, the extension of its concept and its care, cannot be accomplished in its own name. It requires an idea from outside, an idea external to itself, a universalistic idea, a humanistic idea. Asking universalism to keep faith with its own principles is a perennial activity of moral life. Asking particularism to keep faith with its own principles is asking for trouble.", "\u25c6", "Aside from issues of life and death, there is no more urgent task for American intellectuals and writers than to think critically about the salience, even the tyranny, of technology in individual and collective life. All revolutions exaggerate, and the digital revolution is no different. We are still in the middle of the great transformation, but it is not too early to begin to expose the exaggerations, and to sort out the continuities from the discontinuities. The burden of proof falls on the revolutionaries, and their success in the marketplace is not sufficient proof. Presumptions of obsolescence, which are often nothing more than the marketing techniques of corporate behemoths, need to be scrupulously examined. By now we are familiar enough with the magnitude of the changes in all the spheres of our existence to move beyond the futuristic rhapsodies that characterize much of the literature on the subject. We can no longer roll over and celebrate and shop. Every phone in every pocket contains a \u201cpicture of ourselves,\u201d and we must ascertain what that picture is and whether we should wish to resist it. Here is a humanist proposition for the age of Google: The processing of information is not the highest aim to which the human spirit can aspire, and neither is competitiveness in a global economy. The character of our society cannot be determined by engineers.", "\u201cOur very mastery seems to escape our mastery,\u201d Michel Serres has anxiously remarked. \u201cHow can we dominate our domination; how can we master our own mastery?\u201d Every technology is used before it is completely understood. There is always a lag between an innovation and the apprehension of its consequences. We are living in that lag, and it is a right time to keep our heads and reflect. We have much to gain and much to lose. In the media, for example, the general inebriation about the multiplicity of platforms has distracted many people from the scruple that questions of quality on the new platforms should be no different from questions of quality on the old platforms. Otherwise a quantitative expansion will result in a qualitative contraction. The new devices do not in themselves authorize a revision of the standards of evidence and argument and style that we championed in the old devices. (What a voluptuous device paper is!) Such revisions may be made on other grounds \u2014 out of commercial ambition, for example; but there is nothing innovative about pandering for the sake of a profit. The decision to prefer the requirements of commerce to the requirements of culture cannot be exonerated by the thrills of the digital revolution.", "And therein lies a consoling irony of our situation. The machines may be more neutral about their uses than the propagandists and the advertisers want us to believe. We can leave aside the ideology of digitality and its aggressions, and regard the devices as simply new means for old ends. Tradition \u201ctravels\u201d in many ways. It has already flourished in many technologies \u2014 but only when its flourishing has been the objective. I will give an example from the humanities. The day is approaching when the dream of the democratization of knowledge \u2014 Borges\u2019s fantasy of \u201cthe total library\u201d \u2014 will be realized. Soon all the collections in all the libraries and all the archives in the world will be available to everyone with a screen. Who would not welcome such a vast enfranchisement? But universal accessibility is not the end of the story, it is the beginning. The humanistic methods that were practiced before digitalization will be even more urgent after digitalization, because we will need help in navigating the unprecedented welter. Searches for keywords will not provide contexts for keywords. Patterns that are revealed by searches will not identify their own causes and reasons. The new order will not relieve us of the old burdens, and the old pleasures, of erudition and interpretation.", "Is all this \u2014 is humanism \u2014 sentimental? But sentimentality is not always a counterfeit emotion. Sometimes sentiment is warranted by reality. The persistence of humanism through the centuries, in the face of formidable intellectual and social obstacles, has been owed to the truth of its representations of our complexly beating hearts, and to the guidance that it has offered, in its variegated and conflicting versions, for a soulful and sensitive existence. There is nothing soft about the quest for a significant life. And a complacent humanist is a humanist who has not read his books closely, since they teach disquiet and difficulty. In a society rife with theories and practices that flatten and shrink and chill the human subject, the humanist is the dissenter. Never mind the platforms. Our solemn responsibility is for the substance."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/google-said-to-be-in-talks-to-acquire-softcard-a-mobile-payments-company/": ["Softcard, a mobile payments company developed by the largest wireless carriers in the country, never caught on with the mainstream.", "Now, the company is on the selling block.", "Google has made an offer to purchase Softcard for an amount less than $100 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.

He is boyish, ebullient and voluble, which is only natural for someone who makes his living from words. As a child, Shore found himself entranced by language, and when he received the American Heritage Dictionary as a birthday present, he pored over a supplement on the roots of Indo-European words in much the manner that other kids memorized batting averages. (He still has the book on a shelf in his office in Oakland, Calif.) He studied linguistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and wrote a senior thesis on Latin and moraic theory. There wasn\u2019t a lot of work for linguists, so he fell back on another preoccupation, fonts, and became a typesetter for a real estate magazine. Typesetting led him to graphic design, graphic design led him briefly to advertising and advertising led him to naming, beginning with cocktails at Hotel De Anza in San Jose. Shore spent 13 years at one of the oldest and largest branding firms, Landor Associates, and a year at the branding behemoth Lexicon before deciding in 2009 to open his own one-man naming agency, Operative Words.", "Now he met the three entrepreneurs at their office in Menlo Park.

He was immediately teleported to a computer-generated Tuscan villa. Shore was impressed. But still, it looked like a computer game.", "The engineers then loaded a new file, and when Shore looked around the room through the headset, he saw the three inventors tossing a Nerf ball. Only they weren\u2019t. Shore was watching a virtual-reality movie of them tossing a Nerf ball. This time Shore was astonished. \u201cIt was completely real,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was transportive.\u201d", "Shore had named everything from companies to products to websites to ingredients to colors. He was responsible for some 160 distinct names in all, including SoyJoy (the health bar), Lytro (the camera) and Yum!

Some work within larger branding agencies, like Landor or Interbrand. Others work within boutiques, like Catchword, A Hundred Monkeys (put 100 monkeys at 100 typewriters, and eventually they\u2019ll write a Shakespearean tragedy, or a name), Namebase and Zinzin (French for \u201cwhatchama\u00adcallit\u201d).

If that name becomes the foundation of a branding campaign, they can pay tens of millions of dollars more to establish its presence in the commercial firmament. The results can be inspired, but they can also be laughable. When Stephen Wolf took over USAir in the late 1990s, he concluded that the name sounded like that of a regional carrier, and he hired the branding firm Luxon Carra to find him a new name that fit his larger aspirations. The new name was unveiled in February 1997 to great fanfare. USAir was now .\u2009.\u2009. US Airways. The process of rebranding, from reprinting the stationery to repainting the planes, took nine months and, by one account, eventually cost the company nearly $40 million.", "The namer\u2019s craft may attain its highest expression in the pharmaceutical industry, in large part because namers have to work within so many government restrictions.

(The F.D.A.\u2019s guide on Best Practices in Developing Propriety Names for Drugs is a dense 33 pages.) The F.D.A. even runs handwriting tests on potential names to see if pharmacists might mistake one scribbled drug name on a prescription for another.", "The oddity is that for all the weight a company places on choosing names, the decisions arise from a process that couldn\u2019t be less corporate. There are no naming metrics, no real way to know if a new name helps or hinders. The field attracts people who are comfortable with such ambiguity. Jay Jurisich, the founder of Zinzin, is a painter with an M.F.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles. Jim Singer, who founded Namebase, was a jingle writer, and Margaret Wolfson, who now runs naming at Namebase, still splits her time between naming and performing one-woman shows around the world in which she recites classical myths.

Many select \u201cMargi-Gras,\u201d because it is festive and different. But, Norambuena says, a professional namer would see the negative associations with Fat Tuesday and reject it.", "After Shore had his virtual-reality encounter, he got to work. The first thing he wanted to know was how the inventors defined the most salient characteristics of their production process: What made it new, different, amazing? In the naming business, this sort of interrogation is known as the brief. When namers ask these questions, companies often respond by giving them hundreds of pages of research or even slickly produced videos. But too often the executives struggle to articulate what makes their companies or products distinctive, and so namers must draw it out of them \u2014 which is why Jay Jurisich of Zinzin calls this first phase \u201ccorporate group therapy.\u201d Shore learned that the inventors wanted something short, preferably one word. It needed to convey the idea of transport and also seem hip and consumer-\u00adfriendly, in a manner that suggested advanced technology. The founders wanted it to have a science-fiction feel to it. When Shore asked them about names they liked, Christensen said Tesla and Imax.", "That was enough to get started. Shore settled into his home office in the hills above Oakland and considered his naming objectives, or what the name ought to do. Taking off from the inventors\u2019 comments, he kept returning to the idea of transport: \u201cIt puts you somewhere else.\u201d Shore says he always starts with a simple, concrete idea and then tries to \u201celevate it to some overriding, overarching idea that is much more abstract.\u201d So he began riffing. Change of place elevated to motion, then motion elevated to speed, then speed elevated to physical space, then physical space elevated to just plain space. \u201cSo now I\u2019m thinking about space and location.\u201d", "Eventually, he settled on six elements that would serve as the basis of his names. He calls these concepts his creative directions, though other namers call them buckets, places they can dump names that they associate with a given concept. Shore\u2019s were: change (in location and time), entertainment, experience, immersion, presence and reality and, finally, WOW!", "With his creative directions established, he set out to find names that gestured in those directions. He asked himself: What would be the sound of going from one place to another instantly? He began mapping the concept of instant travel to the sounds he decided upon. He knew that speed could be conveyed by what linguists call fricatives, which are consonants produced by forcing air through the narrow channel between tongue and front teeth or tongue and upper palate or tongue and molars: f, s, v, z. And he knew that the point of arrival could be conveyed by stops or plosives, which are consonants in which the air flow is blocked: b, d, p, t. The exercise produced names like Slide or Slyde.", "The techniques Shore was using are a relatively recent innovation \u2014 one that makes the messy process seem more scientific. Will Leben was a linguistics professor at Stanford in 1988 when he got a call from Lexicon asking if its partners could visit him. At the time, Leben was teaching a course on the structure of English words, and Lexicon recruited him for a project: to create a list of morphemes, those parts of words that contain meaning. Using a thesaurus, Leben generated a long list of morphemes and the meanings of each \u2014 \u201cpages and pages of morphemes,\u201d Leben says, which Lexicon could then draw upon to create names that would express the nature of a particular product.", "A few years later, David Placek, Lexicon\u2019s founder, asked Leben what he thought of a name they had conjured, Triples, for a new cereal from General Mills that contained three different grains. \u201cIt sounds like something that\u2019s light and crunchy,\u201d Leben recalls telling them. He says their jaws dropped. Could the sound of a word say as much as its content? The idea of sound symbolism went back to at least Plato\u2019s \u201cCratylus,\u201d in which he associated sounds with physical characteristics, but linguists tended to discredit it. It had long been a fundamental tenet of linguistics, Leben says, that \u201cthe association between the meaning of the word and its pronunciation is an arbitrary one. The reason why we call a piano a piano has nothing to do with the sounds p-i-a-n-o.\u201d", "But Placek was intrigued, and he asked Leben to conduct a study to determine whether sounds did indeed convey physical properties. Leben called his study Sounder. He administered a questionnaire to 150 Stanford and Berkeley students, asking them questions like: Which sounds faster, \u201cfip\u201d or \u201cfop\u201d? Leben found a consensus. \u201cFip\u201d was faster than \u201cfop.\u201d Why? Because of the way the sounds were generated in the mouth, Leben says. \u201cFip\u201d feels lighter and faster because the vocal tract is open only a small amount. There is less acoustic substance for \u201cfip\u201d than there is for \u201cfop,\u201d the pronunciation of which causes the jaw to drop and the tongue to lower, creating a heavier, more powerful sound. There were many similar discoveries among fricatives and plosives, leading Leben to conclude that \u201cthe physical characteristics of sound are what determine associations.\u201d Significantly, Leben got the same results when the study was conducted overseas. Lexicon took the idea and ran with it. \u201cPentium\u201d began with a plosive that signified energy, power and dynamism. The \u201cS\u201d of the Swiffer mop made it sound fast and easy. The \u201cD\u201d of Dasani water made it sound heavier. Leben says: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say \u2018refreshing.\u2019 It says \u2018slow down,\u2019 \u2018cool off,\u2019 \u2018relax.'\u2009\u201d", "Next, Placek asked Leben if he could conduct a study to see if there might be an association between sounds and emotional states. That was Sounder II, conducted in 2002. \u201cThe results came out so clean, it was hard to believe,\u201d Leben says. Certain sounds, for example, were associated with daring or liveliness or sadness or insecurity. But Sounder I and II concentrated exclusively on the initial sounds of a word \u2014 its first consonant or vowel or both. Sounder III, just concluded last summer, asked whether consonants and vowels in other positions in a word might have a similar or additive effect. They did.", "Among the discoveries Leben made: Fricatives convey \u201cfaster\u201d and \u201csmaller\u201d \u2014 as do vowels that are voiced near the front of the mouth, like the a in \u201cbat\u201d or the i in \u201chid.\u201d Plosives, or stops, convey \u201cslower\u201d and \u201cbigger\u201d \u2014 as do vowels that are voiced at the back of the throat, like the o in \u201ctoken\u201d or the double o\u2019s in \u201cfood.\u201d So-called voiceless stops like k, p, and t are more alive and daring than voiced stops like b, d and g, while the voiceless convey less luxury than the voiced. And all sound-symbolic effects manifest differently depending on context. They take on properties of the product being named.", "In his search for just the right sounds, Shore used an app, called Universal Text Combination Generator, to create a list of 7,500 names combining fricatives and stops. Getting some help from computers has become de rigueur among namers, who \u2014 perhaps in part to reassure their corporate clients \u2014 have devised proprietary and often highly confidential software to assist in the naming process. Some of these programs mash together roots of words to form new words. Some find rhymes. Some focus on speech. One company, Idiom, promotes a system it calls Lingtwistics, which, according to its website, is an algorithm that \u201cdeconstructs these naming ingredients, then reassembles them in unexpected ways.\u201d (The name Lingtwistics was itself generated by the algorithm.)", "Like most namers, though, Shore doesn\u2019t believe that computers can replace human creativity. For Shore, sound symbolism was only the beginning. He didn\u2019t just want words that sounded right. Shore liked \u201cnatural words,\u201d words that carried semantic and even historic meaning.", "He kept coming back to the notion that this invention was like something out of science fiction. Looking for inspiration, he watched the movie \u201cJumper,\u201d which is about teleportation, and began examining a website called the Glossary of Science Fiction Ideas, Technology and Inventions. There were 2,400 entries, and Shore studied them all. Two, however, popped out. One was \u201cJumpdoor,\u201d which referred to a teleportation device, still Shore\u2019s go-to idea. And the other was \u201cJaunte Stage,\u201d described as a \u201clittle place to teleport,\u201d first used in a 1956 novel, \u201cThe Stars My Destination,\u201d by Alfred Bester, which served as inspiration for a Stephen King story titled \u201cThe Jaunt.\u201d", "This is the point in his search at which Shore sits at his computer and opens window after window, making lists of words and then trying to make connections among the words on those lists and then putting potential candidates for the final name on a master list. It is an act of computerized mind meld, and it goes on for hours every day for days at a time. If the search seems chaotic, that is the point. The idea is to do everything \u2014 to leave no word unturned. He visits the website onelook.com, which shows how words work with other words, or sketchengine.co.uk, which combs texts and concordances, flags parts of speech and shows how a specific word appears in billions of words of text. He visits rhymezone.com to find all the words that rhyme with a word. That is how he came up with the name for an ideation application for the Palm Pilot \u2014 he began with \u201cbrain,\u201d looked for rhyming words and concluded with BrainForest. For this project, he thought of words about travel, but also about entertainment, the sense of engagement, connection, energy, even spheres. And he laid them all out on an Excel spreadsheet \u2014 1,200 names in all by the time he had finished.", "For a single project, namers can come up with as many as 6,500 names. Big naming companies will do anywhere from 40 to 50 projects a year, and smaller ones 15 to 20, which adds up to a lot of names. Of course, only one name will be chosen for each project, and that is the only one the client will own. The rest, however, won\u2019t necessarily go to waste. Every naming agency keeps a list of its discards in a computer program. These are then classified by message (at Catchword); by distinctiveness, appeal, memorability and concept (at Interbrand); or by whatever other way the namers might want to retrieve them. Catchword has 650 of these categorized lists. And many of the names will be recycled, which suggests that there is a kind of Platonic ideal of good names, independent of products good or bad \u2014 a name so good that it could work, if not on anything, than at least on many things.", "Three weeks after he first experienced the results of the new virtual-reality production process, Shore paid a second visit to Menlo Park \u2014 this time with 61 names he had culled from his master list of 1,200. Using PowerPoint, he presented the names one by one with an explanation of the meaning of each. And he presented them in what amounted to a narrative, bunching all the names that connoted one characteristic and moving from that characteristic to the next in an arc that he thought had a strong beginning and a boffo ending.", "The first name was Virch, for \u201cvirtual\u201d reality.

With the lists in hand, Shore retreated to his home to generate a revised set of 50 names, now that he knew what sorts of names the inventors seemed to like (Glidesight, Latch, Plasm, Sheen, Splicewire and Telescape, among others).", "Getting clients to accept a name is the hardest part of a namer\u2019s job. Shore calls it the brander\u2019s paradox: Having asked for a whole new identity, the client is terrified to accept it. \u201cWe\u2019re taxed with doing something different,\u201d Shore says, \u201cyet those are the very things that might be off-putting or scary.\u201d This is one reason namers make a point of discussing the origins of their names; explaining the chain of reasoning behind an unfamiliar word can make it come to sound not just natural but inevitable. Even so, some of the best names wind up in the bin, which is why Paola Norambuena of Interbrand says she makes it a practice never to argue for a name or to fall in love with one. Naming will break your heart.", "Then there is the issue of trademarks. Before any company or product name can be registered and legally protected, it must pass an evaluation by the Patent and Trademark Office to determine whether it has already been taken. Almost every naturally occurring word has been claimed, which is why namers so often arrive at portmanteaus (Accenture derives from \u201caccent\u201d and \u201cfuture\u201d) or drop vowels (Flickr and Tumblr) or change letters (Lyft). \u201cComing up with a good name is hard,\u201d Margaret Wolfson says. \u201cComing up with a great name is even harder. Coming up with a name that passes trademark! .\u2009.\u2009. \" There are roughly two million active trademarks in the United States, and 5,000 new applications are filed with the trademark office each week. At least half do not pass, often because they happen to be merely similar to another name. Shore\u2019s Respace, which the inventors liked, would be deemed too close to a digital-services firm named Redspace, so the name eventually dropped out. A company can try to buy out another company that has a name it covets, but it can get messy. That is why Shore and other namers subject their candidates to a preliminary trademark screening before a client becomes attached to a name it cannot have. And trademarks don\u2019t have to be cleared only in the United States. For companies and products overseas, they have to be cleared in each country.", "Vetting names internationally means considering cultural issues as well. Lexicon has 84 linguists around the world who make sure names don\u2019t ruffle local sensitivities. By one account, linguists rejected the drug name Soarus because it sounded like tsouris, Yiddish for \u201ctrouble.\u201d Similarly, Wolfson once had to convince a client that a product named Care 4 would not sell in China because the number 4 signifies death. One American company, Good Characters, is devoted entirely to coming up with Chinese names for other American companies wanting to do business in China.", "In pharmaceutical naming, the hurdles are, of course, even higher \u2014 which has led some pharma namers to abandon semantically grounded names altogether. At ixx\u00e9o, a naming firm based in Switzerland, Denis Ezingeard, the managing director, has devised a method that focuses entirely on visual and aural names, on the principle that the less semantic freight a word carries, the better. He says his process draws on jazz, nonrepresentational art, bird-watching and Darwinian evolution. His rationale is that the names don\u2019t mean anything in linguistic terms, which makes it easier for them to pass regulation. Ezingeard may be onto something in a business in which companies are running out of words. The company\u2019s own name, ixx\u00e9o, is a product of its method. It looks and sounds right, but it isn\u2019t a real word. It is an impression \u2014 something Ezingeard made up.", "With the prescreening completed late in August, Shore returned to the inventors\u2019 office for the last time with his 50 final candidates. Once again, he projected the names on a screen in context and explained his reasoning for choosing each. But by this time, Christensen, van Hoff and Annau were seasoned evaluators. \u201cThe names were even better,\u201d Christensen says.", "After Shore left, they wrote the finalists on a whiteboard on their office wall and began deliberating. The contenders included Popover, FarAcross, Jaunt, Jumpdoor and Lunge. Christensen lobbied hard for Jaunt, which had grown on him because of its science-fiction origins. But one partner thought it was too high-toned, too British-sounding. Jumpdoor was still a favorite, and Respace hadn\u2019t yet fallen out. For days, the partners debated the possibilities, and the weight of the decision was considerable. \u201cIt is kind of all or nothing,\u201d Christensen says about their name choice.", "What Shore didn\u2019t tell them was that even if the name they chose received a tepid reception, the power of their production process could still overcome it. Most namers will tell you, as Paola Norambuena puts it, that a \u201cgreat name can\u2019t fix a bad product. A great product can fix a bad name.\u201d Accenture was met with derision for reminding people of dentures. Gap was an empty space. Yelp was a dog in pain. The iPad was confused with a tampon. Now these names have no odd connotations at all, thanks to the success of the things they name.", "So it may have been that after hours upon hours of brainstorming and hours more of deliberations and still hours more of trademark searches, and after the expenditure of tens of thousands of dollars, not as much was at stake as Christensen, van Hoff and Annau thought \u2014 at least not in commercial terms. Personal and emotional stakes were a different story. Christensen says selecting the name was a milestone, though he doesn\u2019t remember exactly how or when they settled on their choice. Shore got the news via an email telling him that they had chosen a name and that it had been granted trademark approval. Now it was theirs.", "It would be seven more months before the company was ready to come out to the public. In that time, the inventors moved their operations to Palo Alto.

The next, she was the proud mother of her first child, who was nicknamed BBBB in the hospital, for Big Baby Boy Bogue (her husband\u2019s last name). This would hardly be considered extraordinary if it weren\u2019t for the fact that she had recently been named the company\u2019s C.E.O. Female chief executives typically live in glass boxes where every move they make is held up for intense public scrutiny, and most get themselves there through brutal amounts of work and by avoiding anything that draws attention to the fact that they\u2019re women. Yet right after starting her job running a troubled $30 billion technology giant, Mayer announced that she would be taking a maternity leave, albeit a stunningly short one. (She took two weeks.) The audacity of the move \u2014 accepting a top executive job knowing that she was five months pregnant and then taking so little time off \u2014 prompted an Internet outcry (\u201cThe Pregnant C.E.O.: Should You Hate Marissa Mayer?\u201d Forbes asked in one representative example), in which even progressives grumbled about the privilege involved, including Mayer\u2019s household staff and in-office nursery. And so it was that her upsetting of the women\u2019s\u00ad-issues industrial complex became all that most people know about Mayer. Yet there is much more to the picture.", "As Nicholas Carlson demonstrates in \u201cMarissa Mayer and the Fight to Save Yahoo!,\u201d a vivid account of her vertiginous career climb, Mayer is worth paying attention to for reasons that transcend gender. Carlson presents her as a complex personality who defies most stereotypes. \u201cMarissa Mayer is fascinating for her contradictions,\u201d he writes. \u201cOnstage, in front of hundreds or thousands, she is warm and charming and laughing. But in a room with just a few others, she\u2019s cold and direct and impersonal.\u201d She also \u201ccalls herself a geek, but she doesn\u2019t look the part,\u201d he points out, the result of an understanding of personal branding that she developed early in her career; since then she\u2019s embraced haute couture and posed for a Vogue photo spread. Not looking the part has only amplified her appeal.", "Most important, Carlson argues, Mayer earned her shot at running Yahoo through years of innovative thinking in an industry that prides itself on novel ideas. She was one of the early engineers at Google and had a central role in building the company into the success that it is, playing the hidden curator behind the clean, uncluttered \u201clook and feel\u201d of Google\u2019s sites and products. Written in a chatty, bloggy tone that may work for some readers and grate on others \u2014 it grew out of several pieces for the financial news site Business Insider, where Carlson is the chief correspondent, and it is loyal to the style found there \u2014 the book is likely to appeal most to Silicon Valley obsessives, as well as anyone who is curious about what lies behind Mayer\u2019s coating of sunny confidence. The author brings juicy scenes and new details to Mayer\u2019s story, whose major turns are well known, although the lack of detailed source notes (there is a bibliography) makes it difficult to evaluate some of the information he presents.", "The question hanging over the narrative is whether Mayer can save Yahoo, or even make it great, and the answer is far from certain. It\u2019s a brand that had been neglected or mishandled for years by those who were in charge before her, and almost half of Carlson\u2019s account retraces the well-worn history of Yahoo, which began in the 1990s as an Internet directory and then morphed into a web \u201cportal\u201d that became overly dependent on dot-com companies for its advertising revenue before the bubble exploded in 2000. The story becomes much more interesting when Mayer takes center stage. The daughter of an art teacher-\u00adhomemaker and an environmental engineer in a tiny town in Wisconsin, Mayer was programmed to achieve, loaded up with extracurricular activities in school, like Tracy Flick. She joined Google right out of a graduate computer science program at Stanford and thrived, ultimately becoming one of its most influential executives. She generated resentment, though, especially among colleagues who were jealous of the extraordinary amount of press attention she got \u2014 not that it was her fault she was a photogenic female computer nerd, a breed as rare as a ghost orchid. \u201cThere was nothing especially abhorrent or uncommon about Mayer\u2019s behavior as an executive,\u201d Carlson writes, hinting at the sexism that seems to have motivated some of her enemies. \u201cShe was headstrong, confident, dismissive, self-promoting and clueless about how she sometimes hurt other people\u2019s feelings. So were many of the most successful executives in the technology industry.\u201d", "Mayer was handpicked by Daniel Loeb, an aggressive hedge fund manager and a Yahoo investor who seems to have informed long stretches of Carlson\u2019s narrative, to take on the role of Yahoo\u2019s savior. She tried to make the company\u2019s work force more productive and to focus the company on making applications for mobile phones, with some success. Two years later, even though Mayer managed to prevent mass layoffs and invigorated the culture of the company, Yahoo is still in deep trouble. In the end Carlson himself seems unconvinced that she can turn things around: \u201cMaybe not even Marissa Mayer, with her incredible work ethic, genius sense of what made an Internet product usable, worldwide fame and talent-attracting charisma, would be enough to save Yahoo.\u201d Mayer deserves to be remembered as someone more than just the woman who took a big job in a male-dominated industry while pregnant, even if it means being known for failing to save Yahoo.", "MARISSA MAYER AND THE FIGHT TO SAVE YAHOO!\nBy Nicholas Carlson\nIllustrated. 357 pp. Twelve. $30."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/facebook-offers-artificial-intelligence-tech-to-open-source-group/": ["Facebook wants the world to see a lot more patterns and predictions.", "The company said Friday that it was donating for public use several powerful tools for computers, including the means to go through huge amounts of data, looking for common elements of information.

For several years, Rachelle would show no interest in eating, doctors told Rhoda; then she would crave food intensely for the rest of her life. No matter how much Rachelle ate, she would never feel full. To make matters worse, she would also have an especially slow metabolism, predisposing her to morbid obesity. Though people with the syndrome now routinely live into their 50s and 60s, their average life expectancy in the United States is 30; most die of obesity-related causes.

By the time she was 8, she weighed close to 200 pounds and had diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, asthma and sleep apnea. Rhoda knew that people blamed her for her daughter\u2019s size.

But for 25 years, no one knew what caused the strange suite of symptoms that, in addition to low muscle tone and insatiability, characterize it. These include short stature, disproportionally short arms and legs and small hands and feet; a tendency to pick skin until it bleeds; a high pain tolerance; infertility; excellent spatial memory; and cognitive disabilities, including low I.Q. and difficulties processing emotions akin to those common in autism. People with Prader-\u00adWilli are prone to troubles with empathizing, to obsessive thinking, to dismay over slight changes in plans and to problems regulating behavior. Many symptoms affect some people more than others \u2014 for instance, not everyone with the disorder is intellectually impaired \u2014 but all children with it show an early failure to thrive, followed by obesity, unless their diet is aggressively managed.", "In 1981, researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine made a significant discovery: Errors on the chromosome 15 segment \u2014 which occur at conception and for which there are no clear risk factors, except in a fraction of cases \u2014 produce the syndrome, making it one of few known genetic causes of obesity. No other genetic disorder incites the same extreme lack of satiety or urge to obtain food. Researchers now know that the damaged stretch of chromosome affects at least a dozen genes, but which of those genes govern hunger and fullness \u2014 and how \u2014 is still a mystery. What is certain is that Prader-\u00adWilli disrupts the functioning of the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that is involved in appetite control.", "One result is a heightened, permanent sensation of hunger. \u201cThey describe it as physical pain,\u201d Jennifer Miller, an endocrinologist at the University of Florida who treats children with Prader-\u00adWilli, told me. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re going to die if they don\u2019t get food. They\u2019re starving.\u201d Parents must lock their pantries, refrigerators and trash cans, and their children frequently lie and steal to get something to eat. They have been known to memorize credit-card numbers and secretly phone for delivery, use a drill to remove the door from a locked refrigerator and break into a neighbor\u2019s garage and eat, uncooked, an entire frozen pizza. Experts aren\u2019t sure how many people are born with the syndrome; estimates range from one in 15,000 to one in 30,000. That means that as many as 20,000 children and adults in the United States could have it, yet doctors are often unfamiliar with the symptoms, and fewer than 8,000 cases have been diagnosed.", "Researchers believe that hundreds of genes, combined with environmental factors, have the potential to influence whether a person in the general population overeats and how easily he or she gains weight. But in almost all cases of obesity, the body eventually fails to properly process leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells. Leptin and other hormones signal the hypothalamus to prompt you to eat or alert you that you\u2019re full, but in obese people these systems break down, preventing them from feeling sated. In some cases, including Prader-\u00adWilli, resistance to leptin appears to come first, leading to insatiability and weight gain. In others, the reverse happens: Weight gain causes resistance to leptin, which increases appetite and perpetuates the cycle. \u201cAs people gain weight, they inflict a chronic injury to the hypothalamus \u2014 to the cells in the brain that sense whether their body weight is appropriate,\u201d says Rachel Wevrick, a professor of medical genetics at the University of Alberta who studies Prader-\u00adWilli.", "That lasting damage is a major reason weight loss is often so difficult to sustain. In Prader-\u00adWilli, the cause of the hypothalamus dysfunction is entirely genetic, but the resulting problem \u2014 an inability to sense fullness \u2014 is similar. Figuring out how to restore proper signaling in the hypothalamus of people with Prader-\u00adWilli, according to many researchers, could translate to a treatment for almost all cases of obesity. \u201cI feel that Prader-\u00adWilli holds the key,\u201d Miller says. \u201cIf you could control their appetite, you could control the appetite of anyone.\u201d", "In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have begun testing substances that they hope will curb the appetites of people with Prader-\u00adWilli \u2014 and by extension those of others struggling with obesity. One drug, beloranib, seemed in a small pilot study to reduce weight, body fat and, for the first time, insatiability in Prader-\u00adWilli subjects \u2014 results that its maker, Zafgen, is now trying to reproduce in larger trials. Ferring Pharmaceuticals recently completed Phase 2 clinical testing of a drug that it hopes will improve fullness-signaling in the hypothalamus. And Rhythm Pharmaceuticals is initiating the first trials of RM-493 in people with Prader-\u00adWilli; that drug also targets the hypothalamus, and compounds similar to it have reduced appetite in mice whose condition approximates the syndrome.", "What is control, and where does it come from? That is perhaps the most complicated, and controversial, question raised by Prader-\u00adWilli. How does the drive to seek food, for people who have it, differ from the urge to overeat that anyone might face? Medicine has no definitive answer, but so far studies seem to suggest that people with Prader-\u00adWilli are experiencing an amplified version of the cravings we all have when we\u2019re hungry.", "Our impulse to eat is linked, via the hypothalamus, to the reward centers of the brain that are also activated by drugs and alcohol. In brain scans, those centers light up if anyone who has been fasting sees pictures of food. But when subjects of normal weight are given glucose, to simulate eating, before they view images of food, their reward centers are quiet; in obese subjects, those regions become slightly more active, and in Prader-\u00adWilli subjects much more so \u2014 in fact, they are particularly stimulated when people with the syndrome who should feel full see high-calorie foods. \u201cI think Prader-\u00adWilli makes you appreciate when we fault people for being obese,\u201d says Janalee Heinemann, the research director of the Prader-\u00adWilli Syndrome Association. \u201cWhat\u2019s to say other people don\u2019t have different hunger-full messages? It\u2019s certainly not just a matter of willpower.\u201d But most families of children with Prader-\u00adWilli find that they are the victims of stereotypes associated with obesity \u2014 schools, employers, medical professionals and even their own relatives simply can\u2019t believe that the condition is just as intractable and potentially lethal as a peanut allergy.", "In 2004, Peter and Gayle Girard held their annual Christmas Eve party for family members at their home in Orlando, Fla. Before dinner, they set out chips, vegetables and dip, shrimp, a bowl of punch and sodas. Their 17-year-old son, Jeremy, had Prader-\u00adWilli, and they often hosted events at their home so he could join in while they kept an eye on him \u2014 as they believed they were doing that night. But the next morning, Jeremy\u2019s belly was distended, and he complained of pain. At the emergency room, doctors pumped his stomach, but his condition worsened. A day passed before surgeons discovered that his stomach, which had been distended long enough to lose blood flow and become septic, had ruptured. Jeremy died that night. Only afterward did the Girards learn that other family members saw him eating more than he should have but didn\u2019t alert them.", "\u201cI think the problem with most people\u2019s perception of Prader-\u00adWilli is: It\u2019s just a fat kid,\u201d Peter Girard told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand that food is a death sentence to these kids.

A case manager met the family in the lobby and led everyone to a long hallway lined with bedrooms. Rachelle\u2019s had a hospital bed covered in a pink flannel blanket. There were plastic shelves bolted to the wall and a bathroom with a walk-in shower and a button to push for help cleaning up \u2014 her shorter arms meant that, like most people with Prader-\u00adWilli, she couldn\u2019t reach to wipe herself.", "The family perched around the room, anxiously scanning Rachelle\u2019s face. She sat on the bed while a staff member in scrubs named Nicole Smith unpacked her suitcase and logged each item, a subtle way of checking for contraband. The floor that housed the Prader-\u00adWilli program was kept food-free and locked. Trays were delivered just before mealtime and removed as soon as everyone finished eating. Accommodations for heavy patients were prevalent but understated: In a central recreation room, extra-wide chairs were filled with sand to prevent them from tipping over or being thrown.", "After a while, Nicole suggested that Rachelle follow her, so she could get her picture taken and meet some new friends. But about 30 feet down the hallway, Rachelle slowed, and Nicole pulled over a chair and had her sit down. Gregory Cherpes, the program director and a psychiatrist, appeared and slipped a monitor onto her finger to measure how much oxygen her tissues were getting. A healthy reading is 95; Rachelle\u2019s was 70. She was close to fainting, and potentially even cardiac arrest. Nicole went to get a wheelchair while Cherpes waited to see if resting would bring the number back up. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty shirt,\u201d he said gently. \u201cRachelle, have you ever been to camp before?\u201d", "Cherpes is 49, tall and thin, with the muted voice and thoughtful expression of an experienced ma\u00eetre d\u2019. He wears black-framed glasses and collared shirts but never neckties, because patients can grab them in a fit of temper. He and the staff were prepared for Rachelle to become aggressive, but she seemed remarkably content. Cherpes wondered if she was simply not feeling well enough to act out. The next day, a new patient hit him in the face; it took four staff members to restrain her.", "As Rachelle left with Nicole, her family went to a conference room to meet with Cherpes and other staff members. They explained that Rachelle would be on a 600-calorie-per-day diet while at the institute and that she would need to eat 800 or fewer calories per day when she returned home if she was to continue to lose weight. To help make the meals look big without adding calories, they recommended offering a bowl of salad greens with lunch and dinner in addition to a medley of other vegetables, a small amount of protein, Jell-O and skim milk. Thinking about just the cost of the produce \u2014 and the gas required to restock vegetables that quickly go bad \u2014 made Rhoda\u2019s stomach hurt. She said she would have to start budgeting. As the family prepared to leave, Rhoda warned Raquel and Edith that they had better not let Rachelle see them cry. \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018bye,'\u2009\u201d she said. \u201cSay \u2018see you later.'\u2009\u201d", "Three weeks later, at 8 on a Monday morning, Rachelle started her breakfast: scrambled eggs, which she dressed with ketchup and pineapple. Sunshine poured through the windows of the common room. That day, there were eight patients on the Prader-\u00adWilli floor. The youngest was 10, the oldest 35. Rachelle sat at a place near the door, her cheeks pink and her eyes bright. \u201cHi, beauty queen,\u201d Luke Kanish, a 26-year-old Penguins fan, called to her as he came in. Alexandra Rudzitis, a sweet, bipolar 17-year-old with corn-silk hair \u2014 the patient who had hit Cherpes \u2014 wandered over to tell her a knock-knock joke. Rachelle had a deep, hiccupping laugh that everyone found contagious. Danielle DiCola, a bright 14-year-old homesick for her guinea pig, Lightning, called her \u201cthe giggle monster.\u201d Surprisingly, even at mealtimes, the patients never talked about foods they missed, or asked for more to eat, or complained about feeling hungry. Some even left food, mostly vegetables, on their trays. That didn\u2019t mean they were full, though. Whether they ate it or not, Cherpes explained, they wouldn\u2019t feel any different.", "All the patients had a green sheet of paper with the day\u2019s agenda on it and boxes for points they could earn by completing each activity. Many refused, at least a few times, to participate. But that morning, as she had every day, Rachelle marched cheerfully through her schedule. In nutrition class, she filled in outlines of food with stoplight colors: green for near-\u00adzero-\u00adcalorie products, yellow for more substantial items and red for things like ice cream or French fries, which she would be allowed to have once a month as a single 350-calorie serving. In physical therapy, she walked for 12 minutes, climbed up and down a flight of stairs and pedaled a seated exercise machine while singing along to Miley Cyrus\u2019s \u201cParty in the U.S.A.\u201d \u201cTell Mama I\u2019m doing good?\u201d she said to her physical therapist.", "The tight structure of Rachelle\u2019s days, combined with the lack of food anywhere, led to a complete absence of her tantrums. Once, after an argument over cards, she put her head on the table and refused to participate in therapy. Another time, she was clipping ads from the paper, a favorite activity, and said she didn\u2019t want to go to class. Cherpes sat down across from her and watched as Constance Casey, a staff member, encouraged her to go earn her points.", "\u201cI\u2019ll keep your stuff here for you,\u201d she told her. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure nobody bothers it.\u201d A moment later, Rachelle got up and walked toward her classroom.", "\u201cGood choices!\u201d Cherpes said.", "The Prader-\u00adWilli program at the Children\u2019s Institute of Pittsburgh began in 1982 with a single patient. Until 2012, when HealthBridge Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston started a program, the institute was the only place in the country, and one of few in the world, to offer inpatient treatment for the syndrome. It now houses roughly 10 patients at a time \u2014 both adults and children \u2014 for stays of four to 10 weeks, depending on their medical needs and what an insurer will cover. The cost of care, per patient per day, averages about $1,500. Over the past few years, patients seem to be coming to the institute sicker than before, sometimes arriving in wheelchairs and on gurneys \u2014 a fact that the staff attributes to insurance companies\u2019 increasing their requirements for inpatient rehabilitation while misunderstanding the disorder and what it takes to treat it. \u201cAs soon as they hear \u2018obesity,'\u2009\u201d says Kwaj Overton, the nurse case manager, \u201cthey think, Well, they need to try Curves.\u201d", "Actually, much of what the institute does \u2014 restricting patients\u2019 caloric intake and getting them to exercise \u2014 would help any obese person lose weight. For people with Prader-\u00adWilli, though, it is impossible to make those changes without also managing grave health complications and out-of-control behavior, which is hard to untangle from exposure to food. People with the syndrome can resist raiding an unlocked cabinet, especially in the company of others. But this effort at control often erupts later in aggression. The institute\u2019s philosophy is that eliminating any exposure to food \u2014 except at rigidly scheduled mealtimes for which menus are posted weeks in advance \u2014 is the only way patients can forget their hunger and anxiety so they can enjoy other food-free activities: crafts, gardening, dancing. There are no punishments for acting out, only incentives for participating. \u201cIf the words are \u2018You have to do this,\u2019 maybe I do or maybe I don\u2019t, but I\u2019m going to test you and see,\u201d Cherpes said. \u201cIn a battle of wills, the person with Prader-\u00adWilli is always going to win.\u201d", "A major part of the program is teaching parents how to create a similar environment at home. The staff members also talk to schools about making accommodations, including securing classmates\u2019 lunchboxes, finding a place for a child to eat alone outside the cafeteria and providing a one-on-one aide for transitions between classrooms \u2014 measures that administrators, especially those in strapped districts, often resist. Over all, the results appear to be positive and lasting. Patients discharged in 2012 lost an average of 27.5 pounds during their stays, and 96 percent continued or sustained their weight loss after 18 months. Nine months out, a vast majority had not needed emergency medical or psychiatric treatment.", "For obesity researchers, the uniqueness of Prader-\u00adWilli presents a paradox: The causes of obesity in the general population are far more complex and varied than those of the syndrome, but Prader-\u00adWilli\u2019s specific genetic roots, while not expected to explain all forms of obesity, could offer universal truths about the biology of hunger and fullness. Robert Nicholls, a geneticist at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh who studies Prader-\u00adWilli, believes it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that our species evolved multiple, separate systems to govern eating. Understanding why people with Prader-\u00adWilli switch in early childhood from an extreme lack of interest in food to insatiability could offer clues about the nature of appetite \u2014 which might eventually help scientists minister to a person\u2019s specific type of overeating or prevent it altogether. It\u2019s possible that it could do the same for conditions of undereating and malnutrition, like anorexia. Whether damage to the hypothalamus can be undone at all, regardless of its cause, is still an open question, but one that a successful treatment for Prader-\u00adWilli could answer. \u201cTaking that genetic condition \u2014 if that is curable, there could be hope there,\u201d says Joan Han, an endocrinologist at Le Bonheur Children\u2019s Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., who conducts research at the National Institutes of Health. \u201cIt may not tell us everything about obesity in general, but it\u2019s an essential part of the big picture.\u201d", "One promising avenue of exploration illuminated by Prader-\u00adWilli involves a gene disrupted by the syndrome, Magel2. During the last 10 years, Rachel Wevrick, the University of Alberta geneticist, and colleagues discovered that mice lacking the gene develop many of the same symptoms that people with Prader-\u00adWilli have, including behavioral abnormalities, low muscle tone and obesity. And though they are less active than normal mice, they do not eat less, so they gain excessive amounts of fat. By analyzing samples of their brain tissue, Wevrick found that the ability of their hypothalamus to sense the leptin produced by the body\u2019s fat cells was impaired, disabling a neural pathway that tells the animals whether they need to conserve energy and consume more calories. Within the past year, researchers have also identified more than a dozen children in whom only the Magel2 gene on the chromosome 15 segment is mutated. At least several of the children have abnormally large appetites \u2014 all have low muscle tone \u2014 reinforcing the idea that the gene may play a central role in producing those same Prader-\u00adWilli symptoms. The Rhythm drug, RM-493, uses a synthetic protein to bypass the neural pathway (in humans) that should be governed by leptin but does not work in the mice that lack the gene. When a similar compound is given to those mice, they eat less food.", "And yet the drug that has progressed furthest in human clinical trials, beloranib, highlights what an enigma Prader-\u00adWilli still is. Originally designed to treat cancer, beloranib had the unexpected side effect of decreasing hunger and increasing weight loss. Though it has shown preliminary success in curbing the appetites of people with Prader-\u00adWilli, no one is sure exactly how it might be doing so.", "In fact, the only drug available so far for managing the weight of people with Prader-\u00adWilli \u2014 human growth hormone \u2014 replaces a deficiency in the pituitary gland that is not directly related to general obesity. Approved for use 15 years ago, the hormone improves muscle tone and increases metabolism, helping people with Prader-\u00adWilli stay thinner. When administered early in life, it also appears to improve cognitive ability. This could partly be why more young adults with the syndrome are graduating from high school. Afterward, though, they\u2019re often stuck. They can\u2019t go away to college, because food is everywhere there. Likewise, it is almost impossible to find a job at which there isn\u2019t, at the very least, access to an employee fridge \u2014 and they can\u2019t be allowed to manage money, because they can use it to buy food. There are a few adult group homes around the country equipped to manage the disorder, but not enough to meet demand. Noah Thorner, who is 23, graduated from high school with honors and now lives with his parents. In lieu of a steady job, he makes wooden toys that he sells on Etsy. Finding friends has been difficult. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see people eating,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd I realize that I can\u2019t participate, and that\u2019s really hard.\u201d", "Another young high-school graduate, Rachel Crowley, attends community-\u00adcollege classes while her mother, Debra, waits outside to prevent her from straying to the vending machines or campus cafe. \u201cShe\u2019s a great candidate for someone who could have her own apartment,\u201d Debra says, \u201cbut she can\u2019t prepare her own food \u2014 that\u2019s the main stumbling block. We\u2019re hoping some of these new medications they\u2019re researching could open that door for her.\u201d But questions remain about whether even a miracle drug would be enough to safeguard against a fatal binge: What if it doesn\u2019t work perfectly? What if, one day, a person forgets to take it? \u201cIt gets exhausting trying to keep your daughter in the world, but a world that just doesn\u2019t get it,\u201d Duane DiCola, the father of Danielle, one of the girls in \u00adRachelle\u2019s\u00ad program, told me. \u201cWe really struggled with \u2018No, my child is different.'\u2009\u201d", "Thirty-four days after she dropped off her daughter, Rhoda flew to Pittsburgh for a visit. She would stay for 10 days \u2014 in housing offered by the institute \u2014 and attend meetings to help prepare for Rachelle\u2019s return home. When she arrived, her daughter was waiting for her almost shyly by the door. She had lost 18 pounds and was wearing an olive outfit her grandmother had sent her. A nurse had cornrowed her hair. Rhoda kissed her and petted her cheeks. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d she said. \u201cWho is this pretty girl?\u201d", "It was lunchtime on a Sunday. Rachelle led her mother to the rec room, and Rhoda sat near her table to watch her eat. On her tray was sliced turkey breast, steamed cauliflower, a salad, sweet potatoes and cucumbers; a carton of skim milk; a cup of decaffeinated coffee; a cup of Crystal Light; a packet of Splenda, ketchup, salad dressing and Mrs. Dash seasoning; and a cup of sugar-\u00adfree Jell-O. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize they needed all this other stuff to go with it,\u201d Rhoda said.", "In thinking about how she had managed Rachelle\u2019s illness so far, Rhoda told me, she graded herself 65 out of 100. But she believed she recognized where she went wrong. \u201cShe\u2019ll have a big bag of nuts,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew nuts were high in calories, but I was looking at the sugar. Now I\u2019m like, that was a horrible choice. Planning would be the way to avoid that. Those slip-ups add up. If I had not been slipping up, she would not have gained that weight.\u201d Rhoda had never met anyone else with Prader-\u00adWilli before, and as Rachelle ate, she surveyed the room. Some of the patients were as heavy as Rachelle, but others were barely overweight. Nearby, Danielle was chatting about Disney movies. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even know anything was wrong,\u201d Rhoda said.", "The next morning, Cherpes, Heather Roach, the program psychologist, and Amy McTighe, the program teacher, took part in a conference call with the director of special education for the Lowndes County school system, where Rachelle is a student. The administrator seemed mostly agreeable to the recommendations they offered, but when Roach suggested celebrating holidays and other events without food, the administrator balked.", "\u201cRealize this is South Georgia,\u201d she said, before quickly adding, \u201cBut if we could teach all of us not to celebrate events with food, we\u2019d be better off.\u201d", "Still, she suggested that Rhoda simply keep her daughter at home on the half days before school breaks, when cake and candy were rampant. McTighe and Roach shook their heads at the phone. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking it\u2019s best that the accommodation happen at school, rather than her having to stay home,\u201d McTighe said.", "Later, Roach explained to Rhoda that if her daughter veered off her dietary schedule, even once, not only would she be ingesting calories she couldn\u2019t afford, but the exception would become an expectation. If a family member slipped her a treat, for instance, she would probably throw tantrums wanting to see that person again. Spontaneity would be impossible. If Rhoda wanted to take the family to a restaurant, she would need to tell Rachelle several days in advance where they were going and exactly what she would be having there; she would need to speak to the servers and ask that they not put breadsticks on the table or offer specials or sodas or desserts; and if Rachelle acted out, Rhoda would need to be prepared to leave and try again another time.", "Rhoda nodded and jotted notes on a sheet of loose-leaf paper. \u201cRegarding the movies,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat is the action to get past the concession stand?\u201d", "Almost a month later, on Rachelle\u2019s second-to-last day at the Children\u2019s Institute, Cherpes found her in the rec room. Rhoda was coming to take her home, and she was too distracted to cut ads or color. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mom?\u201d she kept asking.", "\u201cShe\u2019s going to get here, don\u2019t worry,\u201d said her tablemate, Lana Aliff, a motherly 19-year-old from West Virginia.", "Rachelle put her head down on her arm. \u201cAirplane \u2014 you hear it?\u201d she said. \u201cI think I hear it in the sky.\u201d", "Cherpes asked her if she would come chat with him. As she followed him to a private meeting room, her gait was noticeably quicker. She had lost just over 30 pounds and was off insulin. She had also begun to say more, probably in part because her brain was getting more oxygen. They sat at a table, and Cherpes asked Rachelle if she was excited about going home. She nodded. He started to explain that her mom would be doing some things differently.", "\u201cI don\u2019t like boys,\u201d Rachelle said, changing the subject. \u201cBoys at my school laugh at me.\u201d", "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t feel very good, does it?\u201d Cherpes said.", "\u201cBoys tell me I\u2019m fat. Fat and ugly.\u201d", "\u201cDo you feel fat and ugly?\u201d", "\u201cNo.\u201d", "Cherpes suggested ignoring the boys and telling her teacher. Rachelle just kept repeating the problem: \u201cThey don\u2019t stop. Call me names.\u201d", "\u201cIt gets kind of hard not to cry sometimes,\u201d Cherpes said after she left.", "If Rachelle had said she did feel fat and ugly, he said, he would have pointed out how much she had changed \u2014 something she could control: \u201cWhat would you like to do that you can\u2019t do? Well, just a couple weeks ago you couldn\u2019t walk down the hall.\u201d Now she could walk for 30 minutes on the treadmill.", "That evening, at dinnertime, Rachelle heard the doorbell and speed-walked \u2014 she still couldn\u2019t run \u2014 toward the door. \u201cMama, guess what?\u201d she said when Rhoda greeted her. \u201cI lost some weight!\u201d", "\u201cI know you did,\u201d Rhoda said, cupping her face. \u201cYou did teenager college like a champ.\u201d", "Rhoda debriefed with Cherpes and the rest of the staff the next morning. She and Raquel had cooked meals for the week. Rhoda had found an inexpensive gym membership for her and her daughters and discovered cheap frozen vegetables at Walmart. She had tried, via Facebook, to implore her relatives again not to eat in front of Rachelle or sneak her even seemingly healthful snacks.", "As she went to collect Rachelle for the airport, though, Rhoda just hoped she could make it home without her daughter melting down over all the available food she would see. In the rec room, Rachelle was starting lunch. Once the trays were passed out, Roach, the psychologist, waved a certificate. \u201cIt\u2019s Rachelle\u2019s last day today, and I want to give her her physical-\u00adtherapy award,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has done 65 days of P.T.! Congratulations, Rachelle!\u201d", "Everyone clapped. Rachelle, sandwich in hand, froze. Then the corners of her mouth dropped, and tears ran down her cheeks. As if unsure what to do, she took a bite. Rhoda leaned over her with a napkin and dabbed her face. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go home?\u201d she whispered. Rachelle shook her head from side to side. Soon, Rhoda\u2019s eyeliner was running, and she was using the napkins herself.", "Alexandra gave Rachelle a high-five. \u201cHave a good time, O.K.?\u201d she said. Lana pressed a goodbye card that all the patients had signed into her hand. Rachelle clutched the pink envelope, unopened, all the way to the airport.", "Later, I asked Rhoda why she thought Rachelle had become tearful. \u201cI think she was emotional because she was like, \u2018I\u2019m in a place where there\u2019s other people like me.\u2019 They have this understanding among themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she felt anxiety about going back into the real world. That\u2019s why I started crying, because that\u2019s what I thought she might be thinking. It was just her own little world there, and she was happy.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/magazine/black-mirror-and-the-horrors-and-delights-of-technology.html": ["One of the most disturbing moments in the British TV series \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is what appears to be a passionate love scene.

As the encounter progresses, it is revealed that the couple are actually having dull and mechanical sex, their eyes grayed out as they both tune into their grains to watch memories of their previous trysts, from an earlier, steamier time in their relationship.", "Each episode of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d \u2014 named for the way our screens look while powered down \u2014 paints a different nightmarescape of a future gone technologically awry. In one episode, for example, a woman uses a mail-order kit to create a golem of her deceased boyfriend using his social-media profiles. Another follows an obnoxious cartoon character as he becomes a powerful political figure after performing a series of public stunts. Still another imagines a post-peak-oil future, wherein people generate energy and currency by pedaling on stationary bikes, and the only escape from the drudgery is reality-show fame. The show feels like required viewing for our always connected, device-augmented lives.", "Despite all the recent hype, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d isn\u2019t a new show at all. Its first season was broadcast in Britain in 2011, but it\u2019s enjoying a new surge of interest in the United States since it began streaming on Netflix in December. It wasn\u2019t widely advertised; its growing popularity is fueled by references to it on Twitter and Facebook, screenshots posted to Tumblr and the like.", "That the show probably owes its American stature to social media is perfectly appropriate, because the series fixates on our codependent and contradictory relationship with technology and media. We love being able to share our inner monologues and the minutia of our lives with one another, until, that is, it all goes horribly wrong in ways previously unimaginable. Or even if it doesn\u2019t, we still find ourselves annoyed, jealous, infuriated and even depressed by the behavior of others (and occasionally ourselves) online. And yet we keep logging on.", "The show quickly went from crossover hit to something America seems keen to co-opt. Robert Downey Jr. purchased the rights to the episode described above, in which people use implants to tape their memories, called \u201cThe Entire History of You.\u201d Jon Hamm sought out the show\u2019s creators for a meeting and eventually guest-starred on a special holiday episode called \u201cWhite Christmas.\u201d It\u2019s hard to say exactly how many people have watched the show, because Netflix declined to share that data, but Charlie Brooker, one of the creators, said the uptick was noticeable, even from London. \u201cIt had made some kind of impact,\u201d he said in a recent phone interview.

Hollywood offers little between the horror of dystopia and the wonder of a trip to Q\u2019s laboratory.", "This problem persists in movies that are set on a more human scale and that actually imagine the near future of consumer technologies. \u201cHer,\u201d for example, the sweet romantic comedy about a lonely man falling in love with his operating system, focuses more on the male protagonist\u2019s inability to connect with other humans than the implications of unleashing such powerful programs on the world. Similarly, \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d Mike Judge\u2019s comedy series on HBO, prefers to make caricatures out of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists but not their creation, which is comically arcane: a video-compression algorithm.", "Occasionally, of course, Hollywood does dig deeper. \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix\u201d and \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d all stand out as excellent cautionary tales about the way humans can lose control over their inventions.

Europe and Britain have a richer tradition of lashing back at emerging technologies, especially those they (rightly) view as American technocultural imperialism. Germany, for example, has long warred with Google, Amazon and Uber over business practices, data-collection habits and freewheeling growth tactics that often circumvent regulation and longstanding rules. Technology is one of America\u2019s most important exports, and, as the Snowden disclosures revealed, the widespread adoption of Silicon Valley products allowed our government to surveil the world\u2019s communications. In the aftermath of the exposure of the National Security Agency\u2019s extensive spying network, lawmakers in Brazil, Japan, India and Russia pushed for new laws and cyber infrastructure intended to thwart American snooping.", "In America, we treat the release of each new Apple product with the reverence usually reserved for pop icons. The sly ingenuity of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is that it nails down our love for the same devices we blame for our psychological torment. Brooker understands that even as we swear off tweeting and promise to stop Googling our exes, our phones are still the last things we see before falling asleep and the first things we reach for when we awaken.", "To that end, the gadgets in \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d including the creepy memory-recording devices, look sleek enough to want, which is perhaps the show\u2019s cleverest trick. It is impossible to watch the show and not idly fantasize about having access to some of the services and systems they use, even as you see them used in horrifying ways. (You might not feel this way about, say, \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d) Most television shows and movies can\u2019t even correctly portray the standard interfaces that we use to browse the Web, send a text message or make a voice call, let alone design them in a desirable way.", "\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d resonates because the show manages to exhibit caution about the role of technology without diminishing its importance and novelty, functioning as a twisted View-Master of many different future universes where things have strayed horribly off-course.

Real-world events like the Snowden leaks and even the Sony email hacks may give us the chills, but they weren\u2019t enough to persuade us to change our behavior or demand more from the companies we rely on to send risqu\u00e9 photos and store our personal communications. And perhaps that\u2019s the true appeal of the series: It does more than blame technology for our woes. It deals with the reality that, no matter what gadgetry we may possess, our problems remain human.

What gives it momentum is the audience\u2019s gradual discovery of the dynamic between the two women, a daily cycle of ritual and release.", "The rules seem clear enough at first. Evelyn, dark haired and nervous, with trusting eyes and a tremor in her voice, is the servant whose eagerness to please is met with coldness, and whose slightest lapses are severely punished. Cynthia, when her research is interrupted, responds with haughty weariness or outright cruelty to Evelyn\u2019s timid attempts at kindness. She is the boss, and Evelyn is happy to be subjected to her whims and her discipline.", "Except that, as it turns out, Cynthia is herself acting out Evelyn\u2019s instructions, which are neatly written on notecards or whispered like prompts from backstage. Cynthia finds it increasingly lonely at the top, as her complete obedience to Evelyn\u2019s demands leaves her weary and frustrated. Evelyn, meanwhile, wants more and more, pushing herself and her partner toward extremes of subjugation and rebelling when her yearnings are unsatisfied. She persuades Cynthia to tie her up and lock her in a chest overnight and then jolts her awake with a keening safe word. (The word is \u201cpinastri,\u201d by the way. Go ahead and Google; all the images are safe for work, though if you\u2019re a moth you might feel a little uncomfortable.)", "There is exaggeration and a trace of sly humor in the set design, the costumes, the sometimes jarringly jaunty music and the trembling close-ups of leaves, bugs and water. There is also a sense of surrealist sexual comedy in the way Evelyn and Cynthia\u2019s exchanges of power are performed. But in the end there is nothing especially campy about \u201cThe Duke of Burgundy,\u201d which neither mocks its heroines nor the breathless, naughty screen tradition to which they belong.

What is more, one of those very generals, Thein Sein, who ran the old junta, is now not only Myanmar\u2019s president, but also the architect of the country\u2019s unexpected and quite ambitious reform agenda. As such, he was conveniently removed from the list so that, as the country made its volte-face \u2014 releasing political prisoners, abandoning press censorship and seeking to restore constitutional government \u2014 he was eligible to meet with President Obama and Secretaries of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry.", "Yet because many other former military leaders and businessmen who worked together under the junta remain on the list, Myanmar confronts a unique problem: How can the new government successfully promote development and fully enter the global economy when so many of its biggest commercial players are sidelined?", "The American ambassador to Myanmar, Derek J.

Composed of some 12 properties in all, the chain includes some of Myanmar\u2019s best-known hotels and resorts, from the elegant Kandawgyi Palace in Yangon and the Popa Mountain Resort near Bagan to the singular Malikha Lodge in Putao. Even as many large hotel chains like Hilton and Shangri-la are now clamoring to open properties in Myanmar and are changing the chemistry of visiting this once-languid backwater, for now one could hardly do better as a visitor than to simply travel from one of these properties to another like a Franciscan friar making his way up the California coast by stopping one after another at Spanish missions.", "Despite their indelibly authoritarian provenance, Myanmar\u2019s generals did unexpectedly, and very counterintuitively, begin reforming their own government in 2011. It was a stunning about-face that caught almost everyone off guard. While they remain very much in transition with the outcome of their efforts still uncertain, what is everywhere evident to any of the growing number of visitors to the country is Myanmar\u2019s enduring physical beauty, rich and largely Buddhist culture and extremely open and warm-hearted people (attacks by Buddhist extremists against Muslims in Rakhine State notwithstanding).", "What is more, unlike other popular Asian tourist destinations such as China, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea, which have increasingly become theme-park-like experiences leeched of authenticity, in Myanmar it is still possible for visitors to become lost in a culturally varied and vibrant indigenous society that has yet to become a commercially mummified simulacrum of its former self.", "But for now, strolling through the beguiling small town of Mulashidi, just outside the gates of the Malikha Lodge, laid out well over a half century ago by J.

More than a decade earlier, with a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Harvard, Seung made a dramatic career switch into neuroscience, a gamble that seemed to be paying off. He had earned tenure from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a year faster than the norm and was immediately named a full professor, an unusual move that reflected the sense that Seung was something of a superstar. His lab was underwritten with generous funding by the elite Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He was a popular teacher who traveled the world \u2014 Zurich; Seoul, South Korea; Palo Alto, Calif. \u2014 delivering lectures on his mathematical theories of how neurons might be wired together to form the engines of thought.", "And yet Seung, a man so naturally exuberant that he was known for staging ad hoc dance performances with Harvard Square\u2019s street musicians, was growing increasingly depressed. He and his colleagues spent their days arguing over how the brain might function, but science offered no way to scan it for the answers. \u201cIt seemed like decades could go by,\u201d Seung told me recently, \u201cand you would never know one way or another whether any of the theories were correct.\u201d", "That November, Seung sought the advice of David Tank, a mentor he met at Bell Laboratories who was attending the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, in Washington. Over lunch in the dowdy dining room of a nearby hotel, Tank advised a radical cure. A former colleague in Heidelberg, Germany, had just built a device that imaged brain tissue with enough resolution to make out the connections between individual neurons. But drawing even a tiny wiring diagram required herculean efforts, as people traced the course of neurons through thousands of blurry black-and-white images. What the field needed, Tank said, was a computer program that could trace them automatically \u2014 a way to map the brain\u2019s connections by the millions, opening a new area of scientific discovery. For Seung to tackle the problem, though, it would mean abandoning the work that had propelled him to the top of his discipline in favor of a highly speculative engineering project.", "Back in Cambridge, Seung spoke with two of his graduate students, who, like everyone else in the lab, thought the idea was terrible. Over the next few weeks, as the three of them talked and argued, Seung became convinced that the Heidelberg project was bound to be more interesting, and ultimately less risky, than continuing with the theoretical work he had lost faith in. \u201cMake sure your passports are ready,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWe are going to Germany next month.\u201d", "Seung and his two students spent a good part of January 2006 in Germany, learning the finicky ways of high-resolution brain-image analysis from Winfried Denk, the scientist who built the device. The three returned to M.I.T. invigorated, but Seung\u2019s decision looked, for quite a while, like an act of career suicide. Colleagues at M.I.T. whispered that Seung had gone off the rails, and in the more snobbish circles of theoretical neuroscience, the engineering project was seen as, in Seung\u2019s words, \u201ctoo blue-collar.\u201d In 2010, the Hughes institute pulled the money that funded his lab, and he had to scramble. When his wife went into labor with their daughter in the middle of the night, he was working on a grant application; he wound up staying awake for 36 hours straight. (\u201cScience,\u201d Einstein once wrote, \u201cis a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one\u2019s living at it.\u201d) As the years passed, the advances out of the Seung lab were met with indifference, which was particularly hard on his graduate students. \u201cEvery time they had a success, they were depressed about it, because everyone else thought it was dumb,\u201d Seung said. \u201cIt killed me.\u201d", "Last spring, eight years after he and his students packed a computer workstation into a piece of luggage and headed to Heidelberg, Seung published a paper in the prestigious journal Nature, demonstrating how the brain\u2019s neural connections can be mapped \u2014 and discoveries made \u2014 using an ingenious mix of artificial intelligence and a competitive online game. Seung has also become the leading proponent of a plan, which he described in a 2012 book, to create a wiring diagram of all 100 trillion connections between the neurons of the human brain, an unimaginably vast and complex network known as the connectome.", "The race to map the connectome has hardly left the starting line, with only modest funding from the federal government and initial experiments confined to the brains of laboratory animals like fruit flies and mice. But it\u2019s an endeavor heavy with moral and philosophical implications, because to map a human connectome would be, Seung has argued, to capture a person\u2019s very essence: every memory, every skill, every passion. When the brain isn\u2019t wired properly, it can lead to disorders like autism and schizophrenia \u2014 \u201cconnectopathies\u201d that could be revealed in the map, perhaps suggesting treatments. And if science were to gain the power to record and store connectomes, then it would be natural to speculate, as Seung and others have, that technology might some day enable a recording to play again, thereby reanimating a human consciousness. The mapping of connectomes, its most zealous proponents believe, would confer nothing less than immortality.", "Last year, Seung was lured away from M.I.T. to join the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Princeton\u2019s Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics. These days, Seung, who is 48, has an office down the hall from his mentor Tank at the institute, a white building with strips of wraparound glazing that opened last year on the campus\u2019s forested southern fringe. Outside Seung\u2019s first-floor window are athletic fields, where afternoon pickup games of soccer occasionally lure him away. A few boxes lie around, half unpacked. Near a sycamore-veneer built-in desk designed by the building\u2019s architect sits a jumbo jar of mixed nuts from Costco, a habit he picked up from his father, a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas, Austin. With connectome mapping, Seung explained last month, it is possible to start answering questions that theorists have puzzled over for decades, including the ones that prompted him to put aside his own work in frustration. He is planning, among other things, to prove that he can find a specific memory in the brain of a mouse and show how neural connections sustain it. \u201cI am going back to settle old scores,\u201d he said.", "In 1946, the Argentine man of letters Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short story about an empire, unnamed, that set out to construct a perfect map of its territory. A series of maps were drawn, only to be put aside in favor of more ambitious maps. Eventually, Borges wrote, \u201cthe Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast map was Useless, and .\u2009.\u2009. delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters.\u201d", "With time, Borges\u2019s cautionary parable has become even more relevant for the would-be cartographers of the world, Seung among them. Technological progress has always brought novel ways of seeing the natural world and thus new ways of mapping it. The telescope was what allowed Galileo to sketch, in his book \u201cThe Starry Messenger,\u201d a first map of Jupiter\u2019s largest moons. The invention of the microscope, sometime in the late 16th century, led to Robert Hooke\u2019s famous depiction of a flea, its body armored and spiked, as well as the discovery of the cell, an alien world unto itself. Today the pace of invention and the raw power of technology are shocking: A Nobel Prize was awarded last fall for the creation of a microscope with a resolution so extreme that it seems to defy the physical constraints of light itself.", "What has made the early 21st century a particularly giddy moment for scientific mapmakers, though, is the precipitous rise of information technology. Advances in computers have provided a cheap means to collect and analyze huge volumes of data, and Moore\u2019s Law, which predicts regular doublings in computing power, has shown little sign of flagging. Just as important is the fact that machines can now do the grunt work of research automatically, handling samples, measuring and recording data. Set up a robotic system, feed the data to the cloud and the map will practically draw itself. It\u2019s easy to forget Borges\u2019s caution: The question is not whether a map can be made, but what insights it will bring. Will future generations cherish a cartographer\u2019s work or shake their heads and deliver it up to the inclemencies?", "The ur-map of this big science is the one produced by the Human Genome Project, a stem-to-stern accounting of the DNA that provides every cell\u2019s genetic instructions. The genome project was completed faster than anyone expected, thanks to Moore\u2019s Law, and has become an essential scientific tool. In its wake have come a proliferation of projects in the same vein \u2014 the proteome (proteins), the foldome (folding of proteins) \u2014 each promising a complete description of something or other. (One online listing includes the antiome: \u201cThe totality of people who object to the propagation of omes.\u201d) The Brain Initiative, the United States government\u2019s 12-year, $4.5 billion brain-mapping effort, is a conscious echo of the genome project, but neuroscientists find themselves in a far more tenuous position at the outset. The brain might be mapped in a host of ways, and the initiative is pursuing many at once. In fact, Seung and his colleagues, who are receiving some of the funding, are working at the margins of contemporary neuroscience. Much of the field\u2019s most exciting new technology has sought to track the brain\u2019s activity \u2014 like functional M.R.I., with its images of parts of the brain \u201clighting up\u201d \u2014 while the connectome would map the brain\u2019s physical structure.", "To explain what he finds so compelling about the substance of the brain, Seung points to stories of near death. In May 1999, a young doctor named Anna Bagenholm was skiing down a ravine near the Arctic Circle in Norway when a rock snagged her skis, spinning her halfway around and knocking her onto her back. She sped headfirst down the slope, still on her skis, toward a stream covered with ice. It was a sunny day, unusually warm, and when she hit the ice, she went straight through. Rushing meltwater ballooned her clothes and dragged her farther under the ice. She found an air pocket, and her friends fought to free her, but the current was too strong and the ice too hard. They gripped her feet so they wouldn\u2019t lose her. Bagenholm\u2019s body went limp. Her heart stopped.", "By the time a mountain-rescue team freed her, pulling her body through a hole they cut downstream, she had been under for more than an hour. At that point she was clinically dead. The rescue team began CPR, winched her up into a waiting helicopter and ferried her to Tromso University Hospital, a one-hour flight, her body still showing no signs of life. Her temperature measured 57 degrees. Doctors slowly warmed her, and suddenly her heart started. She spent a month in intensive care but recovered remarkably well. Months later, Bagenholm returned to work and was even skiing again.", "What preserved Bagenholm\u2019s memories and abilities, over hours, in a state of clinical death? Scientists believe that every thought, every sensation, is a set of tiny electrical impulses coursing through the brain\u2019s interconnected neurons. But when a little girl learns a word, for example, her brain makes a record by altering the connections themselves. When she learns to ride a bike or sing \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d a new constellation of connections takes shape. As she grows, every memory \u2014 a friend\u2019s name, the feel of skis on virgin powder, a Beethoven sonata \u2014 is recorded this way. Taken together, these connections constitute her connectome, the brain\u2019s permanent record of her personality, talents, intelligence, memories: the sum of all that constitutes her \u201cself.\u201d Even after the cold arrested Bagenholm\u2019s heart and hushed her crackling neuronal net to a whisper, the connectome endured.", "What makes the connectome\u2019s relationship to our identity so difficult to understand, Seung told me, is that we associate our \u201cself\u201d with motion. We walk. We sing. We experience thoughts and feelings that bloom into consciousness and then fade. \u201cPsyche\u201d is derived from the Greek \u201cto blow,\u201d evoking the vital breath that defines life. \u201cIt seems like a fallacy to talk about our self as some wiring diagram that doesn\u2019t change very quickly,\u201d Seung said. \u201cThe connectome is just meat, and people rebel at that.\u201d", "Seung told me to imagine a river, the roiling waters of the Colorado. That, he said, is our experience from moment to moment. Over time, the water leaves its mark on the riverbed, widening bends, tracing patterns in the rock and soil. In a sense, the Grand Canyon is a memory of where the Colorado has been. And of course, that riverbed shapes the flow of the waters today. There are two selves then, river and riverbed. The river is all tumult and drama. The river demands attention. Yet it\u2019s the riverbed that Seung wants to know.", "When Seung was just shy of his 5th birthday, his father took him to their local barbershop, a screen-door joint in Austin where the vending machine served Coke in bottles. While Seung\u2019s father was getting his hair cut, the barber stopped and pointed out an endearing scene: Little Sebastian was pretending to read the paper. \u201cNo,\u201d his father said, \u201cI think he\u2019s really reading it.\u201d The barber went over to investigate, and sure enough, the boy was happy to explain what was happening that day in The Austin American-\u00adStatesman. Seung had taught himself to read, in part by asking his father to call out store names and street signs. At 5, he told his father \u2014 a man who escaped North Korea on his own as a teenager \u2014 that he would no longer be needing toys for Christmas.", "Growing up, Seung\u2019s primary passions were soccer, mathematics and nonfiction (with an exception made for Greek myths). As a teenager, he was inspired by Carl Sagan\u2019s \u201cCosmos.\u201d He took graduate-level physics courses as a 17-year-old Harvard sophomore and went directly into Harvard\u2019s Ph.D. program in theoretical physics. During a 1989 summer internship at Bell Laboratories, though, Seung fell under the spell of a gregarious Israeli named Haim Sompolinsky, who introduced him to a problem in theoretical neuroscience: How can a network of neurons generate something like an \u201cAha!\u201d moment, when learning leads to sudden understanding. This brought Seung to his own \u201cAha!\u201d moment: At the fuzzy border between neuroscience and mathematics, he spied a new scientific terrain, thrilling and largely unexplored, giving him the same feeling physicists must have had when the atom first began to yield its secrets.", "Seung became part of a cadre of physicists who deployed sophisticated mathematical techniques to develop an idea dating back as far as Plato and Aristotle, that meaning emerges from the links between things \u2014 in this case, the links between neurons. In the 19th century, William James and other psychologists articulated mental processes as associations; for example, seeing a Labrador retriever prompts thoughts of a childhood pet, which leads to musings about a friend who lived next door. As the century closed, the Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal was creating illustrations of neurons \u2014 long, slim stems and spectacular branches that connected to other neurons with long stems of their own \u2014 when people began to wonder whether they were seeing the physical pathways of thought itself.", "The next turn came in more recent decades as a cross-disciplinary group of researchers, including Seung, hit on a new way of thinking that is described as connectionism. The basic idea (which borrows from computer science) is that simple units, connected in the right way, can give rise to surprising abilities (memory, recognition, reasoning). In computer chips, transistors and other basic electronic components are wired together to make powerful processors. In the brain, neurons are wired together \u2014 and rewired. Every time a girl sees her dog (wagging tail, chocolate brown fur), a certain set of neurons fire; this churn of activity is like Seung\u2019s Colorado River. When these neurons fire together, the connections between them grow stronger, forming a memory \u2014 a part of Seung\u2019s riverbed, the connectome that shapes thought. The notion is deeply counterintuitive: It\u2019s natural to think of a network functioning as a river system does, a set of streams that can carry messages, but downright odd to suggest that there are parts of the riverbed that encode \u201cLabrador retriever.\u201d", "A typical human neuron has thousands of connections; a neuron can be as narrow as one ten-thousandth of a millimeter and yet stretch from one side of the head to the other. Only once have scientists ever managed to map the complete wiring diagram of an animal \u2014 a transparent worm called C. elegans, one millimeter long with just 302 neurons \u2014 and the work required a stunning display of resolve. Beginning in 1970 and led by the South African Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner, it involved painstakingly slicing the worm into thousands of sections, each one-thousandth the width of a human hair, to be photographed under an electron microscope.", "That was the easy part. To pull a wiring diagram from the stack of images required identifying each neuron and then following it through the sections, a task akin to tracing the full length of every strand of pasta in a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, using pens and thousands of blurry black-and-white photos. For C. elegans, this process alone consumed more than a dozen years. When Seung started, he estimated that it would take a single tracer roughly a million years to finish a cubic millimeter of human cortex \u2014 meaning that tracing an entire human brain would consume roughly one trillion years of labor. He would need a little help.", "In 2012, Seung started EyeWire, an online game that challenges the public to trace neuronal wiring \u2014 now using computers, not pens \u2014 in the retina of a mouse\u2019s eye. Seung\u2019s artificial-\u00adintelligence algorithms process the raw images, then players earn points as they mark, paint-by-numbers style, the branches of a neuron through a three-dimensional cube. The game has attracted 165,000 players in 164 countries. In effect, Seung is employing artificial intelligence as a force multiplier for a global, all-volunteer army that has included Lorinda, a Missouri grandmother who also paints watercolors, and Iliyan (a.k.a. @crazyman4865), a high-school student in Bulgaria who once played for nearly 24 hours straight. Computers do what they can and then leave the rest to what remains the most potent pattern-recognition technology ever discovered: the human brain.", "Ultimately, Seung still hopes that artificial intelligence will be able to handle the entire job. But in the meantime, he is working to recruit more help. In August, South Korea\u2019s largest telecom company announced a partnership with EyeWire, running nationwide ads to bring in more players. In the next few years, Seung hopes to go bigger by enticing a company to turn EyeWire into a game with characters and a story line that people play purely for fun. \u201cThink of what we could do,\u201d Seung said, \u201cif we could capture even a small fraction of the mental effort that goes into Angry Birds.\u201d", "The Janelia Research Campus features a serpentine \u201clandscape building\u201d constructed into the side of a hill northwest of Washington. The facility, funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, is nearly 1,000 feet long, and most of the exterior walls are glass, the unusual design a result of a \u201cview preservation\u201d stricture put in place in perpetuity by the previous owners of the land. From the top of the hill, you can see little sign of the $500 million building, except for a pair of humming silver exhaust silos and a modest glass entryway, all rising inexplicably from a field of wild grasses where plovers have begun to nest.", "Over the summer, I went to Janelia to meet Seung, who wore a gray polo shirt, blue shorts and a pair of Crocs. He was there to talk about possible collaborations and learn about the technology that others in the field are developing. Inside, he introduced me to Harald Hess, an acknowledged genius at creating new scientific tools. (Hess helped build a prototype in his living room of the extreme-resolution microscope \u2014 the one that earned a longtime colleague a Nobel this year.) Hess led us down a wide, arcing service corridor, the ceiling hung with exposed pipes, the wall lined with pallets of fruit-fly food. He unlocked a door and then ushered Seung into a room with white plastic curtains hanging from the 20-foot ceilings. He parted one with a kshreeek of releasing Velcro and said, \u201cThis is our \u2018act of God'-proof room.\u201d", "The room contained a pair of hulking beige devices, labeled \u201cMERLIN\u201d in black letters \u2014 each part of a new brain-imaging system. The system combines slicing and imaging: An electron microscope takes a picture of the brain sample from above, then a beam of ions moves across the top, vaporizing material and revealing the next layer of brain tissue for the microscope. It is, however, a \u201ctemperature-\u00adsensitive beast,\u201d said Shan Xu, a scientist at Janelia. If the room warms by even a fraction of a degree, the metal can expand imperceptibly, skewing the ion beam, wrecking the sample and forcing the team to start over. Xu was once within days of completing a monthslong run when a July heat wave caused the air-\u00adconditioning to hiccup. All the work was lost. Xu has since designed elaborate fail-safes, including a system that can (and does) wake him up in the middle of the night; Janelia has also invested several hundred thousand dollars in backup climate control. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned more about utilities than you would ever want to know,\u201d Hess said.", "Here at Janelia, connectome science will face its most demanding test. Gerry Rubin, Janelia\u2019s director, said his team hopes to have a complete catalog of high-resolution images\u00ad of the fruit-fly brain in a year or two and a completely traced wiring diagram within a decade. Rubin is a veteran of genome mapping and saw how technological advances enabled a project that critics originally derided as prohibitively difficult and expensive. He is betting that the story of the connectome will follow the same arc. Ken Hayworth, a scientist in Hess\u2019s lab, is developing a way to cleanly cut larger brains into cubes; he calls it \u201cthe hot knife.\u201d In other labs, Jeff Lichtman of Harvard and Clay Reid of the Allen Institute for Brain Science are building their own ultrafast imaging systems. Denk, Seung\u2019s longtime collaborator in Heidelberg, is working on a new device to slice and image a mouse\u2019s entire brain, a volume orders of magnitude larger than what has been tried to date. Seung, meanwhile, is improving his tracing software and setting up new experiments \u2014 with his mentor Tank and Richard Axel, a Nobel laureate at Columbia \u2014 to find memories in the connectome. Still, Rubin admitted, \u201cif we can\u2019t do the fly in 10 years, there is no prayer for the field.\u201d", "At the end of a long day, Seung and I sat on a pair of blue bar stools, sharing some peanuts and sipping on beers at Janelia\u2019s in-house watering hole. Seung was feeling daunted. Even at Janelia, which plans to spend roughly $50 million and has some of the best tool-builders on the planet, the connectome of a fruit fly looks to be a decade away. A fruit fly! Will he live to see the first human connectome? \u201cIt could be possible,\u201d he said, \u201cif we assume that I exercise and eat right.\u201d", "Years ago, Seung officiated at his best friend\u2019s wedding, and during the invocation he told the gathering, \u201cMy father says that success is never achieved in just one generation.\u201d As he has grown older and had a child of his own, he has felt his perspective shift. When Seung was in his 20s, science for him was solving puzzles, an extension of the math problems he did for fun as a child alone in his room on Saturdays after soccer. Now he finds great satisfaction in encouraging younger scientists, in helping them avoid dead ends that he has already explored. He wants to do something that will allow the community to progress, to build \u201cstrong foundations, steppingstones that the next generation can be sure of.\u201d", "The grounds of Janelia have a monastic feel, and while talking with Seung, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of the people who built Europe\u2019s great cathedrals \u2014 the carpenters and masons who labored knowing that the work would not be completed until after their deaths. From the bar, we could see through a glass wall to a patio lined with smooth river rocks and a fieldstone wall. A spare shrub garden was set with a trickling stainless-\u00adsteel fountain, illuminated by a bank of sapphire lights. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ll accomplish in my lifetime,\u201d Seung said. \u201cBut the brain is mysterious, and I want to spend my life in the presence of mystery. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d", "As connectomics has gained traction, though, there are the first hints that it may be of interest to more than just monkish academics. In September, at a Brain Initiative conference in the Eisenhower building on the White House grounds, it was announced that Google had started its own connectome project. Tom Dean, a Google research scientist and the former chairman of the Brown University computer-science department, told me he has been assembling a team to improve the artificial intelligence: four engineers in Mountain View, Calif., and a group based in Seattle. To begin, Dean said, Google will be working most closely with the Allen Institute, which is trying to understand how the brain of a mouse processes images from the eye. Yet Dean said they also want to serve as a clearinghouse for Seung and others, applying different variations of artificial intelligence to brain imagery coming out of different labs, to see what works best. Eventually, Dean said, he hopes for a Google Earth of the brain, weaving together many different kinds of maps, across many scales, allowing scientists to behold an entire brain and then zoom in to see the firing of a single neuron, \u201clike lightning in a thunderstorm.\u201d", "It\u2019s possible now to see a virtuous cycle that could build the connectome. The artificial intelligence used at Google, and in EyeWire, is known as deep learning because it takes its central principles from the way networks of neurons function. Over the last few years, deep learning has become a precious commercial tool, bringing unexpected leaps in image and voice recognition, and now it is being deployed to map the brain. This could, in the coming decades, lead to more insights about neural networks, improving deep learning itself \u2014 the premise of a new project funded by Iarpa, a blue-sky research arm of the American intelligence community, and perhaps one reason for Google\u2019s interest. Better deep learning, in turn, could be used to accelerate the mapping and understanding of the brain, and so on.", "Even so, the shadow of Borges remains. The first connectome project began in the 1960s with the same intuition that later drove Seung: Sydney Brenner wanted a way to understand how behavior emerges from a biological system and thought that having a complete map of an animal\u2019s nervous system would be essential. Brenner settled on the worm C. elegans for simplicity\u2019s sake; it is small and prospers in a laboratory dish. The results were published in 1986 at book length, taking over the entirety of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, science\u2019s oldest journal, the outlet for a young Isaac Newton. Biologists were electrified and still sometimes refer to that 340-page edition of the journal as \u201cthe book.\u201d", "Yet nearly three decades later, Brenner\u2019s diagram continues to mystify. Scientists know roughly what individual neurons in C. elegans do and can say, for example, which neurons fire to send the worm wriggling forward or backward. But more complex questions remain unanswered. How does the worm remember? What is constant in the minds of worms? What makes each one individual? In part, these disappointments were a problem of technology, which has made connectome mapping so onerous that until recently nobody considered doing more. In science, it is a great accomplishment to make the first map, but far more useful to have 10, or a million, that can be compared with one another. \u201cC. elegans was a classic case of being too far ahead of your time,\u201d says Gerry Rubin of Janelia.", "The difficulties of interpreting the worm connectome can also be attributed to the fact that it has been particularly difficult to see the worm\u2019s wiring in action, to measure the activity of the worm\u2019s neurons. Without enough activity data, a wiring diagram is fundamentally inscrutable \u2014 a problem akin to trying to read the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt before the Rosetta Stone, with its parallel text in ancient Greek. A connectome is not an answer, but a clue, like a hieroglyphic stele pulled up from the sand, promising insight into an empire but sadly lacking a key.", "In 2000, President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain held a news conference to announce a complete draft of the human genome, which Clinton called the \u201cmost wondrous map ever produced by humankind.\u201d The map has indeed proved full of wonder \u2014 modern biology would be impossible without it \u2014 but in the years since, it has also become clear how incomplete the cartography is. The genome project identified roughly 20,000 genes, but cells also use a system of switches that turn genes off and on, and this system, called epigenetics, determines what work a cell can do and shapes what diseases a person might be prone to. Recent estimates put the number of switches in the hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million. An international consortium is now trying to map the epigenome, and no one can say when it will be finished.", "Eve Marder, a prominent neuroscientist at Brandeis University, cautions against expecting too much from the connectome. She studies neurons that control the stomachs of crabs and lobsters. In these relatively simple systems of 30 or so neurons, she has shown that neuromodulators \u2014 signaling chemicals that wash across regions of the brain, omitted from Seung\u2019s static map \u2014 can fundamentally change how a circuit functions. If this is true for the stomach of a crustacean, the mind reels to consider what may be happening in the brain of a mouse, not to mention a human.", "The history of science is a narrative full of characters convinced that they had found the path to understanding everything, only to have the universe unveil a Sisyphean twist. Physicists sought matter\u2019s basic building blocks and discovered atoms, but then found that atoms had their own building blocks, which had their own pieces, which has brought us, today, to string theory, the discipline\u2019s equivalent of a land war in Asia. After the genome delivered up the text of humanity\u2019s genetic code, biologists realized that our genetic machinery is so filled with feedback, and layers built on layers, that their work had only begun. Critics of Seung\u2019s vision therefore see it as na\u00efve, a faith that he can crest the mountain in front of him and not find more imposing peaks beyond. \u201cIf we want to understand the brain,\u201d Marder says, \u201cthe connectome is absolutely necessary and completely insufficient.\u201d", "Seung agrees but has never seen that as an argument for abandoning the enterprise. Science progresses when its practitioners find answers \u2014 this is the way of glory \u2014 but also when they make something that future generations rely on, even if they take it for granted. That, for Seung, would be more than good enough. \u201cNecessary,\u201d he said, \u201cis still a pretty strong word, right?\u201d"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/big-data-underwriting-for-payday-loans/": ["ZestFinance traces its origins to a phone call Douglas Merrill received one winter day from his sister-in-law, Victoria, who needed new snow tires to drive to work and was short of cash.

Under Kim Jong-il\u2019s leadership, the country\u2019s film studios released hundreds of movies, Mr. Fischer said.", "Movies were so important to Kim Jong-il that he ordered the kidnappings of the South Korean actress and director so that they could upgrade the nation\u2019s film industry. In these nationalistic spectacles, the Supreme Leader was often spoken of but never shown, with the exception of one hagiographic biopic. (The actor who played Kim Il-sung, the country\u2019s founder, was given plastic surgery to resemble the leader, then sent to a concentration camp when the role ended, Mr. Fischer said.) Going to the movies was mandatory for citizens. In villages without movie theaters, films were shown in factories and party offices, and viewers had to attend discussion sessions with party leaders afterward.", "The government was able to control the films its citizens saw for decades, but its grip on entertainment has slipped. Possession of unapproved films is a crime punishable by death.

The overall figures were mostly as anticipated by Wall Street analysts, who had little expectation for a sudden surge in sales or profits. An average of analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters called for earnings of 71 cents a share and revenue of $26.33 billion.", "But some analysts were disappointed by the weakness in Microsoft\u2019s Windows business. The revenue the company made by licensing copies of the Windows operating system to hardware partners, including makers of PCs and tablets, fell 13 percent during the quarter.", "\u201cIt was largely in line with expectations, but I think PC sales sluggishness was probably a bit greater than expected,\u201d said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones.", "Microsoft\u2019s shares fell more than 4 percent on the news in after-hours trading.", "Last year, there was an uptick in Windows revenue because Microsoft ended its technical support for users of Windows XP, an old version of the operating system. The decision effectively forced many businesses to upgrade to PCs running newer copies of Windows. But now companies are largely done with that process and are spending less on new machines.", "Microsoft is also making less because of a new pricing structure for Windows. The company cut prices on Windows for devices sold to academic customers and to consumers who buy the cheapest PCs available, which usually cost less than $250.", "While competitors have struggled to dislodge Microsoft from the business PC market, they have had better luck chipping away in the education and consumer markets. Apple\u2019s Mac and iPad tablets have both stolen share from Windows PCs, while cheap laptops called Chromebooks that run an operating system from Google are also chewing into low-end PC sales.", "Last week, Microsoft started sharing more of its plans to restart the growth of its operating system business with a new product, Windows 10. It showed off imaginative new products that will run on the software, like HoloLens, a virtual- and augmented-reality headset.", "But it has also modified the product to make it more palatable to customers than the previous version of the software, Windows 8, which aggressively pushed a new touch-friendly graphical interface.", "Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said Microsoft\u2019s Windows results showed the importance of Windows 10, which is expected to be released later this year, to the company\u2019s future. \u201cGrowth still remains an uphill battle, but it feels like this ship is moving in the right direction towards cloud and mobile under Nadella,\u201d Mr. Ives said.", "Microsoft\u2019s revenue from its Xbox business also suffered from price cuts, enacted last year to help it gain share in the game console business. The company originally priced its Xbox One game console at $500, handing its main competitor, Sony, a huge price advantage that spurred sales. In response, Microsoft last year offered a $400 version of the Xbox One without the a motion-control sensor called Kinect, subsequently dropping the price of that product to $350.", "The move helped the Xbox gain share in the American market, but Xbox revenue also dropped 20 percent, partly as a result of the lower prices.", "There were also signs of progress in other areas of the company\u2019s business. Microsoft has invested heavily in cloud computing as traditional software sales lose ground to online services that corporate customers rent instead.

Why would we trust the aggregated (but never publicly tallied) opinions of 6,000 or so film-business professionals over the exquisitely argued verdicts of critics or the hard data of the box office? Here then are some of our thoughts on the current Oscar season, its stakes, follies and meaning or lack thereof.", "A. O.

The point is to put the American movie industry on glorious, ridiculous display, to provide an annual window into the psychology, sociology and political economy of Hollywood.", "So on that high-minded note: What happened to \u201cGone Girl,\u201d a major studio release (from 20th Century Fox) that got mostly good reviews, sold a lot of tickets and inspired endless post-spoiler think pieces?

So does \u201cBoyhood,\u201d a 12-year labor of love incubated far from Hollywood and released by a company (IFC Films) that has never been much of an Oscar player. Do we think it has a chance in the major categories? What would a \u201cBoyhood\u201d win mean?", "Other than that, film critics like us, who proclaimed our love for that movie early and ardently, might not be able to complain about the Oscars for a while.", "MANOHLA DARGIS I think \u201cBoyhood\u201d may have a tough time with Academy voters partly for one of the very reasons that make it extraordinary: its seeming simplicity. It just may not feel big enough to the members, even with its nearly-three-hour running time. Its length may also seem like a long sit to some, especially when no one in it liberates Europe.", "Every best-picture winner holds a mirror up to the Academy in some fashion, reflecting a narrative about the industry that the voters can embrace, whether it\u2019s the liberal pieties of \u201cCrash\u201d or the triumphant union of art and technological change in \u201cThe Artist.\u201d Fox Searchlight, which distributed \u201c12 Years,\u201d apparently understood how its movie was speaking (or could speak) to voters. That\u2019s why, I\u2019m guessing, it ran ads that read \u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d during the Oscar race, as in, it\u2019s time for this sorry group of white people \u2014 for the first time in its long sorry history \u2014 to give its most public honor to this film or rather its monumental subject. I thought the ads were so outrageously obvious that they would hurt the movie, but I forgot that there\u2019s no such thing as over-obvious when it comes to the Oscars.", "Given the passionate argument about civil rights that has reignited in this country, I keep thinking that \u201cSelma\u201d might be the movie the Academy could eagerly embrace this year (it really, really likes black people, etc.). That hunch is only bolstered by the recent assaults on the movie, including in a critical Washington Post opinion piece by Joseph A. Califano Jr., a former assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson. \u201cSelma,\u201d instead of, oh, I don\u2019t know, \u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d is apparently now a front-running threat and the movie to wage a stealth campaign against.", "A.O.S. My least favorite genre of film writing may be the \u201cWhat Film X gets wrong about Historical Topic Y\u201d chin-scratcher, which generally shows little understanding of either movies or history. But such articles do serve a purpose during awards campaigns, smudging the narratives producers and publicists carefully lay down.", "Hollywood likes a narrative that affirms its progressive values and political virtues: the story that ends happily with wins for \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d or \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d Another popular story is about how the Academy rewards popular success. (\u201cGladiator\u201d and \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\u201d are in this category.) There is also the story line \u2014 popular in recent years \u2014 that celebrates what might be called auto-cinephilia, or movie self-love. Three of the last five best picture winners were about showmanship: two of them (\u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cArgo\u201d) specifically about movies and the other (\u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d) about a different kind of performer overcoming obstacles.

The thing about the Oscars that drives journalists crazy is the way they, like \u201cHollywood\u201d itself (as a mythical construct and an economic and creative entity), make it hard to distinguish idealism from cynicism.", "In that regard, the Oscar race has been briefly upstaged this time by the drama surrounding \u201cThe Interview\u201d and the Sony hack. I said \u201cdrama,\u201d but I\u2019m not sure what genre this story belongs to. Is it a geopolitical thriller? A backstage satire? A stoner farce? All of the above? Of course, Very Serious Issues have been raised \u2014 about privacy and corporate responsibility, about sexism and racism in Hollywood, about cyberterrorism and North Korea and Aaron Sorkin \u2014 but the whole thing transported us through an \u201cInterstellar\"-type wormhole, past all previously known event horizons of absurdity.", "M.D. The Sony hack was the industry\u2019s biggest spectacle, bigger than \u201cNoah,\u201d \u201cExodus: Gods and Kings\u201d and \u201cInterstellar\u201d combined. A lot has come out, gossipy and otherwise, but given that we\u2019re talking about that orgy of self-love called the Oscars, it\u2019s worth pointing out that there was some movie love among the emailed screeds and bad spelling. I was happy to read that Sony employees don\u2019t like Adam Sandler movies, that top players revere David Fincher and that at least some industry types freely name-drop \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d Paddy Chayefsky, Cary Grant and Peter O\u2019Toole alongside jokes about Michael Fassbender and penises.", "Whether the missives were cynical or bottom-line driven, these nods to Hollywood history suggest that the industry hasn\u2019t entirely succumbed to spreadsheet logic. The Oscars suggest the same because, while the awards are gold-plated onanism writ large and overly long, their very existence proves that the people who make movies have a sense of history, even if that only extends to their own legacies. It\u2019s a banal truth that the industry is a crude, mercenary business, one that\u2019s currently bingeing on superhero movies. Yet despite overwhelming evidence, it remains a human enterprise. The fact that it makes room for directors as different as Mr. Fincher, Ava DuVernay and Paul Thomas Anderson indicates that industry folks want to be remembered for more than being Mr. Sandler\u2019s enablers.", "This hopeful sentiment seems at odds with Mark Harris\u2019s recent, thoughtful consideration of the art and industry on the website Grantland, in which he asserted that while some good movies get made, \u201ca studio\u2019s lineup is brands and franchises, and that\u2019s it.\u201d In contrast to the golden age\u2019s ragmen turned moguls or the bottom-line generation who came later and yet somehow managed to bankroll dreams, Mr. Harris finds that \u201cthe modern studio chief loves business, success, replication and reliability.\u201d No one expects this new mogul to offer a \u201ccursory nod\u201d toward \u201cideals that relate to content.\u201d Given how titles like \u201cMarvel\u2019s The Avengers\u201d crush the box office, this lament seems unassailable \u2014 though it\u2019s complicated.", "A.O.S. Back in 1935, the German aesthetician Rudolf Arnheim declared that critics should stop pretending film was an art and recognize it as, primarily, \u201can economic product.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change! Which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Mr. Harris is wrong. And even if he is, he\u2019s just doing his job. His argument and the objections to it (articulated, for example, by David Poland in a blog post on Moviecitynews.com) have a ritual quality, but as we\u2019ve been saying, ritual and tradition are what this season is all about.", "The \u201cInterview\u201d business, nonetheless, feels like something new under the sun. The hack itself is a reminder of the radical insecurity of digital information, just as the simultaneous release of the film online and in independent theaters may be a harbinger of things to come. We have grown accustomed to the idea that entertainment will be available to us when we want it, on our phones or tablets or whatever. At the same time, we assume, na\u00efvely, that our information is safe and that large corporations are super-vigilant when it comes to protecting their digital property. If Sony is so vulnerable, what about the rest of us?", "\u201cCitizenfour,\u201d Laura Poitras\u2019s scary documentary about Edward Snowden, provides an obvious, chilling answer. The rights to privacy and freedom of expression are invoked in that film, as they have been in the wake of the Sony hack, but the Snowden and the Sony revelations show just how complicated those ideas have become in the 21st century. A foreign government can hijack corporate data. Our own government can do the same with personal data. And more and more of the communication we think of as \u201cours\u201d \u2014 our Tweets and Facebook posts, our Google searches and on-demand video selections \u2014 takes place neither in privacy nor in the constitutionally protected public sphere, but in corporate-owned-and-operated space.", "I used to worry about being paranoid. Now I worry about not being paranoid enough.", "M.D. That\u2019s entertainment! If only we were still using film prints and, um, typewriters, none of this would have happened. One thing I do wonder about is what the hack means, if anything, to the forward march of digital cinema, including the distribution of movies via satellite and terrestrial networks. (For those who don\u2019t follow such things: Most movies in the United States are now shown digitally from hard drives, a.k.a. digital cinema packages, that are physically delivered to theaters.) The website of the National Association of Theater Owners notes, overenthusiastically for my taste (\u201cThe Digital Transition: We\u2019re Almost Done!\u201d), that the digital conversion process is almost complete: \u201cIt appears that a perfect storm of events may bring about the end of film around the end of 2014 due to either a worldwide lack of film stock and/or the closing of processing labs.\u201d", "A.O.S. I\u2019ve resisted this conclusion for a while, but I think it\u2019s time to acknowledge that this whole Internet thing was a big mistake. What was wrong with printed newspapers, movies on celluloid, music on vinyl or handwritten messages tied to the feet of trained pigeons or whisked through pneumatic tubes?", "Seriously, though: Am I wrong to detect an anti-technological theme in the air? The Oscar contenders set in the present bend away from innovation: \u201cGone Girl\u201d is about two writers brought down by the death of print; \u201cWild\u201d is about the authenticity of living off the grid; \u201cBirdman\u201d uses Raymond Carver and Broadway theater as weapons of resistance against the tyranny of the digitally enhanced blockbuster.", "And there are so many period films. I recently went back to see \u201cSelma\u201d again and found myself fixated on the rotary-dial phones, boxy tape recorders and especially the radio console set into the kitchen wall of Dr. and Mrs. King\u2019s home. And how about the marvelous whir and clatter of Christopher the computer in \u201cThe Imitation Game\u201d? Or the old-school detective work of Doc Sportello in \u201cInherent Vice,\u201d undertaken without a smartphone or a search engine? Even the futurism of \u201cInterstellar\u201d was tinged with nostalgia (and the picture itself was shot on film). Maybe one of the functions of movies, even as they inevitably embrace technological progress, is to keep some sense of the old ways alive, making Hollywood a kind of cultural Jurassic World.", "M.D. The anxiety about technology and/or the nostalgia for an earlier age we see in some movies may speak, however unconsciously, to fears about commercial mainstream cinema\u2019s slipping hold on the cultural imagination. When blogs and Twitter light up, sometimes very reasonably, sometimes less so, over the latest outrage stirred up by a show like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d it certainly seems that movies have ceded that hold to the small screen \u2014 at least until a \u201cGone Girl\u201d hits. The concerns about the movies, their relevance and their big-screen future (some of which I share) also dovetail with the oft-repeated assertion that small screens, not large, have become the destination for serious, intelligent work like Lisa Cholodenko\u2019s \u201cOlive Kitteridge,\u201d her superb HBO mini-series with Frances McDormand.", "Should we be worried about American commercial cinema? Yes, no, maybe. What I do know is that many of us tend to talk about the movie industry as if it were a stand-alone entity, but Time Warner, for instance, owns both Warner Bros. and HBO. While some of Time Warner\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d still hits theaters first \u2014 including its mega-blockbusters, its franchises and an occasional miracle like Mr. Anderson\u2019s \u201cInherent Vice\u201d \u2014 some of its product is designated for small screens. Put another way, Warner Bros. no longer has the art-house boutique Warner Independent Pictures (which released titles like \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d), but its parent company has HBO. So, have serious mainstream motion pictures disappeared, or have they been reconfigured, serialized and rerouted to smaller screens?", "One other thing that seems clear is that not enough mainstream movies this year stirred up the kind of excitement that the HBO show \u201cTrue Detective\u201d did, as the current lineup of largely blah Oscar contenders suggests. The commercial movies that do excite audiences tend to be franchises that, when they connect with their audiences \u2014 as \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d have \u2014 affirm that movies remain popular and populist. Again, should we be worried or should we acknowledge that the visual mediums now flow together so seamlessly into a single image stream that one day the Academy Awards may, like the Golden Globes, dole out prizes for small-screen achievements? Because, really \u2014 the best actress Oscar should go to Ms. McDormand."], "https://www.nytimes.com/video/multimedia/100000003481399/amazon-stock-jumps-on-earnings-beat.html": []}

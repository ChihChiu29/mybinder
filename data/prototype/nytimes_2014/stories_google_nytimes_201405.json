Not of the two previous-generation A3s (which weren\u2019t sold as sedans), but of the 1996 A4 sedan that single-handedly hauled Audi back from the edge of oblivion in America. The new A3 is a car that buyers already think they know, one that instantly elicits warm and cuddly expectations.", "The A3 is the cheapest Audi and the next-to-smallest Audi \u2014 after the two-seat TT \u2014 and it is the Audi that\u2019s easiest to love.", "In its silhouette and surface details, the new A3 is more tightly drawn and athletic than other current Audi sedans. Much of that is because it has an engine mounted sideways in its nose \u2014 most Audis have longitudinal engines that stick out ahead of the front wheels \u2014 and that shrinks the length of the hood. But it carries the brand\u2019s familiar styling cues, including a large trapezoidal grille and, with the optional LED package, the distinctive (or gaudy?) headlamp and taillight show that the company pioneered.", "The A3 is actually built using the Volkswagen Group\u2019s MQB architecture; this new structure is also the basis of the 2015 VW Golf and many other cars scattered among the VW-owned brands.", "There\u2019s nothing particularly exotic about the MQB. Like most front-drive vehicles, the body is made from steel stampings welded into a unit, the front is held up by a pair of MacPherson struts and the tail rides on a four-link suspension. In the A3, however, that doesn\u2019t keep it from being impressively stiff, quiet and capable.", "Audi will initially offer the A3 sedan in two versions. The base front-drive 1.8T uses a 1.8-liter version of a familiar turbocharged and direct-injected 4-cylinder engine, rated at 170 horsepower. Above that is the 2.0T, with a 2-liter 220-horsepower 4-cylinder that feeds the quattro all-wheel-drive system. Both engines come lashed to a standard 6-speed automated dual-clutch transmission that shifts brilliantly on its own or quickly when commandeered by the driver.", "I drove two A3 2.0T quattros, one modestly equipped and the other packing a full arsenal of sporty trappings and technological overkill. The base 1.8T carries a nominal $29,900 base price \u2014 exactly the same as Mercedes-Benz\u2019s new CLA250 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t count the unavoidable $895 destination charge. It\u2019s small comfort that Mercedes demands $925 for this petty extortion.", "The cheapest A3 2.0T Quattro is $3,000 more expensive at $33,795, including the destination charge. Add options like the advanced Multimedia Interface, or M.M.I., and the price races well past $40,000.", "With an overall length of 175.4 inches, the A3 is 2.6 inches shorter than the original A4 of 1996, but its wheelbase, at 103.8 inches, is about the same", "The A3\u2019s interior is also similarly proportioned to that old A4\u2019s: there\u2019s adequate legroom for front occupants, but those in the back may be cramped.", "The interior\u2019s clean design is what makes the A3 cabin so pleasant. While larger luxury cars overwhelm drivers with obscure controls, the A3 is a model of simplicity.", "The upper dashboard features four circular vents and a subtly rounded shape that minimizes the appearance of mass at the base of the windshield. The driver\u2019s primary instrumentation is a large circular tachometer and speedometer on a single plane with a digital information display between them. There\u2019s nothing innovative about any of this, and the simplicity pays off in how easy it is to read the controls. The design is also likely to age well.", "All that cleanliness is possible because Audi has gathered so many controls into a single LCD screen that rises from the dash when the car is started and a single push-dial controller just behind the shifter in the center console. It\u2019s still somewhat frustrating to scroll through menus to perform simple tasks like changing the radio station, but the Audi system is at least headed toward intuitive operation.", "But while all A3s get the LCD screen, adding the $1,900 M.M.I. Navigation Plus and Audi Connect packages makes it even more impressive. Based on an advanced Nvidia graphics processor, the system uses a dedicated in-car AT&T 4G LTE cellular data connection to add Google Earth and Google Street View graphics to the navigation elements and present them with 3-D vividness.", "It\u2019s pretty brilliant to look at. But that initial wow dissipates after a little reflection on the system\u2019s cost \u2014 and how technology like this seems to recede from the leading edge every six months.", "Still, the on-board Wi-Fi network that\u2019s also part of the system works great. It gives passengers access to the web over tablets and laptops even while the car is cruising at highway speeds.", "What separates the A3 from other cars of its size is how well it drives. According to Audi, the 2-liter turbo engine delivers a consistent 258 pound-feet of torque from 1,600 to 4,400 r.p.m. In the regular cut-and-shoot of urban driving, that means there\u2019s always thrust available to squirt through holes in traffic or scoot comfortably into traffic during a merge. Audi claims a 0-to-60 m.p.h. time of 5.8 seconds for the 2.0T quattro.", "The driving position is more upright than in coupelike four-doors like the Mercedes CLA, and that means it\u2019s easier to keep track of the car\u2019s four corners while driving or parking. The A3 feels as if it\u2019s been tailored for maximum driver awareness of the environment around him or her; outward visibility is excellent, the steering provides fine feedback and the suspension reports road hiccups without turning them into hard whacks or loud thumps.", "There\u2019s an authenticity to Audi\u2019s small sedan. Mercedes is reaching down-market \u2014 in the American market, at least \u2014 with its CLA, but Audi has played in this size class in the United States ever since the 1970 Super 90 and the 1973 Fox. The light touch, easygoing personality and unpretentious qualities of the new A3 have been Audi traits for a long time.", "Later this year, additional A3 variations will join the line, including a Cabriolet convertible, a TDI diesel, a performance-fortified S3 and a wagonlike Sportback gasoline-electric hybrid. I expect them all to reflect this same familiar character.", "Ultimately though, it\u2019s that first A4 that this A3 sedan resembles most.", "My wife, Dana, had a 1996 A4, which we remember fondly as a perfectly poised sport sedan. It is reassuring that this new A3 feels so much like that car. After all, no one would want to watch old episodes of \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d only to find that Dr. Huxtable\u2019s sweaters had been digitally altered."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/31/sports/basketball/steven-ballmer-buys-los-angeles-clippers-from-rochelle-sterling.html": ["Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief executive, has agreed to pay $2 billion for the Los Angeles Clippers, according to a statement released by Rochelle Sterling, a co-owner of the team. If approved by the National Basketball Association, the sale would end a troubling situation for the league and rank as one of the largest deals in sports history.", "Mr. Ballmer emerged Thursday night as the last suitor standing in a dizzying bidding process that started when the N.B.A. announced last month that it would try to force Donald Sterling to sell the team. Mr. Sterling had been recorded making racist comments in a private conversation, an episode that touched off a national discussion about race and delivered a public-relations blow to the league during its showcase period, the playoffs.", "Rochelle Sterling, Mr. Sterling\u2019s wife and a co-owner of the Clippers, signed the deal with Mr. Ballmer, and their contract will be sent to the N.B.A. for final approval. Mr. Ballmer, 58, was already vetted by the league in 2013 when he was part of an investor group seeking to buy the Sacramento Kings, which means the process could be expedited.", "But the deal faces possible obstacles.", "Mr. Sterling\u2019s position remains uncertain. He was said to have authorized his wife to negotiate with potential buyers, but she needed his power of attorney to sign off on an agreement. Mr. Sterling\u2019s lawyer, Maxwell Blecher, said Wednesday that Ms. Sterling did not have it. Mr. Blecher also said that, as incentive to agree to sell the team, Mr. Sterling wanted the N.B.A. to drop its charges that he had violated the league\u2019s constitution.", "Mr. Sterling, who has vowed to fight the league in its efforts to terminate his ownership of the Clippers, is scheduled to appear at a special hearing Tuesday to answer to charges that he damaged the N.B.A. by making the racist statements. He was barred from the league for life last month.", "Commissioner Adam Silver said last week that he would prefer for the Sterlings to sell the team voluntarily. A vote of the league\u2019s other owners could force them to sell.", "The Los Angeles Times was the first to report that Mr. Ballmer had reached an agreement with Ms. Sterling.", "If the Clippers sell for $2 billion, the price would be the highest paid for an N.B.A. team, far exceeding the $550 million that the Milwaukee Bucks recently sold for. Major League Baseball\u2019s Dodgers, the Clippers\u2019 Los Angeles neighbors, sold for $2.15 billion two years ago.", "But a critical difference is that the Dodgers\u2019 buyers received much more for their money: the team, as well as Dodger Stadium; an expiring local television contract that the new owners flipped into a long-term, multibillion-dollar payout from Time Warner Cable to start their own network; and a joint venture on the parking lots and land around the stadium with the former owner, Frank McCourt.", "In addition to a suddenly ascendant team with a miserable past, Mr. Ballmer would have a training center and a lease at Staples Center that excludes luxury-suite revenue. The team, under new ownership, would benefit from the boons expected in their next local cable contract and the N.B.A.'s next round of national deals. The new local and league contracts will start in the 2016-17 season.", "Three bidders had emerged as the top contenders for the team.", "One group including Oprah Winfrey; the entertainment mogul David Geffen; Larry Ellison, the software tycoon who runs Oracle and made a losing bid to buy the Golden State Warriors; and Mark Walter and Todd Boehly, two of the principals of Guggenheim Partners, which put together the group that acquired the Dodgers two years ago.", "A second group in the bidding for the Clippers included Antony P. Ressler, who runs the private equity firm Ares Management, and the former N.B.A. player Grant Hill. Mr. Ballmer submitted a bid without any partners.", "The purchase of the Clippers would open a new chapter in the life of Mr. Ballmer, a technology billionaire who has lately found himself without much of an occupation. He left his chief executive job at Microsoft this year, under pressure from its board of directors to accelerate his retirement after the company had struggled in a number of key new markets.", "But unlike his fellow Microsoft billionaires, Mr. Ballmer has done little besides work at Microsoft for the past 34 years. William H. Gates, a Microsoft co-founder and former chief executive, has become a philanthropist, and Paul Allen, another co-founder, owns the Portland Trail Blazers and the Seattle Seahawks.", "Mr. Ballmer is relatively unflashy, even though his net worth is estimated at $20 billion by Forbes. He grew up in Detroit, the son of a Ford Motor Company manager, and was known as a commanding, sometimes bullying leader at Microsoft who underestimated major changes in technology that helped lead to the rise of competitors like Google and Apple.", "He has made no secret of his passion for sports, particularly basketball. In interviews while he was running Microsoft, Mr. Ballmer said he made a point of attending as many of his son\u2019s high school basketball games as possible.", "He tried unsuccessfully to bring an N.B.A. franchise back to Seattle in 2013 as part of an investor group seeking to buy the Sacramento Kings. Like many people in the Seattle area, Mr. Ballmer had felt the sting of the SuperSonics\u2019 departure for Oklahoma City, where they became the Thunder.", "The $1.1 billion paid for the Miami Dolphins in 2009 is the peak price for a N.F.L. team, with the Cleveland Browns, who were sold two years ago, a little behind. N.F.L. franchises share in the most lucrative national television deals of all the major leagues.", "No one knows if Mr. Sterling would have put the Clippers on the market in his lifetime unprompted. But the timing for a sale seems fortuitous.", "With the Lakers suddenly the losing team in town, the Clippers are considered a prized commodity. They have stars like Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and a brand-name, title-winning coach, Doc Rivers. And just getting rid of Mr. Sterling, who has, by nearly universal opinion, run a laughingstock of a franchise, should make the team more valuable to a willing buyer."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/opinion/a-cable-merger-too-far.html": ["There are good reasons the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission should block Comcast\u2019s $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable. The merger will concentrate too much market power in the hands of one company, creating a telecommunications colossus the likes of which the country has not seen since 1984 when the government forced the breakup of the original AT&T telephone monopoly.", "The combined company would provide cable-TV service to nearly 30 percent of American homes and high-speed Internet service to nearly 40 percent. Even without this merger and the proposed AT&T-DirecTV deal, the telecommunications industry has limited competition, especially in the critical market for high-speed Internet service, or broadband, where consumer choice usually means picking between the local cable or phone company.", "By buying Time Warner Cable, Comcast would become a gatekeeper over what consumers watch, read and listen to. The company would have more power to compel Internet content companies like Netflix and Google, which owns YouTube, to pay Comcast for better access to its broadband network. Netflix, a dominant player in video streaming, has already signed such an agreement with the company. This could put start-ups and smaller companies without deep pockets at a competitive disadvantage.", "There are also worries that a bigger Comcast would have more power to refuse to carry channels that compete with programming owned by NBC Universal, which it owns. Comcast executives say that they would not favor content the company controls at the expense of other media businesses.", "The company argues that this deal would not reduce choice because the company does not directly compete with Time Warner Cable anywhere. Comcast would face plenty of competition in high-speed Internet service, they say, from telephone and wireless companies.", "The reality is far different. At the end of 2012, according to the F.C.C., 64 percent of American homes had only one or at most two choices for Internet service that most people would consider broadband. Wireless services can handle streaming video, but many customers of Verizon or AT&T would blow through their monthly wireless data plan by streaming just one two-hour high-definition movie, at which point they would have to fork over extra fees.", "Comcast executives argue that companies like Sprint are planning to provide very fast Internet service that will compete with wired broadband. But wireless companies have been working on such services for more than a decade with little success.", "The Justice Department and the F.C.C. could try to address some of the problems with the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal by imposing conditions, like requiring the company not to give favored treatment to established content providers like Netflix and Google at the expense of smaller companies. Comcast agreed to similar terms in exchange for government approval of its 2011 acquisition of NBC Universal.", "Even so, this merger would fundamentally change the structure of this important industry and give one company too much control over what information, shows, movies and sports Americans can access on TVs and the Internet.

What started in 1964 as a shop in a building lobby in Brentwood, Tenn., grew into a thriving mail-order business and, later, an online retailer with $9 million in annual sales. The company was owned by the same family until 2003, when it was sold to a private equity firm. In 2009, Mark A. Cleveland bought the company with the goal of opening more stores and expanding its lines of radio-controlled products.", "CHALLENGE When Mr. Cleveland bought the company, he knew that it was frequently mistaken for Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., a national craft and art supply chain that is based in Oklahoma City and has more than 600 locations. The companies had a history of working cooperatively and, despite their common name, catered to very different consumers. \u201cRoughly 98 percent of my customers are men,\u201d said Mr. Cleveland, while most of the chain\u2019s customers are women.", "Soon after buying Hobby Lobby International, however, Mr. Cleveland realized that the confusion could be a serious problem. The issue became urgent in 2012 when Hobby Lobby Stores, whose founder is an evangelical Christian, filed a lawsuit over the Affordable Care Act provision requiring employers to provide coverage for all forms of contraception as part of employee health insurance. The case went before the Supreme Court in March; a decision is expected by sometime in June.", "BACKGROUND Before buying Hobby Lobby International, Mr. Cleveland was president and co-owner of a truckload management company. In 2004, he sold the company and started looking for a new challenge. Among other ventures, he bought the building that is home to Hobby Lobby International and got to know the shop\u2019s founder, James Martin, shortly after Mr. Martin sold his business to the private equity firm. In 2008, that firm approached Mr. Cleveland about buying the hobby company, which he did in early 2009.", "At its peak in 2006, the company had more than $9 million in annual sales and 36 employees. By the time Mr. Cleveland took over, sales had fallen to roughly half that amount. Still, he believed there were opportunities to grow by opening new shops and expanding the lines of remote-controlled products.", "Those plans, however, were soon trumped by a more pressing concern: Roughly a quarter of Mr. Cleveland\u2019s daily customer inquiries related to the other Hobby Lobby. \u201cIt was everything from store directions and product returns to human resources,\u201d said Mr. Cleveland, who in 2009 was served the first of many lawsuits intended for the other company.", "Initially, Mr. Cleveland took the problem in stride, contacting his Oklahoma counterpart to come up with a process for dealing with misguided customer complaints, gift cards, vendor inquiries and other mix-ups. \u201cI put up a sign on our building that said \u2018Hobby Lobby for Men\u2019 because so many women were coming in the store looking for crafts,\u201d he said.", "The issues became increasingly problematic when Mr. Cleveland tried to optimize his company\u2019s web traffic and venture into social media. \u201cThe brand confusion became astronomical with competition for these web and social media platforms,\u201d said Mr. Cleveland, who managed to secure a Hobby Lobby Facebook page, Google app and Twitter handle before his Oklahoma counterpart.", "In 2011, Mr. Cleveland reached out to the chief executive of Hobby Lobby Stores, David Green. That spring, the two chief executives met in Oklahoma City, where Mr. Cleveland proposed a partnership in which his company would be the larger chain\u2019s exclusive supplier of radio-controlled toys; at the time, Hobby Lobby Stores did not sell such devices. Mr. Green seemed interested, Mr. Cleveland said, but the chain wound up sourcing the products from another supplier. \u201cThey basically cut me out of the deal,\u201d Mr. Cleveland said. (Hobby Lobby Stores declined to comment on whether any such agreement had been in place.)", "Mr. Cleveland then sent a letter noting that Hobby Lobby International had a trademark for hobby products and demanding that Hobby Lobby Stores stop selling remote-controlled products, which they did. \u201cThey did an honorable thing,\u201d said Mr. Cleveland, who continued to field complaints and returns from people who had bought remote-controlled products from the craft store chain.", "Still, this did nothing to solve the name problem. National attention on social issues, including gay marriage and abortion, put Hobby Lobby Stores in the spotlight, and that attention spilled over to Mr. Cleveland\u2019s company. It peaked in 2012 when Hobby Lobby Stores filed suit over the contraceptive rules in the Affordable Care Act. News of the lawsuit caused a spike in erroneous calls and comments to Mr. Cleveland\u2019s company. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to pick a fight with that company,\u201d Mr. Cleveland said. \u201cBut that\u2019s when I knew I had no choice.\u201d", "OPTIONS Mr. Cleveland made up his mind to force a resolution, even if it meant taking legal action against a billion-dollar company. Believing he had a strong legal position because he had the trademark for hobby products sold under the Hobby Lobby name, Mr. Cleveland wrote a letter to Mr. Green, this time giving him an ultimatum: Hobby Lobby Stores could get out of the hobby business altogether or compensate Mr. Cleveland\u2019s company for the cost of rebranding.", "And if Hobby Lobby Stores would not oblige? Mr. Cleveland knew that a lawsuit would cost millions, but he said he told his wife, \" \u2018I\u2019m prepared to put everything I own into this.\u2019 I was ready to fight.\u201d", "WHAT OTHERS SAY Timothy Calkins, clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management: \u201cMr. Cleveland\u2019s best option is to embrace another name. This is clearly a problem for both of these companies, but it\u2019s a bigger problem for Hobby Lobby International. The craft store is a much bigger player and, socially, is a very polarizing company. For Mr. Cleveland, the question isn\u2019t whether he should change the brand, but how he can convince the other company to pay for it. Big companies don\u2019t like legal fights, and they don\u2019t like distractions, but they won\u2019t settle unless they think it\u2019s a credible threat.\u201d", "William Barnum, partner with Brentwood Associates, a consumer-focused private equity firm: \u201cThis is a worst-case scenario for brand confusion. Hobby Lobby International has to change its name, but in such a way that it doesn\u2019t lose its core customers. It should do whatever it can to keep its brand attributes, including the logo and key words. They also need a good plan for how they communicate the change to brand evangelists, the people who closely follow and blog about the company and its products. This tactic worked for us when we rebranded one of our portfolio companies, The Teaching Company, as Great Courses because it was frequently confused with a company called The Learning Company.\u201d", "Terri Williamson, owner of Water Music, a body care, perfume and candle company she founded in 1999 as Glow but rebranded in 2004 after a legal battle with Jennifer Lopez, who introduced a perfume with the same name: \u201cMy advice to other entrepreneurs in this predicament is to find not just a great attorney, but one with experience in trademark litigation. Going to court is expensive, exhausting and ultimately very risky. It worked in my favor \u2014 I negotiated a settlement \u2014 but I am a big fan of avoiding litigation. In hindsight, the minute Jennifer Lopez started using my name, I probably had no alternative but to rebrand. My company would forever be associated with her. I think that\u2019s the case with Hobby Lobby International. As a branded company, you don\u2019t want to be associated with anyone but yourself or the people of your own choosing.\u201d", "THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on the You\u2019re the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss.

It is not in the top 10 searches for \u201cmy husband wants,\u201d and it falls behind \u201cmy husband wants to share me\u201d and \u201cmy husband wants to be a woman.\u201d", "Because we can examine the searches of foreign-language speakers in the United States and compare them with searches from their home countries, the Google window gives us a fascinating glimpse into cultural assimilation.", "Return to the questions of what pregnant women can safely do, and compare the different questions posed in Mexico and the United States.

LyveHome has lassoed my vast mess of images into a sensible collection I can access from just about anywhere. I can call up the Lyve app on an iPhone, iPad, Mac or Android phone and be instantly transported on a photographic journey into the past \u2014 adding a deeper layer of meaning and enjoyment to a set of memories that were once all but inaccessible.", "Still, at $299, LyveHome isn\u2019t cheap. And it is missing enough important features that I\u2019d be wary of buying one until it is improved.", "But as it is, LyveHome is intriguing, not so much because it works, but because of how it works. LyveHome does not store your photos in a huge database online, unlike Google, Flickr, Facebook and Dropbox. LyveHome eschews the much-hyped cloud. Instead, in addition to copying all your photos to its central drive, LyveHome manages storage space across all your devices to create multiple redundant copies of your images. When you call up a single photo, the system smartly routes the picture from one of your devices to another. In this way, every one of your photos is stored on a device you own, with the LyveHome sitting at the center, managing the flow of images between every device.", "For people who have craved wider access to their photos but who were worried about the privacy implications or the long-term cost of maintaining a large cache of storage space online, LyveHome\u2019s system presents an ingenious alternative. Tim Bucher, the founder and chief executive of Lyve, which makes the LyveHome, argued that a photo library built using people\u2019s existing devices provided the convenience of a cloud service with an added layer of control that most people want.", "\u201cWe want to give consumers the power to decide where they want to store their most precious data,\u201d he said.", "Yet in many ways, Mr. Bucher\u2019s dream of a personal cloud is still more of a theory than a functioning idea, and the limitations should give users some pause about the safety and utility of any photographic stash stored on Lyve, at least right now.", "When you first install the system, Lyve\u2019s well-designed software copies your pictures from each of your phones and computers to the LyveHome, which has about 2 terabytes of data capacity, enough to store hundreds of thousands of photos. The system also creates a master index stored on the company\u2019s servers online; the index contains data about your photos, like file sizes and a unique code to identify each image, but it does not contain the photos themselves. The initial cataloging process can take several hours to several days, depending on how many photos you\u2019re storing.", "Then, when you open the Lyve app on your computer or mobile device, it consults the master index, and it transfers your pictures from the LyveHome to your phone.", "There are two problems with this setup. First, it\u2019s slow. The Lyve app stores thumbnails \u2014 tiny versions of every photo \u2014 on each of your devices, so you can quickly scan through your images on your phone or tablet. But if you click on any thumbnail to see a larger version, there\u2019s a good chance that the full photo will need to be transferred from the LyveHome to your phone.", "If your phone is just in the next room, the picture can take a split second to load, which isn\u2019t so bad, but isn\u2019t quite seamless, either. But if you\u2019re out of your house, pictures come up much slower \u2014 a second or two for each one, at least. There\u2019s an even more excruciating wait to load videos.", "Sure, you see a delay when you download pictures from cloud services, too, but the delay is often much slighter. Because large cloud companies have access to fat Internet pipes \u2014 they\u2019ve got more bandwidth than the LyveHome at your house \u2014 pictures stored on Dropbox or Google load much faster than those on LyveHome.", "The larger problem is redundancy. In some ways, Lyve is built for the future \u2014 when many of us will have enough extra phones and computers lying around that it will be possible to cobble together a robust personal cloud out of our own devices. Security will thus emerge from ubiquity. If enough of your pictures are copied on enough of your devices spread out in enough places, you might be able to lose any one device and not lose any of your photos.", "Today, though, most people don\u2019t have all that many devices. In its current incarnation, then, Lyve\u2019s main storage component is the LyveHome device. This makes it the most vulnerable component, too. If your house burns down, you will lose your LyveHome \u2014 and with it, many of your photos. So even if you choose the LyveHome specifically to avoid online photo services, it would be wise to pair it with a cloud backup system like Mozy, Carbonite or CrashPlan, which create online copies of your data that you can retrieve in the event of calamity.", "There are other caveats with Lyve, too. For now, the system works with Apple and Android mobile devices, and with Apple\u2019s desktop and laptop computers. Lyve\u2019s Windows desktop app will be ready in a few weeks\u2019 time. I tested an early version of that app, and I found it worked well. But it is limited compared with the Mac version. The Mac app lets you view all the pictures you\u2019ve got stored on Lyve, while the Windows version is only for cataloging the images on your computer and transferring them to the LyveHome. That is, for now, you can\u2019t view your Lyve images on a Windows machine.", "Are all these limitations fatal to Lyve\u2019s cloud-free vision of photographic bliss? I don\u2019t think so. Mr. Bucher outlined several coming updates to Lyve that may greatly improve the system. For now, at its best, Lyve is a terrifically easy way to sort through all your digital memories. Just remember that it is very much a work in progress."], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/morning-agenda-atts-move-for-directv/": ["AT&T agreed on Sunday to buy the satellite television operator DirecTV for $48.5 billion in a bid to \u201ctilt the balance of power with media companies as the market for broadband Internet and video shifts,\u201d Michael J. de la Merced and David Gelles write in DealBook.

The service was introduced in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States almost three years ago. When the company last reported customer numbers, in March 2013, it had six million subscribers and 24 million total users.

They include passing a national data breach law that would require companies to report major losses of personal and credit card data, after attacks like the one on Target that exposed credit card information on roughly 70 million customers. It seeks legislation that would define consumer rights regarding how data about their activities was used. It suggests extending privacy protections to individuals who are not citizens of the United States and argues for action to ensure that data collected about students is used only for educational purposes.", "But the most significant findings in the report focus on the recognition that data can be used in subtle ways to create forms of discrimination \u2014 and to make judgments, sometimes in error, about who is likely to show up at work, pay their mortgage on time or require expensive treatment. The report states that the same technology that is often so useful in predicting places that would be struck by floods or diagnosing hard-to-find illnesses in infants also has \u201cthe potential to eclipse longstanding civil rights protections in how personal information is used in housing, credit, employment, health, education and the marketplace.\u201d", "The report focuses particularly on \u201clearning algorithms\u201d that are frequently used to determine what kind of online ad to display on someone\u2019s computer screen, or to predict their buying habits when searching for a car or in making travel plans.

The notification would not apply in cases where a search was authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which prohibits warning targets of such searches, but the firms are clearly trying to deter the government from regularly mining their data.", "In one area, the report appears to side, at least in part, with critics of the N.S.A. who argued with the intelligence agency\u2019s contention that it is far less intrusive to collect \u201cmetadata\u201d about a phone call or email than to collect its content.", "The former director of the N.S.A., Gen. Keith B. Alexander, often noted that because the agency maintained a database only of the phone numbers that Americans called and the durations of the calls, it was not violating their privacy. But the report notes that there is a \u201cprofound question\u201d about whether that kind of metadata \u201cshould be accorded stronger privacy protections than they are currently\u201d because they can be revealing of a person\u2019s movements and habits. \u201cThis review recommends that the government should broaden\u201d the examination of how intelligence agencies use such data and consider whether the test should be \u201chow much it reveals about individuals.\u201d", "Mr. Podesta, in briefing reporters on Thursday, also singled out the shortcomings of the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d that consumers click on, almost always without reading them, when they sign up for free email accounts or download apps for their smartphones.

Doomed, I fear, because the forces of cheap, fast fashion that she decries \u2014 H&M, Uniqlo, Zara, et al. \u2014 have become so powerful and ubiquitous, flaming red flags about the industry\u2019s production methods, like the 2013 collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh that killed over 1,000 workers, notwithstanding.", "First-world women seem far more focused on the source of their organic juice than they do their T-shirts; also maybe less interested in dressing for social life, as they curl inward, potato-\u00adbug-like, to their computing devices.

It was the subject of a new White House report about how technology and the crunching of big data about the lives of Americans \u2014 from which websites they visit to where they drive their newly networked cars \u2014 are enlarging the problem.", "At their core, the questions about the N.S.A. are strikingly similar to those about how Google, Yahoo, Facebook and thousands of application makers crunch their numbers. The difference is over the question of how far the government will go to restrain the growth of its own post-Sept. 11 abilities, and whether it will decide the time has come to intrude on what private industry collects, in the name of protecting privacy or preventing new forms of discrimination.", "President Obama alluded to that at the White House on Friday, when he was forced to take up the issue at a news conference with one of the N.S.A.\u2019s most prominent targets: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who said she was still not satisfied with America\u2019s responses to the revelations that her phone \u2014 and her country \u2014 were under blanket surveillance for a dozen years.", "\u201cThe United States historically has been concerned about privacy,\u201d Mr. Obama said, trying to seize some high ground in the debate. His string of assurances along that line rang a bit hollow last year, as the administration reacted to each disclosure by Edward J.

After approving, for five years, a government program to collect telephone metadata \u2014 the information about telephone numbers dialed and the duration of calls \u2014 he acceded to recommendations to leave that information in the hands of telecommunications companies. Quietly, the White House ended the wiretapping of dozens of foreign leaders.", "Now, by expanding the debate to what America\u2019s digital titans collect, Mr. Obama gains a few political advantages. He is hoping to reinvigorate legislative proposals that went nowhere in his first term. And now that the revelations about the N.S.A. have tapered off, at least for a while, his aides seem to sense that Americans are at least as concerned about the information they entrust to Google and Yahoo.", "In Silicon Valley, there is a suspicion that the report issued on Thursday by John D.

In some cases, the N.S.A. gained some access to data even as it lost some autonomy. For example, its program to collect metadata missed a large percentage of cellphone calls. Under Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, if it becomes law, the N.S.A. would have to leave that data in private hands, but when the N.S.A. does get it, under court order, the agency should have access to a lot more than it does today.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good trade,\u201d said one senior intelligence official who has been working on the issue. \u201cAll told, if you are an N.S.A. analyst, you will probably get more of what you wanted to see, even it\u2019s more cumbersome.\u201d", "In other cases, the N.S.A. is clearly giving up authority. Decisions about whether to exploit flaws in software to allow for surveillance or cyberattacks will be made at the National Security Council, not at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Fort Meade, Md.

They believe that looking for business secrets is part of the fabric of national security, especially for a rising economic powerhouse. And while American officials are loath to admit it, Washington\u2019s view has relatively few advocates around the world. The French, for example, were notorious for conducting state-backed corporate espionage long before the Chinese mastered the form. And if they choose, Chinese leaders have ample opportunity to retaliate by making life even harder for American companies.", "Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. repeated the we-don\u2019t-spy-for-corporate-America argument Monday morning as he unsealed an indictment that included allegations that Unit 61398 had stolen trade secrets for nuclear power plants that would save Chinese firms years of design work, as well as information from inside an American solar energy company that was pursuing a trade complaint against its Chinese competitors.", "\u201cThe alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States,\u201d Mr. Holder said. \u201cThis is a tactic that the U.S. government categorically denounces. As President Obama has said on numerous occasions, we do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies, or U.S. commercial sectors.\u201d", "There is little doubt, based on the evidence published last year, that the Comment Crew\u2019s targets include companies that compete directly with state-owned Chinese enterprises that fund the People\u2019s Liberation Army and often line the pockets of its leaders. But they are hardly the only targets of Chinese espionage: The office of the secretary of defense, the firms building the new Joint Strike Fighter, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Aspen Institute and The New York Times have all been targets of Chinese hacking units, for different reasons.", "But the United States is limited in the complaints it can make because it has targeted similar institutions in China \u2014 for equally murky reasons. So when Mr. Obama raised the issue with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, he focused only on commercial espionage, arguing it is far more pernicious to use the intelligence instruments of the state for a business advantage. The United States may do all it can to learn about China\u2019s nuclear arsenal, or Beijing\u2019s intentions in its territorial disputes with Japan, but it does not, he says, steal from China Telecom to help AT&T.", "Prosecutors focused on the most clear-cut commercial cases, perhaps because the United States believes the cases will bolster the president\u2019s central argument, that there is something sacred about intellectual property.", "\u201cThis is not something they pulled out of their back pocket,\u201d said Kevin Mandia, whose company, the Mandiant division of FireEye, compiled the first public report about Unit 61398 last year. \u201cThis was a logical escalation of the pressure.\u201d", "But it was also an effort to regain the high ground the United States lost last year after the revelations made by Edward J.

At the time, the chief beneficiaries would have been the Big Three auto companies and a smattering of parts suppliers. It is also widely believed to be using intelligence in support of trade negotiations underway with European and Asian trading partners. But in the view of a succession of Democratic and Republican administrations, that is fair game.", "Companies can also be targets. Documents released by Mr. Snowden showed that the American government pried deep into the servers of Huawei, one of China\u2019s most successful Internet and communications companies. The documents made clear that the N.S.A. was seeking to learn whether the company was a front for the People\u2019s Liberation Army and whether it was interested in spying on American firms. But there was a second purpose: to get inside Huawei\u2019s systems and use them to spy on countries that buy the company\u2019s equipment.", "Huawei officials said they failed to understand how that differed meaningfully from what the United States has accused the Chinese of doing.", "But such reasoning is rejected by the intelligence community. \u201cI welcome this indictment because it has our government rejecting the false equivalence between us and the Chinese,\u201d said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the N.S.A. and the Central Intelligence Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s a risky course of action,\u201d he added, \u201cbut prior to this we were in stasis.\u201d", "It is risky because the Chinese have already declared that they are shutting down, at least for now, the modest talks between the two countries on norms of behavior on the Internet.", "Those conversations were already fraught. Last month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel went to Beijing to argue for a new channel of communication between the United States and China on cyberstrategy. American officials had already given the Chinese an overview of American cybersecurity, emphasizing that the N.S.A. did not take what it collects and hand it to Apple or Microsoft or Google.", "The hope was that it would prompt the Chinese to give Washington a similar briefing about the People\u2019s Liberation Army units that are believed to be behind the attacks on American corporations and government networks. So far, the Chinese have not reciprocated.", "Instead, they have denied that the P.L.A. conducts cyberoperations. When The Times published an article early last year about Unit 61398, in which it detailed some of the group\u2019s operations, there were furious denials from Beijing.

But until now, Cuiab\u00e1\u2019s biggest draw has been decidedly regional: Expoagro, a state-fair-like spectacle that attracts 300,000 people over 11 days, many of them for the four-day rodeo.

They may, however, have trouble finding a place to sleep. The city is thousands of hotel rooms short of the expected need. Constricted supply has driven prices up: In mid-May, the few rooms available on Cuiab\u00e1\u2019s four game days averaged more than $500, according to data from the hotel booking site Trivago, far more than the game-day average across all 12 host cities, $188.", "A bed-and-breakfast program to relieve pressure on hotels registered nearly 700 Cuiab\u00e1 families but was long delayed, starting a website this month, but with a clumsy interface and baffling translation by Google. (A similar program in Bras\u00edlia went live in February with a flashier website, with versions in competent English and Spanish.)", "With thousands of beds still needed, officials have scrambled to find space in schools near the stadium and set up campgrounds. Meanwhile, a new state tourism campaign promoting attractions like the Pantanal opened on May 1, too late for many World Cup visitors to make plans.", "Officials stress that the real benefits from the World Cup will materialize in years to come.

Mr. Jobs seems never to have read, or may have chosen to ignore, the first paragraph of the Sherman Antitrust Act:", "Every \u201cconspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce\u201d is illegal, the act says. \u201cEvery person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine\u201d or \u201cby imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments.\u201d", "Mr. Jobs \u201cwas a walking antitrust violation,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law and an expert in antitrust law. \u201cI\u2019m simply astounded by the risks he seemed willing to take.\u201d", "The anti-poaching pact was hardly Mr. Jobs\u2019s only post-mortem brush with the law. His behavior was at the center of an e-book price-fixing conspiracy with major publishers. After a lengthy trial, a federal judge ruled last summer that \u201cApple played a central role in facilitating and executing that conspiracy.\u201d (Apple has appealed the decision. The publishers all settled the case.)", "Mr. Jobs also figured prominently in the options backdating scandal that rocked Silicon Valley eight years ago. Thousands of options were backdated at both Apple and the computer animation studio Pixar, where Mr. Jobs was also chief executive, to increase the value of option grants to senior employees. An investigation by Apple\u2019s lawyers cleared Mr. Jobs of wrongdoing, saying he didn\u2019t understand the accounting implications. But it concluded that he \u201cwas aware or recommended the selection of some favorable grant dates.\u201d Mr. Jobs himself received options on 7.5 million shares, which were backdated to immediately bolster their value by over $20 million. Apple admitted that the minutes of the October board meeting where the grant was supposedly approved were fabricated, that no such meeting had occurred and that the options were actually granted in December.", "Five executives of other companies went to prison for backdating options, but Mr. Jobs was never charged. (Other Apple executives eventually settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges and left the company. The commission did praise Apple itself for its \u201cswift, extensive and extraordinary cooperation.\u201d)", "Despite the strict language of the Sherman Act, the Justice Department tends to file criminal antitrust charges only in the most egregious cases, and by that standard, Mr. Jobs would probably never have been charged. Still, Mr. Jobs\u2019s conduct is a reminder that the difference between genius and potentially criminal behavior can be a fine line. Mr. Jobs \u201calways believed that the rules that applied to ordinary people didn\u2019t apply to him,\u201d Walter Isaacson, author of the best-selling biography \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d told me this week. \u201cThat was Steve\u2019s genius but also his oddness. He believed he could bend the laws of physics and distort reality. That allowed him to do some amazing things, but also led him to push the envelope.\u201d", "Brian Lam, a technology reporter and founder of The Wirecutter website, said that a few antitrust issues hadn\u2019t dimmed Mr. Jobs\u2019s luster in Silicon Valley. \u201cHis reputation is pretty much set in stone,\u201d Mr. Lam said. Mr. Jobs \u201cdidn\u2019t pay much attention to convention, and now more than ever, that\u2019s the culture of tech companies.\u201d", "Professor Hovenkamp characterized both the e-book agreements and the anti-poaching pact as \u201cblatant restraints of trade.\u201d Mr. Jobs, he said, \u201cwas so casual about it, so bold. Didn\u2019t he have lawyers advising him? You see this kind of behavior sometimes in small, private or family-run companies, but almost never in large public companies like Apple.\u201d", "Apple declined to comment.", "Mr. Jobs was certainly brazen. Testimony in the e-books case suggested that Mr. Jobs was eager, even frantic, to have an e-book agreement in place in time for his announcement of Apple\u2019s latest product, the iPad. There\u2019s no indication that any lawyers put the brakes on. (On the contrary, the chief architect of the scheme inside Apple was a lawyer.) In an email to James Murdoch, then an executive at News Corporation, which owned the publisher HarperCollins, Mr. Jobs offered what amounted to a classic case in price fixing: \u201cOur proposal does set the upper limit for e-book retail pricing based on the hardcover price of each book\u201d and urged HarperCollins to \u201cthrow in with Apple.\u201d", "HarperCollins did, along with other major publishers. Judge Denise L. Cote of Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that \u201cApple is liable here for facilitating and encouraging the publisher defendants\u2019 collective, illegal restraint of trade,\u201d adding: \u201cThrough their conspiracy, they forced Amazon (and other resellers) to relinquish retail pricing authority and then they raised retail e-book prices. Those higher prices were not the result of regular market forces but of a scheme in which Apple was a full participant.\u201d", "Why were no criminal charges filed? The Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division chief, William J. Baer, recently noted that the department had filed 339 criminal antitrust cases since President Obama took office, many of them on charges of price-fixing. The issue is, of course, moot with Mr. Jobs, who died in 2011. But his co-conspirators in the publishing industry may have benefited from the relative novelty of e-books. \u201cThere\u2019s a traditional reluctance to go for criminal liability over novel practices,\u201d Professor Hovenkamp said. \u201cThere was probably some thinking that with e-books, the technology was so new, and it was disruptive. It\u2019s tough to prove mens rea,\u201d or criminal state of mind.", "And there may have been political constraints, too. Although consumers were the beneficiaries of the case (and prices of e-books have dropped since the case was settled), publishers and their allies, including many authors, warned that the perverse result was to solidify Amazon\u2019s dominance.", "The anti-poaching case may be taking a bigger toll on Mr. Jobs\u2019s reputation, especially since he seemed so cavalier about people\u2019s jobs. Mr. Jobs was again injudicious in his emails to competitors. In 2007, he threatened Palm Inc. with patent litigation unless Palm agreed not to recruit Apple employees, even though Palm\u2019s then-chief executive, Edward Colligan, told him that such a plan was \u201clikely illegal.\u201d", "That same year, Mr. Jobs wrote Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, \u201cI would be extremely pleased if Google would stop doing this,\u201d referring to its efforts to recruit an Apple engineer. Mr. Schmidt forwarded the email, adding his own indiscreet comment: \u201cI believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple and this is a direct inbound request. Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening? I will need to send a response back to Apple quickly so please let me know as soon as you can.\u201d", "When Mr. Jobs learned that the Google recruiter who contacted the Apple employee would be \u201cfired within the hour,\u201d he responded with a smiley face.", "\u201cHow could anyone have approved that?\u201d Professor Hovenkamp asked. \u201cAny competent antitrust counsel would know that\u2019s illegal. And they had to know they\u2019d get caught eventually.\u201d", "Apple, Google and other technology companies reached an agreement with the Justice Department over the no-poaching practice in 2010, and agreed not to engage in any agreement or activity to reduce or prevent competition for employees. Last week, Apple and other technology companies settled a related class-action lawsuit, agreeing to pay $324 million.", "Again, the Justice Department chose not to bring criminal charges against some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent executives. (The Justice Department said it did not comment on decisions not to file charges.)", "Both the e-book and anti-poaching cases \u201clook suspiciously like a lot of other cases that resulted in criminal charges,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said. \u201cBut there\u2019s always the factor of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d", "There\u2019s no way of knowing whether Mr. Jobs, had he lived and been healthy, would have faced charges, especially since he was a recidivist. Given Mr. Jobs\u2019s immense popularity, prosecutors might not have wanted to risk a trial, Mr. Hovenkamp noted. Mr. Jobs probably came closest to being prosecuted in the backdating scandal, but by then he was already known to have pancreatic cancer.", "But why would Mr. Jobs even have tried to skirt the law, given how much was at stake? Mr. Isaacson said that he couldn\u2019t comment on specific cases, but noted that \u201cover and over, people referred to his reality distortion field.\u201d Mr. Isaacson added, \u201cThe rules just didn\u2019t apply to him, whether he was getting a license plate that let him use handicapped parking or building products that people said weren\u2019t possible. Most of the time he was right, and he got away with it.\u201d", "Mr. Lam of The Wirecutter said Mr. Jobs\u2019s seeming indifference to the law wasn\u2019t unusual in Silicon Valley. \u201cLook at Bill Gates,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was arrested for speeding and driving without a license. And Microsoft had its problems with antitrust law. It\u2019s just a characteristic of young tech entrepreneurs to look at the rules and question them. You can\u2019t get into this game without a healthy distaste for the status quo.\u201d", "But even as Mr. Jobs was doing his best to snuff out competition, he publicly reveled in it, Mr. Isaacson said. \u201cThe paradox is, Steve Jobs was totally energized by competition. His famous 1984 ad was about destroying IBM. He later felt the same about Microsoft Windows and did the PC versus Mac ads. And in his last few years, he was obsessed with Google Android. Yes, he tried to block them in court with lawsuits.

Ms. VanHeirseele wanted most of the videos to be on the large side, about 6 inches by 5 inches on a standard desktop computer. All were to be user-initiated, meaning that a viewer had to click on something to start the ad; none were to run on auto-play.", "Is that what Blue Chip got? Oddly enough, it wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cYou\u2019d ask a media company where an ad was running and they\u2019d say, \u2018We can\u2019t pull that list,\u2019 \u201d Ms. VanHeirseele said. \u201cOr they would give you a massive list but you had no way of telling if it was accurate.\u201d", "So Blue Chip hired a video verification company called BrandAds to track the campaign for the mom-related product and find out where the ads were placed.

Maybe you allow some of those ads to run auto-play.", "Another option for media buyers is to enter the vast and complicated resale market, through what are called ad exchanges.

Back in the 1990s, tech firms took over bunches of old warehouses with exposed brick, tall ceilings and no corner offices during the first dot-com boom. The buildings were cheap.

San Francisco\u2019s prosperity (and stratospheric real estate costs) is a decades-old phenomenon due as well to biotech, tourism and a healthy investment in homegrown industries, which the city protects with laws like the one that requires a chain store with a dozen or more outlets to seek city approval to open an outlet in many neighborhoods. Of course, a business here faces that same hurdle when it succeeds enough to branch out. The city\u2019s Planning Department is rethinking the policy. Nothing is simple in San Francisco.", "That\u2019s especially true when it comes to runaway housing costs, which many residents blame on tech.

A developer then proposed a 16-unit apartment building at 1050 Valencia, the site of a defunct KFC. The proposal conformed to all zoning regulations, with the required pair of affordable apartments, proportionate to the total number of units, and no parking, just as the city demanded, because San Francisco wants to encourage the use of mass transit and bikes. In New York, such a plan would have forged ahead \u201cas of right,\u201d without seeking further city approvals.", "There is no \u201cas of right\u201d here, however. Opponents in the Mission tied up the plan for six more years, arguing the developer down to 12 units from 16 and adding parking, which the city Planning Commission O.K.\u2019d so the project would get done. Opponents then went to the Board of Permit Appeals, which (inexplicably) ordered the developer to chop off the top floor, too, causing the project to fall below the 10-unit threshold requiring affordable apartments. A development that would have provided new apartments, including two affordable ones, reducing automobile dependency in the process, was about to end up after years of delay with fewer apartments, no affordable units and more space for cars. Only at the 11th hour did the board reverse itself this spring, restoring the top floor and parking ban.", "\u201cWe have pretended we could avoid change and somehow make the city affordable,\u201d is how Mr. Wiener summed the story up, \u201cas if by jumping up and down and holding our breath, rents will come down.\u201d", " The other day, an official from the mayor\u2019s office walked me down Market Street, pointing to where Square\u2019s spiffy offices occupy several floors in a grim former Bank of America building; where Dolby is moving, into what used to be the State Compensation Insurance Fund tower, an incredibly dour 1970s office building. The 1917 Strand Theater, vacant since 2003, is being exquisitely renovated, as is the old Renoir Hotel, the 1892 Hibernia Bank and the gracious Warfield, where Spotify and Benchmark Capital have headquarters.

That narrows the field of supported phones even more, because slightly older iPhones like the iPhone 5, for example, don\u2019t support Sprint\u2019s compression technology (the newest ones do).", "As for HD calling on AT&T and Verizon, keep waiting. AT&T said in January that it would start HD voice this year. AT&T said the same thing last year. Verizon has also vaguely mentioned HD voice \u201csometime in 2014.\u201d Neither company responded to requests for comment.", "When and if AT&T and Verizon add HD voice, it will most likely be tied to so-called Voice Over LTE, so only newer 4G phones that support LTE can use the feature.

Today things have changed. The novelty of making a call anywhere has worn off if I can\u2019t understand what you are saying.\u201d", "On top of that, voice-enabled systems like Siri, Google Now and the new Cortana speech assistant built into Windows Phone all rely on voice commands, and those commands get sent to a server for processing \u2014 the equivalent of a phone call. If the sound isn\u2019t good, Siri can\u2019t understand you, and you become that person yelling at your phone in the privacy of your home.", "The same goes for automated call centers.", "Mobile carriers are also under pressure from calling options like Skype or Google Voice. Skype already supports wideband HD voice frequencies and can sound amazing over a good connection.", "If you\u2019ve got a 4G phone, you could use Skype for calling and have a better experience than a standard call. And Microsoft, which owns Skype, has integrated it into the dial pad in Windows 8.1, so any Windows Phone can skip carrier calling completely.", "A Skype call uses your phone\u2019s data plan instead of voice minutes, and carriers don\u2019t really want that, Mr. Mohney said. They want to control the way voice and data are used on their networks, and, of course, they won\u2019t want their calling services to be irrelevant.", "And, said Mr. Hutton of the GSMA, better call quality makes customers happy.", "\u201cIf you as an operator are offering HD voice and your competitors aren\u2019t, the level of service you\u2019re offering is much higher,\u201d he said.", "Well, obviously.

Recently there was a book dissecting Apple\u2019s internal culture; another profiling its design wiz, Jonathan Ive; and a third charting Apple\u2019s tempestuous relationship with Google. All these volumes now orbit around Walter Isaacson\u2019s \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d the definitive chronicle, considering the imperious co-founder himself opened the door to his secretive empire as he battled pancreatic cancer.", "Into this crowded oeuvre comes \u201cHaunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs,\u201d a well-reported but premature evaluation of the post-Jobs era by the former Wall Street Journal reporter Yukari Iwatani Kane. The book is confidently written and contains a few reporting gems for committed Apple watchers. But ultimately it falls under the weight of the unanswerable question that it poses at the start: \u201cCan a great company stay great without its visionary leader?\u201d Analysts, investors and Apple fans may be reserving judgment, but Kane\u2019s answer is a pretty conclusive no. The post-Jobs Apple of her estimation is hapless, lost without its iconic chief executive, and ricocheting between disasters like the worker suicides at its Chinese manufacturing partner Foxconn and the embarrassing shortcomings of new products like Apple Maps.", "At the center of Kane\u2019s account is Tim Cook, Jobs\u2019s handpicked successor, a fiercely analytical executive so skilled in the combat art of supply-chain economics that he called himself the \u201cAttila the Hun of inventory.\u201d Kane traces Cook\u2019s story back to Robertsdale, Ala., the small rural town where he grew up. He was a standout student and a trombone player in the school band. After studying industrial engineering at Auburn University, he was recruited by IBM and fell into the computer revolution, even though he had never been a PC enthusiast.", "The portrait that emerges is hazy and somewhat colorless, because Cook, a workaholic, has himself disclosed so few personal details to colleagues and appears to have no close friends willing to enhance the picture. In one anecdote Kane relates, Jobs asks his executives to go home and try out Apple\u2019s new iMovie software. Some make films of their kids. Cook, unable or unwilling to reveal personal details, returns with a movie about the tribulations of Palo Alto real estate. \u201cThe new C.E.O. was a cipher, a blank slate,\u201d Kane writes. And later: \u201cHe was an unreadable mystery.\u201d", "Cook is unfailingly rational, except when it comes to dealing with Apple\u2019s suppliers, at which point he apparently channels his inner Khrushchev to obtain the best deal terms. Kane charts the ramifications of that strategy: brutal, dehumanizing conditions in the factories of Apple\u2019s Chinese manufacturing partners.", "Here \u201cHaunted Empire\u201d adds to the deep reporting over the last few years into Chinese labor conditions by The New York Times, Bloomberg and other news outlets. Ai Qi is a 23-year-old factory worker at a Foxconn facility in Shenzhen who wears a long-sleeve jumpsuit and face mask but no gloves during her eight- to 10-hour shifts as she handles materials that may or may not cause infertility. Kane\u2019s portrayal of Ai\u2019s life is heartbreaking. She comforts herself with pop songs, contemplates suicide and looks blankly at the inexplicable motivational slogans on the walls of her factory, such as \u201cDucks can make noises, only eagles know how to solve a problem.\u201d There are costs associated with each new iPhone beyond the price tag and the fatigue that comes with camping outside an Apple store the night before it goes on sale.", "The final third of \u201cHaunted Empire\u201d devolves into a retelling of the setbacks that have bedeviled Apple over the last few years. There are overhyped press events to unveil unspectacular upgrades; services that don\u2019t work as well as advertised, like the voice-activated assistant Siri; and Cook\u2019s firing of Scott Forstall, chief of the division that makes the software that runs iPhones and iPads. These tea leaves have been scrutinized by the vast Apple commentariat, and little new light is shed on them here. Kane also gives blow-by-blow treatment to Apple\u2019s patent battle with Samsung, which culminated in a lengthy trial in a San Jose, Calif., courtroom in 2012. It\u2019s \u201ca complex case swirling in arcane and often dreary technicalities,\u201d Kane writes. Indeed. The judge in the case lost patience with the lavishly lawyered sides as they jockeyed for position in the inevitable appeal, and so will readers.", "Kane argues that the lawsuits are symptomatic of a larger problem at Apple: a company looking back instead of forging ahead. All of the missteps, \u201ccoalescing at the same time, created a wave of momentum, pulling Apple down,\u201d she writes. But you don\u2019t need to be a mouth-\u00adfoaming Apple fanboy to see the problems with that argument. Apple\u2019s goose is far from cooked. Its cash hoard is impressive. The stock has stagnated, but that may be as much a function of previously unreasonable highs. The biggest question concerns Apple\u2019s ability to produce more game-changing devices like the iPhone and iPad. While the faithful may lament the fact that their wrists have yet to be gloriously festooned with an iWatch, such a device is likely coming soon.", "Apple\u2019s problem, if it can really be called that, is that it has always been limited by its own orthodoxies. It wants to make beautiful products that people love, as Cook is fond of saying in interviews. It also wants to control every aspect of its products, which means it exerts strict control over its software and hardware and usually declines to let other companies license its designs. That philosophy allows Apple to produce meticulously constructed, high-end devices and to set its prices accordingly. The strategy also opened the door for Microsoft with its Windows operating system running on PCs in the late 1980s, and the same dynamic is now recurring with Google\u2019s Android operating system running on phones and tablets from Samsung and others. Android\u2019s popularity around the world, particularly in low-income countries, is less the result of Tim Cook\u2019s lack of imagination than of Steve Jobs\u2019s core philosophy and unwavering aesthetic.", "In fact, \u201cHaunted Empire\u201d reminds one of just how many problems Apple\u2019s co-founder handed off to his successor. It was Jobs, furious at his putative allies at Google, who steered Apple into its endless patent battle with Samsung over Android. And it was Jobs, aiming to dethrone Jeff Bezos as the king of digital books, who clumsily herded book publishers into a pricing scheme that attracted the attention of the Justice Department, and which a judge later found to be unlawful. In a sense, Cook is still cleaning up messes left by the man whom the world roundly crowned, in a period of understandable mourning, as an unparalleled business genius.", "Jobs set an unmatchable standard for Tim Cook and for all future Apple C.E.O.s.

Comcast and other broadband providers point out that Netflix sucks up about 30 percent of the system\u2019s capacity, so that it should pay more than others only makes sense.", "But why should you, as someone who just wants to use the web to surf or watch programming, care whether companies like Netflix and Hulu have to pay companies like Comcast and Verizon to ensure smooth feeds? Well, even though consumers won\u2019t be charged directly for the faster service, we all know where those fee increases will end up landing. I just received a notice from Netflix that the price of a new membership is rising $1, to $8.99.

Some diplomats have also suggested that nominating a woman to the post might break a looming deadlock with Parliament. That has generated speculation about the prospects for Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund; Dalia Grybauskaite, the newly re-elected president of Lithuania; and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the Danish prime minister.", "The process of selecting the commission president is also likely to determine candidates for other top jobs, including replacements for Mr. Van Rompuy, a new chief of European Union foreign policy to replace Catherine Ashton of Britain, and a new head of the so-called Eurogroup of finance and economy ministers from countries that are part of the 18-member currency bloc.", "But some commentators have emphasized that ignoring the results of the elections by choosing an outside candidate could create further resentment of Brussels.", "The people have been told that they are voting indirectly for the next commission president, said Corina Stratulat, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cSo how will you be able to justify in the end not going for one of the candidates?\u201d she said. \u201cIf this time, it didn\u2019t lead to what was promised, then why would people engage with it next time?"], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/morning-agenda-what-the-alibaba-i-p-o-means/": ["After months of anticipation, it finally happened: The Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group filed paperwork on Tuesday in the United States to go public, Vindu Goel, Michael J. de la Merced and Neil Gough write in DealBook.

The big numbers Alibaba has put up will probably excite many on Wall Street. The company says, for instance, that goods worth $248 billion were sold on its marketplaces in 2013, an amount more than that of Amazon and eBay combined.

But, unlike Amazon, it does not amass large amounts of inventory. Instead, like eBay, it merely matches buyers and sellers. In some ways, though, Alibaba resembles Google.

But the company did not say exactly how much revenue came from that source.", "Alibaba is growing faster than eBay, Facebook and Google. Its revenue surged 57 percent in the first nine months of its 2013 fiscal year.", "Compared with those American companies, Alibaba has far less revenue. But what excites investors is how much profit it earns. Alibaba\u2019s operating profits in those first nine months totaled $3.1 billion, which was equivalent to 48 percent of revenue \u2014 a margin that is far higher than at Google, eBay and Amazon. Its operating margins are also better than those at other public Chinese Internet firms, including Baidu, a search engine, and Tencent, which is pre-eminent in messaging and gaming.", "\u201cIn the last year or so, they seem to have pulled ahead of Tencent and Baidu,\u201d said Brendan Ahern of KraneShares, which manages an exchange-traded fund that focuses on Chinese Internet stocks.", "Still, investors seeking to fully understand Alibaba may feel shortchanged by Tuesday\u2019s filing.", "For one, the company did not provide crucial numbers that would allow outsiders to better gauge the performance of the two online marketplaces that generate nearly all of its revenue.", "Some investors crave such numbers because they want to see whether Alibaba\u2019s stellar profits growth can continue.

Taobao is a hectic-looking online bazaar where consumers can buy almost anything, from fresh groceries to building supplies to pets to concert tickets. The other is Tmall, a more streamlined marketplace where well-known brands are sold.", "But the filing did not break out revenue or earnings for each marketplace. If growth at one of the two sites starts to slow down, for instance, outsiders might not be able to spot that trend for some time. Instead, Alibaba has combined revenue for both websites under a line called \u201cChina commerce retail business.\u201d That revenue stream was $5.4 billion in the first nine months its 2013 fiscal year, which was more than 60 percent higher than in the same period of 2012. The Chinese retail revenue accounted for 83 percent of the firm\u2019s total revenue of $6.5 billion in the period. Alibaba did not break out costs or earnings for the segment.", "The Chinese company has gone to some lengths to explain its mobile business. Investors want to see evidence that the company can still post strong profit growth as consumers increase their use of mobile devices for shopping. Alibaba said that in the last three months of 2013, 19.7 percent of \u201cgross merchandise value,\u201d or the value of goods sold on its sites, came from mobile users. That is a sizable increase from 7.4 percent at the end of 2012. Alibaba, however, did not break out details for revenue from mobile. Other large e-commerce firms also do not break out such figures, but Facebook does disclose how much of its advertising revenue comes from mobile.", "The big question hanging over Alibaba\u2019s I.P.O. is whether it can protect its profits. Sometimes, such high levels of profitability can signal that a company has advantages that may fade and expose it to competition.", "Alibaba\u2019s supporters, however, say that the firm is fiercely competitive \u2014 and has gone to great efforts to keep rivals at bay.", "The company has also taken brash steps to defend its revenue that, for now at least, seem to be paying off. The company, for instance, does not allow Baidu, the search engine, to search its marketplaces. As a result, consumers go straight to Alibaba\u2019s sites to perform their shopping searches. This deprives Baidu of a form of ad revenue that Google has long earned when consumers click through to sellers from its search engine. Instead, Alibaba gets the search revenue.", "As savvy as the Baidu ban looks now, it may become a source of concern. As the number of listings on Alibaba grows, it will need to ensure it attracts a steady flow of traffic to its sites. To do that, it may need the help of outside sites, like Baidu. If that were to happen, it might become less profitable as it is forced to share revenue with other firms.", "But Alibaba\u2019s public offering document only makes one mention of Baidu.", "Analysts who are bullish on Alibaba say it makes sense to value it in line with Baidu or Tencent. Those firms have stock market values around 30 times the earnings analysts expect for next year. Applying that multiple to Alibaba\u2019s 2013 calendar-year earnings of $3.6 billion would value the company at $108 billion, well below the $200 billion some analysts think is possible. To get to the higher number, they use estimates of future earnings, which they expect to be much higher as Alibaba increases its presence in China, where e-commerce activity is below that of Western countries.", "\u201cInvestors are longing for growth \u2014 and here\u2019s a company that really has it,\u201d Mr. Ahern said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/business/media/prominent-hollywood-group-opposes-fcc-action-on-net-neutrality.html": ["LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Caucus for Producers, Writers and Directors, a small but prestigious association of those who create television and new media programs, has staked out a position in the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d debate.

Having helped advance the fundamental face-matching technology in the 1990s, he went into business and promoted the systems to government agencies looking to identify criminals or prevent identity fraud. \u201cWe saved lives,\u201d he said during the conference in mid-March. \u201cWe have solved crimes.\u201d", "Thanks in part to his boosterism, the global business of biometrics \u2014 using people\u2019s unique physiological characteristics, like their fingerprint ridges and facial features, to learn or confirm their identity \u2014 is booming. It generated an estimated $7.2 billion in 2012, according to reports by Frost & Sullivan.", "Making his rounds at the trade show, Dr. Atick, a short, trim man with an indeterminate Mediterranean accent, warmly greeted industry representatives at their exhibition booths. Once he was safely out of earshot, however, he worried aloud about what he was seeing. What were those companies\u2019 policies for retaining and reusing consumers\u2019 facial data? Could they identify individuals without their explicit consent? Were they running face-matching queries for government agencies on the side?", "Now an industry consultant, Dr. Atick finds himself in a delicate position. While promoting and profiting from an industry that he helped foster, he also feels compelled to caution against its unfettered proliferation. He isn\u2019t so much concerned about government agencies that use face recognition openly for specific purposes \u2014 for example, the many state motor vehicle departments that scan drivers\u2019 faces as a way to prevent license duplications and fraud. Rather, what troubles him is the potential exploitation of face recognition to identify ordinary and unwitting citizens as they go about their lives in public. Online, we are all tracked. But to Dr. Atick, the street remains a haven, and he frets that he may have abetted a technology that could upend the social order.", "Face-matching today could enable mass surveillance, \u201cbasically robbing everyone of their anonymity,\u201d he says, and inhibit people\u2019s normal behavior outside their homes. Pointing to the intelligence documents made public by Edward J. Snowden, he adds that once companies amass consumers\u2019 facial data, government agencies might obtain access to it, too.", "To many in the biometrics industry, Dr. Atick\u2019s warning seems Cassandra-like. Face recognition to them is no different from a car, a neutral technology whose advantages far outweigh the risks. The conveniences of biometrics seem self-evident: Your unique code automatically accompanies you everywhere. They envision a world where, instead of having to rely on losable ID cards or on a jumble of easily forgettable \u2014 not to mention hackable \u2014 passwords, you could unlock your smartphone or gain entry to banks, apartment complexes, parking garages and health clubs just by showing your face.", "Dr. Atick sees convenience in these kinds of uses as well. But he provides a cautionary counterexample to make his case. Just a few months back, he heard about NameTag, an app that, according to its news release, was available in an early form to people trying out Google Glass. Users had only to glance at a stranger and NameTag would instantly return a match complete with that stranger\u2019s name, occupation and public Facebook profile information. \u201cWe are basically allowing our fellow citizens to surveil us,\u201d Dr. Atick told me on the trade-show floor.", "(His sentiments were shared by Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law. Concerned that NameTag might facilitate stalking, Mr. Franken requested that its public introduction be delayed; in late April, the app\u2019s developer said he would comply with the request. Google has said that it will not approve facial recognition apps on Google Glass.)", "Dr. Atick is just as bothered by what could be brewing quietly in larger companies. Over the past few years, several tech giants have acquired face-recognition start-up businesses. In 2011, Google bought Pittsburgh Pattern Recognition, a computer vision business developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2012, Facebook bought Face.com, an Israeli start-up.", "Google and Facebook both declined to comment for this article about their plans for the technology.", "Dr. Atick says the technology he helped cultivate requires some special safeguards. Unlike fingerprinting or other biometric techniques, face recognition can be used at a distance, without people\u2019s awareness; it could then link their faces and identities to the many pictures they have put online. But in the United States, no specific federal law governs face recognition. A division of the Commerce Department is organizing a meeting of industry representatives and consumer advocates on Tuesday to start hammering out a voluntary code of conduct for the technology\u2019s commercial use.", "Dr. Atick has been working behind the scenes to influence the outcome. He is part of a tradition of scientists who have come to feel responsible for what their work has wrought. \u201cI think that the industry has to own up,\u201d he asserts. \u201cIf we do not step up to the plate and accept responsibility, there could be unexpected apps and consequences.\u201d", "\u2018Not an Innocent Machine\u2019", "A few uses of face recognition are already commonplace. It\u2019s what allows Facebook and Google Plus to automatically suggest name tags for members or their friends in photographs.", "And more applications could be in the works. Google has applied for a patent on a method to identify faces in videos and on one to allow people to log on to devices by winking or making other facial expressions. Facebook researchers recently reported how the company had developed a powerful pattern-recognition system, called DeepFace, which had achieved near-human accuracy in identifying people\u2019s faces.", "But real-time, automated face recognition is a relatively recent phenomenon and, at least for now, a niche technology. In the early 1990s, several academic researchers, including Dr. Atick, hit upon the idea of programming computers to identify a face\u2019s most distinguishing features; the software then used those local points to recognize that face when it reappeared in other images.", "To work, the technology needs a large data set, called an image gallery, containing the photographs or video stills of faces already identified by name. Software automatically converts the topography of each face in the gallery into a unique mathematical code, called a faceprint. Once people are faceprinted, they may be identified in existing or subsequent photographs or as they walk in front of a video camera.", "The technology is already in use in law enforcement and casinos. In New York, Pennsylvania and California, police departments with face-recognition systems can input the image of a robbery suspect taken from a surveillance video in a bank, for instance, and compare the suspect\u2019s faceprint against their image gallery of convicted criminals, looking for a match. And some casinos faceprint visitors, seeking to identify repeat big-spending customers for special treatment. In Japan, a few grocery stores use face-matching to classify some shoppers as shoplifters or even \u201ccomplainers\u201d and blacklist them.", "Whether society embraces face recognition on a larger scale will ultimately depend on how legislators, companies and consumers resolve the argument about its singularity. Is faceprinting as innocuous as photography, an activity that people may freely perform? Or is a faceprint a unique indicator, like a fingerprint or a DNA sequence, that should require a person\u2019s active consent before it can be collected, matched, shared or sold?", "Dr. Atick is firmly in the second camp.", "His upbringing influenced both his interest in identity authentication and his awareness of the power conferred on those who control it. He was born in Jerusalem in 1964 to Christian parents of Greek and French descent. Conflict based on ethnic and religious identity was the backdrop of his childhood. He was an outsider, neither Jewish nor Muslim, and remembers often having to show an identity booklet listing his name, address and religion.", "\u201cAs a 5- or 6-year old boy, seeing identity as a foundation for trust, I think it marked me,\u201d Dr. Atick says. To this day, he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving his New York apartment without his driver\u2019s license or passport.", "After a childhood accident damaged his eyesight, he became interested in the mechanics of human vision. Eventually, he dropped out of high school to write a physics textbook. His family moved to Miami, and he decided to skip college. It did not prove a setback; at 17, he was accepted to a doctoral program in physics at Stanford.", "Still interested in how the brain processes visual information, he started a computational neuroscience lab at Rockefeller University in Manhattan, where he and two colleagues began programming computers to recognize faces. To test the accuracy of their algorithms, they acquired the most powerful computer they could find, a Silicon Graphics desktop, for their lab and mounted a video camera on it. They added a speech synthesizer so the device could read certain phrases aloud.", "As Dr. Atick tells it, he concluded that the system worked after he walked into the lab one day and the computer called out his name, along with those of colleagues in the room. \u201cWe were just milling about and you heard this metallic voice saying: \u2018I see Joseph. I see Norman. I see Paul,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Atick recounts. Until then, most face recognition had involved analyzing static images, he says, not identifying a face amid a group of live people. \u201cWe had made a breakthrough.\u201d", "The researchers left academia to start their own face-recognition company, called Visionics, in 1994. Dr. Atick says he hadn\u2019t initially considered the ramifications of their product, named FaceIt. But when intelligence agencies began making inquiries, he says, it \u201cstarted dawning on me that this was not an innocent machine.\u201d", "He helped start an international biometrics trade group, and it came up with guidelines like requiring notices in places where face recognition was in use. But even in a nascent industry composed of a few companies, he had little control.", "In 2001, his worst-case scenario materialized. A competitor supplied the Tampa police with a face-recognition system; officers covertly deployed it on fans attending Super Bowl XXXV. The police scanned tens of thousands of fans without their awareness, identifying a handful of petty criminals, but no one was detained.", "Journalists coined it the \u201cSnooper Bowl.\u201d Public outrage and congressional criticism ensued, raising issues about the potential intrusiveness and fallibility of face recognition that have yet to be resolved.", "Dr. Atick says he thought this fiasco had doomed the industry: \u201cI had to explain to the media this was not responsible use.\u201d", "Then, a few months later, came the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Dr. Atick immediately went to Washington to promote biometrics as a new method of counterterrorism. He testified before congressional committees and made the rounds on nightly news programs where he argued that terrorism might be prevented if airports, motor vehicle departments, law enforcement and immigration agencies used face recognition to authenticate people\u2019s identities.", "\u201cTerror is not faceless,\u201d he said in one segment on ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight.\u201d \u201cTerror has measurable identity, has a face that can be detected through technology that\u2019s available today.\u201d", "It was an optimistic spin, given that the technology at that early stage did not work well in uncontrolled environments.", "Still, Dr. Atick prospered. He merged his original business with other biometrics enterprises, eventually forming a company called L-1 Identity Solutions. In 2011, Safran, a military contractor in France, bought the bulk of that company for about $1.5 billion, including debt.", "Dr. Atick had waited 17 years for a cash payout from his endeavors; his take amounted to tens of millions of dollars.", "In fact, some experts view his contribution to the advancement of face recognition as not so much in research but in recognizing its business potential and capitalizing on it.", "\u201cHe actually was one of the early commercializers of face-recognition algorithms,\u201d says P. Jonathon Phillips, an electronics engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which evaluates the accuracy of commercial face-recognition engines.", "Ovals, Squares and Matches", "At Knickerbocker Village, a 1,600-unit red-brick apartment complex in Lower Manhattan where Julius and Ethel Rosenberg once lived, the entryways click open as residents walk toward the doors. It is one of the first properties in New York City to install a biometrics system that uses both face and motion recognition, and it is a showcase for FST Biometrics, the Israeli security firm that designed the program.", "\u201cThis development will make obsolete keys, cards and codes \u2014 because your identity is the key,\u201d says Aharon Zeevi Farkash, the chief executive of FST. \u201cYour face, your behavior, your biometrics are the key.\u201d", "On a recent visit to New York, Mr. Farkash offered to demonstrate how it worked. We met at the Knickerbocker security office on the ground floor. There, he posed before a webcam, enabling the system to faceprint and enroll him. To test it, he walked outside into the courtyard and approached one of the apartment complex entrances. He pulled open an outer glass door, heading directly toward a camera embedded in the wall near an inner door.", "Back in the security office, a monitor broadcast video of the process.", "First, a yellow oval encircled Mr. Farkash\u2019s face in the video, indicating that the system had detected a human head. Then a green square materialized around his head. The system had found a match. A message popped up on the screen: \u201cRecognized, Farkash Aharon. Confidence: 99.7 percent.\u201d", "On his third approach, the system pegged him even sooner \u2014 while he was opening the outer door.", "Mr. Farkash says he believes that systems like these, which are designed to identify people in motion, will soon make obsolete the cumbersome, time-consuming security process at most airports.", "\u201cThe market needs convenient security,\u201d he told me; the company\u2019s system is now being tested at one airport.", "Mr. Farkash served in the Israeli army for nearly 40 years, eventually as chief of military intelligence. Now a major general in the army reserves, he says he became interested in biometrics because of two global trends: the growth of densely populated megacities and the attraction that dense populations hold for terrorists.", "In essence, he started FST Biometrics because he wanted to improve urban security. Although the company has residential, corporate and government clients, Mr. Farkash\u2019s larger motive is to convince average citizens that face identification is in their best interest. He hopes that people will agree to have their faces recognized while banking, attending school, having medical treatments and so on.", "If all the \u201cthe good guys\u201d were to volunteer to be faceprinted, he theorizes, \u201cthe bad guys\u201d would stand out as obvious outliers. Mass public surveillance, Mr. Farkash argues, should make us all safer.", "Safer or not, it could have chilling consequences for human behavior.", "A private high school in Los Angeles also has an FST system. The school uses the technology to recognize students when they arrive \u2014 a security measure intended to keep out unwanted interlopers. But it also serves to keep the students in line.", "\u201cIf a girl will come to school at 8:05, the door will not open and she will be registered as late,\u201d Mr. Farkash explained. \u201cSo you can use the system not only for security but for education, for better discipline.\u201d", "Faceprints and Civil Liberties", "In February, Dr. Atick was invited to speak at a public meeting on face recognition convened by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. It was part of an agency effort to corral industry executives and consumer advocates into devising a code for the technology\u2019s commercial use.", "But some tech industry representatives in attendance were reluctant to describe their plans or make public commitments to limit face recognition.

Where is Facebook?\u201d he loudly asked the audience at one point.", "\u201cHere,\u201d one voice in the auditorium volunteered. That was about the only public contribution from the two companies that day.", "The agency meetings on face recognition are continuing. In a statement, Matt Kallman, a Google spokesman, said the company was \u201cparticipating in discussions to advance our view that the industry should make sure technology is in line with people\u2019s expectations.\u201d", "A Facebook spokeswoman, Jodi Seth, said in a statement that the company was participating in the process. \u201cMulti-stakeholder dialogues like this are critical to promoting people\u2019s privacy,\u201d she said, \u201cbut until a code of conduct exists, we can\u2019t say whether we will sign it.\u201d", "The fundamental concern about faceprinting is the possibility that it would be used to covertly identify a live person by name \u2014 and then serve as the link that would connect them, without their awareness or permission, to intimate details available online, like their home addresses, dating preferences, employment histories and religious beliefs. It\u2019s not a hypothetical risk. In 2011, researchers at Carnegie Mellon reported in a study that they had used a face-recognition app to identify some students on campus by name, linking them to their public Facebook profiles and, in some cases, to their Social Security numbers.", "As with many emerging technologies, the arguments tend to coalesce around two predictable poles: those who think the technology needs rules and regulation to prevent violations of civil liberties and those who fear that regulation would stifle innovation.

Those steps, he says, would inhibit sites, stores, apps and appliances from covertly linking a person in the real world with their multiple online personas.", "\u201cSome people believe that I am maybe inhibiting the industry from growing.

Philip J. Weiser, dean of the University of Colorado Law School, said, common-carrier regulation \u201cis not a panacea.\u201d If the F.C.C. were to use it, he said, there would most likely be years of litigation. Even if the classification withstood a legal challenge, he said, it might not improve the situation. Priority service would presumably be permitted for a \u201creasonable fee\u201d so long as that fee was offered to everybody.", "\u201cIt\u2019s like FedEx,\u201d he said. \u201cYou pay a certain amount for overnight delivery and a certain amount for two-day delivery.

Privacy advocates say that allowing companies to collect all kinds of data \u2014 from web browsing to buying habits \u2014 opens the door to abuses like discriminating against the poor, older people or minorities, or deploying marketing tactics that exploit them.

Besides, they add, there is a fast-growing economy fueled by data, generating jobs and wealth for America.", "The appropriate target for policy is a reasonable subject of debate. But I was struck by the candor and clarity on certain critical issues in the PCAST report, especially given its membership.

This is a kind of market failure.\u201d", "That is hardly the only way the market for online privacy is tilted against the individual. In an interview last week, Mr. Podesta repeatedly used the term \u201casymmetry\u201d to describe the present state of affairs, in which consumers have little idea of how data about their online behavior is collected, traded and analyzed, or for what purposes. To simplify for the purpose of explanation: On one side of the screen is grandma looking for information on arthritis treatments and for gifts for her grandchildren, while on the other side of that screen is a Ph.D. quant from Google, a Silicon Valley start-up or some other company, looking to maximize grandma\u2019s value.", "The answer, the PCAST report suggests, is to change the market, shifting the responsibility for privacy. \u201cThe primary burden,\u201d the report states, \u201cmust fall on the commercial user of big data and not on the consumer.\u201d", "If that occurred, it would be a big change indeed.

A profile supplied by the American Civil Liberties Union might give particular weight to individual rights, while a profile offered by Consumer Reports might be weighted toward economic value for the consumer.", "Technology can help, the report states, but it is not the whole answer. \u201cRules and regulations provide both deterrence of harmful actions and incentives to deploy privacy-protecting technologies,\u201d the report states. \u201cPrivacy protection cannot be achieved by technical measures alone.\u201d", "The concept of changing market incentives and responsibilities has a lot of appeal. That\u2019s what happened in consumer finance. A few rules were set in place, including a $50 limit on individual liability for fraudulent changes on a credit card that was lost or stolen.

Recovering (still) from childhood sexual abuse by a neighbor, I couldn\u2019t transcend romantic failure.", "One night my friend Lourdes, a child psychologist who moonlighted as a yoga teacher, invited me over to fix my love life. After dinner, while drinking mint tea, she said, \u201cYou just have to visualize the exact man you want.\u201d", "Although this seemed very woo-woo, I closed my eyes. Immediately I saw Peter, a brooding soul who also had been abused as a child. Throughout my 20s I\u2019d had a relationship with him \u2014 if you can call hot, sporadic sex with an emotionally unavailable guy a relationship.", "It had been years since I had seen him. So I was shocked to find him lingering in my brain: Being in love with him was a secret I had kept even from myself. All the more shameful was my buried-yet-unequivocal conviction that Peter was the only man who could mend me. On some subterranean level, I believed if we could only be together, his abuse and my abuse would cancel each other out in some mysterious arithmetic of healing.", "I had never confessed this to anyone. But suddenly it came pouring out of me. Lourdes, with black goddess curls cascading down her shoulders (my own brunette frizz worked more horizontally), said I should listen to my inner wisdom.", "\u201cNow that you know who you want,\u201d she said, \u201cthe universe will bring him to you.\u201d", "Like Lourdes, I had been wielding crystals since the \u201980s. Colorful chakra books and CDs on synchronicity were part of my world. But as the child of an Auschwitz survivor, I saw flaws in New Age positions claiming that thoughts alone could determine destiny. This mind-set blamed people like my grandparents for their own murders. Better to hold on to skepticism, I reasoned, despite my tarot-loving tendencies.", "Then again, maybe Lourdes had it right. No stranger to loneliness, hadn\u2019t she manifested (her terminology) a handsome husband at age 40? The guy was clearly a catch, even if he was from the opposite end of the political spectrum.", "At home that night I picked up a journal I had received as a gift. On the first page I wrote: \u201cPeter will come and find me.\u201d Then I sat in a meditation pose pushing away these facts: 1) I\u2019d had no contact with Peter in 11 years. 2) He had no idea where I lived now. 3) Last I heard, he was married and living thousands of miles away.", "I had no intention of interfering with his marriage. Mostly, I pictured Peter and me having a conversation in which I confessed my therapy-resistant brokenness and he, more than anyone, understood. Then we would exchange childhood war stories.", "I believed this interaction would somehow fix my foundation. At the same time, I found the idea ludicrous.", "But when I looked for Peter on Google a few days later, I saw that he was coming to my city to perform a one-night-only, one-person play about his abuse. I was floored. And I was free. I usually taught on Monday nights, but I had that evening off for spring break. Coincidence?", "The night of the performance I sat in the dark theater, sweating, as Peter spilled his trauma onto the stage. His father had been a madman, and Peter spoke eloquently about how this had damaged him. I identified with the powerlessness and self-hatred he detailed. His courage inspired me. After the play, as well-wishers dissipated, I stepped forward to congratulate him.", "There was no wife to be seen.", "We met for lunch the next day, and I told him everything: craving him, visualizing him, being unable to heal. When I was done, Peter told me he was divorced, tired of living in his hometown, and he, too, had been in love with me all those years ago. The next thing I remember we were naked. In the weeks that followed Peter and I emailed frequently. I couldn\u2019t believe it: I was having a relationship with a man I adored. And he was reciprocating.", "No longer a tepid believer, I became a zealot.", "\u201cYou can have whatever you wish for,\u201d I declared at a dinner party.", "\u201cNonsense!\u201d my lawyer friend shouted.", "My friends circled me as accusations flew involving Darfur and pancreatic cancer.

I didn\u2019t care what the material was; it kept out the cold. Sort of.", "I didn\u2019t want to see it at first, but a pattern had developed with Peter. If I emailed him, he wrote right back. If I didn\u2019t write, he didn\u2019t, either \u2014 that is, until I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and wrote him again.", "Finally, the first week of May, two months after our reunion, I went to see him for the weekend. He seemed happy about my plan to visit, but once I got there, though he was kind, he kept picking fights. It was as if his ex-wife was standing just behind my right shoulder, and he was playing out ugly scenes with her.", "When I left on Sunday, I still had hope, reasoning that he was just grieving his marriage. A few days later he emailed: \u201cThis is not a good time for us.\u201d", "I felt humiliated and unmoored.", "Feeling betrayed by Peter, Lourdes and my own doped-up religiosity, I poured my pain into my own one-person play. Mine was about losing my mother 10 years earlier. To research her life, I traveled to Poland and Germany, where I wandered concentration camps, Nazi ghettos and the sites of death marches.", "This confrontation with brutality gave me a strange relief. I finally felt grounded in the real world, where there was no correlation between what a person desired and what the universe offered. When I returned to the United States, I spent a year on my play. I gave up dating. At bookstores I avoided any aisle that featured dead ancestors, angels or the I Ching.", "But one day, while putting final touches on my dramatic piece, I began listening to an interview I had conducted with my mother while still in college. It contained her entire war story. I had recently found the old TDK cassette and had it digitized.", "All of a sudden there was an anecdote I had forgotten. In the last months of the war, my mother lay dying of typhus on the stone floor of a concentration camp, surrounded by corpses. In a stroke of luck, there was a small window where she could see a bit of sky. She thought that if she looked out the window every day, imagining she could fly, the typhus wouldn\u2019t take her. It didn\u2019t.", "I decided magical thinking was encoded into my DNA. It was who I was.", "Under a tangle of socks I found the journal I had used to bring forth Peter. If I wanted love, why wouldn\u2019t I do everything in my power to make it happen? Nothing short of this commitment made any sense.", "Turning to a fresh page, I wrote: \u201cI will be in a serious relationship very soon.\u201d", "A few weeks later, after a slew of Match.com dates (I was taking the practical route, too), I went to lunch with Kurt, a man who was neither dark nor brooding. He was from Indiana.", "In that bright French bistro, Kurt talked about a childhood filled with the usual cuts and bruises, but he was not the least bit abused. I liked his carefully combed hair, boyish grin and earnest blue eyes. But could he help heal me? Partners of abuse survivors can\u2019t avoid taking on this healing role; the residue of sexual violation shows up the minute one of us is touched.", "Despite my doubts, I became animated in his company. My hand gestures grew huge until, during a burst of enthusiasm, I spilled my glass of red wine all over Kurt\u2019s light khakis. Time paused: I was certain this stranger would unveil something unsavory. I held my breath, anticipating a flash of rage or a casual infliction of harm.", "Instead, Kurt threw his head back and laughed.", "\u201cI\u2019m so glad you did that,\u201d he said with a toothy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s something I usually do.\u201d", "Safety felt odd, but as Kurt walked me home, he took my hand. His meaty palm made me calm.", "When we arrived at my building, to my surprise, Kurt kissed me, passionately, in broad daylight. I kissed him back. Three years later, on a snowy December day, we were married.", "Had I conjured Peter from my past to get him out of my system so I could find true love?

In addition to using offshore earnings to acquire foreign targets, our existing cost sharing arrangement requires our foreign affiliates to fund the acquisition of the foreign technology rights of our domestic targets to comply with U.S. tax law. As approximately 50% of our revenues are generated in non-U.S. markets, this will result in a significant use of foreign earnings for both domestic and foreign acquisitions.", "Accordingly, we continue to believe that it is reasonable to forecast that Google needs between $20 to $30 billion of foreign earnings to fund potential acquisitions of foreign targets and foreign technology rights from U.S. targets in 2013 and beyond."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/us/limits-to-law-and-information-sharing-despite-gunmans-danger-signs.html": ["LOS ANGELES \u2014 Elliot O. Rodger was a young college student who had few friends, detested his roommates and spent much of his time alone, reveling in the isolation of a local golf course or the beaches near Isla Vista, where he lived.", "But a review of the three years leading up to Friday night, when Mr. Rodger killed six people and injured 13 others before shooting himself near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, suggests a series of flash points where his often bizarre and unsettling behavior might have drawn the attention of the authorities and, potentially, signaled his violent plans.", "Mr. Rodger, 22, had been planning his \u201cDay of Retribution,\u201d as he called it, for all three years he was in Isla Vista, a period in which he had been under the treatment of therapists; gotten beaten up after trying to shove women off a ledge at a local bar, drawing a visit by the local police; and posted videos on various sites, including one for virgins and another for bodybuilders, that \u2014 if not as explicitly threatening as the one he posted the day of the attack \u2014 nonetheless showed an extremely disturbed young man.", "His behavior alarmed his parents, who had alerted the police, but they found that he did not meet the legal criteria for involuntary psychiatric hospitalization. He stopped attending classes at Santa Barbara City College before his behavior might have caught the attention of behavior therapists there.", "In the end, for all these early warning signs, it is hardly clear that much could have been done to stop this tragedy. Mr. Rodger, like so many mass killers before him, stands as evidence to limits in the laws and regulations \u2014 and the network of communications between police authorities and schools \u2014 intended to flag potentially dangerous figures. That was one reason he was able to legally buy three semiautomatic handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.", "Robert Fein, a psychologist whose specialty is targeted violence and an author of a 2002 report by the Secret Service on school shootings, said warning signs about disturbed individuals preparing for some kind of mass attack are almost always present, but often do not come to the attention of the authorities.", "\u201cIf you look back at any kind of bad situation, there are generally people who have information, but they don\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d Dr. Fein said.", "Public debate after a mass killing inevitably focuses on shortfalls in gun regulations or state laws that govern when someone can be involuntarily held for psychiatric reasons. But no less important, according to law enforcement and mental health experts, would be to improve the sharing of information about potentially violent people among the police, schools, mental health professionals and relatives.", "And mental health practitioners themselves may unwittingly impede that process, experts say.", "Kevin Cameron, executive director of the Canadian Center for Threat Assessment, who is a consultant to law enforcement and mental health agencies and schools in the United States, said legislation governing professional practice contains provisions that \u201cmake it clear, if we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual may pose a significant threat to their own safety or to others, that we have an obligation to share the information without consent.\u201d", "\u201cMany professionals have let the pendulum swing so far that they believe their primary mandate is to protect privacy at all costs,\u201d he said.", "Still, the missed opportunities, viewed with the benefit of hindsight, are at once frustrating and understandable.", "Mr. Rodger\u2019s mother had seen some of the earlier videos posted on his Facebook page and alerted mental health officials, who in turn sent the police. But Mr. Rodger, for all his inner turmoil, displayed to deputies who showed up at his doorstep the kind of outwardly balanced behavior not uncommon for troubled people when confronted by authority figures.", "\u201cThe police interrogated me outside for a few minutes, asking me if I had suicidal thoughts,\u201d he wrote in a 140-page manifesto explaining his plans for mass murder. \u201cI tactfully told them that it was all a misunderstanding, and they finally left.\u201d", "The police determined they had no grounds to hold him for psychiatric examination \u2014 or, perhaps more significant, to search his apartment, where he had hidden three semiautomatic handguns and a trove of ammunition. Once the police left, Mr. Rodger took down the videos.", "Mr. Cameron said that visit illustrated a common error often made in situations of potential threat. \u201cThey rely too heavily on how they feel about the person at the time they interview him,\u201d he said. The deputies, he said, should have \u201ccared less about how he behaved in the moment they were talking to him than on the data that brought them there in the first place.\u201d", "Mr. Rodger rejected attempts by his parents and therapists to treat him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why my parents wasted money on therapy, as it will never help me in my struggle against such a cruel and unjust world,\u201d he wrote in his manifesto. A doctor prescribed him risperidone, an antipsychotic drug, but Mr. Rodger wrote that after researching the drug, he had refused to take it.", "Under California law, if Mr. Rodger in speaking to a therapist had expressed the violent thoughts found in his manifesto or last video, the therapist would have been required to report it to the authorities. The man Mr. Rodger identified as his therapist in his manifesto did not return telephone calls or emails seeking comment on Monday.", "A friend of the family, Simon Astaire, said he did not know if any such report was made. Mr. Astaire said he had spent time with Mr. Rodger, whom he described as withdrawn but showing no sign of violence. His father, Peter Rodger, was a Hollywood director, and worked as an assistant director on the movie \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d", "\u201cElliot never spoke about guns,\u201d Mr. Astaire said. \u201cNever. Never. Wasn\u2019t part of his character. There was no fascination with it. He didn\u2019t like violent movies as such. That was not part of his character.\u201d", "Laws that set down a mental health professional\u2019s duty to warn the authorities of a specific threat from a client are often narrowly interpreted by practitioners, Mr. Cameron said. In truth, such laws offer latitude for therapists to inform not only the person who is a target but the police and other public agencies.", "His final video, \u201cElliot Rodger\u2019s Retribution,\u201d which left no doubt as to his murderous plans, was not posted until the day attack began, according to Google officials. It was unclear who, if anyone, might have seen it before he mailed out his manifesto to his parents, friends and therapists on Friday night just before the attack began.", "A spokeswoman for Google, which owns YouTube, said the video had been removed on Saturday because it violated the service\u2019s guidelines against acts like stalking, intimidating behavior and the making of threats. The spokeswoman said most videos marked for removal are first flagged by viewers and then examined by special review teams that determine whether they meet the site\u2019s guidelines. Google did not have immediate details on how many people might have seen it before it was taken down.", "Clay Calvert, director of the Marion B. Brechner First Amendment Project at the University of Florida, said YouTube had no legal obligation to monitor videos posted to its site for warning signs of violent behavior or report them to law enforcement.", "\u201cYouTube may have an ethical obligation to monitor postings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are so many postings every day that that becomes truly impossible.\u201d", "Mr. Rodger had been a student at Santa Barbara City College, and many, if not most, colleges these days have a committee or individual in charge of threat assessment, a person who in theory might have responded to unusual behavior by a student. In more sophisticated systems, the college police are in touch with the local police and other schools to share information. But more often than not, that does not happen.", "Santa Barbara City College has a \u201cstrong crisis intervention response structure and team\u201d and provides extensive personal counseling to students, said Lori Gaskin, the president of the school.", "\u201cHowever, Elliot Rodger\u2019s connection to the college was limited,\u201d she said in an email on Monday. \u201cAfter completing three courses at Santa Barbara City College during 2011, he enrolled at various times, including for the recently completed semester, but then either stopped attending or withdrew on each occasion. We have found no record of any discipline or other issues.\u201d"], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/google-releases-employee-data-illustrating-techs-diversity-challenge/": ["Google on Wednesday released statistics on the makeup of its work force, providing numbers that offer a stark glance at how Silicon Valley remains a white man\u2019s world.", "Thirty percent of Google\u2019s 46,170 employees worldwide are women, the company said, and 17 percent of its technical employees are women. Comparatively, 47 percent of the total work force in the United States is women and 20 percent of software developers are women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Of its United States employees, 61 percent are white, 2 percent are black and 3 percent are Hispanic. About one-third are Asian \u2014 well above the national average \u2014 and 4 percent are of two or more races. Of Google\u2019s technical staff, 60 percent are white, 1 percent are black, 2 percent are Hispanic, 34 percent are Asian and 3 percent are of two or more races.", "In the United States work force over all, 80 percent of employees are white, 12 percent are black and 5 percent are Asian, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Google\u2019s disclosures come amid an escalating debate over the lack of diversity in the tech industry. Although tech is a key driver of the economy and makes products that many Americans use ever yday, it does not come close to reflecting the demographics of the country \u2014 in terms of sex, age or race. The lopsided numbers persist among engineers, founders and boards of directors.", "The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr., the civil rights activist, has been pressuring tech companies to release data on the makeup of their workforces. When he appeared at Google\u2019s shareholders meeting this month, David Drummond, Google\u2019s chief legal officer, surprised people when he said the company would release the data. Other tech companies at which Mr. Jackson has appeared, including Hewlett-Packard and Facebook, have not released diversity statistics about their companies.", "\u201cGoogle is not where we want to be when it comes to diversity, and it\u2019s hard to address these kinds of challenges if you\u2019re not prepared to discuss them openly, and with the facts,\u201d Laszlo Bock, Google\u2019s senior vice president for people operations, wrote in a blog post.", "Though Google did not specifically say how it planned to change the numbers, it said that it hoped releasing them would start a dialogue. The company had made changes in the past to recruit and retain women, like lengthening maternity leaves and including women on the teams that interviewed prospective employees, but the numbers reveal it has a long way to go.", "Tech companies have often blamed the lack of diverse workforces on the pipeline \u2014 they can only hire the people who apply for jobs, and those tend to be white and Asian men, they say.", "That is partly true. For instance, only 18.5 percent of high school students who took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science last year were girls. In eight states, no Hispanic students took the test and in 12 states, no black students took it. The problems start as early as childhood, when girls are discouraged by parents and teachers from pursuing technical pursuits.", "Yet some of the blame also falls on tech companies. There can be a sexist culture that turns away women, as evidenced by the high attrition rate among technical women as compared to men. And women who try to start tech companies face exclusion by a venture capital network dominated by a chummy fraternity of men.", "This is all despite the fact that the data \u2014 which in Silicon Valley usually reigns supreme \u2014 shows that diversity on groups benefits research, development, innovation and profit."]}

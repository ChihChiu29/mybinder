For instance: How many types of cells are there in the human body?", "\u201cIf you just Google this, the number everyone uses is 200,\u201d said Jay Shendure, a geneticist at the University of Washington. \u201cBut to me that seems absurdly low.\u201d A number of scientists like him want to build a more complete catalog.", "Yet there are an estimated 37 trillion cells in the human body. The traditional ways to identify cell types \u2014 such as carefully tracing the shape of individual cells under a microscope \u2014 are too slow and crude for the job.", "On Thursday, Dr. Shendure and his colleagues published a report describing a speedy new method for taking such a cell census. Instead of inspecting one cell at a time, they measured the activity of genes inside 42,035 cells at once.", "Although still at an experimental stage, the method may become an essential tool for cataloging every cell type in the human body, experts said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a really important piece of work,\u201d said David M. Miller, a cell biologist at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWith this approach, you can do more for a whole lot less work, and a whole lot less money.\u201d", "In the laboratory, scientists easily discern the difference between, say, a muscle and a nerve cell. But these broad categories encompass many different types of cells.", "A muscle cell might be a skeletal muscle cell, the kind you use to walk or lift a cup. Or it might be a smooth muscle cell lining your small intestines, making it ripple with contractions. Our hearts are built of special muscle cells all their own, known as cardiomyocytes.", "Even these come in different types. Some contract the chambers to pump blood, for example, while others conduct electric impulses around the heart.", "Genetically speaking, all cells in the body are identical. They all carry the same 20,000 or so protein-coding genes. What distinguishes each type is the particular combination of genes the cell uses to make proteins.", "The first step in this process is making a copy of the gene in the form of a molecule called RNA. The cell uses the RNA molecule as a template to build a protein.", "Dr. Shendure and his colleagues reasoned that the distinctive collection of RNA molecules floating around inside a cell could provide clues about the cell\u2019s type. To measure that RNA, they developed a kind of molecular \u201cbar coding.\u201d", "In the first step, the researchers pour thousands of cells into hundreds of miniature \u201cwells.\u201d Each well contains molecular tags that attach themselves to every RNA molecule inside the cells.", "The process is repeated two or more times until each cell ends up with a unique combination of tags attached to its RNA molecules. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues then break open the cells and read the sequences of tags at once.", "The \u201cbar codes\u201d allow the scientists to see which genes are active in each cell. Cells of the same type should share many of those genes in common.", "\u201cWe came up with this scheme that allows us to look at very large numbers of cells at the same time, without ever isolating a single cell,\u201d said Dr. Shendure.", "He and his colleagues call their method sci-RNA-seq (short for single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). To test it, they set out to classify every cell in a tiny worm, Caenorhabditis elegans.", "Scientists know more about C. elegans\u2019s cells than any other animal\u2019s. In the 1960s, the biologist Sydney Brenner made it a model for investigating biological development.", "Dr. Brenner and later generations of scientists tracked the worm\u2019s growth from a single cell to about 1,000 cells at maturity, classifying them into types with a microscope. Eventually, scientists plucked individual cells from the worm\u2019s body and painstakingly measured their DNA activity.", "Dr. Shendure and his colleagues decided to see how results from sci-RNA-seq compared to those from decades of research.", "They raised 150,000 C. elegans larvae and then doused them with chemicals that broke them apart into individual cells. (Each larva has 762 cells, not counting the cells that will become eggs or sperm.) They then tagged all the RNA in the cells.", "With the new method, the researchers were able to identify 27 cell types that had been identified in previous studies. But the team also was able to break them down into smaller groups, each with a slightly different pattern of gene activity.", "They identified 40 different kinds of neurons, for example, including very rare types. In few cases, only a single such neuron develops in each worm.", "\u201cI was excited because it worked extremely well \u2014 they uncovered results that will be valuable for me and for the whole field,\u201d said Cori Bargmann, an expert on C. elegans at the Rockefeller University.", "Yet for now, sci-RNA-seq falls far short of capturing the full complexity of cell types, even in such a simple animal.", "Dr. Shendure and his colleagues could not match some of their clusters of neurons to a known type of cell, and they did not find most of the 118 different types of neurons that earlier studies have documented.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t consider this a finished project,\u201d said Dr. Shendure.", "Dr. Bargmann and her colleagues are already trying to match Dr. Shendure\u2019s results to neurons in the worm. \u201cOf course, there is more to do, but I am pretty optimistic that this can be solved,\u201d she said.", "Sarah A. Teichmann, a cell biologist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute who was not involved in the new study, said the report illustrated how fast the field of cell-typing has moved.", "In a review posted on the pre-publication service Arxiv, Dr. Teichmann and her colleagues noted that it was only in 2009 that scientists managed to measure gene activity this way in a single cell. They broke the thousand-cell barrier just three years ago.", "This exponential increase will be crucial to the success of the Human Cell Atlas, an international initiative of which Dr. Teichmann is a joint leader. The researchers plan to create a complete catalog of every cell type in the human body.", "Dr. Teichmann\u2019s fellow atlas leader, Aviv Regev, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute and MIT, said that differences between the human body and that of C. elegans would require some different strategies.", "For one thing, humans are huge compared to C. elegans. The researchers certainly will not try to dissolve human bodies into 37 trillion loose cells and analyze them all at once.", "\u201cThe human cell atlas initiative will work through organs, tissues and systems,\u201d Dr. Regev said.", "And C. elegans follows a tightly controlled genetic program to build its body. Its cells always end up in the same place, in the same numbers. Humans are a lot more flexible in how they develop: the locations of cells vary from one person\u2019s body to the next.", "\u201cThe trick is to relate cells to the place they came from,\u201d Dr. Regev said.", "Nevertheless, sci-RNA-seq may well become a useful tool for work in humans. \u201cThe major benefit is that it could scale to capture many more cells in one experiment,\u201d Dr. Teichmann said. \u201cIt\u2019s an elegant and potentially very powerful approach.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/business/prepper-survivalism-north-korea.html": ["Shoppers are buying six-month food supplies wrapped in military-grade Mylar pouches, and kits filled with duct tape, food bars and an air-filtration mask.", "Some companies that specialize in selling items to people planning for the worst \u2014 so-called doomsday preppers \u2014 say they have had a bump in sales this week, after tensions rose between the United States and North Korea.

Mr. Trump had pinned the blame for the bigotry and violence \u2014 which left one anti-bigotry protester dead \u2014 on \u201cmany sides.\u201d", "\u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\u201d Mr. Frazier said.", "Within minutes on Monday, Mr. Trump, in far less time than it took him to react to the violence in Charlottesville, was on Twitter criticizing Mr. Frazier. \u201cNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President\u2019s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\u201d", "Later, Mr. Trump renewed his criticism of Merck, tweeting: \u201c@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\u201d", "The silence from the larger C.E.O. community about Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to the situation in Charlottesville has been remarkably conspicuous, even as one of their own has now been attacked online by the president.", "By Monday evening, at least two other C.E.O.s had stepped forward. Kevin Plank, the founder of Under Armour, announced on Twitter that he was resigning from the American Manufacturing Council, saying, among other things, that his company \u201cengages in innovation and sports, not politics.\u201d He did not refer to the president, though.", "Mr. Plank was followed shortly after by Brian Krzanich, the Intel chief executive, who announced on the company\u2019s website that he would step down from the council as well. \u201cI resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,\u201d he said.", "A few big-name corporate leaders released innocuous statements over the weekend condemning the violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. But with the exception of Mr. Frazier, none appear to have directly condemned the president\u2019s choice of words, which have been a lightning rod for Americans from many quarters, even among many Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters.", "At a news conference on Monday, after a barrage of blistering criticism, the president said that \u201cracism is evil.\u201d", "As the day wore on, several executives, including Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, made statements in support of Mr. Frazier, while others \u2014 including Tim Cook of Apple, and the Business Roundtable, which represents some 200 C.E.O.s \u2014 condemned the racism on display in Charlottesville.", "But notably, not one executive on any of the president\u2019s various councils said anything directly about the president.", "The statements from American chief executives that came closest to criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s language came from Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Mr. Krzanich of Intel.", "Mr. Blankfein tweeted on Monday morning: \u201cLincoln: \u2018A house divided against itself cannot stand.\u2019 Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\u201d (Mr. Blankfein is not on any of the president\u2019s councils, which may make it easier for him to be critical.)", "Mr. Krzanich put it this way: \u201cThere should be no hesitation in condemning hate speech or white supremacy by name. #Intel asks all our countries leadership to do the same.\u201d", "Marc Benioff of Salesforce aimed at Mr. Trump with a sarcastic post, saying: \u201cThank you @realDonaldTrump for calling to Love thy neighbor, value equality, & calling evil by name.\u201d", "But how can so many other American business leaders and senior executives remain quiet about the president\u2019s reaction? Where is the moral courage to stand up?", "After all, most companies these days spend countless hours talking about their culture and values. Just last week, Google publicly fired one of its engineers within days of his writing a memo that questioned whether \u201cpersonality differences\u201d between men and women led to there being fewer female engineers in the technology industry.", "How can people like Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, a lead director of Goldman Sachs and an infrastructure investor, remain a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum \u2014 a role highlighted on Mr. Ogunlesi\u2019s company biography? How could Mr. Ogunlesi, an immigrant from Nigeria who was a clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the Supreme Court, stay silent?", "As Justice Marshall himself famously said, \u201cWhere you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy.\u201d", "Mr. Ogunlesi declined to comment, through a spokesman.", "What about Indra Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo? She is a member of the president\u2019s business council and has long been a vocal advocate for minorities. The company said this year that it \u201cdoes not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.\u201d", "When I contacted her about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks over the weekend, a spokesman directed me to a tweet that clearly didn\u2019t mention the president: \u201cHeartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans.\u201d", "In truth, it should not fall to C.E.O.s who are members of minority groups to speak up. They face enough pressure already.", "Some people who have less at stake are going on the record to support Mr. Frazier\u2019s stance against the president. Tom Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, wrote on Twitter on Monday: \u201cKen has stood up for true American values. I call on all other members of Trump\u2019s image-burnishing committees to do the same.\u201d", "Privately, many chief executives say they are fuming, outraged by the president. (This after many of them campaigned to get on Mr. Trump\u2019s committees.) But many are too scared to say anything publicly that could make them or their company a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath.", "Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol against Mr. Frazier and Merck \u2014 a company that depends on the government as a buyer for many of its drugs \u2014 will perhaps have an even greater chilling effect on other C.E.O.s who may consider speaking out. (The potential for economic retribution against Merck also demonstrates just how brave Mr. Frazier was in taking a stand.)", "When I asked one chief executive Monday morning why he had remained publicly silent, he told me: \u201cJust look at what he did to Ken. I\u2019m not sticking my head up.\u201d Which, of course, is the reason he said I could not quote him by name.", "The same trepidation may explain why people like Mr. Ogunlesi don\u2019t say anything. He runs an infrastructure fund that will most likely have to do business with the federal government. And Ms. Nooyi\u2019s PepsiCo, for example, was briefly boycotted by Trump supporters when she made some comments that were construed as critical of him.", "Other C.E.O.s, like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, have contended that they consider it part of their patriotic duty to remain on the president\u2019s business council, even when they disagree with things Mr. Trump says or does.", "\u201cIt is very hard if you say, I\u2019m going to go off an advisory group or not do A-B-C, because you disagree on one issue,\u201d Mr. Dimon said in early June after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, a move that Mr. Dimon was against. Elon Musk of Tesla and Robert Iger of Disney resigned from the council in protest.", "\u201cHonestly, no one is going to agree with every president or prime minister on every issue, so I don\u2019t want to overreact to it,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.", "Lawrence Summers, who has served as Treasury secretary and president of Harvard, said in response to Mr. Dimon\u2019s rationale at the time to Bloomberg News: \u201cAt what point as a patriot is your allegiance to your country rather to your president? I\u2019ve always thought of my allegiance as a patriot as being to my country.\u201d", "On Monday, Mr. Dimon, who is the chairman of the Business Roundtable, put out his own statement about the violence in Charlottesville, but nothing about the president.", "C.E.O.s have faced the question of how to address the president when they disagree with him before \u2014 over immigration, say, or the Paris climate accord. Each time, the executives have justified their silence by saying it is more valuable to be at the table than not.", "That\u2019s a valid argument \u2014 to a point. If the president isn\u2019t following your advice or the values you espouse, when should you get up? Of course, big policy decisions like tax reform remain just around the corner, so many executives are desperate to keep a line open to the president even if it is only one-way.", "It is a fair critique of the president that he didn\u2019t immediately and directly condemn the bigoted actions over the weekend and call them out for what they were \u2014 remarks that tacitly helped normalize such hate.", "While C.E.O.s may call out the hate, will they have the fortitude to call out the president?"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/technology/a-hunt-for-ways-to-disrupt-the-work-of-online-radicalization.html": ["Law enforcement officials, technology companies and lawmakers have long tried to limit what they call the \u201cradicalization\u201d of young people over the internet.", "The term has often been used to describe a specific kind of radicalization \u2014 that of young Muslim men who are inspired to take violent action by the online messages of Islamist groups like the Islamic State. But as it turns out, it isn\u2019t just violent jihadists who benefit from the internet\u2019s power to radicalize young people from afar.", "White supremacists are just as adept at it. Where the pre-internet Ku Klux Klan grew primarily from personal connections and word of mouth, today\u2019s white supremacist groups have figured out a way to expertly use the internet to recruit and coordinate among a huge pool of potential racists. That became clear two weeks ago with the riots in Charlottesville, Va., which became a kind of watershed event for internet-addled racists.", "\u201cIt was very important for them to coordinate and become visible in public space,\u201d said Joan Donovan, a scholar of media manipulation and right-wing extremism at Data & Society, an online research institute. \u201cThis was an attempt to say, \u2018Let\u2019s come out; let\u2019s meet each other. Let\u2019s build camaraderie, and let\u2019s show people who we are.\u2019\u201d", "Ms. Donovan and others who study how the internet shapes extremism said that even though Islamists and white nationalists have different views and motivations, there are broad similarities in how the two operate online \u2014 including how they spread their message, recruit and organize offline actions. The similarities suggest a kind of blueprint for a response \u2014 efforts that may work for limiting the reach of jihadists may also work for white supremacists, and vice versa.", "In fact, that\u2019s the battle plan. Several research groups in the United States and Europe now see the white supremacist and jihadi threats as two faces of the same coin. They\u2019re working on methods to fight both, together \u2014 and slowly, they have come up with ideas for limiting how these groups recruit new members to their cause.", "Their ideas are grounded in a few truths about how extremist groups operate online, and how potential recruits respond. After speaking to many researchers, I compiled this rough guide for combating online radicalization.", "Recognize the internet as an extremist breeding ground.", "The first step in combating online extremism is kind of obvious: It is to recognize the extremists as a threat.", "For the Islamic State, that began to happen in the last few years. After a string of attacks in Europe and the United States by people who had been indoctrinated in the swamp of online extremism, politicians demanded action. In response, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other online giants began identifying extremist content and systematically removing it from their services, and have since escalated their efforts.", "When it comes to fighting white supremacists, though, much of the tech industry has long been on the sidelines. This laxity has helped create a monster. In many ways, researchers said, white supremacists are even more sophisticated than jihadists in their use of the internet.", "The earliest white nationalist sites date back to the founding era of the web. For instance, Stormfront.org, a pioneering hate site, was started as a bulletin board in 1990. White supremacist groups have also been proficient at spreading their messages using the memes, language and style that pervade internet subcultures. Beyond setting up sites of their own, they have more recently managed to spread their ideology to online groups that were once largely apolitical, like gaming and sci-fi groups.", "And they\u2019ve grown huge. \u201cThe white nationalist scene online in America is phenomenally larger than the jihadists\u2019 audience, which tends to operate under the radar,\u201d said Vidhya Ramalingam, the co-founder of Moonshot CVE, a London-based start-up that works with internet companies to combat violent extremism. \u201cIt\u2019s just a stunning difference between the audience size.\u201d", "After the horror of Charlottesville, internet companies began banning and blocking content posted by right-wing extremist groups. So far their efforts have been hasty and reactive, but Ms. Ramalingam sees it as at the start of a wider effort.", "\u201cIt\u2019s really an unprecedented moment where social media and tech companies are recognizing that their platforms have become spaces where these groups can grow, and have been often unpoliced,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really kind of waking up to this and taking some action.\u201d", "Engage directly with potential recruits.", "If tech companies are finally taking action to prevent radicalization, is it the right kind of action? Extremism researchers said that blocking certain content may work to temporarily disrupt groups, but may eventually drive them further underground, far from the reach of potential saviors.", "A more lasting plan involves directly intervening in the process of radicalization. Consider The Redirect Method, an anti-extremism project created by Jigsaw, a think tank founded by Google. The plan began with intensive field research. After interviews with many former jihadists, white supremacists and other violent extremists, Jigsaw discovered several important personality traits that may abet radicalization.", "One factor is a skepticism of mainstream media. Whether on the far right or ISIS, people who are susceptible to extremist ideologies tend to dismiss outlets like The New York Times or the BBC, and they often go in search of alternative theories online.", "Another key issue is timing. There\u2019s a brief window between initial interest in an extremist ideology and a decision to join the cause \u2014 and after recruits make that decision, they are often beyond the reach of outsiders. For instance, Jigsaw found that when jihadists began planning their trips to Syria to join ISIS, they had fallen too far down the rabbit hole and dismissed any new information presented to them.", "Jigsaw put these findings to use in an innovative way. It curated a series of videos showing what life is truly like under the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The videos, which weren\u2019t filmed by news outlets, offered a credible counterpoint to the fantasies peddled by the group \u2014 they show people queuing up for bread, fighters brutally punishing civilians, and women and children being mistreated.", "Then, to make sure potential recruits saw the videos at the right time in their recruitment process, Jigsaw used one of Google\u2019s most effective technologies: ad targeting. In the same way that a pair of shoes you looked up last week follows you around the internet, Jigsaw\u2019s counterterrorism videos were pushed to likely recruits.", "Jigsaw can\u2019t say for sure if the project worked, but it found that people spent lots of time watching the videos, which suggested they were of great interest, and perhaps dissuaded some from extremism.", "Moonshot CVE, which worked with Jigsaw on the Redirect project, put together several similar efforts to engage with both jihadists and white supremacist groups. It has embedded undercover social workers in extremist forums who discreetly message potential recruits to dissuade them. And lately it\u2019s been using targeted ads to offer mental health counseling to those who might be radicalized.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s really effective to go beyond ideology,\u201d Ms. Ramalingam said. \u201cWhen you offer them some information about their lives, they\u2019re disproportionately likely to interact with it.\u201d", "What happens online isn\u2019t all that matters in the process of radicalization. The offline world obviously matters too. Dylann Roof \u2014 the white supremacist who murdered nine people at a historically African-American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 \u2014 was radicalized online. But as a new profile in GQ Magazine makes clear, there was much more to his crime than the internet, including his mental state and a racist upbringing.", "Still, just about every hate crime and terrorist attack, these days, was planned or in some way coordinated online. Ridding the world of all of the factors that drive young men to commit heinous acts isn\u2019t possible. But disrupting the online radicalization machine? With enough work, that may just be possible."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/us/california-today-berkeley-chancellor-free-speech.html": ["Good morning.", "(Want to get California Today by email?

It was their fifth week of coding camp, and they were huddled around laptops, brainstorming designs for their final projects. One group was building a computer game that simulates the experience of going through life with depression and anxiety, while others were drafting plans for websites that track diversity at companies and help connect newly arrived immigrants with local community groups.", "They were working intently when Reshma Saujani, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit organization Girls Who Code, dropped in to offer some encouragement.", "\u201cHow many of you take computer science class at your schools?\u201d she asked. Hands shot up. \u201cAre you the only girls in your class?\u201d she asked. Most of the girls nodded.", "Over the past five years, some 40,000 girls have learned to code through the organization\u2019s summer camps and afterschool programs. But Ms. Saujani wanted to expand the group\u2019s reach, and was looking for new ways to recruit girls into the tech industry.", "For a tech evangelist, her solution was surprisingly retro and analog: books. Girls Who Code is creating a publishing franchise, and plans to release 13 books over the next two years through a multibook deal with Penguin. The titles range from board books and picture books for babies and elementary school children, to nonfiction coding manuals, activity books and journals, and a series of novels featuring girl coders.", "This week, the organization is releasing its first two books \u2014 an illustrated nonfiction coding manual by Ms. Saujani, and a novel, \u201cThe Friendship Code,\u201d which features a group of girls who become friends in an after-school coding club.", "\u201cI wanted to create a series of books that girls could see themselves in, where you could sneak in the algorithms and you sneak in the coding,\u201d Ms. Saujani said.", "Lately, the niche has gotten considerably more crowded. A growing number of children\u2019s books authors are using fiction to teach the fundamentals of coding, a trend that has coincided with a push by Silicon Valley to fund and expand technology training in schools. The organization Code.org provides free online coding lessons, and has crafted coding curriculums for elementary, middle and high school students. Last year, Apple released a free app to teach the programming language Swift. Scratch Jr, a coding program designed for 4- to 7-year-olds, now has some five million users.", "The Girls Who Code books are also arriving at a moment of heightened awareness and outrage over the scarcity and treatment of women in the tech industry. The issue has come into sharp focus in recent weeks, following the controversy over a Google engineer\u2019s memo, in which he argued that women are underrepresented in computer science because of physiological differences. The memo, which led to the engineer\u2019s firing, was widely seen as further proof of pervasive sexism in the industry.", "Ms. Saujani\u2019s effort to counter the industry\u2019s gender imbalance, with coding clubs and now books, seems to have won over some major tech industry figures. Her new coding book features glowing endorsements from the philanthropist Melinda Gates; Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter; and Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.", "The daughter of two engineers who came to the United States as political refugees from Uganda, Ms. Saujani is in some ways an unlikely advocate for computer literacy. Her academic and professional background is in law, history and politics, not technology. Before founding her coding organization, she worked as a lawyer for a hedge fund and ran for Congress in 2010. She lost, spectacularly, and decided to start a nonprofit to teach computer literacy to girls.", "Since its founding in 2012, the organization\u2019s coding clubs have rapidly spread across the country and now meet in 50 states. But demand has outstripped growth: 7,000 girls applied for 1,600 seats at the group\u2019s 80 summer camps.", "So in early 2015, to extend the group\u2019s reach, Ms. Saujani, who published a book for adults about women and leadership in 2013, went to her literary agent and proposed a series of children\u2019s books about coding. At the time, it seemed like an untapped market. Ms. Saujani met with several publishers, and was excited by Penguin\u2019s strategy of flooding every corner of the children\u2019s market, with board books like \u201cBaby Code!\u201d for 3- to 7-year-olds and novels for preteenage girls.", "Some tech experts say books could prove an effective way to recruit future coders, particularly girls, if the stories make programming seem creative and appealing. But others caution that books aren\u2019t a substitute for hand-on instruction. Josh Funk, a software engineer and the author of the picture book \u201cHow to Code a Sandcastle,\u201d which will be published next year as part of the Girls Who Code line, sees books as a way to get kids interested in the subject, not as a stand-in for coding classes. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn how to code by reading a picture book,\u201d he concedes.", "Some of the coding books for kids probably work better as gag gifts than as a training manual for mini Mark Zuckerbergs. John Vanden-Heuvel has created a lucrative subgenre in picture books with his series of coding books for babies, with titles like \u201cHTML for Babies,\u201d \u201cJavaScript for Babies,\u201d and \u201cCSS for Babies.\u201d Mr. Vanden-Heuvel, who created and self-published the books after his son was born sold some 100,000 copies on his own, then got a publishing deal with Sterling Children\u2019s. He later moved on to writing coding books for older kids, like \u201cC++ for Kids,\u201d which is aimed at 3- to 5-year-olds.", "Other authors are weaving coding concepts into the narratives of novels. In September, Disney Hyperion will publish Tamara Ireland Stone\u2019s middle grade novel, \u201cClick\u2019d,\u201d about a girl named Allie who builds an app that goes viral at her CodeGirls summer camp, then realizes a glitch could expose users\u2019 private data.

The series, which is illustrated by Mike Holmes, has become a surprise best-seller: The first three books have more than 200,000 in print. As the characters learn to program robots, readers are exposed to basic coding skills such as how to read binary numbers and sequence code.", "\u201cI wanted to play with the similarities between magic and coding,\u201d said Mr. Yang, who taught computer programming at a high school in Oakland, Calif., for 17 years.", "Stacia Deutsch, who wrote \u201cThe Friendship Code\u201d series, had no background in coding when Penguin hired her to co-write the books in consultation with Ms. Saujani. So she went to afterschool coding workshops at schools around Orange County, Calif., where she lives, and studied the organization\u2019s teaching manual. Using their curriculum, she focused on a handful of programming concepts and integrated them into the plot.", "The novel centers on Lucy, who joins an after-school coding club and starts getting mysterious notes on her locker. To understand the messages, she has to master coding concepts like input/output, loops and variables.", "Ms. Deutsch struggled at times to get those ideas across. In moments of panic, she called a friend who is a coder for guidance. But in other ways, her status as a novice was an asset. Her characters didn\u2019t know much about coding at the beginning of the novel, and neither, she presumes, will many of her readers.", "\u201cI wanted someone who didn\u2019t know anything about coding to get excited about the possibilities,\u201d she said."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/briefing/donald-trump-burkina-faso-paris.html": ["(Want to get this briefing by email?

Those apps helped users connect to the rest of the internet world using technology called virtual private networks, or VPNs.", "Taken together, the recent moves by Apple and Amazon show how Beijing is increasingly forcing America\u2019s biggest tech companies to play by Chinese rules if they want to maintain access to the market. The push comes even as the number of foreign American tech companies able to operate and compete in China has dwindled.", "Beijing has become increasingly emboldened in pushing America\u2019s internet giants to follow its local internet laws, which forbid unregistered censorship-evasion software.

In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.", "Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk.

The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label.

In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.", "It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.", "However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.", "These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.", "We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.", "The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.", "The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.", "Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.", "Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.", "The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/briefing/uber-afghanistan-floyd-mayweather.html": ["Good morning.", "Here\u2019s what you need to know:", "\u2022 Our reporters in Seoul and on our business desk are poised to alert you when the verdict is handed down today in the bribery trial of Lee Jae-yong, the heir to the Samsung empire.", "You can set your iPhone or Android device for breaking news alerts, or sign up here to get them by email.

For a century French politics had been divided between mostly Catholic monarchists and mostly anticlericalist republicans, and the church had championed royalists against the secular republic. But now the pope urged French Catholics to take a different approach \u2014 to rally to the republic, a strategy called \u201cralliement,\u201d and work through republican institutions to protect the church\u2019s liberties and promote the common good.", "In European politics this was a novel gambit, but for American Catholics at the time it amounted to a tacit endorsement of what they were already doing. In the United States there was no ancien regime to imagine restoring, no plausible scenario in which the integration of church and state might be achieved \u2014 and Catholics had been trying to prove their patriotism in a largely Protestant country by rallying to the republic since the founding era.", "So Leo\u2019s letter began a long (and complicated) process of harmonization between America and Rome, sealed in the 1960s at the Second Vatican Council, in which the church\u2019s political thought was tacitly Americanized. No more would the Vatican emphasize the necessity, for Catholics, of supporting an \u201cintegralist\u201d relationship between their government and church. Instead the American way of doing religious politics \u2014 in which a secular political framework allowed a great deal of room for religiously inspired activism \u2014 was blessed and accepted as the Catholic way as well.", "Over the last decade, however, as American Christianity has weakened and American politics become ever-more-polarized, the Catholic position in the United States has become more difficult and perplexing. The Democratic Party, whose long-ago New Deal was built in part on Catholic social thought, has become increasingly secular and ever-more-doctrinaire in its social liberalism. The Republican Party, which under George W. Bush wrapped the Catholic-inflected language of \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d around its pro-life commitments, has been pinballing between an Ayn Rand-ish libertarianism and the white identity politics of the Trump era.", "As a result a sense of disillusionment and homelessness among Catholic thinkers \u2014 younger ones, especially \u2014 has increased. It isn\u2019t just that old 20th century approaches to Catholic politics \u2014 both the ethnic-Catholic liberalism of a Mario Cuomo or a Ted Kennedy and the Catholic neoconservatism that shaped figures like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio or Paul Ryan \u2014 seem like they\u2019re out of energy and influence. It\u2019s also that Western liberalism writ large seems at once hostile to traditional religion and beset by internal contradictions, making the moment ripe for serious Catholic rethinking, a new and perhaps even post-liberal Catholic politics.", "So far that new thinking includes revivals of radicalism on the Catholic left, where people pine for a pro-life Bernie Sanders and flirt anew with baptizing Karl Marx. It includes the lively debate over Rod Dreher\u2019s recent book \u201cThe Benedict Option,\u201d with its insistence that politics cannot save American Christianity and that some form of cultural separatism is essential for religious renewal. And it includes the various Catholic responses to Trump and to the revival of European nationalism \u2014 some of which imagine that out of the crisis of Western liberalism a new or different integralism, a more fully Catholic politics, might eventually be born.", "Meanwhile Rome, and specifically the men around Pope Francis, seem to both misunderstand and fear this new ferment. Both reactions, fear and ignorance, inform a recent essay in the Jesuit magazine La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica, written by two papal confidantes, the Jesuit Rev. Antonio Spadaro and the Protestant journalist Marcelo Figueroa, which has generated thousands of words of intra-Catholic argument in the last few weeks.", "Their essay is bad but important. Its seems to intend, reasonably enough, to warn against Catholic support for the darker tendencies in Trumpism \u2014 the xenophobia and identity politics, the \u201cstigmatization of enemies,\u201d the crude view of Islam and a wider \u201cpanorama of threats,\u201d the prosperity-gospel inflected worship of success.", "But the authors\u2019 understanding of American religion seems to start and end with Google searches and anti-evangelical tracts, and their intended attack on Trumpery expands and expands, conflating very different political and religious tendencies, indulging in paranoia about obscure theocratic Protestants and fringe Catholic websites, and ultimately critiquing every kind of American religious conservatism \u2014 including the largely anti-political Benedict Option and the pro-life activism fulsomely supported by Francis\u2019 papal predecessors \u2014 as dangerously illiberal, \u201ctheopolitical,\u201d Islamic State-esque, \u201cManichaean,\u201d a return to the old integralism that the church no longer supports.", "None of this makes any sense. The post-1970s evangelical-Catholic alliance has been flawed in various ways, but it is neither theocratic nor illiberal; if Charles Colson and Richard John Neuhaus were integralists, I am a lemur. The religious right stands in a complex continuity with previous religious reform movements in American history, from abolition to the Social Gospel to Prohibition to civil rights and peace movements in the 1960s. And in its specifically Catholic form, religious conservatism has aspired to exactly the kind of Catholic engagement in liberal-democratic politics anticipated by Leo XIII\u2019s \u201cralliement\u201d and endorsed by the Second Vatican Council.", "What Spadaro and Figueroa do not grasp is that the tendencies that they see at work in American Catholicism, the religious votes for the cheerfully pagan Trump and the growing interest in traditionalism, radicalism and separatism, are not the culmination of the Catholic-evangelical alliance but rather a reaction to its political and cultural failures \u2014 and the failures of liberal religious politics as well.", "In increasing numbers, American Catholics (and Protestants) feel that their leaders and thinkers have spent decades rallying to the republic, trying to bring about its moral and political renewal \u2026 only to see republican virtues decaying, liberalism turning hostile to religious faith, and democratic capitalism delivering disappointment and dislocation. So some of them are reaching backward and sideways or ahead, trying to claim Trumpism or socialism or grasp some as-yet-unknown idea, because they sense that the present order might someday soon be itself an ancien regime from which their religion must slip free.", "They may be wrong about this, but their sense of things is shared in certain ways by Pope Francis himself, who has a Trumpish, populist streak in his own right, and whose critiques of the West\u2019s technocratic order are notable and pungent. Which is the other bizarre thing about Spadaro and Figueroa\u2019s broad brush: As the American Catholic writer Patrick Smith points out, by warning against a Catholicism that takes political sides or indulges in moralistic rhetoric or otherwise declaims on \u201cwho is right and who is wrong\u201d in contemporary debates, the pope\u2019s men are effectively condemning not only American conservative Catholics but also the pope\u2019s own writings on poverty and environmentalism, his support for grass-roots \u201cpopular movements\u201d in the developing world and his stress on the organic link between family, society, religion and the state.", "This they surely do not mean to do. But it is precisely this tension, between the Spadaro-Figueroa critique of American religious conservatives and Pope Francis\u2019 sometimes harsh assessment of the liberal West, that makes the essay important as well as incoherent \u2014 because it reveals something significant about the dilemmas of the Vatican in a populist moment, in which the future of Western politics seems unusually uncertain.", "Between Leo XIII and the Second Vatican Council, Rome gradually made its peace with secular and liberal government, and embraced a style of Catholic politics that worked comfortably within the liberal order, rather than against its grain. And the church has good prudential reasons not to lean in too far to any kind of populism or post-liberalism, lest it lead toward authoritarianism or simple disaster.", "At the same time the church is supposed to be larger than any particular political philosophy, ready to outlast any particular order and capable of speaking prophetically in periods of transition. It could not remain bound to French monarchists forever; there may come a moment when it cannot remain with whatever liberalism might become.", "Again, in the rhetoric of Francis as well as the unsettlement of American Catholics you can see hints that such a moment may be on its way. But in his advisers\u2019 essay, in their evident paranoia about what the Americans are up to, you see a different spirit: a fear of novelty and disruption, and a desire for a church that\u2019s primarily a steward of social peace, a mild and ecumenical presence, a moderate pillar of the establishment in a stable and permanently liberal age.", "At the very least the men in the Vatican who yearn for such a church need to do a better job grasping why so many of their flock, in Europe and the United States, find this vision insufficient to the times.", "And then beyond that they might consider the possibility that as in the 19th century, American Catholics, in all their present confusion and occasional extremism, might be closer to grasping what our strange future holds for Catholic politics than Rome."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/27/us/rescue-houston-harvey.html": ["HOUSTON \u2014 The rain had begun to fall again on Sunday afternoon when there was a roar over Interstate 610.

Amazon\u2019s dominance in online shopping is challenging brick-and-mortar retailers like Walmart, while more people are starting web searches for products they might buy on Amazon instead of Google.", "But working together does not ensure that they will be any more successful. For most consumers, Amazon remains the primary option for online shopping. No other retailer can match the size of Amazon\u2019s inventory, the efficiency with which it moves shoppers from browsing to buying, or its many home delivery options.", "The two companies said the partnership was less about how online shopping is done today, but where it is going in the future. They said that they foresaw Walmart customers reordering items they purchased in the past by speaking to Google Home, the company\u2019s voice-controlled speaker and an answer to Amazon\u2019s Echo.

On this, almost everyone acquainted with reality agrees. How different is the more controversial question, to which there is one particularly interesting answer: A little more different than they used to be.", "This growing difference seems to be a striking aspect of modern Western life. In societies where both sexes have greater freedom \u2014 and women have more educational and professional opportunities relative to men than in the past \u2014 the sexes\u2019 academic interests tend to diverge relative to more traditional societies. And not only their interests but their personalities as well: The more officially egalitarian a society, a credible body of research suggests, the stronger the differences in stereotypically male and female personality traits.", "Conservatives sometimes worry that our society features an unhealthy blurring of sexual identities, an androgyne confusion. The left tends to be more optimistic about such blurring, seeing it as a liberation from the rule of patriarchy and the prison of heteronormativity.", "But the opposite trend, the divergence of the sexes, might be more important. Some of our present difficulties may flow from an excess of feminine and masculine differentiation, from the sexes growing apart and losing common ground, from the decline of marriage\u2019s male-female partnership and the rise of a singlehood that\u2019s often more sex-segregated than family life.", "Certainly the frontiers of sexual license often feature strong male-female differentiation rather than androgyny or gender-neutrality. Think of the clich\u00e9s that prevail in internet pornography, or the gendered kinks of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d Even our culture\u2019s highest-profile gender transition had a highly sex-specific presentation \u2014 Bruce Jenner was the ultimate male Olympian; Caitlyn Jenner, a busty, hyper-feminized Vanity Fair cover model.", "So too with political trends. The idea of a \u201cMommy Party\u201d and a \u201cDaddy Party\u201d goes way back, but the Trump-Clinton election made the increasingly gendered nature of the parties seem ridiculously stark. As Ed West, a columnist for The Week, pointed out last week, the social justice left and the alt-right are among the most gendered movements imaginable \u2014 \u201cthe political equivalent of the Lego Friends Heartlake Cupcake Cafe and the Lego Nexo Knight\u2019s Clay\u2019s Falcon Fighter Blaster, examples of where greater freedom of association and self-actualization has led men and women.\u201d", "Consider it this way: If you asked a right-wing misogynist to craft a sexist parody of his political opponents, you might get something like the highly neurotic, fainting-couch politics of recent campus and online progressivism, whose acolytes oscillate between soft therapeutic language and maenad-like frenzy.", "If you then asked a left-wing misandrist to do the same sort of parody in reverse, you\u2019d end up with something like the online far-right \u2014 nerds and autodidacts obsessed with cuckoldry, fascist cosplayers eager for evidence of their own racial superiority, would-be lotharios furious at feminism, libertarians with a ten-point case for despotism.", "The divergence of the sexes also provides a useful context for thinking about this week\u2019s culture-war controversy, the high-profile firing of a Google software engineer, James Damore, for a memo he wrote criticizing the company\u2019s diversity policies.", "Damore\u2019s memo argued, roughly, that the tech world\u2019s conspicuous dearth of women is quite possibly a consequence of the trend I\u2019ve just described \u2014 that more men than women are attracted to the kind of work that\u2019s done by programmers and software engineers, and that it\u2019s a mistake to assume discrimination when self-selection might be at work. He also questioned why Google\u2019s official rhetoric and internal propaganda focus on the diversity of sex and race while ignoring the value of political or ideological diversity.", "The memo was sometimes tone deaf, clinical, insensitive (in, well, a stereotypically male sort of way), understating the ways in which self-selection and sexism can shape an industry. Even if more men than women are attracted to a particular field, a male-dominated profession can be distinctly unpleasant for the women who work in it, in ways that can justify special scrutiny, recruitment and redress.", "But Damore also made reasonable points about different ways to pursue diversity and the costs and benefits thereof, in an earnest and dialogic style that a healthy corporate culture would have found a way to answer without swiftly giving him the ax.", "At the same time, there was a sense in which Damore had to be fired, precisely because of the intertwined realities that he described. Silicon Valley is a very male environment, a land of nerd kings and brogrammers whose deepest beliefs tend to be the sort that men come up with when they don\u2019t have very many women around \u2014 arch-libertarian, irreligious, utopian in a mechanistic style.", "But the internet industry is also part of a wider elite culture that is trending in the opposite direction, becoming more feminized and feminist, and inclined to view male-dominated enclaves with great suspicion. So Silicon Valley\u2019s leaders use corporate wokeness, diversity initiatives and progressive virtue signaling as a kind of self-protection, a way of promising that they\u2019re mostly men but they\u2019re the good kind of men, so that discrimination lawsuits and antitrust actions and other forms of regulation are less attractive to their critics.", "I strongly suspect that more than a few Silicon Valley higher-ups agreed with the broad themes of Damore\u2019s memo. But just as tech titans accept some censorship and oppression as the price of doing business in China, they accept performative progressivism as the price of having nice campuses in the most liberal state in the union and recruiting their employees from its most elite and liberal schools. And for questioning that political performance while defending the disproportionate maleness that makes it necessary, the Google memo-writer simply had to go.", "This is not a healthy dynamic, obviously. Indeed, part of why the alt-right has such a strong (if sub rosa) presence in Northern California is because it\u2019s a predictable kind of male response to professional life under the rule of political correctness \u2014 a response that the Damore firing will only make more attractive.", "Meanwhile, the real truth \u2014 which the memo at its most sensible almost grasped \u2014 is that Silicon Valley might benefit from having a more female-friendly culture because of the differences between men and women, not because those differences are all somehow a misogynist invention. The fact that the brave new online world of social media may be particularly psychologically unhealthy for young women, for instance, seems like a telling indicator of what can go wrong with a virtual architecture built by brilliant and obtuse males.", "But since the usual way to reintegrate the sexes is to have them marry one another and raise kids, what Silicon Valley probably needs right now more than either workplace anti-microaggression training or an alt-right underground is a basic friendliness to family, pregnancy and child rearing.", "This is why the new Apple headquarters, which has a 100,000-square-foot fitness and wellness center but no child care center, is a more telling indicator of what really matters to Silicon Valley than all the professions of gender-egalitarianism that have followed James Damore\u2019s heretical comments about sex differences.", "Those differences, the real ones, have one common root: Women bear children; men do not. Figuring out how to respect that essential fact and all its implications, while also respecting the equality of the sexes, is one of the great challenges of our age.

At the time, he was Weight Watchers\u2019 chief executive, and he sat watching, waiting for the line on the graph to begin its skyward trajectory. Chambers knew consumer sentiment had been changing \u2014 the company was in its fourth year of member-recruitment decline. But they also had a new marketing campaign to help reverse the generally dismal trend. But the weekend came and went, and the people never showed up. More than two-thirds of Americans were what public-health officials called overweight or obese, and this was the oldest and most trusted diet company in the world. Where were the people? Weight Watchers was at a loss.", "Chambers called Deb Benovitz, the company\u2019s senior vice president and global head of consumer insights. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re having one of the worst Januaries that anyone could have imagined,\u2019\u2019 she remembers him telling her. In the dieting business, January will tell you everything you need to know about the rest of the year. \u2018\u2018Nothing like we had anticipated.\u2019\u2019 Chambers and Benovitz knew that people had developed a kind of diet fatigue. Weight Watchers had recently tried the new marketing campaign, called \u2018\u2018Help With the Hard Part,\u2019\u2019 an attempt at radical honesty. No one wanted radical honesty. Chambers told Benovitz that they needed to figure out what was going on and how to fix it before the February board meeting.", "Benovitz got to work. She traveled the country, interviewing members, former members and people they thought should be members about their attitudes toward dieting. She heard that they no longer wanted to talk about \u2018\u2018dieting\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018weight loss.\u2019\u2019 They wanted to become \u2018\u2018healthy\u2019\u2019 so they could be \u2018\u2018fit.\u2019\u2019 They wanted to \u2018\u2018eat clean\u2019\u2019 so they could be \u2018\u2018strong.\u2019\u2019", "If you had been watching closely, you could see that the change had come slowly. \u2018\u2018Dieting\u2019\u2019 was now considered tacky. It was anti-feminist. It was arcane. In the new millennium, all bodies should be accepted, and any inclination to change a body was proof of a lack of acceptance of it. \u2018\u2018Weight loss\u2019\u2019 was a pursuit that had, somehow, landed on the wrong side of political correctness. People wanted nothing to do with it. Except that many of them did: They wanted to be thinner. They wanted to be not quite so fat. Not that there was anything wrong with being fat! They just wanted to call dieting something else entirely.", "A study out of Georgia Southern University\u2019s Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in March, monitored attitudes toward losing weight over three periods between 1988 and 2014. In the first period, 1988-94, 56 percent of fat adults reported that they tried to lose weight. In the last period, 2009-14, only 49 percent said so.", "The change had been spurred not just by dieting fatigue but also by real questions about dieting\u2019s long-term efficacy. In Weight Watchers\u2019 own research, the average weight loss in any behavior-modification program is about a 5 percent reduction of body weight after six months, with a return of a third of the weight lost at two years. There were studies that appeared to indicate that the cycle of weight loss and weight gain could cause long-term damage to the metabolism. Those studies led to more studies, which suggested that once your body reaches a certain weight, it is nearly impossible to exist at a much lower weight for an extended period of time. Even more studies began to question whether or not it\u2019s so bad to be fat in the first place; one notably suggested that fatter people lived longer than thin ones.", "These questions began to filter into the mainstream. Women\u2019s magazines started shifting the verbal displays on their covers, from the aggressive hard-body stance of old to one with gentler language, acknowledging that perhaps a women\u2019s magazine doesn\u2019t know for sure what size your body should be, or what size it can be: Get fit! Be your healthiest! GET STRONG! replaced diet language like Get lean! Control your eating! Lose 10 pounds this month! In late 2015, Women\u2019s Health, a holdout, announced in its own pages that it was doing away with the cover phrases \u2018\u2018drop two sizes\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018bikini body.\u2019\u2019 The word \u2018\u2018wellness\u2019\u2019 came to prominence. People were now fasting and eating clean and cleansing and making lifestyle changes, which, by all available evidence, is exactly like dieting.", "Diet companies suffered for being associated with dieting. Lean Cuisine repositioned itself as a \u2018\u2018modern eating\u2019\u2019 company, not a diet company. In fact, Lean Cuisine went so far in their pivot that in 2016 they introduced a Google Chrome extension that would filter mentions of the word \u2018\u2018diet\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018dieting\u2019\u2019; it apparently did this to show that just because it was called Lean Cuisine, that didn\u2019t mean it was a diet company. You can\u2019t be held responsible for what your parents named you!", "Weight Watchers saw all this happening and concluded that people didn\u2019t have faith in diets. The company decided that what it offered was not a diet program but a lifestyle program. It was a behavior-modification program. (For the sake of expediency here, I will call its program a diet because it prescribes amounts of food.) When Deb Benovitz returned from her travels with news of dieting\u2019s new language changes, the company realized that something had to change more than its marketing approach.", "Weight Watchers\u2019 chief science officer is Gary Foster, a psychologist \u2014 the first in that position, which previously had been held by dietitians. What he and his team realized from Benovitz\u2019s research was that dieters wanted a holistic approach to eating, one that helped really change their bodies, yes, but in a way that was sustainable and positive. He got to work creating a new approach that would become known as Beyond the Scale: He used all available mind-body research to try to figure out a way for members to appreciate benefits of the program besides weight loss. This would help them stay on the program during setbacks and beyond their weight-loss period and allow the program to infiltrate their lives beyond mealtime and beyond plain old eating suggestions.", "The company would move away from giving its members goal weights. It expanded its cognitive-behavioral strategies, which taught members to challenge unhelpful thinking and to respond to their emotions with reason, as opposed to with food or despair. It developed workshops that used meditation and qigong and didn\u2019t once mention food or weight. It updated its apps and introduced a social-media program, Connect. It became as holistic-minded as the people told Benovitz they wanted a program to be.", "But Weight Watchers was still a company called Weight Watchers, and it had to figure out a way to communicate all of this change to the public. People had too many associations with the brand. It needed someone other than the usual celebrity spokesdieter, a fat famous person who could be paid somewhere between $250,000 and $2 million to do the talk show circuit and People covers for a year. It needed someone who could fast-track the message that it was worth taking a new look at Weight Watchers.", "When the company called Oprah Winfrey in July 2015, she was standing on the lawn of her home in Maui with a sprained ankle, an injury she sustained while hiking in the mountains. In the month since her convalescence began, she had gained 17 pounds. Her struggles with weight were, at this point, a cultural meme. How could you explain the failure of someone so goal-oriented and successful \u2014 someone so successful that her name was invoked as a symbol of success as often as it was ever used to summon her? Weight Watchers had reached out to her in the past, but she politely declined. This time she bought a 10 percent stake in the company for $43 million, and Weight Watchers stockholders rejoiced.", "But the verbal changes around dieting had indicated something deeper than just a marketing issue; they pointed straight back to the fatigue that was hurting Weight Watchers in the first place. So, yes, many people celebrated the new partnership. But others \u2014 meaning, anyone who for a majority of their lives had been watching Oprah cycle up and down through different sizes \u2014 felt a little confused by the move. What was Oprah, a person whose very brand meant enlightenment and progress, doing on another diet? It was hard not to suspect that she was trapped, like so many of us are, in a culture that says one thing about fatness and means something very different.", "Back in 1963, when Jean Nidetch held the first what-would-be-known-as-Weight-Watchers meetings above a movie theater in Queens, things seemed clearer: It was bad to be fat, and it was good to be thin, and fat people wanted to be thin, and thin people wanted to help them get there. Her memoirs, \u2018\u2018The Story of Weight Watchers,\u2019\u2019 reads about as current as a cigarette ad featuring smoking babies. \u2018\u2018If strawberry shortcake made you break out in purple spots, you wouldn\u2019t eat it,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018You\u2019d be allergic to it. But, do you think fat is prettier than purple spots? It\u2019s uglier and harder to get rid of.\u2019\u2019", "Its frankness seems like an anachronism now, but you have to consider that at the time, this kind of straight talk was a glass of cold water in the desert for many fat people, who privately wondered why it was so hard for them to reduce the size of their bodies when it seemed so effortless for the people who walked around thin. Nidetch lost her weight in her late 30s, after a lifetime of self-loathing and embarrassment; the last indignity was the time someone asked when her baby was due when she was definitively not pregnant. She went to a city-run obesity clinic, and when she left the program, she kept the diet it gave her. She mimeographed it and handed it out to people whom she had gathered to spread the word about how weight loss could provide freedom and hope. (The diet would evolve from an eating plan to a more democratic system of balanced exchanges to an absolute laissez-faire system of points, as the company realized that the more autonomy and the less deprivation people experienced in their dieting \u2014 limitless choices, if not limitless amounts \u2014 the more likely they\u2019d be to stay on the diet.) But Nidetch knew that it wasn\u2019t just the food that was the problem; it was the problem that was the problem. What fat people needed was one another. They needed a space in which they could talk openly about the physical struggles and daily humiliations of walking around in a fat body, and just how much that sucked.", "These same ideas were articulated more starkly a few years later, but with a different prescription. In 1967, a fat man named Lew Louderback unleashed an essay in The Saturday Evening Post arguing that the wisdom around thinness could be applied only to thin people \u2014 that fat people suffered physically and psychologically when trying to maintain thin-person weights, and that this maintenance seemed to be temporary at best and largely destructive emotionally.", "He went on to write a book called \u2018\u2018Fat Power,\u2019\u2019 which helped give birth to what would become known as the fat-acceptance movement. That movement has varying degrees of militancy, but generally asks the public to put aside its bias and learn something new \u2014 to not think of fat people as lazy; to not deny them medical care; to not exclude them from their basic rights. It suggests that we re-examine what we think we know about fatness, that we consider trying to love and care for our bodies at whatever size they are now.", "There were more books and more essays and more challenges to the status quo in the decades to come. In 2008, Linda Bacon, a researcher who holds graduate degrees in physiology, psychology and exercise science with a specialty in nutrition, wrote a seminal fat-acceptance book, \u2018\u2018Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight,\u2019\u2019 which used peer-reviewed research to bolster these ideas. She gave seminars to doctors on fat phobia and weight bias in an effort to help them understand how their views on obesi\u00adty were hurting their patients and not allowing them to examine fatness neutrally. For example, there is evidence that stress and discrimination play a strong role in the insulin resistance and diabetes and heart disease for which weight typi\u00adcally takes the blame.", "With the rise of social media, the movement began to infiltrate the culture in other ways, too. Fat-acceptance and body-positivity activists began posting pictures of themselves on Instagram \u2014 just regular pictures, defiant for their lack of apology. There were intuitive-eating workshops and body-positivity training camps. There were bloggers and authors asking exactly how much of your life you were willing to put off in pursuit of a diet, or until you got to a certain weight, even temporarily. Normal, nonmilitant, nonactivist people began asking themselves if it was that bad to be fat \u2014 if it was that unhealthy, or that ugly, to be fat. And yet the most telling thing about the way the fat-acceptance movement is received in our society may be that its Wikipedia entry contains two quotes from people criticizing it before it mentions even one person who espouses it. In this world, we are witness to a moment when the word \u201coptimal\u201d is used in conjunction with the word \u201cbody,\u201d when people are trying to mold themselves into high-performance, precision machines. The idea of a fat machine makes no sense when you are easily fueled and refueled on Whole Foods and Soylent.", "In other words, all this activism didn\u2019t make the world more comfortable with fat people or dieting. Society doesn\u2019t normally change the words for things unless we\u2019re fundamentally uncomfortable with the concepts beneath them. Consider the verbal game of chicken we\u2019ve played with the people all this affects: Fat people went from being called fat (which is mean) to being called overweight (a polite-seeming euphemism that either accidentally or not accidentally implies that there is a standard weight) to being called zaftig/chubby/pleasingly plump (just don\u2019t) to curvy (which seems to imbue size with a sexuality and optimism where it should just be sexually and emotionally neutral) and back to fat (because it\u2019s only your judgment of fat people that made it a bad word in the first place, and maybe being fat isn\u2019t as bad as we\u2019ve been made to believe). It bears mentioning that Weight Watchers doesn\u2019t have a standardized word for its demographic, but Foster uses the term \u2018\u2018people with overweight.\u2019\u2019", "As the ideas that sprang from the fat-acceptance movement began to trickle into the mainstream, fat people began to wonder what it might be like to put all this aside and just live their lives. Some asked themselves if they thought they could figure out a way to not want to be thin; some began to ask themselves if they actually liked the way they looked. They began to wonder if there was even a proven and effective way to become and stay thin anyway. They began to ask themselves if they should be dieting at all.", "Last fall, I was with Foster, Weight Watchers\u2019 chief science officer, as he walked the halls of Obesity Week, the annual conference of the Obesity Society. The conference includes study presentations, each one a possible clue to the mystery of fatness. We attended a presentation on a new study of a weight-loss medication. People on the medication lost weight, but once they were off, the weight came back. If only we could get people\u2019s weight down, the presenters said, they could have a fresh start. Out in the hall, Foster shook his head. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a bias and a stigma: \u2018We\u2019ll give these people medication for a short period, but then they\u2019ve got to fly straight and get will power.\u2019 It\u2019s nonsense. This tough love \u2014 I\u2019m going to be hard on myself \u2014 you know, in some perverse way, if it were true, we might try to leverage it, but it\u2019s not. The harder you are on yourself, the worse you do.\u2019\u2019 In his career before Weight Watchers, Foster was the founder and director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University. Neutralizing the morality talk and stigma that surround obesity, he says, would make it a lot easier to figure out how to deal with it.", "By the time of the conference, the Oprah-Weight Watchers partnership had proved a clear success. Within a year, the company was up to 2.8 million members; by the first quarter of 2017 it would be 3.6 million. Oprah had brought an audience to Beyond the Scale, the holistic model Foster helped create. He says that initial weight loss on the program in 2016 was up 15 percent from what it was the year before. Of course people should want to manage their weight, he said, the same way they\u2019d want to manage their diabetes. \u2018\u2018It would seem preposterous if we would say to people with diabetes, \u2018Don\u2019t manage your diabetes.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Or their asthma. All three are chronic conditions; why, he asks, would we assume we should give up on weight? When people lose weight, he points out, they see improvements in risk factors. Data is data. Modifying your eating is hard, he says, but it\u2019s worth it. No one can tell you that lowering weight doesn\u2019t also lower other health factors like hypertension and high cholesterol and joint pain.", "Maybe that\u2019s true. Most mainstream sources agree on this, but there are definitely some researchers who don\u2019t; there are some who think that people who end up fat have different physiologies, and that fatness is just one component of them. Consider the \u2018\u2018uptick,\u2019\u2019 as Foster calls it, that comes after two years on a diet when, say, the person who lost 5 percent of her weight has gained a third of it back. Think about those numbers. If you weigh 300 pounds, you will lose 15 pounds in six months. You\u2019ll keep it off for a year or two, maybe. Five pounds is likely to return. Of course, these are people who don\u2019t stay on a diet-maintenance plan; but the average dieter certainly doesn\u2019t, and it\u2019s worth it to ask why a person wouldn\u2019t stay on a program that offered such rewards. Is it because they couldn\u2019t? It\u2019s worth it to ask if the programs are right and all these humans trying very hard at them are wrong. And also, where are the 300-pound people who want to lose just 15 pounds in the first place? I haven\u2019t met those people. But mainly, what it comes down to is this: Weight Watchers is designed to be successful only if you can stay on Weight Watchers forever.", "And there were also questions about dieting\u2019s long-term effects on the body. A study done by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. The study followed contestants who had appeared on the eighth season of \u2018\u2018The Biggest Loser,\u2019\u2019 all of whom had normal resting metabolisms for their size when the season began. As the contestants experienced radical, sweeps-week weight loss, their metabolisms slowed, and stayed slow afterward. To maintain his weight loss, one contestant\u2019s resting metabolism now required 800 calories fewer per day than a man of his size. It might be that when you have been fat, your body doesn\u2019t behave the way a thin body does, even when you become thinner.", "Foster shook his head at that one. He hears about the \u2018\u2018Biggest Loser\u2019\u2019 study a lot, but he doesn\u2019t think it conveys accurate information. It uses a very small sample under extreme conditions. He cited his own and others\u2019 studies examining the metabolic rate, fat distribution and psychological state of people before they lose weight, after they lose weight and after they regain the weight. \u2018\u2018Nothing is changed,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good outcome or something we should celebrate \u2014 but this idea that the act of managing your weight and losing weight has somehow set you up to be in a worse spot just isn\u2019t borne out by the science.\u2019\u2019", "Here is the thing about this particular debate at this particular moment: Everyone has much the same data, but there are plenty of people who would interpret the data differently from the way Foster does. I\u2019ve spoken to countless (I literally stopped keeping count) obesity researchers and dietitians and biologists and doctors. The answer becomes one of point of view: Is fat inherently bad, or can it be neutral?", "We can\u2019t answer that yet. There is still too much debate. So in the meantime, a fat person has to consider the data she has access to \u2014 meaning studies, yes, but also her own experience and the experience of her fat peers \u2014 and ask: Do you believe that you, a fat person, can ever be meaningfully thinner for a meaningful amount of time? Is a diet successful if it stops being successful once you\u2019re done with it? I\u2019ve interviewed Foster before. Back in 2011, when he was at Temple, he published a study about the efficacy of different kinds of diets. They all led to similar losses, and they all led to similar rates of recidivism. When I spoke with him back then, I asked him why we should continue dieting if the outcomes were so bad. He was concerned that I would suggest to my readers that dieting wasn\u2019t worth it. He told me that people didn\u2019t need that kind of discouragement. This attitude is what makes him so credible to me \u2014 his message was the same long before he worked for a corporation \u2014 but it\u2019s also what makes this so depressing.", "I do not recommend being a fat person at Obesity Week. Over the years, the event has become a week long, and it contains a robust trade show. After Foster left me to go to a meeting, I walked the trade-show floor and saw all the products being shown to the obesity specialists in attendance. I watched a video of a new kind of retractor that will more easily hold open belly skin while part of a stomach is cut out and sewn up, because you can\u2019t eat as much if your stomach is made smaller. I watched a person showing a model of a balloon you\u2019d insert into the stomach of a patient that would take up volume so that she wouldn\u2019t be so hungry, to be removed later once her behavior had been modified. I drank a smoothie with a superfood ingredient I can\u2019t pronounce or remember while someone told me that my readers would really be interested in their something-metrics plan for hydration and portion control. I narrowed my eyes thoughtfully because it felt rude to be drinking this guy\u2019s smoothie without taking him seriously. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no such thing as magic, Taffy,\u2019\u2019 the smoothie man was saying. I nodded in solemn agreement.", "Before he left me, I told Foster that Obesity Week made me sad. First, it was the profusion of educated people in the room studying me and my people as if we were problems to solve. But second, it was because if you have this many hundreds of smart and educated people trying to figure this out, and nobody has anything for me but superfood and behavior modification and an insertable balloon and the removal of an organ, it must be that there is no way to solve fatness.", "Foster doesn\u2019t see it that way, he told me. \u2018\u2018I look around this room,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018and I see hope.\u2019\u2019", "By the time Oprah announced that she was signing on with Weight Watchers, I was celebrating my 25th anniversary of my first diet, at age 15, which I found in an issue of Shape magazine. I was 5-foot-3 and weighed 110 pounds. In the intervening years, I did cleanses and had colonics and refilled the prescriptions on three rounds of those diet pills that made my teeth sweat and ate two shakes for lunch and just protein and just good carbs (carbs are divided into good and bad, like witches in Oz) and just liquid and just fruit until dinnertime and just food the size of my fist and two glasses of lukewarm lemon water. I had stood up in a room and said, \u2018\u2018Hello, my name is Taffy, and I am a compulsive overeater.\u2019\u2019 I had stuck my finger down my throat, a shot in the dark that I hoped would be more sustainable than it was. I had South Beached, I had Atkinsed, I had Slim-Fasted. Put it this way: The Amazon algorithm recently recommended to me, based on my previous searches, a book-and-CD combination, \u2018\u2018Hypnotic Gastric Band: The New Surgery-Free Weight-Loss System,\u2019\u2019 which offered a hypnotic equivalent to bariatric surgery. Put it this way: When I arrived at Weight Watchers, despite the fact that I was there as a journalist, I registered for the diet under the ra\u00adtion\u00adale that this was experiential journalism. When I gave my name at the counter, the person registering me furrowed her brow and said: \u2018\u2018That\u2019s strange. There are three other people named Taffy Akner.\u2019\u2019 I said, \u2018\u2018No, those are all me.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018In Brooklyn?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Yes, when I was in high school.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018In Los Angeles?\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018Yes, right before I was married.\u2019\u2019 I stopped her before she could go on. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re all me.\u2019\u2019", "By then I was all in, as if I ever hadn\u2019t been. When I arrived at the Union, N.J., meeting at 8 a.m. on a Saturday, it was a few weeks before Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is marketed as a fun, festive holiday of family gathering, but everyone at that meeting knew the truth: Thanksgiving is an existential threat. Thanksgiving is a killer.", "The year leading up to Thanksgiving hadn\u2019t been much better for this group. There had been family deaths and illness. There had been foreclosures and unemployments and high-school reunions, and someone\u2019s daughter was always baking sticky buns; someone\u2019s husband wanted to know where his steak was; someone\u2019s son wanted to know why the meatloaf tasted different; someone\u2019s co-worker was always leaving doughnuts and bagels on the communal table at the office. The people, mostly women, in the folding chairs had one rule, though: No matter what happened during the week, you showed up. \u2018\u2018This is my church,\u2019\u2019 a woman named Donna told me. A few months before, she buried her mother on a Friday; on Saturday she came to the meeting.", "Dayna, the group leader, stood at the head of the room. How could you not love Dayna? She took such care with her appearance \u2014 she wore tall boots and wrap dresses and makeup, even on Saturday mornings when everyone else wore sweatpants at best (or leggings; leggings weigh less). She gave them star-shaped stickers off a large roll when they lost weight or when they had acted in their best interests over the week. She remembered their names, even the ones who hadn\u2019t shown up in months; she gave them hugs.", "Today, Donna had gained weight. She had been holding steady at six pounds short of her goal. Since 2009 \u2014 2009 \u2014 she had shown up every week and by now had lost 132 pounds, which is an entire other Donna. But these last six pounds, my God, what would it take? She\u2019d been down last week by a pound, and now that pound was back. She\u2019d been going to the gym \u2018\u2018religiously\u2019\u2019 for two weeks, but thought maybe the not going to the gym three weeks ago had caught up with her. Sometimes being six pounds away from her goal was harder than being 321 pounds.", "\u2018\u2018I\u2019m so frickin\u2019 aggravated,\u2019\u2019 she said. She asked me how I did. I shrugged and told her I had lost three pounds. \u2018\u2018But I just started, so, .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019\u2019 I said. I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad. Another woman, Amy, whispered to me, \u2018\u2018You never want to say \u2018I only lost, .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019 because then everyone will go, \u2018Oh, jeez.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "I asked the women there, most of whom were repeat joiners as well: Shouldn\u2019t we be moving toward acceptance? Here we all were \u2014 smart, accomplished, successful women (and one man) \u2014 and we couldn\u2019t maintain what was proved to be the most effective diet you could ever try. If we couldn\u2019t stay on this, could we stay on anything? What if the flaw wasn\u2019t in us but in the system?", "They furrowed their brows and shook their heads and gave me funny looks. What was I talking about? How could a fat person not want to be thin? Donna\u2019s sisters were all on diabetes medication, and she wasn\u2019t. Her back had hurt until about 20 pounds ago, and now she could crawl on the floor with her grandson as if it were nothing.", "I couldn\u2019t counter very hard. Each time I came to a meeting, I was seduced by the possibility, by the clean, Calvinist logic, that if you ate less you would weigh less, that your body would feed on itself and its fat reserves until you became smaller and smaller and more pleasing to the world and its standards \u2014 until you practically disappeared (we are a culture that fetishizes something called Size 0). I looked forward to these meetings, feeling as if these people were the only ones who seemed to truly understand my predicament. But my optimism and motivation didn\u2019t survive my walk out the door. By the time I got to my car, I had no idea what to do. I knew that if this could be done, I would have done it, and yet I didn\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t do it. Just eat less, right? It\u2019s so simple!", "About two years ago, I decided to yield to what every statistic I knew was telling me and stop trying to lose weight at all. I decided to stop dieting, but when I did, I realized I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know what or how to eat. I couldn\u2019t fathom planning my food without thinking first about its ability to help or hinder a weight-loss effort. I went to a nutritional therapist to help figure this out (dieting, I have found, is its own chronic condition), and I paid her every week so I could tell her that there still had to be a way for me to lose weight. When she reminded me that I was there because I had realized on my own that there was no way to achieve this goal, I reminded this wonderful, patient person that she couldn\u2019t possibly understand my desperation because she was skinny. I had arthritis in my knees, I said. Morality and society aside, they hurt. I have a sister with arthritis in her knees, too, but she\u2019s skinny and her knees don\u2019t hurt.", "I went to an intuitive-eating class \u2014 intuitive eating is where you learn to feed yourself based only on internal signals and not external ones like mealtimes or diet plans. Meaning it\u2019s just eating what you want when you\u2019re hungry and stopping when you\u2019re full. There were six of us in there, educated, desperate fat women, doing mindful-eating exercises and discussing their pitfalls and challenges. We were given food. We would smell the food, put the food on our lips, think about the food, taste the food, roll the food around in our mouths, swallow the food. Are you still hungry? Are you sure? The first week it was a raisin. It progressed to cheese and crackers, then to cake, then to Easter candy. We sat there silently, as if we were aliens who had just arrived on Earth and were learning what this thing called food was and why and how you would eat it. Each time we did the eating exercise, I would cry. \u2018\u2018What is going on for you?\u2019\u2019 the leader would ask. But it was the same answer every time: I am 41, I would say. I am 41 and accomplished and a beloved wife and a good mother and a hard worker and a contributor to society and I am learning how to eat a goddamned raisin. How did this all go so wrong for me?", "They tried to soothe me. They told me that hatred of fat was a societal construct, but I never understood why that should comfort me. I live in society. I hurt my ankle playing tennis, activating an old injury, and an internist I was seeing for the first time, without taking any medical history or vital signs \u2014 my blood pressure is pristine, just so you know \u2014 told me he couldn\u2019t do anything for me until I lost weight and gave me a rusty photocopy about food exchanges. (Another doctor prescribed three months of physical therapy, and now my ankle is fine.) I was in Iceland, for a story assignment, and the man who owned my hotel took me fishing and said, \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not going to insist you wear a life jacket, since I think you\u2019d float, if you know what I mean.\u2019\u2019 I ignored him, and then afterward, back on land, after I fished cod like a Viking, he said, \u2018\u2018I call that survival of the fattest.\u2019\u2019 A woman getting into a seat next to me on a plane said, \u2018\u2018Looks like this will be a cozy ride,\u2019\u2019 and a Manhattan taxi driver told me he liked to watch my \u2018\u2018jelly\u2019\u2019 shake, by which I can only presume he meant a part of my body. I have been asked if it was my first time taking Pilates at a studio where I\u2019m on my fifth 10-pack. I have been told at a yoga class that I have \u2018\u2018a really great spirit\u2019\u2019 and it\u2019s important that I \u2018\u2018just keep coming.\u2019\u2019 (I\u2019ve been taking yoga for 12 years.) I was told by a seamstress that she had never seen a bride not lose weight for her wedding until she met me. A crazy man tried to give me candy outside the Met, and when I politely declined he screamed at me that of course I didn\u2019t want it, I was fat enough, and my sister asked me why I was so upset, clearly that guy was crazy, and I said, \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t understand because you\u2019re skinny,\u2019\u2019 and on and on forever.

She is tan and very blond, with pink lipstick; she looks like the second coming of Jean Nidetch. Weight Watchers had found its business leader. She was joining the company after its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth because it had finally found its spiritual one.", "On the release day of the commercial in which Oprah told the world she loved bread and was excited to be able to eat it every day and still lose weight, the graph line shot up tall and straight at Weight Watchers. But a lot of us wondered if maybe Oprah had finally fallen out of touch. She said in one commercial, \u2018\u2018Inside every overweight woman is a woman she knows she can be,\u2019\u2019 saying she\u2019d been buried in her weight to the point where she couldn\u2019t recognize herself, and the internet did not love this sentiment, asking exactly why Oprah thought that women were worthless if they weren\u2019t thin. They asked if she was \u2018\u2018disempowering women.\u2019\u2019 They said her investment in Weight Watchers was \u2018\u2018bad news for women everywhere.\u2019\u2019 One blogger wrote that she was \u2018\u2018disappointed that she is choosing to participate in and endorse a company whose sole purpose is to tell women that they are not enough.\u2019\u2019 The journalist Melissa Harris-Perry gave a five-minute \u2018\u2018Letter of the Week\u2019\u2019 on MSNBC saying: \u2018\u2018But, O!

Back in 1985, Joan Rivers brought Oprah on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019\u2019 and without so much as a warning in the pre-interview, told her she shouldn\u2019t have \u2018\u2018let\u2019\u2019 her weight gain happen to her. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re a pretty girl, and you\u2019re single,\u2019\u2019 Rivers said. Oprah explained that she had done everything so far \u2014 everything! By 1985! She had done the banana-hot-dog-egg diet (in which you just eat a banana and a hot dog and an egg). She had done the pickles-and-peanut-butter diet (in which all you eat are pickles and peanut butter).", "In 1988, she pulled a wagon full of fat onto the stage of her show to show off her 67-pound weight loss. In 1991, she went on the cover of People and declared she was never dieting again. In 1996 she wrote a book with Bob Greene about having found the solution. In 2002, she wrote a story in her magazine, O, called \u2018\u2018What I Know for Sure About Making Peace With My Body,\u2019\u2019 in which she announced that she had made peace with her body. In 2005, the cover of O, which usually features just one Oprah, featured two: a thin one with an exposed midriff leaning on the shoulder of another thin one in a fancy dress. In 2009, she published another two-Oprah cover. This one was the midriff-bearing one from the 2005 cover, leaning on a larger Oprah in a purple jogging suit. The cover line said, How did I let this happen again?", "Oprah sounds like Oprah when you talk with her \u2014 she sings your name, \u2018\u2018Taffy!\u2019\u2019 and her voice registers in you in a way that is as familiar to your body as your mother\u2019s voice. She told me she doesn\u2019t care if she\u2019s never skinny again. She cares that she feels as if she has control. For her whole life, she said, her only goal has been to find a higher level of consciousness, to remain more in the moment than she has ever been in any other moment. She had never felt stress, even during all those years when she was doing three shows a day. She just ate instead. She had bags of potato chips, and people would say, \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you get stressed?\u2019\u2019 and she\u2019d think, What\u2019s stress? She had seen the cultural changes for years.

But this thinking was a prison. So was the one where you just accept yourself and move on. \u201cThis whole P.C. about accepting yourself as you are \u2014 you should, 100 percent,\u201d she said. But it was that thinking that made her say yes to Weight Watchers. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a mechanism to keep myself on track that brings a level of consciousness and awareness to my eating. It actually is, for me, mindful eating, because the points are so ingrained now.\u2019\u2019 Meaning, Oprah wasn\u2019t interested in ceding to a movement. She was wondering how to finally make this work.", "\u2018\u2018In the particular moment in time that I got the call,\u2019\u2019 she told me, \u2018\u2018I was desperate: What\u2019s going to work?

With either approach, you can override and lower the phone\u2019s default maximum audio level and decrease it, say to 75 or 80 percent of what the phone can actually produce.", "Google\u2019s Android operating system (which often warns users when the volume is set too high) comes in many versions across the various phone and tablet models, so the controls you have will vary.

(Menu names may vary based on Android version.) There you can set the default volume for many of the phone\u2019s functions, including ringtone, system alerts and media. To lock the levels, tap the three-dot More options menu on the screen and choose Media Volume Limiter. Once you enable the feature, you can set a custom maximum volume level and secure it with a PIN code.", "If your version of Android does not come with volume-limit controls in the settings, you can find apps in the Google Play store to lock the sound levels.

And just about every tech company took up the fight against neo-Nazis.", "Mike: That\u2019s a lot to unpack. Can we start with the easy one?", "Farhad: Let\u2019s start with Apple.

Or maybe \u201c2 App 2 Furious\u201d?", "Seriously, though, I hope Apple hires some good content executives from places like Netflix and Amazon.

Isn\u2019t Apple sitting on a zillion dollars in cash somewhere?", "Anyway, I think Apple needs a real breakout hit, just like Facebook and its big video push. I\u2019m not sure they have the eye for talent that Netflix does, though.", "Farhad: O.K., let\u2019s move on to Uber.

After the racist protests and car-ramming in Charlottesville, Va., last week, a number of internet companies took action against white supremacist organizations. The domain-name company GoDaddy kicked off The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist site, which then tried to get a domain from Google \u2014 which also promptly kicked the site to the curb. Then Cloudflare, a company that protects against network attacks, also canceled The Daily Stormer\u2019s account.", "There were lots of others: Facebook deleted an event page for the Charlottesville rally and even prevented people from sharing a Daily Stormer article.

Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, wrote a heartfelt letter to employees denouncing racism and President Trump\u2019s response to the racist uprising, and he pledged a $1 million donation to two anti-hate groups.", "There was some hand-wringing over all this, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights organization, argued that the tech companies\u2019 push to ban white supremacists set a dangerous precedent for free speech online. \u201cAny tactic used now to silence neo-Nazis will soon be used against others, including people whose opinions we agree with,\u201d it said.", "I understand this worry; the slippery-slope problem here is real and worth watching. But I don\u2019t share the alarm, because I suspect this slope isn\u2019t all that slippery.", "To me, it seems like white supremacists constitute a pretty bright line: If your site\u2019s entire purpose is to spew racial hatred, no respectable company is going to do business with you. The tech giants have had a similar policy toward Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS for years now, and those efforts have not really chilled free expression online. The same thing could work well for Nazis.", "What do you think?", "Mike: I\u2019m fine with Nazis getting banned from these networks. I understand the free speech argument, but it\u2019s hard to support when the rhetoric also includes the elimination of races other than whites. Go look at the Vice News video on Charlottesville for some perspective.", "Let me go meta for a second: How nuts is it that now we\u2019re seeing citizens turn to corporate leaders to voice their concerns against the administration? It used to be folks said, \u201cWrite a letter to Congress to spur change.\u201d Now it seems to be, \u201cWrite a comment on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page to urge him to ban Nazis.\u201d", "Isn\u2019t that odd? Or is that the end result of capitalism in its current form? That we\u2019ve identified the corporations we interact with every day as the power centers that can help people fight back against injustice?", "Maybe that\u2019s not such a new phenomenon.

Stormfront \u2026 it was the first white nationalist website on the internet, and it has been the largest one ever since. So I grew up with the leadership of the white nationalist movement, all coming over to the house, and when I got older, we\u2019d go to conferences and it was my life.", "M.B.: Derek Black grew up in West Palm Beach, Florida, across from the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago mansion and he used to drive past it almost every day in a red pickup truck with a confederate flag sticker on the back window. His father is Don Black, once a grand wizard of the K.K.K.", "M.B.: It sounds like what you\u2019re describing is like you\u2019re the First Child of American white nationalism?", "D.B.: [Laughs.] Yeah \u2026 I knew everybody, I knew everybody who was involved in it, and I knew all the different organizations, and I expected that it would be my life\u2019s work to try to advance this. I thought it was the right thing. \u2026", "M.B.: How did you process these ideas of your godfather and your father and your mother and this entire movement as a child, what is white nationalism through the eyes of a child?", "D.B.: It\u2019s a really tight knit movement of people. It\u2019s important to understand the context that in my family pioneering white nationalism on the web was my dad\u2019s goal. That was what drove him from early \u201990s from beginning of the web, and so growing up \u2026 we had the latest computers, first people in the neighborhood to have broadband because we had to keep Stormfront running, and so technology and connecting people on the website, long before social media and the way the web is set up now was his driving purpose, so we were very connected to everybody in the white nationalist movement to everyone in the world. When I was a little kid, I would get on chat rooms in the evening \u2026 and I had friends in Australia who I would talk to at a certain hour ... I had friends in Serbia I would talk to at a certain hour.", "M.B.: And what would you be saying to each other?", "D.B.: In the late \u201990s, I was talking to a white nationalist kid, and he was explaining to me the Smerican invasion of Serbia and how it tied to Jewish control of American military.", "M.B.: Wow \u2026 not the conventional understanding of the U.S. military action which was to spare people genocide.", "D.B.: Absolutely, yeah. I started a kid\u2019s website on Stormfront on my dad\u2019s website and so, from the time I was 12, would constantly get death threats and emails.", "M.B.: So you started your own kind of white nationalist website for children?", "D.B.: Yeah.. when \u2026 I\u2019m not sure what age \u2026 11 or 12 or something I set up pretty basic little web page on there, and posted some essays that I was writing at the time. In some ways \u2014 in a lot of ways \u2014 that brings people together, I know it brought my family together, fact that you have media coming over as I went on television and newspapers, which were usually coming over to talk to my dad \u2026 and then we\u2019d get really bad stories about us, but we\u2019re all working toward a cause \u2026 so the fact that everybody is so opposed to something we know is so right really brought us together.", "M.B.: At this point in your life, when you\u2019re a young man and you saw an African-American or you saw a Jewish person, what was going through your mind? What kind of things were you thinking or saying to yourself?", "D.B.: I think my family made a distinction between individuals and big groups \u2026 that there\u2019s many opinions on this among white nationalists, there are people who say, \u201cOh you can\u2019t be friends with anyone who\u2019s not white.\u201d And my family was generally a bit more cosmopolitan ...although I think they\u2019ve gotten more extreme in the last couple of years \u2014", "M.B.: I have to pause and tell you the notion of a cosmopolitan white nationalist is a little tricky. But I\u2019m going to go with it.", "D.B.: [Laughs.] When you zoom in on it, and it becomes the whole world that you\u2019re viewing \u2026 then all the different factions take on a bigger role. So yeah, I think my family \u2014 usually, at least, it was definitely my attitude by the time I got to college that individuals are one thing. You talk to people and everybody can be anything and their race is not going to predict an individual\u2019s life or anything about them. It\u2019s only when you\u2019re talking about millions of people that this becomes a defining aspect of humanity.", "In reality it is white supremacy. It\u2019s just that they wouldn\u2019t see it that way. I never saw it that way. My dad \u2014 I genuinely believe, who I know very well \u2014 does not believe that he is doing something bad to other people. That does not make it untrue, but a lot of these people don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re actually hurting other people by their policies.", "M.B.: He instead believes what that he\u2019s doing something for himself?", "D.B.: He believes that for white people to exist and live and have a country like America was before 1950, everybody needs to be the same color and be together because, race is a real, genetic thing that predicts all this stuff like intelligence and ability, that race is so real that every race in the world should be separated. Saying this and living as I do now sounds delusional, but it is possible for somebody to believe and think that it makes sense.", "M.B.: Derek, can you take me to 2008 and President Obama\u2019s election? I don\u2019t know exactly how old you were at that moment but do you remember where you were and what you were doing around that time?", "D.B.: In 2008, I was 19 and at the same time as Obama was heading to winning the presidency I had also submitted my name for this local Republican executive committee election which was county level, and I won that. I got 60 percent of the vote.", "After he won, David Duke, my godfather, organized a conference for I think it was the weekend after the election. And I went up there \u2026 and it was pandemonium. I knew people who were sobbing, and saying that now there\u2019s never going to be another white president again, and that the country is lost, thinking they had to make contingency plans. The thinking of white nationalist leaders at the time was that Barack Obama has won, but now that he\u2019s won, you\u2019re going to have a huge white backlash against this. And so it became this meeting to try to figure out how to make the movement bigger while he\u2019s president.", "I had just won that little Republican position, so I was very encouraged that if we told people all the white nationalist talking points, without necessarily saying that we\u2019re white nationalists, that we could win elections. Whether they\u2019re little county things like that or maybe even larger ones.", "M.B.: My whole talk was the fact that you could run as Republicans, and say things like we need to shut down immigration, we need to fight affirmative action, we need to end globalism, and you could win these positions, maybe as long as you didn\u2019t get outed as a white nationalist and get all the controversy that comes along with it.", "M.B.: So the Republican Party which had just lost to Barack Obama, your argument was that it could be the vehicle for the mainstreaming of white nationalism or white supremacy?", "D.B.: Yeah, my thinking at the time was that all this backlash, which we eventually did see of white people against having a black president, would have to go into the Republican Party. Because America is a two party system, and the Republican Party would become the white people\u2019s party.", "M.B.: Hmm.", "M.B.: Then you went to college, so tell me about that.", "D.B.: In 2010, I moved across the state and started college at this little liberal arts college in Florida, which was about three and a half hours from home and it was the first time that I had lived away from home.

Isn\u2019t this insane?\u201d", "And I had founded that section because when movies came out I got super into it, and I figured you could get people who liked with such a white mythos, a few turned on by white nationalism, and more mundanely just wanted to talk about movies, so I had found that 10 years earlier, guy turned it around and I pretended I had never heard of it.", "M.B.: Huh, you just acted as if you had no role in it", "D.B.: I was like, \u201cWhat is that? what is Stormfront?\u201d", "M.B.: And so then of course \u2026 inevitably it happens. You\u2019re found out. The student forum explodes, and you\u2019re shunned on campus for a time. But then you get an invitation, right? Tell me about that.", "D.B.: I had a friend on campus who I had gotten to know during my first semester when nobody knew who I was, he was an observant Jew who had Shabbat dinners pretty regularly whenever he was in town on Friday night and he would invite people of atheists and all sorts of different religions. It was just a nice dinner. And so he actually invited me to one of the Shabbats, and I knew him, and so I brought wine.", "M.B.: Even after learning what he did about you?", "D.B.: Yeah, he did. He had read my posts on Stormfront going back years \u2014 even the stuff when I was a teenager \u2014 and he doubted that he was going to convince me of anything, he just wanted to let me see a Jewish community thing so that if I was going to keep saying these anti-Semitic things that at least I had seen real Jews.", "It was ultimately in private conversations with a person I met at the Shabbat dinners \u2026 we would talk about things.

And we did that over a year or two on one thing after another until I got to a point where I didn\u2019t believe it anymore.", "M.B.: So as you and this friend are going around and around and your mind is changing about this, what\u2019s the definitive moment where you make a decision and do something about it?", "D.B.: It was really this letter over the summer of 2013, and I sent it to the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2026 which is an organization my entire life that had been the enemy. They had come after my mother, they had constantly written articles about my father, they had tried to get his website taken down \u2014 they had been one of the biggest opponents of my family for my entire life.", "M.B.: And then you turned to them as somebody who would disseminate this letter you wrote?", "D.B.: I did \u2026 I turned to them to publish my letter because I knew that their intelligence report was the most widely read thing in the white nationalist world \u2026 more so than any white nationalist publication, this was like the gossip mag that the white nationalist world turned to to find out what everybody else was doing. And by sticking my letter on their website, I knew that every white nationalist would see it and every anti-racist would hear about it. The audience was in a lot of ways my own family. I wanted them to know that I understood what we believed, and I was systematically disbelieving each point. And then I just sent it and they published it and when it came out \u2026 my dad called me up in the morning and said, \u201cI think you\u2019ve been hacked, I think your email was hacked and somebody sent this letter.\u201d", "M.B.: Wow, he didn\u2019t believe you\u2019d written it.", "D.B.: No, we hadn\u2019t talked about my beliefs changing. At first he was incredibly sad. He called me a few days after I had written the letter, it was the first time we talked since he first called to tell me he thought I had been hacked, and it was just this sad moment where he said, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it and it\u2019s really hurting me. I think it might not have been a good idea to have a son \u2026 if this is the pain that\u2019s going to come from it.\u201d", "M.B.: Whoa. He said that he wondered whether it was a good idea to have had a son because of the shame he felt because you had written the letter and rejected everything he stood for?", "And I could understand it \u2026 he called again later that day and said I shouldn\u2019t have said that I\u2019m sorry. And then we started talking bit by bit. I made the argument that family and political beliefs should not be the same thing and aren\u2019t the same thing. He came back at the time with the case that there is nothing in your life experience that would suggest that our family is not a political family, we believe these things. That is the basis of our family the idea that you could be anti white nationalist and that wouldn\u2019t affect your relationship to the family is not going to work. It was how we connected it\u2019s what kept us together.", "M.B.: Right. This sounds unbelievably painful.", "D.B.: It was.", "M.B.: When\u2019s the last time you spoke with him?", "D.B.: Not since before Charlottesville. Not since all this.", "My big revelation when I left this movement and no longer talked to anybody in the movement was that most people don\u2019t talk about race very often. And so I came to the conclusion that white nationalism is a fringe movement and everybody is aware that it should be a fringe movement, Barack Obama is the president he\u2019ll make sure that it stays, remains a fringe movement and I\u2019ll just try to quietly fade away and never talk about this again and the future will be fine.", "D.B.: So to begin with, I think it\u2019s very important to understand that from the perspective of white nationalists, it\u2019s basically the definition of the movement that you\u2019re working against the establishment. And that\u2019s what every white nationalist event is \u2014 it is very easy for the local politicians to condemn it and you expect them to condemn it and there\u2019s nothing else that you would dream might happen. It\u2019s something that people are proud of \u2026 that you are working even though everybody says you shouldn\u2019t. And so that\u2019s the context. And all the usual condemnations came from everybody else.", "People in Congress, governors, mayors \u2026 people who just wanted to get in their condemnations because everyone knows it\u2019s extremely easy to condemn a white nationalist rally. And then on Saturday it was weird that he didn\u2019t, everybody took that as a huge victory there were tweets, people commenting online, that\u2019s very new, but Tuesday just took my breath away. I was sitting in a coffee shop and I thought the news from this was done when I read that he had come back and he said there were good people in the white nationalist rally and he salvaged their message.", "M.B.: What do you mean when you say he salvaged their message?", "D.B.: The message they were trying to get out was that tearing down Robert E. Lee\u2019s statue is an assault on white culture, so if you think that tearing down Robert E. Lee\u2019s statue is the wrong choice, then these are your guys that these are the people who are willing to say it but then amidst all the violence and the chaos I think that got lost. You\u2019re not going to follow these people even if you believe that.", "And in his message saying that these were good people because they\u2019re fighting for something that a lot of people believe in, he salvaged the message that they wanted to spread which is that if you believe this too and maybe you\u2019re on the edge about whether this is a fringe movement or not, Donald Trump thinks we\u2019re fine. I don\u2019t think the whole world reads it that way but within the white nationalist movement and anyone who was thinking maybe this might be a movement for me, suddenly being at that that rally becomes a historical moment. // What they wanted to do is blow apart that context. To say that if you think Lee statue should stay up, there\u2019s no distinction between what you believe and what a white nationalist believes, and it felt like he was agreeing with them.", "M.B.: What do you think the impact of that is having the president in your words salvage their message and make all right what they were doing there in the broader sense?", "I think Tuesday was the most important moment in the history of the modern white nationalist movement.", "M.B.: Wow.", "D.B.: It\u2019s impossible to say what will happen in the future, like maybe nothing. But if you were on the fence about whether to get involved in this stuff or not, the president\u2019s O.K. is the biggest thing that\u2019s ever happened. I don\u2019t want to be an alarmist and say this is a movement that\u2019s going to take over the world.

As I try to deal with events this week I wonder how much the fact that being in my family and other people I knew were willing to push to try to get people who were maybe on the fence or maybe thought they were being discriminated against or that they kids couldn\u2019t get into college because of affirmative action and try to push them a little bit more and try to get them a little but more angry. However much of an effect that had I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t know.", "M.B.: It sounds like you\u2019ve given some thought to your own role in this.", "D.B.: It\u2019s something I think about everyday, I think.", "M.B.: Derek, you know this I\u2019m sure, there are still pictures of you online as a child attending various far right white nationalist white supremacist conferences, and you\u2019ve got a little hat on. And you are in it. I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t go back and look, but what do you think when you look back at those images and that version of yourself?", "D.B.: I\u2019m always very conflicted \u2026 that I\u2019ve come to terms with myself, I\u2019m not too much filled with deep shame all the time. Because I don\u2019t know what else I could do. What I wanted to do what would have been more comfortable what I really wanted to do was just leave, never say anything again, disappear off the face of the earth pretend that I had never lived the life that I lived and didn\u2019t know anything about white nationalism and never be heard from again\u2026 and it was a few more tough conversations that convinced me that wasn\u2019t enough because I\u2019d actually done harm \u2026 I tried to follow the beliefs that my father has that if you think there is a danger to our society you should do something.

Stryk began the night slumped in a Morton\u2019s steakhouse in downtown Washington, tuning out the guests at his watch party to type out the campaign announcement of a buddy who \u2014 in the wake of Donald J. Trump\u2019s all-but-certain defeat and the Republican Party implosion that was sure to follow \u2014 planned to make a long-shot bid for chairman of the Republican National Committee. He ended it by closing down the bar at the Mayflower Hotel, and after the race was called, giddily marching down Connecticut Avenue with his friends as they chanted, \u2018\u2018Make America Great Again!\u2019\u2019", "Stryk, who owned a lobbying firm so small it didn\u2019t actually have an office, spent most of his time in California and owned a small vineyard in Oregon, and he had helped out the Trump campaign as a sort of informal West Coast hand. He was still reveling in Trump\u2019s upset win two nights later, over a bottle of wine on the patio of the Four Seasons in Georgetown, when a chocolate Lab padded over to his table to sniff his crotch. Stryk and the dog\u2019s owner got to talking about wine and cigars and finally, like most of the country, about Trump. It turned out that she worked for New Zealand\u2019s Embassy in Washington. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister still hadn\u2019t connected with the new president-elect, she told Stryk \u2014 a diplomatic and political embarrassment. Stryk cocked an eye across the table. \u2018\u2018What if I said I could get you the number of someone to call the president?\u2019\u2019 he asked her.", "The following afternoon, Stryk found himself in a cab, headed for a meeting with New Zealand\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Tim Groser. Stryk was more than a little nervous. On the way over, he called a friend named Stuart Jolly, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who ran Trump\u2019s field operation during the Republican primary and spent election night with Stryk at Morton\u2019s. Jolly reached out to someone he knew in the Trump high command and delivered a cell number, but Stryk didn\u2019t know if it would actually work. At the embassy, Groser invited him in, uncorked a bottle of pinot noir and called the prime minister to pass along the number. A week later, President-elect Trump was finally able to accept a congratulatory phone call. But even before the call went through, plans and possibilities were blooming in Stryk\u2019s mind. \u2018\u2018I said to myself: \u2018This could be very, very interesting,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he told me when I first met him this spring. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018The world\u2019s going to change.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "Stryk, who grew up in Arizona, had bounced around the minor leagues of politics for most of his adult life. At 41, he has the frenetic energy of a serial entrepreneur and the motley r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to match. After dropping out of college to intern on Capitol Hill, Stryk wrote voter-contact scripts for a Republican P.R. firm, helped start a political job-listing website and eventually opened his own Beltway lobbying shop, Sonoran Policy Group. The firm almost collapsed in 2009, after Stryk tried to acquire a troubled Maryland-based security-guard business. Stryk decamped to California, owing thousands of dollars in back rent, and reinvented S.P.G. as a procurement and political-consulting business. He traded tequila shots with the California congressman Dana Rohrabacher, ran for mayor of a town in Napa Valley, handled P.R. for an arms dealer accused of smuggling weapons to Libya \u2014 the case was dropped last fall \u2014 and helped clients sell the government everything from flashlights to missile-guidance software. By the time he hooked up with the Trump campaign, Stryk had hustled his way to a good living, and he knew his way around Washington. But he was no one\u2019s idea of a Beltway insider.", "When the phone call to Trump went through, Stryk saw the geography of a new world forming before his eyes. Interests that spent millions of dollars studying Washington and shaping it to their liking had been taken totally by surprise by Trump\u2019s win. The rules had changed, and no one was sure what the new ones were. For Stryk, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for. As he saw it, the lobbying old guard \u2014 the guys that threw down black Amex cards at Joe\u2019s Crab and sent fat quarterly bills to clients they barely did any work for \u2014 were on the defensive. New people would have a chance. People like Stryk.", "New Zealand was a prime example. Groser and his staff had spent months researching Hillary Clinton, calculating who among her vast claque would win positions of power and influence in her administration. The main thing they knew about Trump was that he had sworn to pull the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the complex 12-nation trade deal that Groser helped negotiate. Stryk, offering to work free, had a proposal. New Zealand would throw the biggest party of Trump\u2019s inauguration. Stryk would put the new administration\u2019s leading lights in the room; Groser would do the rest. \u2018\u2018It was about building brand recognition for New Zealand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk explained. \u2018\u2018If we can get them there, then forever, bad or good, Trump and New Zealand are a co-brand.\u2019\u2019", "In the tumult following Trump\u2019s win, Stryk was discovering that many of his old friends \u2014 most of them fellow Washington backbenchers, B-listers and understudies \u2014 had vaulted to positions of unexpected influence. A guy Stryk knew at the inaugural committee put out the word among Trump alums that New Zealand\u2019s party was the week\u2019s hot ticket. Stryk called a friend at Salem Media, the right-leaning media-and-talk-radio company, which signed on as a party sponsor. Another friend, the actor Jon Voight, agreed to attend as a special celebrity guest.", "In January, hundreds of guests packed into to the embassy\u2019s chancery, among them dozens of Trump-campaign alumni and future West Wing staff. Stryk rented a tuxedo jacket for the occasion. Groser gave a Trump-friendly speech, lauding the end of political correctness and the dawn of a new era in Kiwi-American relations. \u2018\u2018We had a party that rocked, frankly,\u2019\u2019 he told me recently. In one night, New Zealand had upended Washington\u2019s elaborate diplomatic pecking order. Diplomats and social secretaries at other embassies were left wondering how the country had pulled in so many Trump V.I.P.s. Trumpworld, previously inscrutable and unreachable to Groser\u2019s team, was now populated by friendly faces. \u2018\u2018Robert showed, \u2018I\u2019m connected,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 he told me.", "Groser decided to hire Stryk full time. Not long after, Stryk pulled $250,000 out of his savings, moved his family to the Washington suburbs and started hiring.", "T\nhere are about 10,000 registered lobbyists in Washington \u2014 roughly 20 for every member of Congress \u2014 and thousands more unregistered ones: consultants and \u2018\u2018strategic advisers\u2019\u2019 who are paid to help shape government policy but do not disclose their clients. By whatever name, they are the people companies and countries hire to help roll back regulations, unstick bids, tweak legislation or get meetings. Lobbying is at once Washington\u2019s most maligned, enduring and essential industry. Underpaid young politicos and retiring lawmakers depend on Beltway lobby shops \u2014 known as \u2018\u2018K Street\u2019\u2019 after the city boulevard that once housed many of them \u2014 for the high-six-figure salaries that will loft them into Washington\u2019s petite aristocracy. Congress needs K Street, too: After decades of cutting its own staff and research arms, much of Capitol Hill\u2019s institutional memory and policy expertise now resides in the lobbying industry. But the private sector needs lobbyists the most. The modern federal government is so sprawling and complex that it practically demands a specialized class of middlemen and -women.", "Over the decades, lobbying has evolved from a niche trade of fixers and gatekeepers to a sleek, vertically integrated, $3-billion-a-year industry. A good lobbyist doesn\u2019t go into a meeting asking for legislation; she or he already has the bill drafted, a coalition of businesses and trade groups poised to support it, a policy brief to hand out to reporters and to the officials positioned at dozens of decision points throughout the bureaucracy and relationships with advertising and polling firms to manage the public rollout. Everyone has a lobbyist \u2014 or three, or 50 \u2014 and the lobbyists know everyone. K Street is majestic and immovable, veined through Washington like fat through a prime steak.", "Like virtually every other candidate for president, Trump campaigned against this thicket of money and influence, positioning himself as an outsider who would \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 This pledge would soon prove more rhetorical than real, but it contained a grain of truth. Trump arrived in Washington with a relatively short baggage train of Beltway relationships and obligations. He didn\u2019t read policy briefs; he barely had policies. His inner circle was a hodgepodge of Breitbart alumni, nominally Democratic financiers, Trump Organization employees on loan, the odd reality-show star and Republicans who would have been unemployable in almost any other administration. The smart money in Washington \u2014 K Street and K Street\u2019s clients, the big corporations and trade associations \u2014 didn\u2019t quite know what to expect. But mostly, they didn\u2019t know whom to call.", "\u2018\u2018Many companies want to understand: What are the president\u2019s priorities?\u2019\u2019 Corey Lewandowski told me in February, a few weeks after the inauguration. \u2018\u2018But there are so few people in Washington who have a relationship or an understanding of him.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski, the president\u2019s former campaign manager, was happy to tell you that he was one of the few exceptions.", "Lewandowski\u2019s journey from obscure New Hampshire political operative to celebrity power broker was emblematic of how Trump\u2019s election scrambled Washington\u2019s hierarchies. Much like Stryk, Lewandowski had spent years in the lower ranks of conservative politics and lobbying. Being hired as Trump\u2019s campaign manager moved Lewandowski into the political big time, and being fired, midway through the race, did little to dislodge him. There were speaking gigs, a stint as a reliably pro-Trump pundit on CNN. At one point last year, Lewandowski even tried selling a book, tentatively titled \u2018\u2018Let Trump Be Trump\u2019\u2019; Stryk, introduced to Lewandowski by a mutual friend, helped him shop the proposal. \u2018\u2018Corey had a brand,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me, and that brand was valuable. HarperCollins offered Lewandowski $1.2 million, an astounding figure for a campaign manager \u2014 though the deal evaporated when Lewandowski refused to show HarperCollins a copy of his nondisclosure agreement with Trump.", "Through it all, Lewandowski remained close to Trump and spoke to him often. But after the election, the White House job Lewandowski hoped for never quite materialized. Now Lewandowski, too, was on K Street. He had joined up with another former Trump aide, Barry Bennett, to start a lobbying firm called Avenue Strategies.", "Unlike other people on K Street, Lewandowski did not pretend to be an expert on the legislative calendar or the fine points of the Administrative Procedure Act. He was an expert on Trump. \u2018\u2018There are just so few people in Washington who know the president,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski told me in February. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a comparative advantage.\u2019\u2019 He was not shy about playing up their friendship. He sometimes tweeted from the White House grounds. When journalists or other visitors came to his office, on Pennsylvania Avenue a few blocks from the White House, he would point out his window to where, he claimed, he could see the president\u2019s bedroom.", "His mind-meld with Trump was what made him valuable to clients, Lewandowski explained to me. \u2018\u2018I think what I bring is a level of understanding of the president\u2019s thought process,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018only because I had the privilege of being next to him for so long.\u2019\u2019 He was doing as many as nine or 10 meetings a day: Chief executives, prominent Republicans, even other lobbying firms wanted his advice. He offered it freely, Lewandowski told me. He wanted to be helpful. \u2018\u2018You know what a guy said to me the other day?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018You\u2019ve got a hot hand. Just remember, that hand\u2019s not going to be hot forever.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "One good source of business was the president\u2019s habit of calling chief executives to the White House for televised meetings. In January, when the chief executive of Whirlpool was summoned by Trump to discuss how to revive American jobs, the company asked Avenue Strategies to advise it. As one lobbyist who shared clients with Lewandowski put it to me, companies like Whirlpool needed to know the lay of the land inside the White House: How much sway did Wilbur Ross have? Was Steve Bannon for real? And what should the company do if Trump started dumping on it on Twitter?", "Everyone had seen what happened to Lockheed Martin. Lockheed, the federal government\u2019s single biggest contractor, is a powerful presence inside the Beltway. But through the winter, Trump had lashed out at the company over cost overruns on the F-35 fighter jet. The company\u2019s shares dropped each time, taking Lockheed\u2019s value down by billions of dollars. These were the kinds of problems that Lewandowski believed others on K Street couldn\u2019t help with. \u2018\u2018If you\u2019re a corporate C.E.O. and the president has tweeted at you and your stock has dropped 4 percent, you say: \u2018Why am I paying all these guys so much money?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said. The old model of Washington influence wouldn\u2019t work on Trump, he believed. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t know him, and they don\u2019t know any of his guys, and they don\u2019t understand how he thinks.\u2019\u2019 Eventually Lockheed, too, turned to Avenue.", "Over the course of a few conversations with the company\u2019s Washington office, Bennett told me, they advised Lockheed on how Marillyn Hewson, its president and chief executive, should approach conversations: \u2018\u2018Short, direct, honest answers,\u2019\u2019 as Bennett recounted it for me later. \u2018\u2018Feel free to educate the president. In the end, it\u2019s going to be transactional.\u2019\u2019 The next time Hewson met with Trump, a week before the inauguration, she came bearing gifts: a potential F-35 price cut and a promise to add jobs at a Texas plant.", "The Twitter attacks ceased. By the end of February, Trump was praising Lockheed. \u2018\u2018They\u2019ve just announced eighteen hundred new jobs,\u2019\u2019 Trump told reporters after a meeting with Hewson and other manufacturing executives. \u2018\u2018I have to say this, Marillyn, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of credit because what you did was the right thing.\u2019\u2019", "L\newandowski\u2019s help did not come cheap. A typical boutique lobbying firm might charge $10,000 to $15,000 a month. A big lobbying or law firm, with teams of para\u00adlegals or assistants and high overhead, might charge twice that, with a three-month retainer. Avenue sometimes asked for as much as $50,000 a month \u2014 a top-shelf price on K Street \u2014 and Lewandowski on occasion tried to go higher. But there were plenty of takers: By midwinter, Avenue had \u2018\u2018more than a dozen, less than 50\u2019\u2019 clients, Lewandowski told me at the time.", "The demand was so great that would-be Trump-whisperers were popping up in Washington like toadstools after a rainstorm. The former Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, a \u2018\u2018senior adviser\u2019\u2019 to the lobbying practice at Dentons, the world\u2019s largest law firm, was hawking a book titled \u2018\u2018Understanding Trump.\u2019\u2019 Established K Street firms were grabbing any Trump people they could find: Jim Murphy, Trump\u2019s former political director, joined the lobbying giant BakerHostetler, while another firm, Fidelis Government Relations, struck up a partnership with Bill Smith, Mike Pence\u2019s former chief of staff. All told, close to 20 ex-aides of Trump, friends and hangers-on had made their way into Washington\u2019s influence business.", "Beltway experience was not necessarily required. Squire Patton Boggs formed a \u2018\u2018strategic alliance\u2019\u2019 with Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s self-described \u2018\u2018personal attorney\u2019\u2019 from New York, who had scant government experience. There was also Brad Gerstman, a brawny Long Island lobbyist and P.R. man who had done work for Trump in New York over the years. On election night, Gerstman was so sure Trump was going to lose that he got on a plane to Israel. As Gerstman tells it, his business partner called as soon as he landed. \u2018\u2018Why the hell are you in Tel Aviv?\u2019\u2019 his partner asked. \u2018\u2018We have an office to open in Washington.\u2019\u2019 Gerstman hung up and went to his hotel, where he looked out over the Mediterranean, put a cigar in his mouth and listened to the congratulatory messages piled up in his voice mail. In January, he set up an office in downtown Washington. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t want to sell ourselves as just the Trump guys,\u2019\u2019 Gerstman told me. \u2018\u2018But maybe that\u2019s what it takes for the first few years.\u2019\u2019", "Many of the Trump-connected lobbyists told me they were turning away as much business as they accepted. One person offered Lewan\u00addowski $250,000 just to get the president to tweet about him. A lobbyist who worked on Trump\u2019s inaugural committee told me of a billionaire who, within a week of the inauguration, offered a million dollars if the lobbyist could arrange for his picture to be taken in the Oval Office with the new president. \u2018\u2018You can make $2 million if you want,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me, sounding almost apologetic. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like: \u2018I\u2019ve got a gold mine in Eastern Europe.\u2019 Or: \u2018My client is suing the I.R.S. \u2014 can you help?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "Not all of the new arrivals affected to be part of a revolution. One day this spring, I met with Brian Ballard, a veteran Florida lobbyist and top-tier Republican fund-raiser. Ballard had recently opened an office in Washington just a few blocks from the new Trump International Hotel. He had known Trump since the 1980s, and he later started lobbying regulators and state officials on behalf of Trump\u2019s golf courses and his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, but he was practical about the realities of politics. Like most of Florida\u2019s Republican old guard, he started the 2016 campaign backing the state\u2019s former governor, Jeb Bush, before switching to the state\u2019s junior senator, Marco Rubio. Once it became clear that Trump would lead the Republican ticket, Ballard enthusiastically joined the campaign as Trump\u2019s Florida finance chairman.", "Ballard, who is 56, had a ruddy Florida tan that marked him as new in town, and the serene confidence of a man who saw no way he could lose. At his office, an attractive receptionist led us into a spotless conference room. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not an expert in Washington, D.C.,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me when we sat down. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m an expert in lobbying.\u2019\u2019 In Florida, Ballard had a blue-chip list of corporate clients: Google, pharmaceutical companies, Big Sugar. His business plan was simple: to sign up his Florida clients for Trump-related advice in Washington. \u2018\u2018When I was on the campaign, they didn\u2019t want to pitch in,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of his clients. \u2018\u2018And now they say: \u2018How do I figure out what is going on here?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "By the end of his first 100 days in office, it seemed, Trump had not so much drained the swamp as enshrouded it with a billowing fog of uncertainty. No previous president had changed his mind more often, or contradicted his cabinet so frequently, or permitted such vicious ideological combat under his White House roof. Many clients just wanted to know what they could safely ignore. \u2018\u2018White Houses are always somewhat opaque places of fascination, where you don\u2019t quite know who is up and who is down, or how decisions are ultimately reached,\u2019\u2019 said Bruce P. Mehlman, a prominent Republican lobbyist who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u2018\u2018The added complexity here was there was not a single consistent governing philosophy. It was not clear if the president saw trade the way that Gary Cohn sees it or the way Steve Bannon sees it.\u2019\u2019", "Moreover, some of the usual paths through the bog were now closed. Hundreds of senior administration jobs were going unfilled, as Trump\u2019s cabinet secretaries battled with his inner circle over potential hires from among the Republican regulars in Washington. One lobbyist at a well-regarded firm with numerous financial clients told me that his problem was less that he didn\u2019t know whom to call than that there was no one to call: Infighting and vetting problems had stymied so many appointments at the Treasury Department that many of the offices were empty.", "All of this had inadvertently created an entirely new business model for Trump\u2019s friends and former employees. In normal times, K Street did much of its business on Capitol Hill, where the churn of legislation offered unending opportunity to deliver goodies for clients. But the power vacuum in Trump\u2019s cabinet agencies, and the inexperience of his West Wing staff, seemed to offer a different kind of opening. It was easy to imagine that a single phone call, coming from the right person, could redirect a major policy initiative. Some of the old firms would do O.K., Lewandowski thought \u2014 the ones that had relationships in Congress, that understood the intricate ballet of lawmaking. But the real action, he was betting, would be at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018I think this particular administration is really going to be driving the agenda,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018Not Congress.\u2019\u2019", "A\nfter New Zealand, Stryk\u2019s phone barely stopped ringing, and he quickly built up his own shop. Stuart Jolly, the ex-Trump campaign aide who worked out the phone call for New Zealand, became the new president of S.P.G. Stryk hired a former Central Intelligence Agency station chief and a few other ex-military and intelligence types, people who had contacts and expertise abroad. He also brought on an earnest young small-town lawyer from Oregon named Jacob Daniels, whom he met through his vineyard business. Daniels had been working out of his car, mostly on drunken-driving cases, when Stryk recommended him to Jolly for a job with the Trump campaign. Daniels ended up as the campaign\u2019s second in command in Michigan, where Trump became the first Republican to win in almost 30 years, making Daniels a Trumpworld rising star. Now he was Stryk\u2019s vice president of policy.", "On a balmy spring day in April, I met Stryk and a few of his colleagues on a terrace at the Army-Navy Country Club, a sprawling and immaculate golf club near the Pentagon; S.P.G. still didn\u2019t have a proper office. Stryk wore cowboy boots and a T-shirt under a rumpled black sport coat. Most of K Street, he told me, was \u2018\u2018a washing machine. Money just goes from one firm to another. No one creates any new wealth.\u2019\u2019 Stryk\u2019s own politics leaned libertarian, he told me; despite his firm\u2019s ties to the Trump team, he didn\u2019t think of himself as particularly Trumpy. One of the new hires, a Democratic foreign-policy veteran, had been good friends with Paul Wellstone, the liberal senator who died in 2002. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re here for the opportunities,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Not for the ideology.\u2019\u2019", "Stryk was focusing not on nervous companies but on nervous countries. He and his new team had made a list of the governments S.P.G. wanted to work for \u2014 NATO allies mostly, nothing iffy like Ukraine or Pakistan \u2014 and with New Zealand as his calling card, they pitched S.P.G. as the go-to foreign lobbying and advisory firm in Trump\u2019s Washington. Historically, foreign lobbying has been a specialized business dominated by a few big firms. Stryk viewed them as he viewed the rest of the lobbying industry: as a cartel ripe for disruption. Stryk pitched his clients policy expertise, round-the-clock work habits and personalized service.", "Stryk believed his team could penetrate the uncertainty surrounding the White House. He wanted to be a \u2018\u2018calming resource for foreign countries and businesses,\u2019\u2019 he told me \u2014 and there was a lot of calming to do. Over the course of a few months, the new president had managed to start a trade war with Canada, picked a fight with the prime minister of Australia and hinted that the United States might need to pull out of NATO. He also wanted to slash the State Department budget, and through the spring and summer, many senior jobs at State would remain unfilled. Everyone, even close allies, was looking for Sherpas and back doors. R. Nicholas Burns, the veteran American diplomat, told me that Trump\u2019s denuded State Department had left diplomats from perhaps a hundred countries \u2014 most of them smaller nations \u2014 without their traditional liaison to the United States government. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s never been anything like this, ever,\u2019\u2019 Burns said.", "Trump\u2019s statecraft had a way of generating new business in other ways, too. The president of the Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, was not a popular figure in Barack Obama\u2019s Washington: A right-wing populist who preached closer ties to Russia, he once banned the United States ambassador from Prague Castle, the Czech seat of government. Trump, naturally, invited him to Washington, and Zeman\u2019s government hired Stryk\u2019s firm to help plan the state visit. New Zealand needed to talk to the administration about a new bilateral trade agreement, now that Trump was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Korean trade association wanted help planning a conference in Washington but didn\u2019t know anyone in the Trump White House. Stryk\u2019s people got on the phone, cold-calling around the Commerce Department to find a senior official who would speak at the event. \u2018\u2018Most lobbyists are afraid of a \u2018no,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018A \u2018no\u2019 means you have no juice. I\u2019m not afraid of \u2018no.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "But Stryk\u2019s greatest coup was Saudi Arabia. Gulf-state oligarchs spend tens of millions of dollars a year lobbying in Washington and larding influential think tanks with grant money, and Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest spenders. The country\u2019s then-crown prince and minister of the interior, Mohammed bin Nayef, was an exception: He enjoyed deep ties to the American intelligence apparatus under President Obama and had never needed a lobbyist. This spring, however, Trump invited Nayef\u2019s chief rival \u2014 Mohammed bin Salman, the deputy crown prince and the king\u2019s son \u2014 to a formal White House lunch. The lunch sent ripples through Riyadh. Did Trump favor Salman? Accidentally or on purpose, Trump had just waded into Saudi Arabia\u2019s treacherous succession politics. Nayef found himself in need of guidance.", "In May, S.P.G. signed a contract to provide \u2018\u2018congressional and executive branch brand engagement\u2019\u2019 to the Saudi Ministry of the Interior \u2014 Nayef\u2019s domain. Stryk did not want to reveal much about his work for the Saudis, but lobbying records show that the fee was $5.4 million, payable up front.", "That was the other thing about foreign lobbying: It paid even better than corporate lobbying. Inevitably, Stryk had competition.", "I\nn keeping with Trump\u2019s America First campaign pledge, Barry Bennett once told reporters that Avenue would not work for foreign governments. Foreign politicians were another matter. By March, Bennett was sitting in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel with an Albanian party leader named Lulzim Basha.", "Basha was the young chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania, the country\u2019s conservative party, which was looking to unseat the ruling Socialist Party in elections scheduled for June. Basha borrowed liberally from Trump\u2019s playbook; he had attacked the Socialists for being in bed with crime syndicates and, simultaneously, with George Soros, whose foundation was active in Albania. His slogan was \u2018\u2018Make Albania Great Again.\u2019\u2019 Now, according to Bennett, Basha wanted help beating the Socialists in June \u2014 and who better to advise him than a couple of Trump-campaign veterans? Bennett told me that it was a cordial meeting and that he later sent Basha a proposed contract. \u2018\u2018I told him we\u2019d love to be his political consultant,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said. (Through a representative, Basha declined to comment.)", "Through an intermediary, the Albanian Democrats also reached out to Ballard, who was making his own push into foreign lobbying. He had brought on board a couple of partners with experience in Eastern Europe and Latin America, including a former Democratic congressman and a former ambassador. \u2018\u2018They called me,\u2019\u2019 Ballard said of Basha\u2019s party. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t know Albania in an atlas.\u2019\u2019 Ballard told them he couldn\u2019t help them. He was already working with the Albanian Socialists.", "When a friend referred the Socialists to him, Ballard told me, he had two questions. \u2018\u2018I asked: \u2018Is it a democracy?\u2019 Yes. \u2018Are they an ally of the U.S.?\u2019 Yes.\u2019\u2019 The Socialists had a story that was becoming increasingly familiar in Washington. After Trump won, most of the American diplomats their government had worked with seemed to vanish, and no one replaced them. One Albanian official, who asked not to be identified by name, told me his government felt that \u2018\u2018we had to increase our presence in Washington.\u2019\u2019 I asked him how his government picked Ballard. \u2018\u2018The internet makes it easy,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018You just Google.\u2019\u2019", "But as companies and countries vied for Trump\u2019s ear over the spring, the new Trump lobbyists found themselves competing with one another as much as with the established Washington firms. Ballard, for example, had explored working for members of the Venezuelan opposition. (\u2018\u2018I\u2019m no world-peace guy,\u2019\u2019 he told me, \u2018\u2018but I think I can help a little bit.\u2019\u2019) Lewan\u00addowski\u2019s firm, meanwhile, was pitching Citgo, the American subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company. (Avenue eventually signed Citgo, and in August the Trump administration would partly exempt the company from a new round of sanctions on the Venezuelan government.) Ballard was also working out a $1.5 million contract with Turkey \u2014 which put him up against Brad Gerstman, Trump\u2019s old New York guy. Gerstman\u2019s firm, Gotham Government Relations, had signed up a company linked to Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric whom the Turkish government blames for fomenting last year\u2019s failed coup.", "Not many lobbyists wanted to represent the Gulenists, partly because Trump appeared to have already picked a side. When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey won a widely disputed referendum in April granting himself expanded powers, Trump called to congratulate him. When Erdogan visited the White House some weeks later, Trump praised the bravery of Turkish soldiers and talked about beating ISIS together.", "I watched Erdogan and Trump\u2019s joint news conference on TV with Gerst\u00adman, who had been hired to spread the word about Erdogan\u2019s worldwide oppression of Gulenists. When Erdogan referred to the Gulen \u2018\u2018terrorist organization,\u2019\u2019 you could see Trump purse his lips during the translation, then nod a few times. It wasn\u2019t totally clear what the president was nodding about. Gerstman remained hopeful. \u2018\u2018Our view is that six months from now, everything is going to look different,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s fluid. It\u2019s dynamic.\u2019\u2019 He looked thoughtful. \u2018\u2018One thing we know about President Trump is he\u2019s not afraid to change.\u2019\u2019", "O\nne afternoon in late April, Jolly, Stryk\u2019s marquee Trumpworld hire, called me out of the blue. He was leaving S.P.G., he said. He told me he had grown uncomfortable with the firm\u2019s auditions for foreign clients, so he was going back to his own political-consulting business.", "Stryk was having his own qualms. Lewandowski had beaten him on some pitches, Stryk was told by prospective clients, by promising that he could get Trump on the phone \u2014 a promise Stryk felt he could not make. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t sell access to Trump,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know Donald Trump.\u2019\u2019 He was increasingly impatient with the notion that he was simply providing entree to the new administration. He was in negotiations to acquire a small design and branding firm. He saw S.P.G. evolving into something bigger and more stable, a full-service \u2018\u2018advisory\u2019\u2019 company that could compete with the most sophisticated shops on K Street \u2014 and beyond. Stryk saw Lewandowski\u2019s firm, and some of the others associated with the new administration, as short-term plays. They could sell access or surf the disruption, but he aimed to outlast it. \u2018\u2018Do they have business outside of this Trump phenomenon?\u2019\u2019 Stryk mused. \u2018\u2018The talk around town is, how long does this last before the business goes back to the establishment?\u2019\u2019", "Among the new arrivals, Ballard, at least, was doing pretty well. After only a few months in Washington, he had signed up more than 30 clients: energy companies, insurers, Amazon, American Airlines. The new Washington office would soon be on track to make $15 million in 2017, almost as much as his firm reported making in Florida last year. Ballard, unlike some of his competitors, was at ease in the swamp. He didn\u2019t want to beat the Washington establishment; he was here to join it. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no big firm that should worry about us,\u2019\u2019 Ballard told me. \u2018\u2018We augment other people, or they augment us. The Trump guys are not going to take over the town.\u2019\u2019", "If anything, the Trump guys were learning the downsides of proximity to the president. By spring, the Justice Department had appointed a special counsel to probe Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, an investigation that would quickly reach into the president\u2019s inner circle. The various White House factions seemed to spend as much time planting negative press on one another as they did figuring out what the president should do. When the White House got involved in big legislative battles, like the Obamacare repeal effort, it tended to hurt, not help.", "Proximity was proving an especially mixed blessing for Lewandowski. A stream of news stories had detailed promises he was supposedly making to clients, which he mostly denied \u2014 not just phone calls with Trump but also visits with White House officials and even access to Trump\u2019s Twitter account. In late April, Politico reported that Lewan\u00addowski and Bennett also owned another, separate company called Washington East West Political Strategies. This new firm, a vehicle for overseas consulting, had circulated at least one written proposal promising to arrange meetings with Trump and other administration officials, seeming to undercut Lewandowski\u2019s earlier denials. I later obtained a copy of the proposal, which named the potential client: Edi Rama, Albania\u2019s Socialist prime minister. The new firm \u2014 or as Bennett later explained, a business associate in Europe, acting without authorization \u2014 had pitched opposing candidates in the same campaign.", "Official Washington professed itself to be aghast at Lewandowski, who did not bother to couch his sales pitches in the Beltway\u2019s customary euphemisms: He was what they pretended not to be. Ethics watchdogs cast him as living proof of the hollowness of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u2018\u2018drain the swamp.\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski disagreed. In his view, the swamp was the sprawling, unresponsive bureaucracy, not the people you paid to help you get your phone calls returned. Still, friends of Lewandowski\u2019s told me that White House officials had advised him to keep a lower profile.", "By that point, it was hard to know exactly how well Avenue was doing. As the summer recess drew near, the firm had disclosed fewer than 10 lobbying clients. Among them were a San Diego-based environmental consulting firm and an Ohio payday lender \u2014 valuable clients, but not quite blue-chip. For every Whirlpool that asked Lewandowski for help, his rivals told me, there was another big company that decided he was too radioactive. Lockheed never actually signed a contract with Avenue; when news leaked of Lewandowski\u2019s role in advising it on Trump, a Lockheed spokesman issued a carefully worded statement that \u2018\u2018Lockheed has not retained Lewandowski, or his lobbying firm.\u2019\u2019 In the same way that most big chief executives turned up their noses at Trump during the campaign but now hoped he would deliver tax reform and sweeping deregulation, they wanted Lewandowski\u2019s help without being too closely associated with him.", "Then, too, Lewandowski\u2019s clout wasn\u2019t always what he promised. Puerto Rico\u2019s government, for example, hired Avenue to help ease the island\u2019s fiscal crisis. But the job pitted Lewandow\u00adski against a coalition of hedge funds that owned much of Puerto Rico\u2019s debt, and whose former lobbyist Trump had installed on his National Economic Council. The swamp\u2019s old guard prevailed: In late April, as Puerto Rican officials were begging Congress for more federal funding, Trump publicly dismissed their cause in his trademark fashion. \u2018\u2018Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars,\u2019\u2019 Trump tweeted. \u2018\u2018Sad!\u2019\u2019", "In a sense, Lewandowski\u2019s biggest problem was the president himself. Lewandowski had bet that the White House would be the center of energy and action in Trump\u2019s Washington, but instead the Trump administration was being swallowed by its own chaos. Divided by factions and backbiting, unable to wield full control of the bureaucracy or execute on many of its own ambitions, the administration was in danger of becoming a minor player in the policy debates of the day. Many companies were coming to the conclusion that on complex issues like tax reform, their energies were better directed at lawmakers on Capitol Hill \u2014 and their money better spent at the traditional lobbying firms stocked with ex-lawmakers and their former aides.", "Moreover, despite Trump\u2019s campaign pledges, many of the agencies he now oversaw had proved more than friendly to the legions of longtime Beltway lobbyists working for the energy, telecommunications and other industries. In many cases, Trump had hired them outright: By the summer, he had appointed more than 100 lobbyists to jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, the Federal Communications Commission and elsewhere. Their old clients didn\u2019t need much help from the new Trump guys on K Street. They already knew exactly whom to call.", "Perhaps that\u2019s why the traditional lobbying shops were doing just fine. As for protecting clients from Trump\u2019s Twitter howitzer \u2014 well, that had turned out to be easier than it looked, several lobbyists told me: Just show up in person, promise the president you\u2019ll create some jobs and publicly give him the credit. \u2018\u2018You make it about Trump and you link it to jobs, and you could be Russia or China and he will support you,\u2019\u2019 one told me. \u2018\u2018It is that unsophisticated.\u2019\u2019", "L\newandowski\u2019s office, when I finally got to see it, turned out to be a cramped room with scuffed yellow walls. His desk held a couple of commemorative Trump pens and a warm can of Monster energy drink. A new whiteboard, still in its wrapping, leaned against one wall; a carry-on suitcase leaned against another. I could see the White House, but only if I leaned over his desk and craned my neck.", "\u2018\u2018There it is,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski said, a little halfheartedly, pointing out the window. His day had not gotten off to a great start. That morning, Puerto Rico had filed for a territorial version of bankruptcy. A prominent watchdog group had sent a letter to the Justice Department asking officials there to investigate why Lewandowski had never registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a World War II-era law that imposes stringent disclosure requirements on Americans representing foreign governments in Washington. (Though Bennett and other Avenue employees had registered as lobbyists, Lewandowski insisted that most of his business was advising clients on strategy, not setting up meetings or contacting officials on their behalf, the kind of work that requires you to register.) Politico had struck again, revealing Avenue\u2019s Citgo contract. Technically, the United States-based company was owned by the left-wing government of Venezuela, whose vice president the Trump administration had accused of drug trafficking.", "Lewandowski told me he didn\u2019t work directly for foreign governments, notwithstanding the stories and documents. Not that he wouldn\u2019t be good at it \u2014 you know, if he wanted to. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t work for foreign governments, but if I were a foreign government, and I wanted to hire people who understood how to get to the president, there are a small number of people I would think of,\u2019\u2019 Lewan\u00addowski said. As he spoke, he seemed to recover his familiar brio. \u2018\u2018The establishment is so afraid of President Trump they will do anything. Which includes hiring individuals who have purported to be tied to the White House who really aren\u2019t.\u2019\u2019", "The next day, Lewandowski announced he was quitting Avenue. In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg, he explained that Bennett and their employees had been using his name to drum up business he didn\u2019t want, exposing him to criticism and sullying his reputation. He insisted he had never asked Trump for anything. \u2018\u2018People want to see me fail,\u2019\u2019 Lewandowski grumbled.", "\u2018\u2018I feel bad for Corey,\u2019\u2019 Bennett told me when I went to see him the following week. \u2018\u2018He didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But he\u2019s a lightning rod.\u2019\u2019 Bob Dole, he pointed out, had just signed a $500,000 contract for work on behalf of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a violence-racked country run by a kleptocratic strongman. But no one in Washington gave Bob Dole a hard time.", "\u2018\u2018He thought he could go in\u2019\u2019 \u2014 into the White House \u2014 \u2018\u2018during the second wave,\u2019\u2019 Bennett said of Lewandowski. K Street was just a way station for him, Bennett suggested, while he waited for the only job he truly wanted \u2014 the one he could picture when he gazed out his window, down Pennsylvania Avenue. \u2018\u2018Looking back on it, he probably should never have owned a chunk of a lobbying firm. In the media\u2019s mind, every client we had was Corey\u2019s client.\u2019\u2019 But even with Lewandowski gone, Bennett said, there was plenty of work. \u2018\u2018All of K Street is doing well right now,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Chaos is good for everyone\u2019s business.\u2019\u2019", "L\newandowski, I soon learned, hadn\u2019t really left the swamp. He had merely receded into the nebulous ranks of Washington\u2019s unregistered lobbyists. In July, he founded a new firm, Lewandowski Strategic Advisors. He offered clients \u2018\u2018strategic advice and counsel,\u2019\u2019 according to a copy of one contract I obtained, and had picked up at least one client from Avenue, the Ohio payday lender. He was back on TV more and more, energetically defending Trump and plumping for various private interests. At one point, I got a tip that he had been spotted in Taipei, Taiwan. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what he was doing there, or for whom he was working \u2014 \u2018\u2018I\u2019m just a private citizen,\u2019\u2019 he texted \u2014 but weeks later, he tweeted about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to approve a $1.42 billion arms sale to the country. He hadn\u2019t yet landed that White House job, but he was in the West Wing often, and he had a new Twitter avatar: a picture of himself standing on the stairs to Air Force One. Newt Gingrich\u2019s publisher had bought Lewandowski\u2019s Trump book, and by the end of the summer, he had added yet another gig, joining Trump\u2019s official super PAC, American First Action. Lewandowski had absorbed the swamp\u2019s most essential trait: adaptability.", "Not long ago, Stryk opened a proper Washington office, right in Georgetown, a stone\u2019s throw from the Four Seasons. The new space was undecorated and unmarked, and there wasn\u2019t much there yet but a couple of laptops. But Stryk was buoyant. He was about to sign two more big foreign lobbying clients, the governments of Afghanistan and Kenya, along with a pharmaceutical firm. Saudi Arabia had canceled its S.P.G. contract after Stryk\u2019s client, the crown prince, was deposed in a palace reshuffle, and New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry had decided that its embassy no longer needed Stryk\u2019s services. But in Stryk\u2019s view, these were just hiccups. Competitors around town \u2014 big firms that had never given him the time of day \u2014 were starting to ask around about S.P.G., wondering who they were and how they were getting so much business.", "In about a month, Trump\u2019s ham-handed defense of white nationalists and white supremacists rallying in Charlottesville would prompt most of the chief executives serving on White House advisory councils to quit in protest. It would cost the chief executives something, losing their face time with this impressionable, transactional president \u2014 and their loss would be K Street\u2019s gain. Those same companies would now just rely more on their lobbyists, or on the trade associations they belonged to, to drive their agendas.", "But as we sat down in his new conference room, Stryk was already looking beyond the Beltway. He saw Trump\u2019s disruption spreading beyond Washington, to foreign capitals and overseas markets. The chaos in Trump\u2019s government was creating a vacuum abroad, one that entrepreneurs like Stryk could fill with deal-making and private diplomacy. \u2018\u2018I want to grow a business that\u2019s 200 million a year,\u2019\u2019 Stryk told me. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re not going to get that arranging dinners in Washington.\u2019\u2019", "The new contracts with Afghanistan and Kenya, Stryk explained, were prototypes for the kind of business he wanted to do, an escape from the washing machine. The Afghans and the Kenyans didn\u2019t just want help with the Trump administration. They wanted help with everything: attracting American investment, troubleshooting problems in other foreign capitals, finding companies that could build them roads or manage their health care records.", "So recently, Stryk had begun pitching investors on a new venture: a $5 billion private-equity fund that would specialize in infrastructure and procurement. One side of the business, the lobbying, would identify government customers abroad; the other side would invest in companies that could deliver what those governments needed. Secure voting systems, border-security hardware \u2014 the opportunities were limitless. \u2018\u2018It is our job, as conservatives and capitalists, to take the chaos and do with it what we can,\u2019\u2019 Stryk said. \u2018\u2018Our goal is to take an environment that was created by the president and use it to \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused for a second, thinking. \u2018\u2018To do some good.\u2019\u2019"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/podcasts/the-daily/charlottesville-white-nationalist-trump.html": ["Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher", "Protests over a plan to remove a statue of a Confederate general in Charlottesville, Va., spun out of control, leading to clashes that left at least one person dead and 34 others injured.", "President Trump condemned the unrest, blaming \u201chatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\u201d but he did not specifically criticize the rally by white nationalists or their neo-Nazi slogans.", "On today\u2019s episode:", "\u2022 Sheryl Gay Stolberg, domestic affairs correspondent for The Times, was in Charlottesville over the weekend.

The company making the devices failed to deliver enough of them, and some of those provided did not work.", "But when Eneco sent workers to recover the monitors, something strange happened \u2014 a tenth of customers refused to open their doors. \u201cThey wanted to keep it,\u201d said Tako in \u2019t Veld, a former Eneco executive who now leads the \u201csmart energy\u201d unit at Quby, the company that makes the energy meter. \u201cThey were so happy with the energy insight.\u201d", "The test in 2010 was part of Eneco\u2019s efforts to adapt to upheaval in the energy market. In recent years, large volumes of wind and solar-generated electricity have undermined the economics of traditional power plants and provided the outlines of a future in which conventional power plants no longer supply the bulk of a home\u2019s electricity.", "Through acquisitions (including of Quby), by nurturing a cluster of start-ups and with other initiatives, Eneco has sought to provide new services to customers \u2014 and, in doing so, to enter new sectors, like the charging of electric vehicles and the repair of solar panels.", "\u201cWe said \u2018we have to create an increasing customer loyalty by doing something different,\u2019\u201d said Hans Valk, chief executive of Quby and formerly the leader of Eneco\u2019s consumer business. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is switch from selling a pure commodity to selling energy as a service.\u201d", "For instance, Eneco owns Jedlix, an electric vehicle charging unit, which has partnerships with Tesla and BMW and allows car owners to recharge their vehicles inexpensively when there are large supplies of renewable energy on the grid. Jedlix sometimes even pays them to do so.", "Eneco is also starting a business called CrowdNett which, unusually, pays customers for some of their power. Eneco looks for people who already have solar panels at home and tries to sell them a large home battery, like a Tesla Powerwall. Surplus power generated by the solar panels is stored in the battery and Eneco taps into a portion of that storage to help balance the electricity grid. Customers will receive 450 euros, or $530, a year for allowing use of their batteries.", "Eneco\u2019s leaders concede that they are proceeding more by trial and error than following a grand plan. Still, these efforts may, over time, aid the company\u2019s survival and contribute to creating ways to help consumers shift to cleaner energy.", "\u201cThey are very forward-looking in terms of strategy and mind-set,\u201d said Roberta Bigliani, a vice president at IDC, a market research firm. If Eneco\u2019s experiments flop, though, \u201cthey definitely will not be in operation in the future,\u201d she said.", "So far, the experiment with its wall-mounted energy monitor, known as Toon, has been among its more successful.", "When Eneco first considered the test, the utility was locked in a profit-zapping battle with competitors, cutting prices for electric power and natural gas while giving customers gifts for signing up. Seeing the danger signs, Eneco\u2019s management decided that a radical change was necessary.", "The Toon offered Eneco an opportunity to shift course and, despite early teething problems, Eneco expanded the rollout. The meters allow customers to control their domestic heating settings through a smartphone app, and they have displays that show electricity and natural gas consumption in detail, along with other information like weather forecasts.", "Much as telephone companies offer discounted devices with longer-term contracts, the Toon typically comes as part of a utility contract; Eneco customers pay \u20ac3.50 a month for the meter. In return, customers say it helps them save energy, offering the dual benefits of saving money and cutting the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for climate change.", "Quby says it has placed more than 300,000 Toons in Dutch homes and has deals to supply the devices to other utilities, like Engie in Belgium and Viesgo in Spain.", "In his home north of Amsterdam, Marco Westenbrink has a Toon on his living room wall. \u201cIt is always there like it\u2019s my big brother, and it is always staring at me,\u201d the graphic designer said in an interview in his garden, overlooking a canal. \u201cYou can call it annoying, but it makes you completely aware.\u201d", "Mr. Westenbrink, who lives with his wife in a cozy, century-old house in Krommenie, estimates that the Toon has helped them cut their annual energy bills by nearly a third, to about \u20ac2,000.", "His wife, Karin Krol, says the Toon is also helping their family battle climate change. \u201cWe believe that small things can change the environment,\u201d she said.", "Those who sign up for the Toon cut their average annual energy consumption by around a tenth, according to Quby. Lower energy consumption would not necessarily seem to be in Eneco\u2019s interests, but it figures that any loss in revenue will be more than offset by growth in its services business. (The company does not provide details on its services unit in its public filings.)", "Already, through Toons, Eneco can monitor the performance of natural gas boilers and solar panels and can send repair people when equipment needs servicing. And, as Mr. Valk, the Quby chief, had hoped, the devices have helped reduce the number of customers who leave Eneco for other providers by 60 percent, the company says.", "Mr. Valk envisions a future where customers pay for various services, rather than kilowatts of energy. Unlike today\u2019s dominant sources of electricity, wind and solar power are essentially free once equipment is installed. So, \u201cyou are going to pay for flexibility, not for the \u2018neutrons,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valk said.", "Eneco has also invested heavily in wind power, in part so that it can assure environmentally minded customers that their power comes from cleaner sources. That has paid dividends: The company has a 10-year contract to supply Google with clean energy for an electricity-hungry data storage center that opened last year in Eemshaven, in the north of the Netherlands.", "Much of Eneco\u2019s strategy is in its infancy. CrowdNett, the battery storage service, has only a few dozen clients, but the utility has big ambitions for the initiative. If enough battery owners sign on, Eneco says, it can use software to electronically aggregate and sell the power, like a conventional utility.", "Daan Berkouwer, who works for a water management company, said the combination of financial incentives and the promise of cutting emissions helped him decide to buy a lozenge-shape Tesla Powerwall battery to use with CrowdNett.", "\u201cWhen everybody is doing this, then the oil companies can quit with their production,\u201d said the 27-year-old Mr. Berkouwer, who lives with his wife on the outskirts of Gouda, the town famous for its cheese. \u201cWhy take out all the oil and demolish the planet if you can do it with clean energy?\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/dining/opentable-restaurant-reservations.html": ["Almost 20 years ago, a new company came on the scene promising to revolutionize the tedious and often frustrating chore of securing a restaurant reservation.", "No more waiting on the phone and pleading with snooty receptionists.

Restaurants would benefit, too, handing off the job of juggling tables and recording reservations in a bulky book.", "The company was called OpenTable, and, since its genesis in 1998, it has come to dominate the field it created. Today, it says it seats more than 23 million diners a month in 43,000 restaurants across the globe.", "Two decades on, though, the company faces a number of troubles that threaten that hold. Priceline, which now owns it, has written down the company\u2019s value and said it is reducing investments in the system.

After all, the restaurants are paying monthly fees for the service.", "But winning over restaurateurs, many of whom have accumulated a long list of gripes against what they perceive as cookie-cutter approach to their reservation woes, is still a challenge.", "\u201cThese kinds of technologies have been a boon for the diner,\u201d said David Barber, an owner of Blue Hill in New York City and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester County. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s delivered this great efficiency to the restaurant business is kind of a myth, especially for fine-dining restaurants.\u201d", "OpenTable is not just standing by as others invade its turf.

Last November, Priceline announced that it had written off $941 million of OpenTable\u2019s value, after a rapid burst of investment to expand the service\u2019s international offerings failed to produce the expected profits. The travel behemoth, which paid $2.6 billion for OpenTable in 2014, also predicted a \u201cmaterial reduction in forecasted long-term financial results and a reduction in investment\u201d in the business.", "Leslie Cafferty, a Priceline spokeswoman, said OpenTable is profitable and bigger than it was then.

Resy follows up to remind diners when a reservation they made is imminent.", "Users can also put themselves on a waiting list at some restaurants, which makes it much easier to ensure that all tables will be filled, since most cancellations happen within 24 hours before the reservation time. As a result, Resy says, it has brought no-shows down to under 4 percent on average; the usual rate is as much as 15 percent, the company said.", "Perhaps the company\u2019s biggest coup, though, was winning over Union Square Cafe when that perennially popular New York restaurant reopened in December. Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, was on the OpenTable board for almost two decades and one of its best ambassadors.", "In the mid-1990s, when Mr. Meyer was working to open his second restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, he tried starting a similar system himself. He didn\u2019t even think about using it to allow customers to make reservations online; rather, it was to be an answer to a perennial problem.", "\u201cI was tired of this recurring problem we had in the restaurant, where people would always be yelling up and down the stairs, saying, \u2018Who\u2019s got the reservation book?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cOne time a fraternity brother of mine pulled a prank and took the book out of the restaurant entirely \u2014 it was not a nice prank.\u201d", "So when he opened Eleven Madison Park in 1998, OpenTable was taking the reservations. When Blue Smoke opened in 2002, the only way to make a reservation was via OpenTable; a phone line was discontinued. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAn online blog called Daily Candy announced that step and within hours, we had filled the entire restaurant for a month.\u201d", "But OpenTable had its limitations. Until recently, for instance, it would not link the reservation systems at the Union Square group\u2019s restaurants. A free-spending diner who patronized Union Square Cafe for years could show up at Gramercy Tavern for the first time, and the host would not know him.", "Mr. Meyer said that, to some extent, OpenTable had been criticized unfairly. After all, it still seats far more diners in restaurants like his than any other service, and serves all the Union Square group restaurants except Union Square Cafe and the new Martina, which doesn\u2019t take reservations. Nonetheless, he said, \u201cthe latest round of assaults from start-ups looking to eat their lunch is more than they\u2019ve ever faced before.\u201d", "The rivals have easily identified OpenTable\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel: the fees it charges restaurants every time someone books a table using its system. For reservations made on OpenTable, the restaurant pays $1 for each diner. Even if reservations are made on the restaurant\u2019s website, OpenTable charges 25 cents a diner. And if they don\u2019t show up, the restaurant recoups none of those fees, several restaurateurs said. (OpenTable, however, says it charges fees only for guests who do show up.)", "That galled Anjan Mitra, proprietor of Dosa, a popular Indian restaurant with locations in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif.

The company doesn\u2019t need to attract marquee dining spots to entice users, who are already coming to it for reviews, giving it a major advantage.", "Yelp Reservations charges a restaurant $249 a month, and, in exchange, a reservations option is added to the top of its page on the Yelp app and website. \u201cMany people planning to make a reservation for dinner are already opening Yelp to figure out where they want to go, and now they can see whether there\u2019s a table waiting for them or not,\u201d said Vishwas Prabhakara, the general manager of Yelp Reservations.", "He said the flat-monthly-fee model used by most of the new reservation services helped discourage a restaurant practice that infuriates customers: holding back tables during prime hours. Some restaurants do that because they know they can fill the tables on their own at those times, and they like to seat valuable guests who show up at the last minute.", "\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive to hold tables back because you\u2019re not having to pay for each reservation,\u201d Mr. Prabhakara said.", "Nick Kokonas, an owner of the Chicago restaurants Alinea and Next, said he helped found the online reservation system Tock in 2014 because he was frustrated with his own experience with OpenTable.", "\u201cPeople in the restaurant business have moved from fear of change to a recognition that OpenTable was built in 1998,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really kept up innovation-wise, and part of that is because of the architecture of their technology.\u201d", "He said that, until this summer, OpenTable gave restaurants only \u201cone blank box on the screen\u201d to enter a wide range of information on a diner \u2014 such as dietary restrictions, preferred nights of the week and wines ordered \u2014 instead of separate fields that made it easy to see if a customer, say, has lactose intolerance.", "\u201cNot to be creepy, but instantaneous and easy-to-read customer data is the best way we have to give the customer the best service,\u201d Mr. Kokonas said. \u201cIt lets us know that the last time you were here, you finished with a special spiced tea that you liked, and we can make that happen again and easily.\u201d", "Mr. Jampol of OpenTable said that his company also compiles piles of similar data on customers that restaurants could use \u2014 but that they rarely want it. \u201cRestaurateurs have a lot of things to keep track of every day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as much as they say they want data, they\u2019re often too busy to dive into it.\u201d", "Nonetheless, Mr. Kokonas and others see an opportunity to do it better. Tock, which was co-founded by Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google engineer, spent roughly two years building its system, testing different components with restaurants and getting feedback. It is web-based rather than app-based, because that makes it easier for restaurants to log in and configure Tock to their needs.", "Other new reservation services are also looking to please restaurants. Reserve has adopted an \u201copen data model\u201d that allows its restaurants to see what diners are looking for, and, since it tweaked it service in May, it is adding more than 100 restaurants a month (for a total of 850), said Peter Esmond, its vice president for customer success.", "Say a potential customer is seeking a table for four at 7:30 p.m., and a restaurant is showing nothing available at that time. If it has a table available then that it has held back, it can quickly add it to its Reserve page in an effort to attract the booking.", "Thus, more control over how reservations are made is put in the hands of restaurants, rather than the reservation app.", "At Blue Hill, Reserve worked with Mr. Barber to tailor its product to his needs. And that, Mr. Barber said, is why a monolithic reservation titan like OpenTable may be a thing of the past.", "\u201cTrying to build ubiquitous software that will meet all the needs of high-, middle- and low-priced restaurants and make consumers happy, that\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a baseline product that comes close to what OpenTable does and then allows some customization, that\u2019s what the restaurant business wants \u2014 and then customers will really start to see the benefit of these things.\u201d", "Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

It would clean up the balance sheet. Deep-pocketed players like Google, Apple and Intel are new rivals in the race toward autonomous driving. Lacking investment firepower, Mr. Marchionne has stayed largely on the technological sidelines, though last week he took his company into the Intel-Mobileye-BMW alliance.", "Yet handing the keys to Jeep to a new owner would combust even the modest earnings that are currently anticipated.

The computers may have been mostly beige and balky, but certain developments were destined to pay off down the road. Steve Jobs returned to a floundering Apple after years of corporate exile, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer finally nailed the world-champion chess master Garry Kasparov with a checkmate, and a couple of Stanford students registered the domain name for a new website called google.com. Nineteen ninety-seven also happened to be the year that the software engineer Ellen Ullman published \u201cClose to the Machine: Technophilia and Its Discontents,\u201d her first book about working as a programmer in a massively male-dominated field.", "That slender volume became a classic of 20th-century digital culture literature and was critically praised for its sharp look at the industry, presented in a literary voice that ignored the biz-whiz braggadocio of the early dot-com era. The book had obvious appeal to technically inclined women \u2014 desktop-support people like myself then, computer-science majors, admirers of Donna J. Haraway\u2019s feminist cyborg manifesto, those finding work in the newish world of website building \u2014 and served as a reminder that someone had already been through it all and took notes for the future.", "Then Ullman retired as a programmer, logging out to go write two intense character-driven thriller novels and the occasional nonfiction essay. The digital economy bounced back after the Epic Fail of 2000 and two decades later, those techno-seeds planted back in 1997 have bloomed. Just look at all those smartphones, constantly buzzing with news alerts and calendar notifications as we tell the virtual assistant to find us Google Maps directions to the new rice-bowl place. What would Ullman think of all this? We can now find out, as she\u2019s written a new book, \u201cLife in Code: A Personal History of Technology,\u201d which manages to feel like both a prequel and a sequel to her first book.", "Don\u2019t panic, non-nerds. In addition to writing code in multiple computer languages, Ullman has an Ivy League degree in English and knows how to decode her tech-world adventures into accessible narratives for word people: \u201cTime went on; I graduated from Cornell and moved to San Francisco, where, one day in 1979, I walked past a Radio Shack store on Market Street and saw in the window a microcomputer called the TRS-80. Reader, I bought it.\u201d", "Her work as an active programmer spanned about 20 years, ending in the 1990s, but some experiences stay with you forever. \u201cThe role they assigned to me, translator, is perhaps the most accurate description of everything I have ever done concerning technology,\u201d she writes of one gig. As I\u2019ve found in my own scribbling about tech, language skills and accurate translation are essential to understanding in both human and computer systems. The most useful bit of prep I had for that came from the two years of Attic Greek I once took to fulfill a curriculum requirement for a theater degree. Converting text into plain language for the inquiring masses is vital, whether it be wrestling Xenophon\u2019s \u201cAnabasis\u201d or Linux engineer notes into English.", "The first three-fifths of \u201cLife in Code\u201d is primarily composed of essays published elsewhere between 1994 and 2004, while newer material from 2012 to early 2017 fills out the rest. The technology mentioned within those early chapters often recalls quaint discovery, like finding a chunky, clunky Nokia cellphone in the back of the junk drawer. The piece on preparing computers for the Year 2000 has a musty time-capsule feel, but the philosophical questions posed in other chapters \u2014 like those on robotics and artificial intelligence \u2014 still resonate.", "While the electrified economy had yet to complete its first dramatic cycle of boom and bust when her first book came out, a 1998 essay in \u201cLife in Code\u201d shows Ullman, Cassandra-like and ever the pragmatic pessimist, already bracing for the coming storm. \u201cI fear for the world the internet is creating,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBefore the advent of the Web, if you wanted to sustain a belief in far-fetched ideas, you had to go out into the desert, or live on a compound in the mountains, or move from one badly furnished room to another in a series of safe houses.\u201d These days, she\u2019s still concerned about the damage the internet is doing to culture, privacy and civility.", "What hasn\u2019t changed in the past 20 years is the dominant demographic of the technology industry and its overall lack of diversity. Ullman addresses these topics in the latter part of the book, as she observes online classes for newer programming languages like Python and feels put off by the \u201cunderlying assumption of male, white, geeky American culture\u201d with science fiction TV shows woven into the course material. She worries that this approach may alienate people who aren\u2019t familiar with it, and imagines a time when the general public is writing their own code for the world they need. \u201cWhat I hope is that those with the knowledge of the humanities break into the closed society where code gets written: invade it,\u201d Ullman writes. But, she warns, be prepared for an environment of \u201cboyish men who bristle at the idea of anyone unlike them invading their territory.\u201d", "She has many stories of her own to share on the topic of gender relations in the office and points out that not all of them were bad. In one case, she tolerates frequent comments about her hair from one addled man in order to learn more about various aspects of computing from him. \u201cI did have pretty hair; I went on to become a software engineer.\u201d", "As then, not all men today are hostile to women and many are quite accepting, but the misogyny Ullman experienced in her programming days seems to have escalated in some places. Perhaps this is because of the antler-whacking nature of today\u2019s hyper-driven culture, as illustrated in the situations of women like Susan J. Fowler, who set the executive dominoes cascading at Uber earlier this year with a blog post detailing overt and unchecked sexual harassment by her male manager. A recent 10-page internal memo (by a male Google engineer) that lambasted the company\u2019s diversity efforts also shined a light on workplace culture for some. The abuse of women, the L.G.B.T. community and racial, religious and ethnic minorities on social media is also well-documented \u2014 and much more vitriolic than flare-ups like the recent bout of androcentric caterwauling over the casting of a woman in the lead role on \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d", "As noted by Anna Wiener in an interview with Ullman for The New Republic, Twitter \u201cwould look a lot different today if it had been built by people for whom online harassment was a real-life concern.\u201d When reading \u201cLife in Code\u201d later, I thought of Ullman\u2019s musings about interface design in general: \u201cTo build such a crash-resistant system, the designer must be able to imagine \u2014 and disallow \u2014 the dumbest action.\u201d Let\u2019s face it, a queer female gamer of color is going to have a very different idea of \u201cthe dumbest action\u201d than a 23-year-old white brogrammer and we need that perspective. (As for Twitter, Ullman considers the service a broadcaster of \u201cthought farts.\u201d)", "It may take a generation, but progress to find balance and representation in the tech and tech-driven world is happening. And the invasion is underway, with women-in-tech groups like Girls Who Code, Project Include, the Anita Borg Institute and its Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (a conference named for the Navy rear admiral, herself a programming pioneer) striving for diversification on multiple fronts. Because, as Ullman observes, \u201cthe world of programmers is not going to change on its own.\u201d One hopes she\u2019ll check back in 20 years to comment on how it\u2019s going."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/podcasts/the-daily/steve-bannon-breitbart-news.html": ["Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: On iPhone or iPad | On Android via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher", "Stephen K.

In 2015, a three-minute New Rockstars video speculating about how the next \u201cFast & Furious\u201d movie would address the death of the co-star Paul Walker generated 8.6 million views, and New Rockstars promptly changed its business plan.", "\u201cThe moment we saw the response to that \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 video, we decided to reduce all the coverage on all the YouTubers,\u201d said Jeben Berg, a former Google executive and a partner in Zealot Networks, which owns New Rockstars. \u201cPeople wanted to see heightened, sensible, intelligent speculation on what was happening on big Hollywood film properties.\u201d", "New Rockstars videos now typically generate a few hundred thousand views each.

After a stint at the celebrated Bay Area restaurant La Folie, Mr. Keao labored in Silicon Valley, running the Hangout Cafe at Google for a time. But he missed the heady mash-up of the food on which he was raised and bristled at the ignorance in which his ancient culture was held.", "\u201cThe only thing anyone knew about Hawaiian culture out here,\u201d he said, \u201cwas pineapple and ham on a pizza.\u201d", "Thus Aina was born. The name comes from a Hawaiian concept that conveys love of the land. Since the 38-seat restaurant is about 2,300 miles from the land he loves, for Mr. Keao that means a lot of air miles.", "Take, for example, one of the most popular items on the brunch menu, a maximalist version of French toast that arrives buried under a macadamia nut crumble, salted coconut caramel, a spray of fresh strawberries, a cloud of vanilla whipped cream and a few leaves of mint. The bread itself, sweet and soft, is flown in weekly from Punaluu Bake Shop, a century-old bakery on the southern tip of Hawaii. Also flown in is the poi, or taro root paste, and the fresh hearts of palm, which are served pickled, roasted, fresh and fermented. Cords of kiawe, a Hawaiian hardwood, arrive weekly; Mr. Keao uses it to smoke fish, meat and vegetables.", "Aina\u2019s menu is both international and uniquely Hawaiian. It courses with the often fractious history of the island. Influences include Portuguese (plump guava-stuffed doughnuts called malasadas), Japanese (bento boxes and furikake rice) and American (artisanal Spam from Stone Valley Farm).", "But there are plenty of native Hawaiian dishes, like pipikaula, a type of Hawaiian beef jerky here made with shoyu-cured short rib and accessorized with puffed paiai, or taro root. Even better-known dishes like poke are creatively tweaked: Aina\u2019s comes with limu (Hawaiian algae), inamona (a relish made of kukui nuts), fresh hearts of palm, smoked sesame oil, shiso and sea grass. (Mr. Keao is planning a tasting menu for later this summer.)", "But there is one ingredient you will not find at Aina: pineapple. That it came to be so associated with the island, Mr. Keao said, \u201cis infuriating.\u201d For Hawaiians, pineapple has a painful colonial history. (The fruit was popularized in Hawaii by the American Dole family after Sanford Dole helped overthrow Hawaii's queen.)", "\u201cI\u2019m here to challenge people about what they think they know about Hawaii,\u201d Mr. Keao said, \u201cand teach them about the land I love.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html": ["Through Aug. 20.

It offers a rare balm in a moment when tumult reigns on so many fronts, and takes its title, \u201cThe Small Exceeds,\u201d from Hexagram 62 of the I Ching, which heralds \u201cthe preponderance of the small,\u201d and counsels the strengths of restraint, conscientiousness and modesty. \u201cSmall things may be done,\u201d it says. \u201cGreat things should not be done. If a man occupies a position of authority for which he is by nature really inadequate, extraordinary prudence is necessary.\u201d", "The quietude begins with a shoji screen by Mr. Childress that blocks off the gallery\u2019s front window, its lightweight frame reiterating the six basic lines of the hexagram structure. The screen\u2019s structure and softening effects are echoed at the back of the gallery in the atmospheric yet geometric blacks and grays of a painting by Mr. Childress. In the middle of the space, Siebren Versteeg\u2019s \u201cSunyata\u201d \u2014 the Buddhist concept of emptiness or voidness \u2014 gives you a notion of chance in action: Resembling a glowing glass coffee table with a modernistic lamp, it is actually a large LCD monitor laid horizontal and outfitted with a webcam arcing over it.

The asymmetry of Kate Casey\u2019s \u201cOffset Bench\u201d may make you look twice to discover its balance and, in its details, its symmetry. Lena Schmid\u2019s large, carefully textured landscape on paper might be a pictorial response to Hexagram 62\u2019s invocation of \u201cThunder Over the Mountain.\u201d That it is a monotype and not, as it first appears, a charcoal drawing somehow makes it stranger. Next to it, Katy Fischer\u2019s magical \u201cShards 9\u201d may inspire a similar double take: What seem to be found ceramic fragments in irregular shapes are in fact carefully formed and glazed objects, suggesting the evolution of language and tools in a universe in which every different thing is perfect.", "In the resonating oppositions and agreements of these works, Mr. Childress\u2019s show resembles a well-made puzzle, perhaps a kind of hexagram.

That improved the odds people would stay in their seats while fostering some good will with a quicker interruption.", "That rationale helped Fox charge roughly as much for the six-second spots on the show as it did for 15-second ads, according to people familiar with the negotiations, and reduced the program\u2019s overall commercial time.", "Similarly, Fox has been able to maintain the premium for the six-second ads it is selling now by pointing to lucrative placements, like just before kickoff for an N.F.L. game, the people said. While the ads are being sold as part of broader packages, a six-second spot could cost, at the high end, around $200,000, they said.", "Six seconds has become something of a magic number for video ads online.

At places like Google and the University of California, Berkeley, robots have already used the technique to learn simple tasks like picking things up or opening a door.", "All this is why Mr. Amodei and Mr. Christiano are working to build reinforcement learning algorithms that accept human guidance along the way.

This is how Facebook identifies faces in snapshots, and it\u2019s how Google instantly searches for images inside its Photos app.", "But Mr. Goodfellow and others have shown that hackers can alter images so that a neural network will believe they include things that aren\u2019t really there. Just by changing a few pixels in the photo of elephant, for example, they could fool the neural network into thinking it depicts a car.", "That becomes problematic when neural networks are used in security cameras. Simply by making a few marks on your face, the researchers said, you could fool a camera into believing you\u2019re someone else.", "\u201cIf you train an object-recognition system on a million images labeled by humans, you can still create new images where a human and the machine disagree 100 percent of the time,\u201d Mr. Goodfellow said. \u201cWe need to understand that phenomenon.\u201d", "Another big worry is that A.I. systems will learn to prevent humans from turning them off. If the machine is designed to chase a reward, the thinking goes, it may find that it can chase that reward only if it stays on. This oft-described threat is much further off, but researchers are already working to address it.", "Mr. Hadfield-Menell and others at U.C.

I mean, it\u2019s an existential sadness. I\u2019m not going to hitch my sadness to what happened over the weekend, but...I was on vacation. The show was on vacation. For some reason, all hell breaks loose in Charlottesville, Virginia.", "JW: For many reasons, which we\u2019re going to get into.", "WM: And I don\u2019t know. I feel like we had to come back and talk to each other about it because it seemed crazy not to. What is the point of having the show if when things like this happen we can\u2019t talk about them? And every time these things come up, I get down because it forces me to remember how little people understand about the history of this country that they want to fight for.", "JW: Willfully don\u2019t understand.", "WM: What\u2019s going on with you? How are you?", "JW: I\u2019m recovering from this surreality. Is that a word? Surreality.", "WM: Sure, yeah.", "JW: Of looking at the lawn in Charlottesville at the University of Virginia that I streaked the night before graduation, woke up the morning of graduation on, and then walked down later that afternoon to graduate and enter into the real world being transformed into a white nationalist/supremacist rally. I can\u2019t get over that. Although I shouldn\u2019t be surprised given what I know about UVA\u2019s history, which is that it had its own chapter of the Ku Klux Klan which also donated money many times over that school\u2019s history, and that UVA was once the site of one of the best known eugenics research programs in the country during the first half of the 20th century.", "WM: Oh, boy. With that, let\u2019s actually talk about what is going on right now.", "JW: Let\u2019s do it.", "WM: I guess...what happened? What is happening? We\u2019re having this conversation on Tuesday, the Tuesday after the Friday of the precipitating events in which a group of white supremacists went on a march with tiki lamps and heil Hitler signs in Charlottesville. That was Friday, and then Saturday, a rally turned into a melee between the supremacists and the anti racists and the anti fascists and some other groups that were there to allegedly keep the peace.", "JW: A lot of people were hurt, a woman was killed, and now we\u2019re all let scratching our heads going, what\u2019s going on in America? What\u2019s going on in our country?", "WM: Yeah. And I think part of the reason that we\u2019re having this conversation right now \u2014 like, the two of us are having this conversation right now \u2014 is that nobody seems to know what to do. I mean, there\u2019s a camp of people that thinks this is some kind of turning point. I\u2019m not sure for whom and for what.", "JW: Right. I\u2019ve definitely seen online people talk about this being the marker of some sort of larger social revolution, but it\u2019s not clear which way we\u2019re turning and whether things are turning for the better or for the worse.", "WM: Well, first of all, you lived in Charlottesville for more than a minute.", "JW: Ugh, I did. Well, I was an undergraduate at UVA until 2004.", "WM: So what happened over the weekend isn\u2019t necessarily new to you?", "JW: No. I think what\u2019s been really interesting \u2014 I found out about what was happening in Charlottesville via a series of texts. My mom happens to live right outside of Charlottesville and her partner needs medical treatment in Charlottesville, so they go there quite regularly. And this outburst was precipitated by a couple of other events that happened in Charlottesville. There was a KKK rally. There\u2019s been heightened racial tensions in that town in May and July. For those of us who live in Charlottesville, none of this really feels that surprising. When I was there as an undergraduate, there were multiple blackface events. There were racial attacks. One of the first black student body presidents \u2014 or a black student to run for student body president, I guess \u2014 was attacked and told there will never be an n word for president. I looked at her Facebook yesterday and she was just like, of course this is Charlottesville. This is UVA. This is America. Which has been this common refrain to come out of this, right? People keep saying, well, this isn\u2019t our country. It\u2019s actually the most American thing about America, this kind of racialized violence.", "WM: It is America. America was founded on this very thing.", "JW: Right. If you were a student of color at UVA \u2014 and I would say, during my time, but any time because subsequent graduates have reported the same thing, you know \u2014 it was not uncommon if you were a black male to be racially profiled on campus. A good friend of mine was walking home one night from studying at the library and was stopped by the police and they took a DNA sample from him to put it on file, which is a violation of so many rights. And he was a student, and they didn\u2019t believe him. But you comply, right, because what else are you taught to do? You\u2019re a student. You don\u2019t know any better. It was a very oppressive feeling place, and it was the kind of place too that really prided itself on a certain kind of southern gentility, which is really important in the context of why Charlottesville matters and also why Robert E. Lee matters. And if you were a student there, it was very common \u2014 people dressed up for football games, boys wore suits, the girls wore pearls. Charlottesville and UVA, of course, is the home and university built by Thomas Jefferson who is seen as this great founder of American modern democracy. When you\u2019re a student there, you get to take a tour of the Jefferson plantation, and they definitely, there\u2019s like a little wink, wink, nod about his relationship to Sally Hemmings. On Valentine\u2019s Day, there are all these signs that go up that say, like T.J. loves Sally. I mean, there\u2019s a way in which that town \u2014", "WM: Shut up.", "JW: Mm hmm. There\u2019s a way in which that town \u2014", "WM: Sally Hemmings, for anybody who doesn\u2019t know, was one of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s many slaves and his most prized. He had a relationship with her for many years.", "JW: And it\u2019s part of this larger rewriting of a historical narrative and a historical record, right, that slaves had it good, and that slavery was actually kind of benevolent. And it wasn\u2019t that bad. How bad could it have been? And that town really exists as a weird fantasy of what it was like to be part of the Confederacy. The campus is absolutely beautiful. It does have this slow, syrupy feeling of what it meant when America was great again, before, you know? And it does feed into this idea that if you come there and you fit in and you do the things that make you part of the culture, which is there\u2019s a very much a code of conduct, there\u2019s very much a code of dress, then somehow that makes you more American. But it\u2019s really subversive, and it\u2019s really disastrous. It\u2019s why I didn\u2019t really last there for more than a semester or two before I had to go abroad, and then I immediately moved downtown \u2014 and it\u2019s just confusing, too, because you\u2019re just like, this is colloquial college experience. This is what we\u2019re supposed to be doing. And you don\u2019t realize how you get coopted into this way of thinking, and...kind of like...you just get really pushed into believing the myth of the south, right. But when you look closer, there\u2019s a history of erasure and disappearance of blackness in all of Charlottesville, and especially in downtown Charlottesville where this park is. The Robert E. Lee park, which has since been renamed Emancipation park. And by the way \u2014 the groups just wanted to move the statues. They weren\u2019t saying melt them down and turn them into, I don\u2019t know, cool footwear.", "WM: The city council agreed to just move the statues somewhere else and change the name of the part.", "JW: Which is what incited all this stuff. But I guess the point I wanted to make is, the people who believe that this heritage, this southern way of life \u2014 which, by the way, includes the minimization and marginalization of people of color, black people and anyone else that\u2019s not white \u2014 are part of this larger group that really believes in this lost cause, the Confederacy. That there was this sort of, you know, if you google lost cause, it comes up that the war that was lost was like a noble one, a heroic one, and a lot of that in part of inspired by the conciliatory speech that Robert E. Lee made when he was announcing defeat. So, it\u2019s all weirdly very connected and Robert E. Lee has become, I think in a lot of ways, very emblematic to this struggle for what was once good. And I\u2019m using air quotes. It was not good for us. It was not good. But I think that\u2019s important to remember. That these groups have effectively rewritten the past, and they\u2019re fighting to preserve what they believe was the past for the present and for the future. And on the other side of it, you have people that are saying, oh, no, no, no, we have to aggressively rethink the past now, otherwise we\u2019re going to be screwed in the future. And that\u2019s actually really what the fight is coming down to: the way we want to think about what happened in the past.", "WM: I think that thinking about the future and the past in the context of the present is really useful. I think that one thing about being a black American is that you carry that around with you all the time. I think you are always aware of your physical place in any space. I\u2019m always aware of my blackness, whether I\u2019m among other black people and I can feel how special in some ways that is, or if I\u2019m in predominantly white environments as I frequently am and you are very quietly bracing yourself for something that probably won\u2019t even happen, but could.", "JW: And that\u2019s actually the point of those statues, and the Confederate memorials that are both very visible and not. There was a huge boom after the civil rights movement to build these memorials because this was the point. Just this subtle reminder of the racial terrorism that had happened in the past and that it could happen again at any moment. Gone but not forgotten.", "WM: Right. So, I think that there are really two important events that kicked off this current situation that we\u2019re in. Well, I mean, there are three, the first of which is the election of Barack Obama in 2008. But I also think that within that context, I think Dylann Roof\u2019s murder of nine people at the Emanuel AME church in June of 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 that same month, Donald Trump announces his presidential campaign. And he doesn\u2019t just announce his presidential campaign. He basically kicks it off with this announcement that Mexicans are \u2014 you know, the famous, now infamous Mexicans are rapists and murderers speech, or observation, or lie. It sets a climate that never goes away, but the storm clouds keep gathering. They\u2019ve been gathering for two years. And frankly, they\u2019ve been gathering since \u2014 well, I mean, in the Donald Trump context, because really, Donald Trump\u2019s relationship to all of this, in my mind, he and Barack Obama are nationally, psychically conjoined. Obama becomes elected, Trump starts his birther campaign. The constant nagging question that he creates in people\u2019s minds about Barack Obama\u2019s \u2014", "JW: Legitimacy.", "WM: Legitimacy as an American citizen. Constantly otherizing him. It really satisfied a lot of white people. That seed of doubt has flowered, I think, into this awful organism that showed up in Charlottesville over the weekend.", "JW: Right.", "WM: It\u2019s not that it\u2019s new. But it is the first active, violent manifestation of what Donald Trump is about, like the vessel that he is. And that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really upsetting. It\u2019s not so much that what happened is necessarily new. It\u2019s now, you are seeing these physical manifestations in the real world of what was going on at his rallies as egged on by him. In February, in suburban Kansas City, a white man shot an Indian man under the assumption that he was a Muslim from the Middle East. A few months later, there was a stabbing on a train in Portland. A man stabbed two men who were trying to protect a couple Muslim women.", "JW: Muslim American women.", "WM: Muslim American women, sorry, from him, who was just defiant in the courtroom about what he did. I hope they all die, he said. I\u2019m going to say that on the stand. I\u2019m a patriot, and I hope everyone I stabbed died.", "JW: I think it\u2019s easy for people to view that man and his views as an anomaly, as an abnormality. But he\u2019s not. It\u2019s becoming the new norm. Southern Poverty Law Center reported recently that the number of hate groups in the U.S. rose for the second year in a row. The most dramatic growth was the near tripling of anti Muslim hate groups, which went from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year. The FBI also said that hate crimes against Muslims grew by 67 percent in 2015, the year in which Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign. So, it\u2019s a clear correlation between the two things, and it feels really terrifying to have a president who won\u2019t come out and say, these are deplorable acts. And so, it now perpetuates this feeling of very state sponsored and government sponsored violence of racial terror. That if you are a person of color walking around these United States, at any moment, you could be a target of racial violence or racial terrorism that is essentially state and government sponsored. Very few of the people who have perpetuated crimes against black people, whether they be police officers or anybody else, have been prosecuted for it.", "WM: Right. That\u2019s a fact. Okay, we\u2019re going to take a break here, and we\u2019ll be right back. I think that one of the striking things about what happened on Saturday was that a lot of the clashing was being done between white people.", "JW: Right.", "WM: I was talking to a number of people who found those images confusing because they couldn\u2019t tell who was which, and that was really fascinating to me, because in the history of battles against white supremacy in this country, it\u2019s been black people confronting white people or white state controlled or government controlled apparatus turned against black people. And so, in a sense, there is something new about a race melee featuring more white people fighting each other than black people and white people.", "JW: I found it comforting.", "WM: It was perversely comforting.", "JW: It was perversely comforting to see how many white people showed up.", "WM: Because \u2014 and this gets to this idea that people don\u2019t want to hear about white supremacy, because they aren\u2019t white supremacists \u2014 but you are white. And I think part of the problem with the conversation around white supremacy is that white people might not feel like they\u2019re white supremacists at all. In fact, most aren\u2019t. But there\u2019s a system by which white supremacy operates, and it is set up to benefit white people. Now, you don\u2019t have to be a practicing racist to benefit from racism.", "JW: It\u2019s basically just interest on whiteness, you just collect the checks.", "WM: You have, as a beneficiary, as a permanent beneficiary of that system, a duty to challenge it when it loses its mind and actively begins to start doing things like taking away people\u2019s rights and actively harming people, which is what this administration seems intent on doing from policy proposal to policy proposal to policy proposal.", "JW: Mm hmm. And there are a lot more anti fascists in this country, too, than I think we realize, and I think that\u2019s why a lot of the signs that were making the rounds on social media \u2014 there was that older woman holding a sign that was like, I escaped the Nazis once, I\u2019m not going to do it again. You know, and I think that\u2019s also closely aligned with other Americans in this country who are just like, I am not for this racism either. I think those two groups are coming together in a really significant way, which is encouraging to me.", "WM: Yes. I\u2019m a little bit of a wimp when it comes to this, like the violence. I don\u2019t want to see anybody hurt, killed, whatever. I understand that for some people, it took the death of Heather Heyer who was killed by the crazy person who \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t even give him the benefit of being crazy \u2014 the racist who drove a car into the crowd on Saturday afternoon. It\u2019s going to take something like her death to galvanize people to understand that \u2014", "JW: That next time it could be them.", "WM: It could be you. I also find it \u2014 and this is the point at which I think it\u2019s really important to talk about Donald Trump in like a real way, because his refusal to say anything on Saturday was unsurprising to me. But his failure to acknowledge the deaths of three people involved in this, and the many injured people...the very least a president can do is condemn racism, racists, and white supremacists. The second easiest thing to do as president, and crucial, I would say, is to acknowledge the pain and suffering of people who didn\u2019t have to die \u2014 over the weekend, for instance \u2014 but did.", "JW: Instead, we got a tweet from Ivanka Trump, which made her the highest ranking official in the White House to acknowledge.", "WM: The failure of this man to lead in any direction is...it\u2019s a travesty of American democracy in the most perverse sense. I would have more respect for him if he went up there and said, you know what, guys? Thanks for doing my bidding out there. I\u2019m so glad to see you guys come out.", "JW: Jesus. I understand but \u2014", "WM: But wouldn\u2019t that be something? Rather than like, this non answer. And then, so like two days later, we this B.S. thing where he condemns all racism as evil? Donald Trump, you don\u2019t fool me for one second. First of all, I mean, the idea that we can\u2019t talk about Donald Trump being a racist and all the racist energy is being directed at Stephen Bannon, who is one of his advisors? And Stephen Miller, who also is advising Donald Trump? Uh uh. That\u2019s lunacy to me. He\u2019s as racist as anybody.", "JW: But it feels like the beginning of a tide, though.", "WM: Oh? What kind of tide?", "JW: I don\u2019t know. Like purging, like the purge.", "WM: You know what? Purge Donald Trump. Because getting rid of Steve Bannon does nothing for me. It\u2019s not like \u2014 I mean, Steve Bannon didn\u2019t deny anybody the right to live in a Trump building in 1970 something. Stephen Bannon didn\u2019t take out an ad in 1989 to condemn the Central Park Five, who were accused of raping a woman they didn\u2019t actually rape, were exonerated like 25 years later, and Donald Trump then takes out an editorial in the same newspaper saying that the settlement and the exoneration were stupid and bogus.", "JW: Look, I know the rod goes all the way up to the top. I know. I know. I know. However, the purge has to start somewhere, and at least it feels there are now starting to be some checks and balances, whereas before there were none. And if it takes Google and AirBnB and tech companies who have pushed back and said, you know, we\u2019re not going to host the websites of these companies, we\u2019re not going to host neo-Nazis...when the president won\u2019t say it, if the people around him are saying it, even if it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m the most cynical person about when tech companies and CEOs and various people do things in their own interest, because it\u2019s always in their own business interest, but when they make these stands, they\u2019re highly public, they\u2019re highly visible. They\u2019re the most visible signs we can get, since the president won\u2019t say this is deplorable and I condemn this behavior. When we have CEOs who are \u2014 frankly, the CEO of Google is as powerful as the president in a lot of ways \u2014 saying I don\u2019t condone this behavior, I\u2019ll take it, because we\u2019re not getting much else right now. We\u2019re not getting anything else right now.", "WM: Well, you know what we got on Saturday at about like 8 PM?", "JW: What?", "WM: Speaking of presidential. Barack Obama went on Twitter.", "JW: What\u2019d he say?", "WM: He just basically quoted Nelson Mandela, and he had this quote about \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ll read the whole thing. \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate. And if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\u201d Ah...I just can\u2019t believe that nobody in that administration could find it in their hearts to like...", "JW: Yeah.", "WM: It\u2019s so crazy to me. This is like insane.", "JW: But look, they will be \u2014 I honestly am starting to believe, though \u2014 there will be more Bree Newsome, who is the woman who shimmed up the pole to take down the Confederate flag. There will be more Mitchell Andrews, who was the mayor of New Orleans who facilitated the taking down of Confederate statues. And when we were in New Orleans, people were saying to me, well, we need more Mitches. Because we\u2019re going forward. We\u2019re not going back. Change is violent. The transition from the last century was violent, too. This one\u2019s also going to be violent. We\u2019re moving forward.", "WM: Well, we\u2019re moving forward, but he still can\u2019t fix the water pumps to keep the flooding out of New Orleans. So...I know, I don\u2019t expect anything from this administration, and it doesn\u2019t really matter what they say, as long as they\u2019re trying to repeal affirmative action policy. As long as they\u2019re trying to stop people from entering this country lawfully or to escape persecution in other places. As long as they are trying to do any of the other number of things \u2014 like take back voting rights from people? Like all the stuff that our ancestors marched and died for. To repeal those things like it\u2019s nothing. I don\u2019t care what they say. They can say whatever they want. They can get rid of whoever they want, as long as there are people in place to keep those policies from being enacted or to repeal them or to water them down. Donald Trump can condemn racism every day for the rest of his administration as long. As long as he\u2019s trying to get this other stuff done, that contradicts \u2014 any statement against white supremacy he can, he is still practicing white supremacy in his presidency.", "JW: These are dark times. I\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat it. There are dark times. The outcome can\u2019t be, this is only bad when it gets bloody. Because the blood is invisible but it\u2019s everywhere all the time. And that\u2019s what I was trying to say earlier in a very muddled way about people who are posting on social media. Like, white silence is violence. I\u2019m like, my dude. Your Facebook post is white silence. Organize a dinner. Raise money. Do something. Support an organization. If you\u2019re a journalist, write a story. Don\u2019t...like, I had to go to yoga yesterday and really work out some emotions, because the number of people posting on Facebook ... I also saw, I will say, an equal number of people actively protesting at Trump power \u2014 oh my God! I saw, I saw as many if not equal or more posts from white friends in my feeds who were protesting at Trump Tower, which makes me feel good because I\u2019m like, that is an active action, not a passive one to me, but I\u2019m, I need people to take action. Because the administration is not going to do it. A Facebook post is not going to do it. All the attention that was focused on Charlottesville has energized white supremacists, has energized right wing supremacists, many of whom are organizing various satellite versions of exactly what went down. They\u2019re going to San Francisco to protest Google. They\u2019re going to Berkeley. The flames are being fanned.", "WM: Mm hmm. Yeah. The rallies are coming to your town, so fasten your seatbelts.", "JW: There\u2019s a quote from a guy in the article the Times ran today that said, every city needs to watch out. We are everywhere.", "WM: I think Make America Great Again is ... you know, one of the most savagely brilliant marketing campaigns ever. I mean, it\u2019s the sieg heil of the 21st century.", "JW: Absolutely.", "WM: Well, one of the crazy things I\u2019ve been thinking was \u2014 I mean, this is kind of grim, but I think about it all the time when you see these white nationalists co-opt the language of oppressed people. The optics of what happened on Friday with that march with the tiki lamps to me looked like a Take Back the Night rally on a college campus. And...I think a lot about like, what do these people, what do they want? And it\u2019s kind of a miracle that you and I are even sitting here, given all the other people who have died over the course of the last 200 years. Well, beyond 200 years. It\u2019s amazing like they didn\u2019t just kill us all and just make us all go away. I mean, it\u2019s not so much that I want to die or like, I just think it\u2019s a miracle that they didn\u2019t just round us up in 1865 when there was just, there was no more...there was no more slavery, basically, and just kill us all because otherwise, to incorporate us into society would just be impossible. And as it turns out, it\u2019s still kind of impossible to get total peace. And, of course, they couldn\u2019t do that because slavery was part of a capitalist system and they still needed the work. They needed labor. But I think about the American Indians all the time, and how \u2014 I mean, you and I have like cried about this on the show before...", "JW: I know. Which has also gotten rewritten in this whole thing, where there was a Times story taking first person accounts from the various events on Friday and Saturday in Charlottesville, and someone who came out to support the white nationalist party said, well, America is for white people. Africa is for black people. Forgetting that before that, America was for brown people! It\u2019s like, so your memory only goes back a century or two? Like, what the hell?", "WM: You know, I just \u2014 and I also don\u2019t mean to make it seem like freed slaves would have allowed themselves to be killed, like willy nilly, but I think that, as campaigns go, I object to calling these guys Nazis, because...", "JW: It affords a kind of distancing.", "WM: It creates a very safe distance from actual white nationalist, KKK racists. There are a lot of young people \u2014 I mean, many people have noted the number of young people who have been out there on Friday and Saturday \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what you do about that. That\u2019s the part of me that feels a little bit hopeless. Like...lost cause, lost cause in one direction, lost cause in another direction.", "JW: Yeah.", "WM: I don\u2019t know what we do.

On Aug. 7, _________ fired a software engineer who wrote an internal memo that questioned the company\u2019s diversity efforts and argued that the low number of women in technical positions was a result of biological differences instead of discrimination. The memo struck a nerve and was harshly criticized inside a company and an entire industry struggling to explain why women are underrepresented in key engineering ranks and are often underpaid when compared with their male peers.", "42. In North Korea, Kim Jong-un called the intercontinental ballistic missile his country launched on July 4 a \u201cgift package\u201d to the United States. The missile seemed capable of hitting Alaska and Hawaii. The crisis escalated when President Trump\u2019s threat on Aug. 8 to unleash _________ against North Korea sent a shudder through Asia, raising alarm among allies and adversaries and, to some observers, making the possibility of military conflict over the North\u2019s nuclear program seem more real.", "43.

And it got there faster than any music video in history. Just over two weeks ago Universal Music announced it was also the most streamed song in history, if you combine the number of times people played the original song or video with a remixed version featuring vocals from the Canadian singer Justin Bieber.", "The ascendance of \u201cDespacito\u201d is remarkable for a number reasons: Except for Mr. Bieber\u2019s intro, the song is almost entirely in Spanish. (Despacito means \u201cslowly,\u201d and depending on how you interpret the lyrics, the song is about what you\u2019d do slowly to someone you really like.) The rhythmic backbone of the song is reggaeton, a style with roots in Jamaica that developed in Puerto Rico and has long been popular in Latin America but has only occasionally broken through to the English-speaking world. The video is set in a storied Puerto Rican slum called La Perla and features a joyously multiracial cast.", "And maybe most notably, the song has achieved worldwide fame at a time when nativism is surging, anxiety over borders and immigration is rising, and the executive branch of this country seems determined to make it whiter.", "The song\u2019s success highlights the truism that the soul that moves so many of us, that we groove to, that animates our lives, that in some ways binds us as a global community \u2014 pop music \u2014 is the opposite of nativist. It\u2019s promiscuous. It doesn\u2019t respect borders or stick to racial categories. It borrows willy-nilly, encouraging cross-fertilization of cultures and styles. It courses with energy from the African diaspora. And those billions of views say that people, lots of them American, can\u2019t get enough of it.", "Of course, the song\u2019s success doesn\u2019t mean that President Trump\u2019s project will fail, or that cranky nativism will give way to happy multiculturalism. Plenty of people might be willing to watch a video by Puerto Rican artists and still not want a Spanish-speaking neighbor next door. (Although Puerto Rico is a United States territory, so if you\u2019re American, get over it.)", "But the song\u2019s success does highlight a side of humanity that, these days, often seems overshadowed by uglier tendencies. We know that humans can be tribal, that we quickly organize ourselves into in-groups and out-groups, that we can treat those out-groups cruelly and even savagely. These tendencies probably predate our being human. Even groups of chimpanzees wage war against one another.", "But we have this other side that\u2019s curious, that doesn\u2019t cringe from difference so much as find inspiration in it. A transcendent side that takes joy in bringing together disparate parts, in creation, in play.", "Take \u201cDespacito\u201d itself. It begins with a steel-stringed Puerto Rican guitar called the cuatro, which most likely descended from an instrument brought to Spain from North Africa by Moors. The rolling reggaeton beat came out of Jamaica and, long before that, probably originated in West Africa. In rapping, Daddy Yankee employs an art form developed by urban African-Americans, infusing it with the unique feel of Puerto Rican Spanish and slang. Mr. Fonsi\u2019s deliciously suggestive lyrics arguably belong to a tradition that stretches back to the lovelorn troubadours of medieval Spain, and beyond.", "The song is a fusion, an amalgam. As such, it doesn\u2019t just illustrate the genius of pop music but also serves as a model of how creativity works generally. Innovation often involves organizing old pieces into new configurations. Tech companies, like Apple and Google, know this. Hence their emphasis on cross-pollination \u2014 their open work spaces and public areas designed to encourage intermingling.", "And this was also, until recently, how I\u2019d conceived of the American project. Then came President Trump and the news that some still viewed the United States as a fundamentally white, Christian nation with European roots. Which means what, exactly? Modern genetics tells us that Europeans are themselves a mixture of different peoples, a hunter-gatherer population mixed with farmers who, thousands of years ago, immigrated from what\u2019s now Turkey (near Syria), topped off by herders from what\u2019s now the Russian steppe. Christianity, the supposed glue of Europe, was imported from the Levant. And I\u2019m writing this in a language \u2014 English \u2014 that consists of French and Latin grafted onto an Anglo-Saxon base, sprinkled with Old Norse and grains of Celtic.", "Yes, nations exist. Yes, they have borders. Yes, distinct cultures and languages arise. There are bedrock ideas that we can perhaps call Western. But when you look closely at the boundaries demarcating these supposedly discrete entities, you find them to be remarkably porous.", "In the battle for hearts and minds represented by pop music, of course, all this goes without saying. \u201cDespacito\u201d has won the day."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/technology/facebook-china-moments-colorful-balloons.html": ["SHANGHAI \u2014 Facebook and many of its apps have been blocked in China for years.

The app, which has not previously been reported, shares the look, function and feel of Facebook\u2019s Moments app. It was released through a separate local company and without any hint that the social network is affiliated with it.", "The stealthy and anonymous release of an app by a major foreign technology company in China is unprecedented. It shows the desperation \u2014 and frustration \u2014 of global tech companies as they try to break into the world\u2019s largest online market. It also underscores the lengths they are willing to go, and their increasing acceptance of the idea that standards for operating in China are different from elsewhere.", "China\u2019s internet censorship \u2014 which includes making some news websites inaccessible and passing rules that result in app removals \u2014 has left big players like Facebook and Google on the sidelines of a major boom there. The country boasts an audience of more than 700 million internet users who buy $750 billion of stuff online a year, but they are served by local tech companies that have developed their own way of doing business that can seem exotic to Silicon Valley.", "Facebook hopes it can learn and potentially assimilate those ways. Yet the social network was banned in China in 2009, followed by its photo-sharing app Instagram in 2014, and its messaging app WhatsApp was partially blocked last month. While the company has more than two billion users around the world, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, has often asked where its next billion users will come from.", "Now Colorful Balloons gives the Silicon Valley company a way to see how Chinese users digitally share information with their friends or interact with their favorite social media platforms.", "\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.", "It is unclear whether China\u2019s various internet regulators were aware of the app\u2019s existence. The under-the-table approach could cause Facebook new difficulties with a Chinese government that has maintained strict oversight and control over foreign tech companies.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not a mere business thing,\u201d said Teng Bingsheng, a professor of strategic management at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s politics.\u201d", "The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment.", "Before the release of Colorful Balloons, Facebook had taken an unusually high-profile approach to courting China.", "Mr. Zuckerberg had paid a series of visits to the country in recent years and become something of a celebrity there. Videos of him speaking Mandarin have gone viral, as did a photo of him jogging on a dangerously smoggy day through Tiananmen Square in Beijing.", "Colorful Balloons represents the opposite approach \u2014 one that is low profile.", "The app was released in China by a company called Youge Internet Technology, according to a post in Apple\u2019s app store. It is registered to an address in eastern Beijing, yet the room number listed in company registration documents could not be found amid a series of shabby, small offices on the building\u2019s fourth floor.", "According to the documents, Youge\u2019s executive director is a woman named Zhang Jingmei. She appeared in a photo of a recent meeting between Facebook and the Shanghai government, sitting next to Wang-Li Moser, a Facebook executive whose responsibilities include building up the company\u2019s relationship with the Chinese government. Ms. Zhang\u2019s presence at such a high-level meeting indicated she is likely a Facebook adviser or employee.", "Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Zhang\u2019s relationship to the company, and Ms. Zhang did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.", "If Facebook did little to promote Colorful Balloons in China, it did work to tailor the app to a local audience. In the rest of the world, the company\u2019s Moments app connects users through Facebook. Colorful Balloons instead links users through China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat.", "The app, which is designed to collate photos from a smartphone\u2019s photo albums and then share them, does so in China with the use of a QR code, a sort of bar code that is widely used by WeChat and other apps in the country.", "While photos can be shared, Facebook appears to have taken steps to ensure the app could not spread widely. For example, people who post photos from Colorful Balloons on WeChat will see a link that lets other users download Facebook\u2019s Chinese app. But the link does not work, meaning people have to seek out Colorful Balloons in an app store instead of grabbing it from their friends, which may limit its distribution.", "The risk Facebook is taking with the new app is high. The company appears to have handed over a fully functioning product to Youge for release, and has done so without indicating in any public way that it is connected to Facebook. Coming just ahead of a key meeting of the Chinese Communist Party this autumn, the secretive release of Colorful Balloons could also undermine trust between the company and the Chinese government.", "Such tactics underline the degree to which Facebook is willing to experiment and break precedent to get into China. Last year, The New York Times reported Facebook had also quietly been at work on a censorship tool that could be used on a version of the social network in a place like China, where the government demands control over what is shared. The tool could suppress posts from appearing in people\u2019s news feeds in specific geographic areas.", "Yet even if Facebook is able to use Colorful Balloons to keep up with the Chinese market, a recent intense internet crackdown in China suggests the political winds may not soon blow in favor of the company further entering the country.", "Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s attention to China also appears to have waned. And China\u2019s former internet czar, Lu Wei, who had visited Facebook\u2019s offices in 2014, has been removed from his position, making things harder for the company.", "\u201cThe government\u2019s control and surveillance of media is strict, and it is almost impossible for them to open that door,\u201d said Mr. Teng, the Cheung Kong professor. \u201cAlthough Mark Zuckerberg has visited China many times and practiced his Chinese very hard, I don\u2019t foresee any major breakthroughs for Facebook.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/dining/restaurant-software-analytics-data-mining.html": ["The early diners are dawdling, so your 7:30 p.m. reservation looks more like 8.

In it, he was trying to explain why 80 percent of Google\u2019s tech employees are male. He agreed that there are large cultural biases but also pointed to a genetic component. Then he described some of the ways the distribution of qualities differs across male and female populations.", "Damore was tapping into the long and contentious debate about genes and behavior. On one side are those who believe that humans come out as blank slates and are formed by social structures. On the other are the evolutionary psychologists who argue that genes interact with environment and play a large role in shaping who we are. In general the evolutionary psychologists have been winning this debate.", "When it comes to the genetic differences between male and female brains, I\u2019d say the mainstream view is that male and female abilities are the same across the vast majority of domains \u2014 I.Q., the ability to do math, etc. But there are some ways that male and female brains are, on average, different. There seems to be more connectivity between the hemispheres, on average, in female brains. Prenatal exposure to different levels of androgen does seem to produce different effects throughout the life span.", "In his memo, Damore cites a series of studies, making the case, for example, that men tend to be more interested in things and women more interested in people. (Interest is not the same as ability.) Several scientists in the field have backed up his summary of the data. \u201cDespite how it\u2019s been portrayed, the memo was fair and factually accurate,\u201d Debra Soh wrote in The Globe and Mail in Toronto.", "Geoffrey Miller, a prominent evolutionary psychologist, wrote in Quillette, \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I think that almost all of the Google memo\u2019s empirical claims are scientifically accurate.\u201d", "Damore was especially careful to say this research applies only to populations, not individuals: \u201cMany of these differences are small and there\u2019s significant overlap between men and women, so you can\u2019t say anything about an individual given these population-level distributions.\u201d", "That\u2019s the crucial point. But of course we don\u2019t live as populations; we live our individual lives.", "We should all have a lot of sympathy for the second group of actors in this drama, the women in tech who felt the memo made their lives harder. Picture yourself in a hostile male-dominated environment, getting interrupted at meetings, being ignored, having your abilities doubted, and along comes some guy arguing that women are on average less status hungry and more vulnerable to stress. Of course you\u2019d object.", "What we have is a legitimate tension. Damore is describing a truth on one level; his sensible critics are describing a different truth, one that exists on another level. He is championing scientific research; they are championing gender equality. It takes a little subtlety to harmonize these strands, but it\u2019s doable.", "Of course subtlety is in hibernation in modern America. The third player in the drama is Google\u2019s diversity officer, Danielle Brown. She didn\u2019t wrestle with any of the evidence behind Damore\u2019s memo.

The coverage of the memo has been atrocious.", "As Conor Friedersdorf wrote in The Atlantic, \u201cI cannot remember the last time so many outlets and observers mischaracterized so many aspects of a text everyone possessed.\u201d Various reporters and critics apparently decided that Damore opposes all things Enlightened People believe and therefore they don\u2019t have to afford him the basic standards of intellectual fairness.", "The mob that hounded Damore was like the mobs we\u2019ve seen on a lot of college campuses. We all have our theories about why these moral crazes are suddenly so common. I\u2019d say that radical uncertainty about morality, meaning and life in general is producing intense anxiety. Some people embrace moral absolutism in a desperate effort to find solid ground. They feel a rare and comforting sense of moral certainty when they are purging an evil person who has violated one of their sacred taboos.", "Which brings us to Pichai, the supposed grown-up in the room. He could have wrestled with the tension between population-level research and individual experience. He could have stood up for the free flow of information. Instead he joined the mob. He fired Damore and wrote, \u201cTo suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not O.K.\u201d", "That is a blatantly dishonest characterization of the memo. Damore wrote nothing like that about his Google colleagues. Either Pichai is unprepared to understand the research (unlikely), is not capable of handling complex data flows (a bad trait in a C.E.O.) or was simply too afraid to stand up to a mob.", "Regardless which weakness applies, this episode suggests he should seek a nonleadership position.

Discord allows users to form private, invitation-only chat groups invisible to those outside the app, and it allows a high degree of anonymity, making it an ideal choice for people looking to avoid detection or surveillance. Perhaps most importantly, it is largely self-policed \u2014 administrators of servers, as Discord\u2019s group chat rooms are known, set their own rules and are responsible for keeping their members in line.", "Leaders like Richard Spencer, who is credited with coining the term \u201calt-right,\u201d and Andrew Anglin, the editor of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, used Discord to discuss current events and debate movement strategy.

In the back, the other two followed the flight on their laptops, eyeballing data sent from the glider\u2019s tiny onboard computer and barking the figures into a walkie-talkie. In a Jeep up ahead, Ashish Kapoor listened as he, too, sped down the gravel road, eyes fixed on the white Styrofoam glider.", "Soon, the glider took another turn. It gently circled an invisible column of rising hot air while climbing slowly skyward. \u201cIt\u2019s soaring,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said, pointing at the glider as it spiraled higher and higher on a stream of warm air. \u201cIt found a thermal.\u201d", "Last week, in the desert valley surrounding Hawthorne, Nev., 130 miles south of Reno, Mr. Kapoor and his fellow Microsoft researchers tested two gliders designed to navigate the skies on their own. Guided by computer algorithms that learned from onboard sensors, predicted air patterns and planned a route forward, these gliders could seek out thermals \u2014 columns of rising hot air \u2014 and use them to stay aloft.", "The hope is that the autonomous aircraft can eventually ride the air for hours or even days at a time while consuming very little power, helping to, say, track weather patterns, monitor farm crops or even deliver the internet to places where it\u2019s otherwise unavailable.", "Led by Mr. Kapoor, who is an artificial intelligence researcher and a licensed pilot, the project was part of a growing effort to build aircraft, automobiles and other machines that can make decisions on their own when faced with uncertainty \u2014 an essential skill for any machine trying to navigate the world on its own.", "Using similar methods, Google has built high-altitude internet balloons that can stay aloft for months on end. Countless companies are designing cars that can drive on their own. And academics at schools like the University of California, Berkeley are developing everything from household robots that can perform seemingly simple but surprisingly complex tasks like making a bed to surgical robots that can handle some procedures on their own.", "Cars, planes and other robots can now recognize the objects around them with an accuracy that rivals human sight thanks to the recent rise of neural networks, a term for mathematical systems that can learn certain tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data.", "But that only gets them so far. To navigate the world on their own, they must also mimic the way humans intuitively predict what will happen next and adjust their behavior accordingly. Projects like those at Microsoft, Google and Berkeley are reaching in that direction.", "This kind of research has become increasingly important as Google and many companies try to build driverless cars. Mykel Kochenderfer, a Stanford University professor of aeronautics and astronautics, said Microsoft\u2019s project was a step toward self-driving vehicles that are nimble enough to handle all the unexpected behavior that human drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians bring to public roads.", "It was also a way of pushing the boundaries of the mathematical techniques that control a machine in a relatively safe but still very real environment. \u201cWith a glider, you can test these algorithms with minimal risk to people and property,\u201d Mr. Kochenderfer said.", "In building their algorithms, Mr. Kapoor and his team relied on techniques that date back decades \u2014 something called Markov decision processes. Essentially, this is a way of identifying and responding to uncertainty.", "The approach is like the one you take when looking for change in a backpack crammed with random stuff. If you just stick your hand in the bag and start rummaging around, you face enormous uncertainty. You don\u2019t know where to grab. But if, first, you remove the larger items like books and pencils that you know aren\u2019t coins, the change falls to the bottom and the task gets easier. That is what Microsoft\u2019s algorithms do \u2014 in a mathematical sense. They work to limit uncertainty, to reduce the scope of the problem.", "Mr. Kapoor\u2019s team included Andrey Kolobov, a researcher who specializes in these methods.", "When he joined Microsoft\u2019s research group four years ago, Mr. Kolobov fed these ideas into the company\u2019s Windows operating system and its Bing search engine. Back then, he was dealing with uncertainty in the digital world. Now, he\u2019s applying them in the physical world. \u201cThe number of applications where these methods are used is growing,\u201d Mr. Kolobov said.", "In the Nevada desert, the team launched its two gliders with help from a hand-held remote control. Once airborne, the gliders \u2014 or sailplanes \u2014 were left to their own devices. They were forced to fly with help from the wind and other air patterns.", "Through those onboard algorithms, the gliders could analyze what was happening around them and then change directions as need be. They could learn from their environment, and although they could never be completely sure what would happen next, they could at least make educated guesses. Because it is dependent on phenomenon it has no control over, the glider must reason and plan in advance, Mr. Kolobov said.", "The gliders planned their own paths to locations that could provide lift, and then they worked to exploit this lift, to ride those columns of rising air. When Mr. Kapoor pointed skyward from his Jeep, this is what happened. The math worked.", "Still, these aircraft were far from perfect. Using a fiberglass glider with a 16-foot wingspan, the team hoped to set a record for autonomous flight time by a sailplane \u2014 more than five hours aloft. But after two days of trial and error, thanks to problems with radios and other equipment, that didn\u2019t happen.", "That researchers can improve on these sorts of learning algorithms has become an imperative to improving autonomous vehicles. To navigate the real world on their own, machines must mimic the way humans intuitively plan for their next action and deal with events they\u2019ve never before experienced.", "\u201cThe core problem for robotics is uncertainty,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a professor at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThis is what differentiates robotics from a game like Go or chess.\u201d", "Over the last two years, researchers at DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence lab owned by Google, used neural networks and other techniques to build a system that could beat the world\u2019s best players at Go, a game that is exponentially more difficult than chess. It was a milestone in the development of artificial intelligence. Now, researchers hope to reach bigger milestones here in the real world.", "That\u2019s the big reason Microsoft is building autonomous gliders.

Daisuke reported that Apple will first test its tech on its own employees: It\u2019s building a self-driving shuttle to ferry employees between its buildings.", "Mike: So Apple is building its own version of Disney World\u2019s monorail, I guess? How retro.", "Building a car is hard. Building a self-driving car is even harder. And building a self-driving car from scratch, in house, when you\u2019re a tech company that has only ever built phones and computers, seems near impossible. But perhaps I\u2019m being too pessimistic.", "Farhad: Finally, there was yet more Uber news. Recode reported that the company had moved closer to settling on a new C.E.O., with Jeff Immelt, the former chief of G.E., now getting support from the majority of the Uber board. What do you think \u2014 is Immelt going to be the guy? And if not him, who else?", "Mike: I don\u2019t want to go into it too much, so as not to tip my hand. But it says something to me that only Immelt\u2019s name is being leaked. We\u2019ll see what happens.", "Farhad: And then there are Uber\u2019s numbers. It\u2019s been operating without a chief and lots of other top executives for months, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting its business.", "The company is private, but it regularly releases a summary of its financial data to investors. Its latest report shows that Uber\u2019s quarterly revenue after paying out drivers rose to $1.75 billion from $1.5 billion last year, and requests for rides have increased 150 percent since last year. This is despite my column telling people not to ride Uber until it gets its house in order.", "Honestly, Mike, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m yelling into a void. But really, why is Uber doing so well despite acting so badly? Do customers really just not care? Is there some danger in the numbers we aren\u2019t seeing?", "Mike: It\u2019s hard to act according to all your values in every single facet of your life, so maybe folks rationalize it and pick their battles, which doesn\u2019t include taking a stance on Uber.", "That, or more likely: People just don\u2019t care. Uber is incredibly convenient and works well if you\u2019ve got the money to spend on it. Why go back to waiting on yellow cabs or fighting your way onto a crowded bus if you don\u2019t have to?", "Farhad: I guess that makes sense. Anyway, have a good vacation!

It\u2019s the internet\u2019s most productive viral machine; every other meme or GIF you encounter online probably came from Reddit first. But if it creates lots of stuff for the rest of the internet to gawk at, it hasn\u2019t been very good at becoming a mainstream site by itself. For the uninitiated, it\u2019s tricky to navigate Reddit and find yourself a comfortable corner there.", "And it sounds like the company understands that. The new money will go to redesigning the site and creating a better mobile version, in the mold of more modern services \u2014 it will look like Facebook or Twitter, per Recode, the technology site.

Now I collect the only commodity that matters: Twitter followers.", "Mike: O.K. then.", "Finally, I wanted to scratch at something in potential acquisition land. According to a report from Business Insider, Google was apparently sniffing around a potential acquisition of Snap, the self-styled \u201ccamera company\u201d and maker of Snapchat, for a whopping $30 billion.", "The caveats: This all happened last year, and Snap said the rumors were false (though there may have been \u201cinformal\u201d talks, according to B.I.). It may not have been a real serious possibility, and often when rumors like these get floated, it stems from folks who have quite a vested interest in making an acquisition actually happen.", "Farhad: It\u2019s kind of like that rumor about how you\u2019re being sent to The New York Times\u2019s Siberia bureau. I\u2019m not sure who keeps starting that rumor.", "Mike: That said, I see the logic in this deal. Snap is in trouble. Their stock is getting hammered, Facebook is copying nearly all of its features wholesale across practically all of the Facebook-related apps, and Instagram is overtaking every popular Snapchat behavior and making it better inside of its own app.", "Advertisers are noticing. I keep hearing chatter about ad budgets being moved from Snapchat over to Instagram, which offers a nearly identical product but with better advertising technology and a much larger base of users. If you\u2019re an ad exec looking to spend dollars on digital ads aimed at youngsters, it seems like kind of an easy choice.", "So perhaps a bailout acquisition by Google would actually make a modicum of sense. Think back to when Facebook bought Instagram. Mark Zuckerberg basically said, \u201ckeep doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d to Instagram, and acted to help supplement Instagram\u2019s growth only by providing some of Facebook\u2019s strongest assets. Facebook is sitting on a mountain of sophisticated ad technology, not to mention hundreds of thousands of eager advertisers looking for more space to buy ads.", "I could see Google and Snap in a similar situation, especially since Snap is actively in the market to improve its advertising technology through a potential acquisition or two, as we\u2019ve heard rumors of over the past few months. Selling out seems like a no-brainer to me, even if it\u2019s a tacit admission that the company couldn\u2019t make it alone on the public markets.", "Farhad: On paper it would seem to make sense. But in reality I\u2019m not sure it would work out, which is perhaps why it didn\u2019t gel last year. For one thing, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Snapchat wants to sell \u2014 part of the reason it has been so innovative is that it has set itself apart from the Silicon Valley tech giants, and I suspect it feels it would lose some part of what makes it special under Google.", "Also, it\u2019s expensive. Even for Google, tens of billions of dollars on a second-place social networking company might be too much to swallow. Also, aren\u2019t we holding out for Google to buy Twitter?

That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.", "Their surge, which has taken place inside a tightly controlled internet space that has blocked international companies like Facebook, has increasingly set them apart from the rest of China.

The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.", "Alibaba and Tencent owe part of their success to China\u2019s censorship and suspicion of foreign tech firms, which have kept American giants like Facebook and Amazon out of their orbit. But the two have also scored some major technology innovations in their own right. They dominate a smartphone culture that in many ways is superior to that of the United States. Chinese people use their dueling mobile payment systems to settle their restaurant tabs, to shop online, to pay their utility bills, to rent bicycles and even to put money into investments.", "Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.", "Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia.

This is the simple case for the relevance of the YouTube Right, which I wrote about for The New York Times Magazine earlier this month. After it was published, controversy erupted over a Google employee\u2019s memo criticizing his company\u2019s attitudes toward diversity; when the employee was fired, he granted his first interview to Stefan Molyneux, a central figure in the movement (and the piece).", "Covering any large subculture \u2014 particularly one with an explicit ideological component \u2014 is a surefire way to garner a passionate response.

I received messages objecting to the article\u2019s political descriptions, which wasn\u2019t a surprise: Many such YouTubers self-identify with more granularity, as classical liberals or libertarians, as \u201cidentitarians,\u201d or as mere contrarians. There were people urging me not to give extreme politics a platform as others claimed these ideas were anything but.", "But reactions to the piece crystallized something else about the state of the media \u2014 all media \u2014 today. The most useful way to understand the disparity in responses inspired by the piece isn\u2019t to understand audiences as living on different parts of an ideological spectrum, or on a continuum of tech-savviness. Rather, I learned to understand where they were coming from in a much more literal sense. Media consumers\u2019 internet of 2017 is divided up among enormous, distinct and powerful platforms \u2014 Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. And their experience of the broader media universe is informed by the contexts in which they spend the most time, or to which they feel allegiance.", "Those immersed in this subculture were, of course, skeptical and defensive, critical of what felt to them like a glancing take on their hometown, dismissing it as condescending or antagonistic.

They\u2019re well-known objects of mockery on Tumblr, and something like mainstream figures on a site like 4chan.", "One user\u2019s home platform is another\u2019s foreign land. A point made by a subculture at home on Facebook might look funny to another on Twitter, which can read as evidence of a conspiracy to yet another on YouTube, which might be seen as offensive on Tumblr, which could be a joke on Reddit. One\u2019s sense of these things \u2014 whether a meme is funny, whether an argument is persuasive, whether a statement amounts to a threat \u2014 is informed not just by what the subculture stands for, but by which platform you use to make sense of the vast internet around you.", "And attention from a reporter \u2014 perceived as resident of none of the above \u2014 is suspect by default.

Communities such as the YouTube Right are adept at supercharging this complaint into a potent resentment politics: The \u201cmainstream\u201d or \u201celite\u201d media, they argue, isn\u2019t just out of touch ideologically or culturally, it is technologically and sociologically incompatible with the participatory, identity-centric \u2014 begrudgingly, social \u2014 media of the future. \u201cThey treated us as a curiosity for years. Now it\u2019s their turn,\u201d or something like that.", "This is strategic, yes. But not entirely mistaken.

Enrolling as a graduate student at Indiana University, in Bloomington, not far from where he grew up, he pitched the idea to Douglas Hofstadter, the cognitive scientist who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning book on minds and machines, \u201cG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.\u201d Mr. Hofstadter turned him down, adamant that even the latest artificial intelligence techniques were much too primitive. But over the next two decades, working on the fringe of academia, Mr. Eck kept chasing the idea, and eventually, the A.I. caught up with his ambition.", "Last spring, a few years after taking a research job at Google, Mr. Eck pitched the same idea he pitched Mr. Hofstadter all those years ago. The result is Project Magenta, a team of Google researchers who are teaching machines to create not only their own music but also to make so many other forms of art, including sketches, videos and jokes. With its empire of smartphones, apps and internet services, Google is in the business of communication, and Mr. Eck sees Magenta as a natural extension of this work.", "\u201cIt\u2019s about creating new ways for people to communicate,\u201d he said during a recent interview inside the small two-story building here that serves as headquarters for Google A.I. research.", "The project is part of a growing effort to generate art through a set of A.I. techniques that have only recently come of age. Called deep neural networks, these complex mathematical systems allow machines to learn specific behavior by analyzing vast amounts of data. By looking for common patterns in millions of bicycle photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a bike. This is how Facebook identifies faces in online photos, how Android phones recognize commands spoken into phones, and how Microsoft Skype translates one language into another. But these complex systems can also create art. By analyzing a set of songs, for instance, they can learn to build similar sounds.", "As Mr. Eck says, these systems are at least approaching the point \u2014 still many, many years away \u2014 when a machine can instantly build a new Beatles song or perhaps trillions of new Beatles songs, each sounding a lot like the music the Beatles themselves recorded, but also a little different. But that end game \u2014 as much a way of undermining art as creating it \u2014 is not what he is after. There are so many other paths to explore beyond mere mimicry. The ultimate idea is not to replace artists but to give them tools that allow them to create in entirely new ways.", "In the 1990s, at that juke joint in New Mexico, Mr. Eck combined Johnny Rotten and Johnny Cash. Now, he is building software that does much the same thing. Using neural networks, he and his team are crossbreeding sounds from very different instruments \u2014 say, a bassoon and a clavichord \u2014 creating instruments capable of producing sounds no one has ever heard.", "Much as a neural network can learn to identify a cat by analyzing hundreds of cat photos, it can learn the musical characteristics of a bassoon by analyzing hundreds of notes. It creates a mathematical representation, or vector, that identifies a bassoon. So, Mr. Eck and his team have fed notes from hundreds of instruments into a neural network, building a vector for each one. Now, simply by moving a button across a screen, they can combine these vectors to create new instruments. One may be 47 percent bassoon and 53 percent clavichord. Another might switch the percentages. And so on.", "For centuries, orchestral conductors have layered sounds from various instruments atop one other. But this is different. Rather than layering sounds, Mr. Eck and his team are combining them to form something that didn\u2019t exist before, creating new ways that artists can work. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next film camera,\u201d Mr. Eck said. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next electric guitar.\u201d", "Called NSynth, this particular project is only just getting off the ground. But across the worlds of both art and technology, many are already developing an appetite for building new art through neural networks and other A.I. techniques. \u201cThis work has exploded over the last few years,\u201d said Adam Ferris, a photographer and artist in Los Angeles. \u201cThis is a totally new aesthetic.\u201d", "In 2015, a separate team of researchers inside Google created DeepDream, a tool that uses neural networks to generate haunting, hallucinogenic imagescapes from existing photography, and this has spawned new art inside Google and out. If the tool analyzes a photo of a dog and finds a bit of fur that looks vaguely like an eyeball, it will enhance that bit of fur and then repeat the process. The result is a dog covered in swirling eyeballs.", "At the same time, a number of artists \u2014 like the well-known multimedia performance artist Trevor Paglen or the lesser-known Adam Ferris \u2014 are exploring neural networks in other ways. In January, Mr. Paglen gave a performance in an old maritime warehouse in San Francisco that explored the ethics of computer vision through neural networks that can track the way we look and move. While members of the avant-garde Kronos Quartet played onstage, for example, neural networks analyzed their expressions in real time, guessing at their emotions.", "The tools are new, but the attitude is not. Allison Parrish, a New York University professor who builds software that generates poetry, points out that artists have been using computers to generate art since the 1950s. \u201cMuch like as Jackson Pollock figured out a new way to paint by just opening the paint can and splashing it on the canvas beneath him,\u201d she said, \u201cthese new computational techniques create a broader palette for artists.\u201d", "A year ago, David Ha was a trader with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. During his lunch breaks he started toying with neural networks and posting the results to a blog under a pseudonym. Among other things, he built a neural network that learned to write its own Kanji, the logographic Chinese characters that are not so much written as drawn.", "Soon, Mr. Eck and other Googlers spotted the blog, and now Mr. Ha is a researcher with Google Magenta. Through a project called SketchRNN, he is building neural networks that can draw. By analyzing thousands of digital sketches made by ordinary people, these neural networks can learn to make images of things like pigs, trucks, boats or yoga poses. They don\u2019t copy what people have drawn. They learn to draw on their own, to mathematically identify what a pig drawing looks like.", "Then, you ask them to, say, draw a pig with a cat\u2019s head, or to visually subtract a foot from a horse or sketch a truck that looks like a dog or build a boat from a few random squiggly lines. Next to NSynth or DeepDream, these may seem less like tools that artists will use to build new works.

This was surprising, because Osborne owns multiple toy stores in South Carolina. Twenty years ago, she would have greeted a new fad like fidget spinners with glee. But the economy has changed quite a bit in the last two decades, and so when Osborne began first noticing the spinner craze, all she could think was: This seems like trouble.", "A fad changed Osborne\u2019s life, much for the better, shortly after she opened her original toy store, named Wonder Works, in the 1990s. In those early days, Osborne tried selling board games and science kits, but she was struggling to find customers. Then, in 1994, a family visiting from Chicago walked through her doors and asked if she had any Beanie Babies.", "Osborne had never even heard of them. But almost immediately, she started hearing about nothing else. Later that week, someone called asking if she had Quackers the Duck. The next day someone inquired about Happy the Hippo. Osborne quickly learned that Beanie Babies were stuffed animals that, truth be told, weren\u2019t all that distinguishable from other stuffed animals. But for some reason, they had become playground must-haves. \u2018\u2018And that\u2019s when I knew,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me, \u2018\u2018if we could just get our hands on Beanies, it would be our ticket.\u2019\u2019", "Talking to her suppliers, Osborne eventually figured out that Beanie Babies were made by Ty, a company in Westmont, Ill. Ty didn\u2019t actually manufacture Beanie Babies \u2014 that was outsourced to China \u2014 but it did everything else. The previous year, Ty\u2019s executives began an extensive campaign to identify the nation\u2019s most influential specialty gift and toy stores. Then, rather than advertise Beanie Babies to the public, executives quietly distributed small numbers of them to these retailers, often extracting a promise they would not sell more than a few Beanies to any single customer.", "Ty fiercely controlled retailers\u2019 inventory of Beanies based on a complicated formula that was updated with each day\u2019s sales and trends. If a store degraded the Beanie brand by discounting the toy or employing unfriendly salespeople, Ty would cut them off. As particular animals \u2014 like Peanut the Elephant \u2014 became popular, Ty ceased manufacturing them altogether. When Wal-Mart and Toys \u2018\u2018R\u2019\u2019 Us asked to carry Beanie Babies, Ty refused.", "Osborne was accustomed to toy manufacturers begging her to carry their products in her store. With Beanie Babies, everything was reversed. Osborne tracked down a Ty sales rep named Joyce and pleaded with her. \u2018\u2018I started in with the charm,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me. \u2018\u2018I would telephone nearly every afternoon and tell her we would do anything to get some stock.\u2019\u2019 Eventually, Joyce relented, and Wonder Works began earning thousands of dollars a week from Beanie Baby sales.", "But as the months passed and the women continued talking, Joyce began asking for favors of her own. Ty\u2019s executives wanted to know Osborne\u2019s opinion on her customers\u2019 tastes. Did they respond to primary colors? To sparkly bows? Why was Manny the Manatee so popular, but Darling the Dog a bust? Based on such conversations with Osborne and countless other toy-store owners, Ty\u2019s executives made hundreds of tiny shifts in their manufacturing, marketing and distribution over the years, turning what began as a fad into a perennial best-seller, one that earned hundreds of millions of dollars each year and helped Ty employ thousands of people. As for Osborne, she used her Beanie profits to expand Wonder Works to four locations. Today, more than two decades later, Beanie Boos, one of Ty\u2019s latest iterations, are still among her top-grossing items.", "This spring, when Osborne started getting phone calls about a new playground must-have \u2014 the fidget spinner \u2014 she was apprehensive instead of excited. \u2018\u2018Everything is different now,\u2019\u2019 Osborne told me. \u2018\u2018My goal was to get in and get out as fast as I could.\u2019\u2019", "Fidget spinners had been around for years, marketed as aids for kids with attention problems (a claim that has little scientific backing). But they were never particularly popular. That changed last year, after a rash of videos appeared on YouTube featuring teenagers performing fidget-spinner tricks. That caught the attention of Chinese factories, many of which have begun to employ squadrons of workers to monitor social media and Google Trends, allowing them to jump on the next big consumer-product craze as soon as it starts materializing. By the time Osborne became aware of the fad, all she had to do was go to DHgate.com, a chaotic online marketplace where overseas factories offer everything from fake eyelashes ($1.27 a pair, shipping within four days) to automobile engines (minimum order $50,000, full delivery in six weeks). There were dozens of manu\u00adfacturers offering fidget spinners in whatever quantity a buyer desired. With help from a colleague, Osborne ordered her stock from a factory where, as far as she could tell, no one spoke English, and five days later, the boxes started arriving. Soon she was selling tens of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of spinners each month. Her biggest competitors were gas stations and people selling from collapsible tables in a nearby park. Most of them also got their spinners through sites like DHgate.com.", "For fidget spinners, as Osborne well knew, no one was going to manage the buzz, strategize about inventory and plan marketing the way Ty had for Beanie Babies. \u2018\u2018Now, in less than half a year, spinners are done,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m moving on to squishies\u2019\u2019 \u2014 squishable toys that are also (questionably) marketed as attention aids. \u2018\u2018I think they\u2019ll last at least a few months.\u2019\u2019", "Within economics, this transition to direct selling \u2014 of cutting out sales reps like Joyce in lieu of websites like DHgate.com \u2014 is known as disintermediation, and it\u2019s one of the defining characteristics of the internet age. Companies like Uber, Amazon and Priceline have succeeded by disintermediating enormous industries (taxi dispatchers, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel agents). The logic of disintermediation seems self-evident: By putting factories directly in contact with stores, by helping customers order directly from manufacturers, by letting riders coordinate with drivers, you cut out a needless source of waste and inefficiency. Middlemen (and middlewomen), so this theory goes, have simply been gobbling a slice of the pie they never really deserved.", "In reality, though, all these middlemen were often crucial to ensuring that the pie was baked at all. As Osborne learned when she started selling Beanie Babies, middlemen like Joyce are often the ones who turn a fad into a sustainable business that creates jobs. You might think a company\u2019s main function is to make stuff. But that\u2019s usually wrong. Making stuff is often the easiest part of what a company does. It\u2019s everything else \u2014 marketing and defending intellectual property, coming up with distribution strategies and knowing when to stop manufacturing Peanut the Elephant \u2014 that\u2019s the hard part. That\u2019s what middlemen do.", "Or, at least, it\u2019s what they did, before the digital economy made their jobs disappear. Take, for instance, the travel industry: As Youcheng Wang of the University of Central Florida notes, the industry as we know it was built, over decades, by hundreds of thousands of middlemen at travel agencies, tour operators, hotels and airline bucket shops. \u2018\u2018There were layers of jobs and experts,\u2019\u2019 Wang says. \u2018\u2018They convinced people to visit new places and helped resorts find new customers.\u2019\u2019 Today, however, many of those jobs and experts are gone, replaced by disintermediators like Trip\u00adAdvisor (3,000 employees) and Priceline (18,500 employees), which are built on what middlemen created, but which employ far fewer people. And the impact of losing all those jobs will have ripple effects that we can\u2019t even predict. Who, in the absence of those middlemen, is today persuading travelers to dream bigger about their vacations, to open their wallets to support off-the-beaten-track destinations, to help new hotels find their clienteles? \u2018\u2018Without intermediaries,\u2019\u2019 Wang points out, \u2018\u2018it can be difficult to get discovered.\u2019\u2019", "Around the same time Osborne was first hearing about fidget spinners, she visited a big toy fair in New York and stopped by the booth of Zing, a toy manufacturer that jumped on the craze early. At the fair, Zing executives were testing out an idea: What did retailers like Osborne think about a fidget spinner with LED lights that kids could program from their iPhone, so that it would spell out words as it spun?", "It was a fun idea, retailers said. It could probably help fidget spinners make the transition from a fad into a sustainable product. If it worked, it would create jobs and help toy stores prosper. But Osborne and others cautioned Zing against making the investment. It would take at least six months to design and manufacture the new item, and by then, the fidget spinner craze would most likely be over. So Zing shelved the idea \u2014 and the new hiring it would have triggered.", "\u2018\u2018Now a fad is just a fad,\u2019\u2019 Osborne says. \u2018\u2018And that makes things harder for all of us.\u2019\u2019"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/business/dealbook/uber-softbank-benchmark-dragoneer.html": ["There\u2019s never a dull moment at Uber.", "The company is weighing a number of offers from investors seeking to buy shares in the ride-hailing service, The New York Times reports.

It\u2019s the platform Mr. Lynn, Matt Stoller and Lina Khan have used to call for regulatory scrutiny of the tech monopolies like Google, Amazon and Facebook as these companies increasingly come to dominate our economy. But Google\u2019s financial power at New America was apparently such that it could close the group down. Though Ms. Slaughter denies the connection between Google\u2019s funding and her decision, the implication seems clear. A firm whose motto was \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d has no interest in being called a monopoly by a think tank it funds.", "In his book \u201cZero to One,\u201d the tech investor Peter Thiel writes that companies like Google lie to protect themselves. \u201cThey know that bragging about their great monopoly invites being audited, scrutinized and attacked. Since they very much want their profits to continue unmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly \u2014 usually by exaggerating the power of their (nonexistent) competition,\u201d he explains. There\u2019s evidence that this kind of exaggeration is carried out by numerous scholars and think tanks funded by Google. According to a 2017 Wall Street Journal investigative report, \u201cOver the past decade, Google has helped finance hundreds of research papers to defend against regulatory challenges of its market dominance, paying $5,000 to $400,000 for the work.\u201d", "But as the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog discovered in February 2009 when it investigated Google\u2019s handling of consumer privacy, the funding from Google comes with strings attached.

Google was forced to disclose that it provided major funding to important organizations like Public Knowledge, Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Computer and Communications Industry Association.", "So when these supposedly neutral organizations weigh in on issues that involve Google, you should take their advocacy with a grain of salt. In the coming months, privacy legislation put forward by Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, and modifications to the Safe Harbor provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act advocated by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, will come before Congress. Google does not want either of these laws to pass, and you can be sure that papers from major think tanks will be part of the policy discussion.", "Perhaps more important, the discussion that is beginning to take place on both sides of the political aisle on whether companies like Google and Amazon are too big will continue.

The decision-makers who apply research results in ways that have significant social impact are far more likely to be general readers than academics. Mr. Harford\u2019s achievements over this period are all the more impressive by virtue of the fact that he is both the economist and the journalist producing the translation of the technical ideas.", "Mr. Harford\u2019s latest book (his sixth follow-up to \u201cThe Undercover Economist\u201d) is a different kind of translation: a reimagining of his popular 2016 podcast from the BBC World Service, \u201cFifty Things That Made the Modern Economy,\u201d as a book.", "The subtle name change from podcast to book \u2014 \u201cFifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy (Riverhead: 2017)\u201d \u2014 reflects an emphasis on humility. Mr. Harford repeatedly emphasizes that he is not trying \u201cto identify the 50 most economically significant inventions.\u201d", "Unfortunately, Mr. Harford\u2019s clarity about what the book isn\u2019t is not matched by comparable clarity about what the book is.", "This is not to say that there isn\u2019t plenty to savor in \u201cFifty Inventions.\u201d After all, the podcast was popular for a reason, and much of the book is a verbatim transcription of that series. The issue is that the insistence on making the book be about something more than the individual tales often becomes a distraction instead of a benefit. Organizing the podcasts by theme is sometimes forced, the cross-referencing of the stories uneven and the promised payoff \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to draw these lessons together and ask how we should think about innovation today\u201d\u2014 never really comes.", "Take the first invention grouped under the first theme: the gramophone as an example of the phenomenon that \u201cnew technologies almost always create winners and losers.\u201d Mr. Harford argues that the availability of recorded music \u201cled the way toward a winner-take-all dynamic in the performing industry.\u201d", "He provides an engrossing account of the English soprano Elizabeth Billington, who prompted a mad bidding war among opera houses and was the highest paid solo singer of the early 19th century. Yet those financial spoils represented, in today\u2019s dollars, less than 1 percent of what Elton John pulls in. The availability of recorded music, Mr. Harford argues, has not only enriched the handful of Elton Johns but has been costly to those who fail to achieve superstardom because \u201cwhen you can listen at home to the best performers in the world, why pay to hear a merely competent tribute act in person?\u201d", "Citing an influential 1981 article on superstar economics, Mr. Harford then asserts that across many industries in which technology has radically expanded the market, the result has been that \u201cthe only-slightly-less-good went from making a comfortable living to struggling to pay their bills.\u201d He particularly argues that satellite television \u201chas been to athletes what the gramophone was to musicians.\u201d", "The trouble with this narrative, as any American sports fan knows, is that it is false. Even the weakest players in any of the major sports leagues should have few challenges in obtaining life\u2019s necessities. For example, during the 50 years since Marvin Miller negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement for the Major League Baseball Players Association \u2014 precisely the period over which Mr. Harford predicts that slightly-less-good athletes should have been financially devastated \u2014 the minimum salary has grown 20,000 percent. The average player currently makes over $4 million and the minimum is over half a million.", "Part of the challenge faced by Mr. Harford is simply one of space. The economics is right, but the complexities of the industry structures often require a more nuanced story line. Fifty compelling stand-alone yarns in under 300 pages would challenge the most accomplished economic journalist. Adding a discussion of seven overarching themes (not to mention the need to compare and contrast and deliver on the anticipated concluding lessons) and the burden of integrating these into the individual narratives is more than can be reasonably achieved.", "The less than five pages devoted to Google search highlight both the structural challenge and the need for nuance. In pressing the theme of winners and losers Mr. Harford emphasizes that, with the rise of Google, newspaper advertising \u201chas fallen off a cliff.\u201d This is an unsatisfying on two fronts. First, the more fundamental challenge to newspaper advertising predated Google, with the introduction of Monster, Craigslist, eBay and the slew of other online marketplace businesses that eviscerated the core newspaper classified profit engine. Second, the bigger impact of the Google advertising monolith is the extent to which it has swallowed a disproportionate slice of the growth in digital advertising generally, relegating many once promising and highly popular ad-based online businesses to the dustbin of history.", "More troubling is the perfunctory history of AdWords, the core monetization engine that underpins Google\u2019s financial success. Mr. Harford correctly points out that the brilliant search algorithm in itself, although wildly useful, was not financially viable on its own. Mr. Harford, however, gives no context for how the pay-per-click advertising lifeline represented by the auction-based AdWords product came to be.", "Some of the most interesting parts of \u201cFifty Inventions\u201d are Mr. Harford\u2019s discussion of the complex role of government generally and intellectual property rights particularly in both fostering and hindering innovation.

In Exley\u2019s judgment, B.P.S. is emblematic of a marginal but ascendant sort of YouTube figure \u2014 a type that is becoming a meaningful force in the practice of politics online. B.P.S. has, by any objective standard, a significant and engaged audience; at the moment, he has about 215,000 followers, and his uploads have been viewed more than 25 million times. In an introductory video, he describes himself as something like a pundit or an analyst: \u201cI attempt to make sense out of the increasingly nonsensical world we all share,\u201d he says of his channel. \u201cI try and be only as offensive as I need to be.\u201d His videos are unhurried, heavy on explanation and argument, regularly stretching over the 10-minute mark. And, as Exley notes, his politics skew right. Hard right:", "Like its fellow mega-platforms Twitter and Facebook, YouTube is an enormous engine of cultural production and a host for wildly diverse communities. But like the much smaller Tumblr (which has long been dominated by lively and combative left-wing politics) or 4chan (which has become a virulent and effective hard-right meme factory) YouTube is host to just one dominant native political community: the YouTube right. This community takes the form of a loosely associated group of channels and personalities, connected mostly by shared political instincts and aesthetic sensibilities. They are monologuists, essayists, performers and vloggers who publish frequent dispatches from their living rooms, their studios or the field, inveighing vigorously against the political left and mocking the \u201cmainstream media,\u201d against which they are defined and empowered. They deplore \u201csocial justice warriors,\u201d whom they credit with ruining popular culture, conspiring against the populace and helping to undermine \u201cthe West.\u201d They are fixated on the subjects of immigration, Islam and political correctness. They seem at times more animated by President Trump\u2019s opponents than by the man himself, with whom they share many priorities, if not a style. Some of their leading figures are associated with larger media companies, like Alex Jones\u2019s Infowars or Ezra Levant\u2019s Rebel Media. Others are independent operators who found their voices in the medium.", "To the extent that these personalities challenge their viewers, it\u2019s to commit even more deeply to what their intuitions already tell them is true \u2014 not despite those opinions\u2019 rejection from mainstream liberal thought, but because of it. Theirs is a potent and time-tested strategy. Unpopular arguments can benefit from being portrayed as forbidden, and marginal ideas are more effectively sold as hidden ones. The zealous defense of ideas for which audiences believe they\u2019re seen as stupid, cruel or racist is made possible with simple inversion: Actually, it\u2019s everyone else who is stupid, cruel or racist, and their \u201cconsensus\u201d is a conspiracy intended to conceal the unspoken feelings of a silent majority. Trump has developed an intuition for this kind of audience cultivation; so have countless pundits, broadcasters, salespeople and politicians of different populist political stripes. But Exley, in his final analysis of B.P.S., points to an especially apt historical parallel: conservative talk radio. \u201cFixated as they are with Fox News,\u201d he says, \u201cliberals, scholars and pundits have failed to give talk radio \u2014 which is almost wholly conservative \u2014 its due, even though it\u2019s now nearly three decades old and reaches millions each day. They now stand to miss a new platform that, so far, is also dominated by the right wing.\u201d", "The radio comparison is a useful one. Talk radio\u2019s growth followed decades of deregulation and disruptive opportunity: the rise of FM radio during the late 1960s and \u201970s, the abandonment by music stations of the low-fidelity AM band and the 1987 revocation of the Fairness Doctrine, a rule through which the Federal Communications Commission attempted to regulate a sort of balance into content produced by licensed broadcasters. The subsequent rise of conservative talk radio, typified by superstars like Rush Limbaugh, had enormous influence and continues to attract millions of listeners a day, well into the internet era. Its style, once novel, is now familiar. There\u2019s the casual, knowing rapport with listeners; the baggy, multihour shows, which double as news digests; the moralizing monologues that transition seamlessly into jokey rants and asides. But something about the medium seems to favor the right. Repeated, strenuous attempts by liberal broadcasters to replicate conservative talk radio formats have not fared well. Air America, which was launched in 2004 and shuttered in 2010, helped propel talent into other venues \u2014 Rachel Maddow to television, Al Franken to the Senate \u2014 but failed as a sustainable answer to combative conservative talk radio. AM opened a space for reaction, but seemed to have no room for the counterreaction.", "YouTube\u2019s political context is similar in some notable ways: the value it places on personalities; its reliance on monologue and repetition; its isolation and immunity from direct challenge; its promise to let listeners in on the real, secret story. Both are obsessed with persuasion and conversion, combined with a giddy disbelief at the sheer stupidity of liberals, who \u2014 and this is part of the fun \u2014 aren\u2019t listening. Comparing YouTube to talk radio is also a useful reminder of how potent a medium can become while still appearing marginal to those who don\u2019t care for it or know much about it. For listeners of conservative talk radio \u2014 where right-wing populist rhetoric has flourished for decades, and where hosts can get away with authoritarian flirtations and xenophobic rhetoric that mainstream politicians can\u2019t \u2014 the rise of Donald Trump was somewhat less of a surprise than it was for many others.", "The YouTube right may be comparatively marginal and ragtag, but it\u2019s also comparatively young. If talk radio primed listeners for Trump\u2019s style and anticipated the American right\u2019s current obsessions, the YouTube right is acquainting viewers with a more international message, attuned to a global revival of explicitly race-and-religion-based, blood-and-soil nationalism. Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars, 35, is perhaps the archetypal YouTube-right vlogger; he has nearly a million followers, and his videos have been viewed more than 215 million times. He has in the last month published videos with titles including \u201cStaged Video Shows \u2018Refugee\u2019 Fake Drowning,\u201d \u201cFinsbury Mosque Terror: What They\u2019re NOT Telling You,\u201d \u201cThe Truth about Refugees\u201d and \u201cWhy Leftists Submit to Terror.\u201d The scripts for these videos are straightforward nativist polemics, with a particular focus on Europe \u2014 Watson is from Northern England \u2014 delivered in a relentlessly insistent tone, and quite close to the camera. Watson posts extended \u201croasts\u201d of his political villains, as well as rants that betray a peculiar blend of self-taught reaction: against pop culture, broadly, but also against \u201cmodern architecture\u201d and \u201cmodern art.\u201d If one video sums up what a receptive viewer might take from subscribing to his channel, it\u2019s \u201cSome Cultures are Better than Others.\u201d", "Watson frequently suggests that ideologies like his represent a sort of new counterculture and boasts about the right wing\u2019s dominance on the YouTube platform. \u201cTwitter is a tiny echo chamber,\u201d he tweeted earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the left understand the monumental ass-whupping being dished out to them on YouTube.\u201d And in terms of sheer numbers and visibility on the platform, the YouTube right is substantial.

His journey terminated at a cavernous military hangar.", "A fleet of JPL trucks made the trip under armored guard to the same destination. Their cargo was unwrapped inside the hangar high bay, a gleaming silo stocked with tool racks and ladder trucks. Engineers began to assemble the various pieces. Gradually, two identical spacecraft took shape. They were dubbed Voyager I and II, and their mission was to make the first color photographs and close-up measurements of Jupiter, Saturn and their moons. Then, if all went well, they might press onward \u2014 into uncharted territory.", "It took six months, working in shifts around the clock, for the NASA crew to reassemble and test the spacecraft.

Shielding their eyes, they peered across a flat expanse at smoke billowing on the horizon. Slowly and silently, the capsule rose out of the cloud, its rockets trailing flames. In an instant, there came a terrific boom as the sound waves from blastoff hit the hangar like a gong, ringing it as the spacecraft disappeared.", "Two weeks later, after the second launch, everyone headed home. The show was over \u2014 both spacecraft were performing flawlessly \u2014 but behind the scenes, the mission, on a tight budget, lagged in hiring the more than 200 computer engineers needed to shepherd the spacecraft through a planetary encounter. Many of those on the flight team were fresh out of college, running the most sophisticated electronics systems in the world. They had barely had a chance to jell, when, in April 1978, not yet halfway to Jupiter, Voyager 1 experienced a problem. Its scan platform, where the cameras and instruments are mounted, got stuck.", "As the engineers scrambled to figure out what they could do from more than 100 million miles away, someone forgot to send a weekly command to reset a timer on the other spacecraft. When it ran down without hearing from Earth, it triggered so-called fault-protection software, 600 lines of code that respond to malfunctions automatically. In this instance, fault protection assumed the radio receiver was broken and switched to the backup. On the mission-control monitors in a situation like this, the crawl of numbers reporting the status of the receivers would have turned crimson: a \u2018\u2018red alarm.\u2019\u2019", "Realizing their mistake, the engineers tried to stop the fault-protection routine, but the newly awakened backup receiver would not register their command. Helpless, they waited for the spacecraft to reason its way back to the original receiver; when it did, and the command went through normally, they were giddy with relief. They were still high-fiving when the working receiver shorted out like a blown fuse. Now it really was dead.", "Fortunately, the malfunctioning backup receiver was still drawing current. They guessed that its oscillator, which allows it to accept a wide range of frequencies, had quit, essentially shrinking the target for transmissions from Earth. Assuming a much narrower bandwidth, and manually subtracting the Doppler effect, they recalibrated their signal. It worked \u2014 but to this day, the same calculation must precede every command. The original receiver remains useless: one engineer\u2019s simple oversight nearly doomed humankind\u2019s lone visit to Uranus and Neptune. \u2018\u2018You like to think you have checks and balances,\u2019\u2019 Chris Jones, JPL\u2019s chief engineer, who designed Voyager\u2019s fault protection, told me. \u2018\u2018In reality, we all worry about being that person.\u2019\u2019", "Today the Voyagers are 10 billion and 13 billion miles away, the farthest man-made objects from Earth. The 40th anniversary of their launch will be celebrated next month. We tend to think of space as vacant, but it is actually matter, created, as everything in the universe is, by the explosions of ancient stars. Within our planetary neighborhood, this \u2018\u2018space\u2019\u2019 is made up of different particles than the space outside is, because of supersonic wind that blows out from the surface of our sun at a million miles per hour. The wind generates a bubble around our solar system called the heliosphere. Five years ago, Voyager 1 reached the boundary where the heliosphere gives way to interstellar space, a region as novel to us \u2014 and potentially relevant \u2014 as the Pacific was to Europeans 500 years ago. The data the probes are collecting are challenging fundamental physics and will provide clues to the biggest of questions: Why did our sun give birth to life only here? Where else, within our solar system or others, are we most likely to find evidence that we are not alone?", "The mission quite possibly represents the end of an era of space exploration in which the main goal is observation rather than commercialization. In internal memos, Trump-administration advisers have referred to NASA\u2019s traditional contractors as \u2018\u2018Old Space\u2019\u2019 and proposed refocusing its budget on supporting the growth of the private \u2018\u2018New Space\u2019\u2019 industry, Politico reported in February. \u2018\u2018Economic development of space\u2019\u2019 will begin in near-Earth orbit and on the moon, according to the president\u2019s transition team, with \u2018\u2018private lunar landers staking out de facto \u2018property rights\u2019 for Americans on the moon, by 2020.\u2019\u2019", "All explorations demand sacrifices in exchange for uncertain outcomes. Some of those sacrifices are social: how many resources we collectively devote to a given pursuit of knowledge. But another portion is borne by the explorer alone, who used to be rewarded with adventure and fame if not fortune. For the foreseeable future, Voyager seems destined to remain in the running for the title of Mankind\u2019s Greatest Journey, which might just make its nine flight-team engineers \u2014 most of whom have been with the mission since the Reagan administration \u2014 our greatest living explorers. They also may be the last people left on the planet who can operate the spacecraft\u2019s onboard computers, which have 235,000 times less memory and 175,000 times less speed than a 16-gigabyte smartphone. And while it\u2019s true that these pioneers haven\u2019t gone anywhere themselves, they are arguably every bit as dauntless as more celebrated predecessors. Magellan never had to steer a vessel from the confines of a dun-colored rental office, let alone stay at the helm long enough to qualify for a senior discount at the McDonald\u2019s next door.", "Their fluency in archaic programming languages will become only more crucial as the years go on, because even as the probes harvest priceless information from the cosmos, they are running out of fuel. (Decaying plutonium supplies their power.) By 2030 at the latest, they will not have enough juice left to run a single experiment. And even that best case comes with a major caveat: that the flight-team members forgo retirement to squeeze the most out of every last watt.", "One of the greatest obstacles to planetary science has always been the human life span: Typically, for instance, a direct flight to Neptune would take about 30 years. But in the spring of 1965, Gary Flandro, a doctoral student at Caltech, noticed that all four outer planets \u2014 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2014 would align on the same side of the sun in the 1980s. If a spacecraft were launched in the mid- to late 1970s, it could use the gravity of the first body to slingshot to the second, and so on. Such a trajectory would add enough speed to shorten the total journey by almost two-thirds. What\u2019s more, this orbital configuration would not appear again for 175 years.", "The Voyagers carried cameras and instruments for analyzing atmospheric temperatures, moon masses, gravitational and magnetic fields and radiation levels. Reaching Jupiter in 1979, they captured images of lightning in its cloud tops and astounded scientists \u2014 who had assumed all moons were as barren as our own \u2014 with pictures of eight active volcanoes on its satellite Io; Europa, another Jovian moon, was encased in a shell of water ice, cracked in places by what appeared to be the tides of an ocean below. The photographs revealed themselves on control-room monitors pixel by pixel, row by row. \u2018\u2018I would be sitting in here at night sometimes when the Voyager mission was flying,\u2019\u2019 Esker Davis, project manager for the Saturn encounter, told David W. Swift, who published an oral history of the mission in 1997, after Davis\u2019s death. \u2018\u2018And my wife would call up and ask what I was doing. I said, \u2018Just watching pictures come in, being the first person to see this picture.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019", "The mission would have ended there, but President Ronald Reagan bestowed an extension, possibly swayed by the real-time briefings hosted by Ed Stone, the project\u2019s lead scientist, on the occasion of every planetary encounter. Hundreds of reporters, as well as politicians and celebrities, attended, packing into a cramped JPL auditorium for the debuts of Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989.", "The final flyby, of Neptune\u2019s moon Triton, took place on a hot August night. Afterward, everyone celebrated with Champagne, cold cuts and drunken singing; on the JPL lawn, Chuck Berry performed \u2018\u2018Johnny B. Goode,\u2019\u2019 one of the tracks included on gold-plated records of human sights and sounds attached to the spacecraft for any intelligent life that might find them. Then, gradually, the hallways grew quiet. Stone and his colleagues moved on to new projects while analyzing Voyager data part time; the flight team laid off 150 engineers (many of whom went on to staff subsequent missions). The probes\u2019 new goal was to reach interstellar space. But though scientists had measured the speed of the solar wind that forms the heliosphere, the properties of the matter beyond it had never been analyzed. How much pressure it exerted on the bubble, and thus the size of the bubble, were a mystery. So, too, was how long \u2014 years? decades? \u2014 it might take a craft to escape it.", "At the mission\u2019s outset, the flight-team members were mischievous kids. They relieved stress with games and pranks: bowling in the hallway, using soda cans as pins; filling desk drawers with plastic bags of live goldfish; making scientists compete in disco-pose contests. Now, by 1990, they were older, with kids of their own. They had experienced the deaths of colleagues and watched others\u2019 marriages falter as a result of long hours at the lab. With no planets to explore, they spent the decade doing routine spacecraft maintenance with a fraction of their bygone manpower. Six of the current nine engineers were on the team then. Sun Kang Matsumoto, who joined the mission in \u201985, studied so diligently to master the new roles pressed upon her that her sons learned the spacecraft contours by osmosis. When her eldest was 8, he surprised her with a perfect Lego model; now in college, \u2018\u2018he calls and asks, \u2018How is Voyager?\u2019 Like, \u2018How is Grandma?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto says.", "The mission originally occupied three floors of Building 264 on the JPL campus, home to many of the lab\u2019s highest-profile projects. But soon after Neptune, says Jefferson Hall, who joined the project in 1978, \u2018\u2018we were booted out.\u2019\u2019 Their first move was into the former offices of a mainframe-computer company in Sierra Madre. In 2002, after more staff cuts, they moved to a rental suite in Altadena. NASA reviewed the mission to determine if it should be canceled altogether.", "The scientists\u2019 models, meanwhile, began to reveal subtle changes in the raw data. By late 2004, it was clear that Voyager 1\u2019s magnetometer had detected an abrupt increase in the strength of the surrounding magnetic field, suggesting the probe had entered the outermost layer of the heliospheric bubble, the \u2018\u2018heliosheath.\u2019\u2019 This is where the solar wind ions abruptly slow as they press outward against the surrounding interstellar matter and swerve to create a cometlike tail. A wind of interstellar ions flows around the outside of the bubble like water around the bow of a ship. Finally, on Aug. 25, 2012, the density of particles around the spacecraft precipitously increased, as though it had plunged from sky to sea. It had crossed the threshold of interstellar space.", "I\nn 2016, the year he turned 80, Zottarelli, the flight team\u2019s most experienced programmer, gave six months\u2019 notice and spent the time training a successor. None of the other engineers, only one of whom is under 50, have a replacement in waiting in the event that they abdicate more suddenly. Unlike the astrophysicists who devise experiments for Voyager and who interpret the results, the core flight-team members don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to work simultaneously on other missions. Over decades, the crew members who have remained have forgone promotions, the lure of nearby Silicon Valley and, more recently, retirement, to stay with the spacecraft. NASA funding, which peaked during the Apollo program in the 1960s, has dwindled, making it next to impossible to recruit young computer-science majors away from the likes of Google and Facebook.", "Last autumn, I drove through the San Gabriel Valley to a squat concrete building beside Scott-Fox Puppy Preschool. Suzanne Dodd, 56, the mission\u2019s project manager, answered the door. She wore red-framed glasses over sharp blue eyes, and her fair hair was cut short. She escorted me past the vestibule to a common room ringed by office doors. Hanging over the cubicle partitions in the center was a shingle that read \u2018\u2018Mission Control.\u2019\u2019", "\u2018\u2018You can see where we are in the culture,\u2019\u2019 she said, with a mild sweep of her palm. Voyager was her first job. She pointed out a used microfiche reader that Tom Weeks, a hardware engineer and the self-described mission librarian, purchased on eBay to read old diagnostics reports. To conserve power on the spacecraft, the engineers must decide what to turn off when, and for how long \u2014 which means estimating how cold they can let each component get. (On Voyager 2, because of the broken oscillator, any change in temperature also tweaks the receiver frequency.) Turning the heaters off for a while is the safest way to get enough power to run the instruments, but the lower the overall wattage drops, the faster parts will freeze. One of the team\u2019s most valuable insights so far: Spinning the wheels of an eight-track tape recorder \u2014 the spacecrafts\u2019 only data-storage option \u2014 generates a bit of additional heat.", "Enrique Medina, the power subsystem expert, was preparing to implement a \u2018\u2018patch,\u2019\u2019 an update that would turn off a heater on Voyager 2 in order to run the gyroscope, roll the spacecraft and calibrate the magnetometer. Even though they simulate every patch with software, there is plenty of room for human error. Far more often, hardware fails for no evident reason. In 1998, Voyager 2 reacted to a command by going silent. For 64 hours straight, the flight team studied the specific instruction \u2014 consisting of 18 bits, or 1s and 0s \u2014 that preceded the blackout. Bits have been known to \u2018\u2018flip\u2019\u2019 to the opposite value, changing the instruction the same way that swapping a single letter turns \u2018\u2018cat\u2019\u2019 into \u2018\u2018cut.\u2019\u2019 The question was: What instruction had they accidentally given and how could they undo it? At last, modeling the outcome of each possible bit, they discovered one that turned off the exciter, which generates the spacecraft\u2019s radio signal; when they turned it back on, the transmissions resumed. A similar scare took place in 2010, when a bit involved in formatting telemetry flipped, turning the transmissions to gibberish. \u2018\u2018A lot of our anomalies we\u2019ve come up with workarounds for, and at the time we didn\u2019t know why it happened,\u2019\u2019 Weeks explained. Dodd added, \u2018\u2018The No. 1 rule with spacecraft is: Don\u2019t change it if you don\u2019t have to.\u2019\u2019", "In the mission-control cubby, Medina, who is 68 and a grandfather of four, with a husky voice and a Tom Selleck mustache, rolled a chair over to two pairs of monitors labeled with construction-paper signs that read: \u2018\u2018Voyager Mission Control Hardware, PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH.\u2019\u2019 He jiggled a mouse, and one of the screens woke to a stream of numbers and letters describing the health of Voyager 1.", "Because they have only four kilobytes of computer storage, the spacecraft transmit data 24/7, but the radio signals take 19 hours and 12 hours to reach Earth. The three antenna dishes big enough to register them are shared, so Voyager gets only four to six hours of reception time per spacecraft per day; outside these often odd windows, their data dissipate into the ether. Medina gestured to another computer in the corner that monitors the telemetry that comes in when the office is empty and, if it detects an anomaly, phones an on-call engineer: the Voyager Alarm Monitor Processor Including Remote Examination tool. \u2018\u2018We call it Vampire,\u2019\u2019 Medina said, \u2018\u2018because it works in the middle of the night.\u2019\u2019", "In March 2014, after news broke that Voyager 1 had crossed into interstellar space, I spoke with Medina over the phone. \u2018\u2018I would not leave my wife to go with Angelina Jolie, as exciting as that sounds,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018And I would not leave Voyager to go to the new Mars missions. I will not leave Voyager until it ceases to exist. Or until I cease to exist.\u2019\u2019", "A\nll the billions of stars in the universe, hosts to billions of planets, have a heliosphere. Understanding the properties of our own will help us interpret observations of those systems. Voyager 1 has shown that it blocks 75 percent of cosmic radiation, which at extreme levels is toxic to life as we know it. This is not a static number: Our sun is orbiting the galaxy at 125 miles per second; its interstellar environment \u2014 and thus the size and shape of its heliosphere \u2014 is constantly in flux.", "\u2018\u2018If the pressure outside got high enough, and there are some areas in the Milky Way galaxy where it would be high enough, it could compress the heliosphere down to where in fact the boundary is almost to where we are. And that would change the radiation environment of the planets, which is important when you want to try to understand anything about the origin of life,\u2019\u2019 Ed Stone, the science-team leader, told me when I visited him at Caltech last fall. \u2018\u2018Here on Earth, wherever there\u2019s liquid water, whether it\u2019s boiling water coming out of the vents or frozen water, there are microbes there. So life is remarkably robust where there\u2019s water.\u2019\u2019", "He went on: \u2018\u2018I think that one of the biggest questions is, Can we find a spot here in the solar system where there\u2019s microbial life? If there\u2019s no microbial life anywhere else, that would be surprising, given here on Earth it appeared fairly quickly after the end of the bombardment,\u2019\u2019 an epic rain of asteroids some four billion years ago. \u2018\u2018If one could ever find some evidence of it here in the solar system where we could get a sample, then one could look at the DNA. All life on Earth has a related DNA. Is that true for everywhere? Either answer would be amazing. Either there\u2019s only one way that life evolves, or no, there\u2019s more than one way.\u2019\u2019", "In his office, Stone stood on tiptoe to lift an intricate model of Voyager from the top of a bookcase. At 81, he moves more stiffly than the Stone of NASA archival footage. Otherwise, he is remarkably unchanged. On a bulletin board behind his computer, he pins the latest graphs of the rate of charged particles that each spacecraft has detected. A drastic dip in low-energy ones is what convinced him that Voyager 1 had exited the heliosphere, and he is eager for Voyager 2, which entered the heliosheath from a different angle in 2007, to see a comparable drop before it goes quiet.", "\u2018\u2018When we started this, I realized we were on a mission of discovery,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I just had no idea how much discovery there was going to be. And I certainly had no idea that it would last as long as it has.\u2019\u2019 After we lose contact with them, the spacecraft will continue to orbit the galaxy for billions of years, never striking another star. \u2018\u2018Space,\u2019\u2019 Stone said, \u2018\u2018is really empty.\u2019\u2019", "Astrophysicists who study the heliosphere wage a constant battle against apathy when it comes to invisible substances nearly 100 times farther away from us than the sun is. \u2018\u2018I hear a lot of people saying, \u2018So what?\u2019 I try to explain: \u2018It\u2019s like your home,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Merav Opher, a professor of astrophysics at Boston University and a member of the Voyager science team, told me. \u2018\u2018You just found out the walls aren\u2019t walls. They\u2019re porous. I think it\u2019s existential.\u2019\u2019 In 2006, Opher and Stone published a landmark paper in The Astrophysical Journal predicting that Voyager 2 would encounter the heliosphere boundary closer to the sun than its twin had, pointing to a startling contradiction: The heliosphere must be asymmetrical; it is not a \u2018\u2018sphere\u2019\u2019 after all.", "There is passionate disagreement about what its exact shape is. (The Voyager scientists argue over practically every scrap of data; a few holdouts insist that Voyager 1 has yet to reach interstellar space.) In 1961, Eugene Parker, the renowned astrophysicist who first predicted the existence of a heliosphere, hypothesized that it might look like a comet \u2014 compressed in front with a tail in back. Earlier this year, Tom Krimigis, the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and the principal investigator for Voyager\u2019s Low-Energy Charged Particle Experiment, published a paper in Nature Astronomy showing that the heliosphere has a very short tail and \u2018\u2018kind of moves through space like a clenched fist.\u2019\u2019 His instrument has also shown that cosmic rays \u2014 expected to flow toward the heliosphere uniformly from across interstellar space \u2014 actually move quite differently depending on their orientation to the interstellar magnetic field. \u2018\u2018Every once in a while, a tsunami passes Voyager,\u2019\u2019 Krimigis told me, referring to these waves. \u2018\u2018The galaxy was supposed to be a calm sea, and that\u2019s not what we find.\u2019\u2019", "Opher believes that the influence of the sun\u2019s magnetic field may warp the heliosphere into the shape of a \u2018\u2018croissant.\u2019\u2019 At its plump center, interstellar matter presses in closer than previously thought \u2014 which would mean we are less isolated from the rest of the galaxy than we believe.", "Last Sept. 29, a Thursday, Larry Zottarelli awoke before 7, as he did most weekdays, and dressed quietly so as not to disturb his sleeping wife. He raked a comb through his silver hair, donned trifocals and a calculator watch and drove to the office. He brewed his first mug of coffee in the efficiency kitchen and carried it to his desk. He\u2019d been on the job for 40 years; the next day would be his last. A printed-out email taped to his computer hutch had instructions for handing in his badge and parking pass and collecting his final paycheck. He had cleared out most of his belongings, except two gallon-size Ziploc bags, in which he had sealed the plastic arms of his office chair to protect them from disintegrating under the daily weight of his elbows. Sitting facing the door, backed by a windowless, conch-pink brick wall, he brought to mind a hermit crab wearing a seashell.", "Later that morning, when Zottarelli entered the conference room to attend his last daily flight-team briefing, his colleague Adans Ko, 58, was arranging takeout containers of dim sum on the table for a celebration. He threw an arm around his shoulders and said, \u2018\u2018Larry is going to give me a kiss today!\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto, who was holding a camera, said, \u2018\u2018O.K., look at me.\u2019\u2019 She was making a photo album for him. When the party broke up, I found Zottarelli\u2019s replacement, Lu Yang, at her desk. I asked her if he had given her any specific advice. \u2018\u2018Whatever the problem, you go there and solve it,\u2019\u2019 she said, and laughed.", "In retirement, Zottarelli told me, he would like to see Florida again. He wonders how it has changed. In his garage is a 1954 Swallow Doretti, a fixer-upper. \u2018\u2018It probably needs new brakes,\u2019\u2019 he said. I asked him if there was anywhere he liked to drive for fun. \u2018\u2018No,\u2019\u2019 he replied. \u2018\u2018Not anymore.\u2019\u2019", "I had stopped by his office to say goodbye and ask him what he planned to do with his newfound freedom. I pictured him in the Doretti, flying down the Pacific Coast Highway, wind in his hair. But he seemed to be in no mood for talking. I wished him well and turned to go. Then he spoke. \u2018\u2018I expect my second stroke will be on the 17th of November,\u2019\u2019 he said ruefully, gesturing toward his empty wall calendar. \u2018\u2018Life expectancy is five to seven years at my age on retiring, so \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018That was humor, I guess. I\u2019m not looking forward to being even older. Got no choice in the matter.\u2019\u2019", "I asked if he ever found himself thinking about the billions of years that the Voyagers will circle the center of the galaxy, long after our sun has exploded, scattering more stardust throughout the universe. \u2018\u2018Of course,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I was raised in the Roman Rite.

The show, with more than 35 coins, tokens, medallions and medals that celebrate black history leaders, events and institutions, is on loan from the Museum of UnCut Funk, the online destination for all things funky, which Ms. Williamson and Ms. Thomas began to curate about a decade ago.", "\u201cI bet you didn\u2019t know there was all this money with actual black people on it,\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \u201cAnd I doubt anybody knows the process that was undertaken to get these people put on currency.\u201d That process includes presidential authorization only after two-thirds of both the House and the Senate have first voted to approve the idea, she explained. \u201cIf you look at it from the perspective of, \u2018Well, damn, I had no idea about this,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cthat makes it pretty funky.\u201d", "Ms. Williamson continued, \u201cThis may be our most traditional show in that it\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019d expect to see in a black history exhibition.\u201d She and Ms. Thomas founded the funk museum, which usually focuses more on pop culture, in 2007. Besides Mr. Washington, other figures whose images are cast in bronze, gold and silver within the single-room show on Wall Street in the financial district include Joe Louis, Bessie Coleman and the Tuskegee Airmen.", "A few of the objects, like a 2016 Harpers Ferry National Historical Park quarter, representing Washington, D.C., and another from Washington, featuring the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, issued in 2017, are currently in circulation. But most, like two for President Barack Obama from his first and second terms in office, and Rosa Parks\u2019s 1999 bronze medal, were pressed strictly to honor the subject, not to be used as money. Still, they represent what Ms. Williamson called a funky twist in how people think about the United States Mint.", "Ms. Thomas and Ms. Williamson opened their online museum, which has all the usual elements of the brick-and-mortar kind, including a gift shop with T-shirts and coffee mugs, as a way of celebrating their blackness and their mutual love of 1970s black culture. \u201cFat Albert and the Cosby Kids\u201d cartoon cels and blaxploitation movie posters can be viewed at the museum site. So can recorded interviews with James Brown, Isaac Hayes and Teddy Pendergrass, and the work of the pioneering black cartoonist Morrie Turner, whose comics appeared in publications like Negro Digest and Ebony.", "A comprehensive \u201c\u2019Fro Back\u201d exhibition offers a tour of the hairstyle. \u201c\u2019Fro Back,\u201d like each of the museum\u2019s 20 online exhibitions \u2014 \u201cBlack Barbie\u201d is another \u2014 has titles and text panels.

By about a year later, they had about 30, and now the collection has ballooned to around 12,000 objects, including black advertising tins and black postage stamps, and all of it is self-funded. In the late \u201990s, they opened a gallery in Summit, N.J. But the aftermath of 9/11 forced them to close.", "\u201cThe community was in mourning,\u201d Ms. Thomas said, and foot traffic slowed so much it didn\u2019t make sense to stay open.", "\u201cHaving the gallery space, just the physicality involved in moving stuff and hanging art, was hard enough, and something I would rather not do again,\u201d Ms. Williamson said. \u201cSo I said, \u2018How about we put our stuff online first, and maybe we can have a physical space later?\u2019\u201d", "The move from physical to digital worked so well that they never looked back.", "Hundreds of thousands of people have now visited the site, including representatives of colleges, libraries and institutions like the Museum of American Finance.", "If the online address sounds like a destination for the nostalgic or the lighthearted, it is. \u201cWe\u2019re basically stuck in the \u201970s, and we know other people are, too,\u201d said Ms. Williamson, who works on the site full time. Ms. Thomas is a preschool teacher \u2014 she limits her funky endeavors to after-school hours.", "\u201cWhen we were kids growing up eating cereal in front of cartoons on Saturday mornings, we saw some of the first positive representations of black people on television,\u201d through shows like \u201cThe Jackson 5ive,\u201d Ms. Williamson said.", "Ms. Thomas said, \u201cWe were the first generation that benefited from that, and we know other people appreciate those memories and want to relive them too.\u201d But they recognize that the UnCut Funk museum is also becoming a place for serious scholarship. This is by design.", "For example, the coins. Ms. Thomas and Ms. Williamson started to promote \u201cFor the Love of Money,\u201d one of five traveling Museum of UnCut Funk shows, in response to the news that Harriet Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill in 2020. The exhibition\u2019s title is a nod to the O\u2019Jays tune.", "\u201cWe sort of realized that things have come full circle, with happy slaves being depicted picking cotton on Confederate currency just before the Civil War, to Obama\u2019s bronze medals for being the first African-American president, to Harriet Tubman being on the new 20 and Sojourner Truth having a turn on the 10 and Marian Anderson being on the 5 in 2020 \u2014 which I hope still happens,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.", "The seriousness of the museum has been recognized not just by the Museum of American Finance, but also by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, site of the first traveling show Ms. Thomas and Ms. Williamson organized, \u201cFunky Turns 40: Black Character Revolution,\u201d in 2014. A version of that show, made up mostly of the animation art, including \u201cFat Albert,\u201d later traveled to the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka, Kan., and the Bessie Smith Cultural Center in Chattanooga, Tenn. Google, too, has taken notice. The women have teamed up with Google Arts & Culture, where visitors can see more than 240 artifacts from their collection.", "The plan is to keep expanding the collection, and to keep curating and lending it. But Ms. Williamson acknowledged that there are still kinks to be worked out.", "\u201cPeople go to school to learn how to run a museum,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done any of that.

And Wall Street is using Snap to gauge whether investors will embrace other unprofitable tech companies if they go public.", "Snap has not delivered on either front. Over the past few months, the once-buzzy company has faced a litany of issues. Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app Instagram, as well other Facebook apps that have copied Snapchat\u2019s main features, have been growing more rapidly than Snapchat. In May, Snap reported disappointing earnings, its first as a public company. Its stock has since plunged well below its $17 public offering price.", "Snap will soon face a make-or-break year, said Norm Johnston, the chief strategy officer at Mindshare, a global media agency. \u201cEither it will realize its full potential by delivering growth in daily users, or it will end up as the next Twitter,\u201d the social media service that has been grappling with stalled growth, he said.", "On Thursday, Snap did little to change its trajectory when it reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street projections. The company reported a loss of 36 cents a share, versus estimates of a 33-cent loss. Revenue rose to $181.7 million, versus expectations for $185.8 million. The company recorded a wider quarterly loss than a year ago of $443.1 million, up from $115.9 million.", "User growth was a mixed bag. The user base grew by 21 percent over the past year to 173 million, which was slower than analysts had expected. But the bulk of that growth came from North America, showing that the company can still expand in highly lucrative advertising markets like the United States. The average amount of revenue made per user increased by 109 percent over the year to $1.05.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been working closely with our advertisers to improve our offerings and become a more integral part of their strategy,\u201d said Imran Khan, the chief strategy officer at Snap. He said that existing customers were also spending more money with the company.", "Snap shares fell by more than 16 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its numbers. The stock\u2019s performance is being closely watched as a measure of tech start-ups in the public markets. Snap and the online meal kit company Blue Apron, which lowered its offering price when it went public in June and is dealing with a declining stock, are casting a pall over other potential initial public offerings.", "For Snap, there have long been signs that it would face bumps as a public company. Before its I.P.O., the company said it was losing money and made no guarantee that those losses would subside. Snap also said that its user growth rate was slowing and that it did not have a firm international expansion plan.", "\u201cSnap was massively overvalued because, as a private company, it could set a valuation based on the opportunity for growth,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group.", "Evan Spiegel, a chief executive and founder, and Bobby Murphy, another founder of Snap, also maintain control of the company\u2019s voting rights. That means that no matter how dissatisfied shareholders become, they have no direct say in corporate strategy or management. If shareholders are unhappy, the only way they can make their voices heard is to sell their shares.", "Mr. Spiegel said during a call with analysts that neither he nor Mr. Murphy would sell their stock this year. \u201cWe believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.", "For a few months, Snap\u2019s stock stayed above its I.P.O. price.

Some brands are beginning to question whether Snapchat is a niche product, like Twitter, or an essential piece of their digital marketing strategy, like Facebook or Google, said several advertising buyers.", "Last month, Morgan Stanley, which helped underwrite Snap\u2019s I.P.O., issued a report on the company that questioned the measurement tools that Snap makes for advertisers. These tools are regarded as subpar compared with the ones offered by Facebook, which is important because the tools help brands determine whether an ad was effective.", "\u201cThe reality is they still lag behind most of the competition in fundamental audience targeting and measurement,\u201d said Sean Corcoran, an executive director at MullenLowe Mediahub, a digital advertising firm. Mr. Corcoran said that it was more difficult to target ads at particular Snapchat users and to measure clicks on ads in Snapchat compared with other social networks.", "Snap has introduced new tools for advertisers this year to make it easier to buy and manage ads on Snapchat.

The average user spends more than 30 minutes a day in the app. And in the most recent quarter, users under the age of 25, a demographic that advertisers covet, are spending more than 40 minutes a day in the app.", "He told analysts that it could become less costly to advertise on Snapchat, a platform that has been notoriously expensive. \u201cLower pricing is an important driver of growth at this stage,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said, and the change could get more advertisers to learn how to use Snap.", "Price has been one of several barriers that have made it hard for marketers to make a significant investment in Snapchat, said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re dropping prices,\u201d she said. \u201cNow marketers will need Snap to help them measure the performance of their ads.\u201d"]}

Yahoo spent $1.1 billion last year to acquire Tumblr, a social networking company with a strong presence in mobile.", "With the new service, Yahoo is also increasing its efforts to become a more significant player in both mobile and web-based native advertising, a newer form of online marketing generating interest \u2014 and controversy.", "When native ads appear in online publications, they are typically made to look like stories and other editorial content While publishers, including The New York Times, label native ads that appear on their sites, they have still raised concerns among some media critics about a blurring of lines between advertising and editorial.", "In the blog post announcing Yahoo Gemini, Jay Rossiter, senior vice president of Yahoo\u2019s cloud platform group and Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products, wrote that the service will give advertisers a way to \u201cget the performance and ease of search, combined with the scale and creativity of native advertising.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/technology/intels-sharp-eyed-social-scientist.html": ["Behind the gray, noise-absorbing cubicle walls at the Intel Corporation in Hillsboro, Ore., researchers who forecast the future of computing can sense her arrival.", "Reverberating down the hall comes an emphatic Australian voice and the rhythmic thwack-thwack of pointy-heeled boots on carpet.

She runs a skunk works of some 100 social scientists and designers who travel the globe, observing how people use technology in their homes and in public. The team\u2019s findings help inform the company\u2019s product development process, and are also often shared with the laptop makers, automakers and other companies that embed Intel processors in their goods.", "Some years ago, for instance, Dr. Bell\u2019s team interviewed parents in China who regarded home computers as distractions from their children\u2019s school work. Intel developed a prototype \u201cChina Home Learning PC,\u201d eventually manufactured by an Intel customer, with a key that parents could activate to prevent their children from playing online games during homework time.", "\u201cMy mandate at Intel has always been to bring the stories of everyone outside the building inside the building \u2014 and make them count,\u201d says Dr. Bell, who considers herself among the outsiders. \u201cYou have to understand people to build the next generation of technology.\u201d", "By \u201coutside,\u201d she isn\u2019t referring only to consumers outside of the United States. Dr. Bell and her team are responsible for sussing out the attributes that people everywhere love, or wish they could have, in their PCs, televisions and so on. Over the last few years, they have been concentrating on consumers\u2019 appetites for hyper-personal technology, like voice-recognition systems and fitness trackers. In essence, they are pushing Intel toward a more people-centric era of personal computing.", "Lately, that work has become all the more important to the company. That is because Intel, which has long dominated the laptop processor field, was surprisingly slow to acknowledge the burgeoning market for smartphone chips. In fact, Dr. Bell and her team, among others, had forecast the mobile trend early on, says Diane M. Bryant, the general manager of Intel\u2019s data center group, but Intel didn\u2019t prioritize it at the time. Although the company recently introduced new chips for mobile devices, PC makers are still Intel\u2019s largest customer base, accounting for $33 billion of its $52.7 billion in revenue last year.", "Now, attributable in part to the efforts of Dr. Bell and her team, Intel is trying to catch up, forging into realms like wearable gadgets that could showcase its new, lower-powered ultrasmall chips. Futurists on Dr. Bell\u2019s team are also developing a customizable personal robot, about the size of a big teddy bear, based on the new mini-chips. Where even a decade ago Intel still focused largely on turning out increasingly efficient technology for its industrial customers, its executives say, the company now looks to consumer happiness as a starting point of product development.", "\u201cWhat Genevieve and her organization have done is to shift our mind-set,\u201d Ms. Bryant says. \u201cIt takes a very different skill set, a unique domain experience, to sense the market and identify the emerging signals and what is going to matter to the end user.\u201d", "Unpacking the Car", "A few years ago, Dr. Bell was thinking about one particular end user: the car owner. If the marketing is to be believed, cars are no longer just transportation devices, but mobile entertainment systems. Ford promotes its \u201cSync\u201d in-car infotainment system with slogans like \u201cDrive Connected,\u201d \u201cDrive Personally\u201d and \u201cDrive Entertained.\u201d Audi bills its latest built-in wireless system as the \u201cconnected car future,\u201d with smoother digital maps, faster downloads and, someday soon, the ability to exchange data with \u201cparking garages and other connected cars.\u201d", "Dr. Bell has never been much impressed by such idealized visions of technology. So when those notions start to settle into conventional wisdom \u2014 like the car as a superconnected entertainment-and-communication bubble \u2014 she wants to kick the tires, so to speak. This urge is not just contrarianism. If Intel wanted to innovate for its automaker clients, Dr. Bell believed, the company would need to better understand how real people shifted back and forth between built-in technologies and the personal devices they carried into their cars.", "So Dr. Bell and Alexandra Zafiroglu, a fellow Intel anthropologist, set off on an expedition. They traveled around the world, examining, logging and photographing the contents of people\u2019s cars.", "In a typical encounter, the pair found themselves in an underground parking lot in Singapore, where a man named Frank had agreed to let them scour his new white Volvo S.U.V. They searched his car methodically from the glove compartment to the trunk, removing each object they found and placing it on a beige shower curtain that they had spread out next to his car.", "Soon, the plastic curtain was covered with all manner of tech gear: iPods, calculators, a Bluetooth headset, a collection of CDs and DVDs, remote controls for the car\u2019s DVD players, wireless headphones and a detachable GPS system, plus manuals for all of the electronics. There were also personal items: umbrellas, golf clubs, credit cards, toys, candy, hand sanitizer, a small Buddha given to Frank by his mother, and an anti-slip pad on which the Buddha rested. When they had finished the car excavation, Dr. Bell climbed up a stepladder and photographed the spread.", "As they traveled from country to country, asking drivers about how they used every object in their cars, the pair developed a messier counternarrative to the tech-idealized version. Although carmakers have embedded voice-command systems and the like in their vehicles with the idea of reducing distracted driving, the researchers found that when drivers were bored in traffic, they often picked up their hand-held personal devices anyway.", "\u201cWhat became clear was a couple of things: how much technology people bring to cars, how much they were ignoring the technology that was built in, and how much that technology was failing them,\u201d Dr. Bell says.", "This more grounded, nuanced view of driver behavior served as a reality check for Intel and its clients. Last fall, Intel announced a collaboration with Jaguar Land Rover to develop, among other things, better ways for consumers to sync their personal devices with their cars. Intel has a similar effort with Toyota, to develop user-interaction systems involving voice, gesture and touch.", "The goal is to make built-in technology more seamless and supersede a driver\u2019s reflex to reach for a hand-held device.", "Irritant in the Industrial Oyster", "Dr. Bell was teaching in the Stanford anthropology department in 1998 when a technology entrepreneur she met in a Palo Alto bar suggested that she apply for a job at Intel.", "At the time, the company already had a handful of social scientists on staff. But executives had been looking for an anthropologist to conduct research into how people used technology in their homes. (Today, companies like IBM, Microsoft and Google also employ social scientists, in-house or as consultants, who specialize in applied anthropology.)", "During her job interview, Dr. Bell apprised her would-be bosses that she couldn\u2019t see herself fitting in at Intel. After all, she wasn\u2019t a technologist, she didn\u2019t do PowerPoint, she used a Mac and she was, she told them, a \u201cradical feminist and an unreconstructed neo-Marxist.\u201d She was hired.", "On her first day at work, Dr. Bell recounts, her new boss told her that the company wanted her help with two realms: women and \u201cR.O.W.\u201d \u2014 for \u201crest of world\u201d outside the United States.", "Dr. Bell was well-suited to the task. She spent much of her childhood on aboriginal settlements in the north and west of Australia, where her mother, an anthropologist, was doing field work. Young Genevieve learned aboriginal survival skills such as how to squeeze a drink out of Australian water-holding frogs. (\u201cIt\u2019s a one-way ticket for the frog to nonfrogness,\u201d Dr. Bell notes.) It was an education in both feeling like an outsider herself and empathizing with outsider groups.", "At Intel, Dr. Bell started taking research trips around the world to see how consumers used technology in their kitchens and living rooms, at sports events and religious observances. After she and her colleagues returned, they printed posters with the photographs and comments of people they had interviewed, posting them around Intel\u2019s offices. Employees were so interested in the images, she recalls, that there were bottlenecks in the hallways.", "She also discovered that Intel engineers were more welcoming of naysayers than many professors she had encountered.", "\u201cAt Stanford, they didn\u2019t like it when you told the faculty they were dead wrong, whereas here, that was a cultural value,\u201d Dr. Bell explains. \u201cHere I would say, \u2018You are dead wrong and here are 17 reasons why and six data sources,\u2019 and they would say, \u2018That\u2019s very interesting; tell me more.\u2019 \u201d", "Even her appearance is a self-conscious provocation. In a corporate culture engendered by male engineers, and still dominated by them, Dr. Bell sees flaunting her otherness as part of the job description.", "\u201cSome things I do quite deliberately,\u201d she told me. \u201cI wear French perfume. I wear heels. I dress like I am actually female.\u201d", "Sixteen years after Dr. Bell, now 46, arrived at Intel, she continues to nudge, contradict and challenge perceptions. But now she leads her own research enterprise. Still, it can be hard to describe precisely what Dr. Bell herself does, because she tends to favor open-ended research questions that don\u2019t have an immediately obvious practical payoff. Newspaper articles \u2014 with headlines like \u201cTechnology\u2019s Foremost Fortune Teller\u201d \u2014 have portrayed her as an oracle with magical predictive powers.", "But over several months of conversations, I came to think of her more as Intel\u2019s in-house foil, the company contrarian, an irritant in an industrial oyster shell.", "\u201cShe is not afraid to voice her opinion thoughtfully and forcefully; she\u2019s not afraid to tell you how wrong you are,\u201d says Tad Hirsch, an assistant professor of interaction design at the University of Washington in Seattle who used to work with her. \u201cShe credits it to being Australian, which is partially true. But part of it is just Genevieve.\u201d", "Celebrating Presence", "A man and a woman sat at different tables in a mock coffee shop set up on a San Francisco stage for a recent talk by Dr. Bell.", "Before each was an open dual-screen laptop \u2014 one screen facing toward the user in the usual way, the other facing outward for public viewing. An audience of Intel developers watched as the pair, two actors hired for the occasion, demonstrated some technology-enabled flirtation.", "On the exterior surface of his laptop, the man posted a message in big white letters: \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d", "The woman typed a reply: \u201cAre you hitting on me?\u201d", "\u201cYep,\u201d he posted.", "Intel\u2019s business remains heavily rooted in the laptop market. Last year, in a bid to make laptops more relevant, Dr. Bell\u2019s lab designed prototype software on a TaiChi, a dual-screen notebook computer made by Asus, an Intel customer. The program lets people post photos and text messages of up to 140 characters on the exterior laptop screens. The goal was to encourage real-time communication between people who are in the same place at the same time, offering a physical complement to virtual networks like Facebook and Twitter.", "\u201cWhat would it be to have technology that celebrated presence, not absence, that grounded you in being in that place, not being somewhere else?\u201d Dr. Bell says of the impetus for the project.", "Members of her team tested the program, called \u201cPersonal Billboard,\u201d in cafes around Portland and Seattle. They discovered that passers-by were initially wary; they would glance quickly at the screens, then look away. But if researchers posted a question \u2014 like \u201cWhat did you read today?\u201d or, \u201cDo you think Nordstrom has good customer service?\u201d \u2014 strangers would start talking to one another.", "The researchers also tested it on a group of 14-year-old girls, who used it for hours to trash-talk with one another across a table. Eventually, the girls asked if they could have a sleepover at the testing facility because they wanted to keep playing with the second-screen messaging.", "\u201cWe keep talking about how technology is destroying social activity,\u201d says Dr. Bell, sitting in her office. \u201cIt was reassuring that, when you give people technology that reinforces presentness, they embrace it.\u201d", "Right now, however, Personal Billboard is experimental \u2014 a demonstration to computer makers that the company is exploring ways to reposition the laptop as a social interaction device. But, with so many people now more compelled by mobile devices, the software may never appear in consumer laptops. Or it could recur in a different incarnation: on dual-screen smartphones.", "A Robot Named Jimmy", "On the way to a restaurant near her office on a cold day, Dr. Bell slipped on a pink, knitted, conical hat with feathers erupting from the top.", "\u201cI don\u2019t just have a hat. I have an award-winning aboriginal beanie,\u201d she said, explaining that the hat won a design competition in Alice Springs, in central Australia. \u201cAnd those are emu feathers,\u201d she said, pointing to the top of the hat.", "In a corporation that venerates high-tech engineering, Dr. Bell often expresses her affinity for tactile, low-tech objects. And she makes a concerted effort to inhabit tech-free zones. She loves swimming because, she says, \u201cnobody can call me.\u201d", "Dr. Bell tends to be indifferent to the blinking lights of the latest gadgetry. What fascinates her is a pattern, which has repeated itself over the centuries, of society\u2019s initial embrace of a new invention, often followed by what she terms \u201cmoral panic\u201d and then, eventually, by widespread adoption. That was the trajectory of home electrification and of passenger cars. Even the 1950s introduction of the Princess rotary phone, marketed to teenage girls for use in their bedrooms, Dr. Bell says, prompted concerns like \u201cWould it lead to licentious phone calls?\u201d", "Lately, she has been reflecting on a more contemporary issue: anxiety over the possibility of intelligent, sensate computers that might take on a life of their own. In 1818, she notes, the publication of \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d by Mary Shelley, stoked fears that inventions might come to life and kill us \u2014 a theme that later recurred in films like \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d", "It\u2019s relevant again now, she says. With the advent of the Internet of Things, an increasing number of objects, like thermostats and traffic lights, are being outfitted with sensor chips that can collect and transmit information about their environments. Dr. Bell sees these connected objects as harbingers of devices that will have relationships, rather than mere interactions, with people.", "As in the past, fiction often precedes fact. Consider the movie \u201cHer,\u201d in which a computer operating system named Samantha becomes the caretaker, companion and, eventually, the virtual paramour of Theodore, a human lonely heart.", "\u201cMaybe the Internet of Things will be about delighting us or taking care of us, not traffic lights,\u201d Dr. Bell mused over lunch with Brian David Johnson, a futurist in her lab.", "Mr. Johnson is leading a project to develop a personal robot, named Jimmy, that would relate to people as individuals. White and curvaceous, Jimmy is a knee-high customizable system \u2014 like a mobile phone on legs \u2014 onto which consumers could download apps. \u201cJimmy is a computational platform that can walk around,\u201d Mr. Johnson explained. \u201cThere\u2019s enough computational power to sense what your mood is, where you are, an understanding that is relationship-based.\u201d", "Jimmy is meant to show Intel\u2019s corporate customers what its design thinking \u2014 and chips \u2014 can accomplish. But it is also rooted in Dr. Bell\u2019s belief that the future of computing is in personalized, people-centric devices. In fact, Intel plans to make the software public this spring so that people with access to 3-D printers can create their own Jimmys. \u201cUltimately, it will be about people stuff,\u201d Dr. Bell says, \u201cand Jimmy makes the people stuff readily apparent.\u201d", "Even so, Dr. Bell is the first to say that she is no tech oracle:", "\u201cTen years from now, do we think people will still want to talk to each other? Yes. Will they still want to share cat pictures? Yes. Will they still want to tell bad jokes? Yes. Will people want a camera on their person? Probably,\u201d she conjectures. \u201cWhat will that look like?\u201d She shrugs.", "Dr. Bell was hurrying home to pack for a trip to Australia. Before she decamped, she donned a down coat and the award-winning aboriginal beanie and picked up that near-extinct mobile device, a BlackBerry. \u201cI am firmly in the present,\u201d she said as she headed toward the exit. \u201cBut, sometimes, I want to drag the future here and see if we want it.\u201d"], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/outrage-over-wall-st-pay-but-shrugs-for-silicon-valley/": ["", "Take Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive and current chairman of Google.

The bank\u2019s board awarded Mr. Dimon $20 million in pay for 2013, $18.5 million of which was in restricted stock that vests over three years.", "In doing so, the JPMorgan board stated that the award was justified because of JPMorgan\u2019s \u201csustained long-term performance; gains in market share and customer satisfaction; and the regulatory issues the company has faced and the steps the company has taken to resolve those issues.\u201d", "While JPMorgan may be hogging the regulatory limelight at the moment, other Wall Street banks have faced that glare and have been questioned about their chief executives\u2019 compensation. Total pay for Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, no stranger to regulatory scrutiny, has not yet been disclosed, but he was recently awarded $14 million in stock. Once his cash bonus is announced, Mr. Blankfein will probably be paid an amount similar to Mr. Dimon\u2019s.", "Like JPMorgan\u2019s board, Goldman\u2019s board has sought to justify such pay and is criticized just the same.", "This double standard for finance and technology doesn\u2019t make sense.", "For one, the outsize pay for Mr. Schmidt doesn\u2019t square with Google\u2019s performance. Putting aside the fact that he is not even the chief executive, Google had net income of $12.9 billion last year.

As for Comcast, the Time Warner Cable deal would be its second big act to radically reshape the media landscape in the United States \u2014 the company completed its acquisition of NBC Universal less than a year ago.

Even my 70-year-old mother, whose response to new technology sometimes resembles that of a cornered animal, now lets me use Square Cash when I owe her money.", "Something this good probably can\u2019t endure in its current form, and the catch here is that each transaction costs Square a bit of money even though it\u2019s collecting no revenue. The cost comes from the fact that it\u2019s pushing the payments over the debit card rails that Visa and MasterCard own, and a number of toll collectors get money along the way.", "This sort of electronic movement of money is not new.

You open a blank email message and fill out the \u201cto\u201d field.

It promises that the money will land in one or two business days, but it sometimes happens faster.", "If you want to send more than $250 in a week, Square will want a bit more information from you. There are two ways to go here. First, you can let the company look at your Facebook profile as a friend would, and also hand over the last four digits of your Social Security number. Or you can give Square your full name, date of birth and those same four Social Security digits. Once you do that, you can send up to $2,500 each week.

Ron Mazursky, who directs the debit advisory service for the consulting firm Mercator, expects some tighter constraints. Perhaps Square Cash will be free only for the first year. Or there will be limits on the number of transactions, or charges for higher amounts.", "Right now, Square Cash works only in the United States, but plenty of people have problems moving money from one country to another. The service might be able to help them, and charge less for the privilege than banks or Western Union.", "Then there are possibilities that may be more tantalizing to Square. It would, after all, like more and bigger retailers to use its tools in their stores. \u201cThe only way to generate real revenue is to go up the food chain and say to retailers, \u2018Look, if you implement our system, we\u2019ll bring users to you,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Schatt said.", "With a pile of email addresses from Square Cash users, the company is just one step away from trying to entice us to download its mobile wallet application. Perhaps merchants would sweeten the pitch with discounts.

However, it was not until in 2004, while researching an article for his portal on Indian cinema, Upperstall, that he discovered the director of both films was an American, Ellis R. Dungan.", "He ended up writing an article about the director for the website, but thoughts about Mr. Dungan\u2019s adventures kept recurring as he puzzled over why an American would spend 15 years in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu to make movies during the 1930s and1940s.", "Around 2009-10, Mr. Bali had the idea of making a documentary of Mr. Dungan\u2019s life in India, but it was only after he watched several of Mr. Dungan\u2019s films \u2014 including \u201cAmbikapathy (1937), regarded one of the greatest hits of pre-independence Tamil cinema, and \u201cPonmudi\u201d (1949), which was a commercial failure but was notable for its extremely intimate scenes, a novelty in Tamil cinema at the time \u2014 that he decided to make the documentary \u201cAn American in Madras.\u201d", "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the documentary to simply be a curio piece about a gora or vellaikaran (white man) making Tamil films,\u201d said Mr. Bali, 45, in an email interview from Mumbai. \u201cThe films showed me that while he didn\u2019t deviate from the themes of the films being made then, it was his cinematic treatment in several sequences that made Dungan stand out from the theatrical quality of many of the films I had seen of the period.\u201d", "The documentary, which is screening at the Mumbai International Film Festival on Thursday, traces Mr. Dungan\u2019s career in the Tamil-language film industry, whose center was in Madras, now known as Chennai. He ended up making 13 feature films, 11 in Tamil and one each in Telugu and Hindi, of which only five prints survive.", "\u201cHis story was never really known except maybe to a few film historians, film scholars and lovers of old Tamil cinema,\u201d Mr. Bali said. \u201cIt had to be brought to light, and I\u2019m glad I was able to do so.\u201d", "Mr. Dungan visited Madras in 1935 at the invitation of a classmate from the University of Southern California, where Mr. Dungan had studied filmmaking. Intending to stay six months, he spent almost 15 years in India, revolutionizing the Tamil-language film industry in the process.", "\u201cI definitely felt he played an important role in helping to technically develop the then fledgling Tamil film industry and that had to be acknowledged and documented,\u201d says Mr. Bali. \u201cFor example, sequences like visually showing Ambikapathy\u2019s life flashing before his eyes as he is about to be executed, or the transition of the young Meera to a grown-up Meera during the song \u2018Nandabala,\u2019 or even using the day-for-night technique to make the sun a moon in \u2018Manthiri Kumari\u2019 \u2013 all these were great technical achievements for their time.\u201d", "Mr. Dungan\u2019s visual treatment, mobility of his camera, his frequent use of outdoor locales, his proper blocking of scenes and his strong female characters also made his films stand out, Mr. Bali said, even if the plots were nothing new.", "Mr. Dungan managed to carve out a special place for himself within the insular Tamil film industry. \u201cWhile there were other foreign directors working at the same time in India like German, Franz Osten, who made films at Bombay Talkies, Osten worked with his own familiar crew of German technicians while Dungan had to make do with the locals. In that sense, I rate Dungan\u2019s achievements higher,\u201d said Mr. Bali.", "Mr. Bali\u2019s research led him to Mr. Dungan\u2019s 2001 autobiography, \u201cA Guide to Adventure,\u201d co-written with Barbara Smik. \u201cThe book opened up for me not just details about Dungan\u2019s filmmaking in the Tamil industry, but also his other work in India like his working as the official photographer for the British government or photographing some of India\u2019s most historic events around the period of her independence,\u201d he said.", "After researching for a couple of years, Mr. Bali started making the documentary in April 2012, with the help of a school friend who helped finance it. (Mr. Bali declined to reveal how much it cost to make the film.)", "One of the biggest challenges was finding archival footage from the works of Mr. Dungan, who died in Wheeling, W.Va, in 2001. Among his feature films, only \u201cAmbikapathy,\u201d \u201cSakuntalai,\u201d made in 1940, \u201cMeera,\u201d both in Tamil and Hindi, and \u201cManthiri Kumari\u201d are preserved at the National Film Archive of India in Pune.", "Through Google, Mr. Bali found the email address for Ms. Smik, Mr. Dungan\u2019s co-author. She directed Mr. Bali to the West Virginia State Archives in the United States, where Mr. Dungan had donated all his archival material.", "\u201cThey were most helpful in providing me with the material they had. Most of the photographs and Dungan\u2019s documentary films, \u2018In a South Indian Village\u2019 and \u2018Tiger Shikar in India,\u2019 have come from there,\u201d said Mr. Bali. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic. These are films made by Dungan in India about India, but we don\u2019t have their prints.\u201d", "Another major challenge was finding anything with ties to the American director. All of the studios that employed Mr. Dungan had disappeared, and only a handful of people who had direct connections to Mr. Dungan were still alive.", "Among these people, Mr. Bali and his crew interviewed C.M. Muthu, the makeup assistant in \u201cSakuntalai\u201d and \u201cMeera,\u201d and Radha Viswanathan, an actor who played the young Meera in \u201cMeera\u201d and was also in \u201cSakuntalai.\u201d The popular Tamil actor Kamal Hassan and the Tamil film historian S. Theodore Baskaran provided historical context. Mr. Bali also tracked down some extremely rare footage of Mr. Dungan on the sets of his first three films in 1935 and 1936.", "The film had its premiere at the LV Prasad Film and TV Academy auditorium in Chennai on Dec. 1, the anniversary of Mr. Dungan\u2019s death. Then it was screened at the Chennai International Film Festival on Dec. 14 and at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Bangalore in January.", "Mr. Bali is taking his film on the festival circuit to drum up more interest so he can get a distribution deal.", "\u201cI\u2019m trying to see if we can screen the film in Wheeling, U.S.A., where Dungan lived, on May 11th, his birthday,\u201d Mr. Bali said. \u201cThat would be really special.\u201d", "Visi Tilak is a freelance journalist based in Boston."], "https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/morning-agenda-a-silver-lining-in-bitcoins-stumble/": ["BITCOIN\u2019S SILVER LINING  |  The apparent collapse of Mt.

Most of these posters are plastered over within an hour, so there is a short window of opportunity to make an impact.", "When introducing Posse, we designed notices that resembled the typical lost animal posters that people use when a cat or dog has gone astray. We found the funniest looking animals we could and displayed them in the center of the poster with a prompt for people to find the best places to eat, drink and shop. We photocopied a few hundred of these in black and white, designed to look cheap and homemade (which they were) and stuck them up the next morning at 7, all around the conference center.

For a few weeks after her third child was born, she had checked into one of Seoul\u2019s newly popular postnatal spa-hotels, which offers daily massages, lactation help, 24-hour infant care and luxurious, quiet rooms.", "But Arcadia, the most confident person I knew in high school, had never been to a jimjilbang before, in part because even she had been intimidated by the prospect of silent judgment. \u201cThis is where mothers take their daughters-in-law to check out the marital packages,\u201d she said, only half-joking.", "Last year on a family trip to Japan, my husband, daughter and I visited Hoshinoya Karuizawa, a resort in the mountains northwest of Tokyo that turns bathing into an experience of minimalist splendor. We soaked for hours each day, moving silently through pools devoted to meditation, immersing ourselves in wooden baths filled with kumquats, and watching Japanese families relax in outdoor pools that mimicked mountain streams. The Hoshino chain, with its contemporary versions of traditional Japanese ryokans, or inns, is an example of Japan\u2019s genius for preserving its culture while marketing it to outsiders \u2014 a skill that Korea, for all of its energy and success, still largely lacks. In Tokyo, we also visited more modest bathhouses, neighborhood joints with vending machines and large-screen TVs in the lobbies. But even those places carried a glow of cleanliness and serenity: the bath as Shinto-Buddhist ritual.", "Korean jimjilbangs are their cousins, newer versions of the public bathhouses that became popular during Japanese rule, and some of the facilities look the same in the two countries, down to the little stations where you rinse yourself before immersing in hot medicinal pools. But going to a jimjilbang in South Korea can be like having a shvitz and a bath at a mall \u2014 in some cases, a mall that is on a cruise ship. The most elaborate jimjilbangs are multistory, self-contained universes with magic shows, Korean barbecue restaurants and corporate team retreats. (According to one Korean expression, you\u2019re not really friends with someone until you\u2019ve bathed together naked in a jimjilbang.) A popular TV variety show even has a regular segment set in a jimjilbang called, \u201cDon\u2019t Laugh in the Sauna.\u201d The host asks celebrity guests nosy questions in a funny accent, and if they laugh, they are doused with water.", "Based on my visits to bathhouses in three cities \u2014 just a few of the thousands of facilities spread across the country \u2014 this is what you\u2019ll find: admission to a jimjilbang is almost always cheap, less than $10 for a locker, as much soaking and sauna-going as you can manage, and a cotton uniform that imposes Confucian conformity, in some cases making everyone look like a character on \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d Little is in English, so wandering around is bewildering fun: You are likely to see saunas inspired by Egyptian pyramids; little heating coils, the kind you see in toasters, built into the floor; and salt rock rooms said to draw toxins out of the body. The facilities are generally clean but rarely posh, and often filled with passed-out bodies \u2014 living, snoring symbols of a country so overworked that it switched from a six- to a five-day workweek only a decade ago. Couples intertwine on the heated floors, seeking the kind of privacy in public space that they can\u2019t have at home, where living spaces are small and many young people live with their parents longer than in the United States.", "Jimjilbangs around the country vary in their exact amenities: Dragonhill Spa in Seoul, where Arcadia and I were scrubbed, is kitschy and a little dingy but popular, especially with those who pass out there overnight after an evening of heavy drinking. In Busan, South Korea\u2019s second-largest city, the Shinsegae department store has a far sleeker jimjilbang, with gleaming wood surfaces and a \u201cwave dream\u201d room that simulates the feeling of being in deep water. Near Suncheon, also in the south, I visited a jimjilbang in a bamboo forest with a \u201cgroundhog sauna\u201d that gently warms your body while leaving your head exposed to the winter sunshine and mountain mist.", "One morning in Daejeon, an unremarkable-looking city in the center of the country, I ducked into a drab office building housing a jimjilbang that seemed like a hidden water world. Before entering the baths, you\u2019re supposed to shower, but not in the American sense. A Korean shower is a top-to-bottom exercise involving cascades of suds, dental floss and sustained scrubbing. Several women in their 20s and 30s were gently washing their mothers, vigorously but with a tenderness that conveyed generational respect. I moved from one pool to another, glancing back at them: 20 minutes later, they were still scrubbing, the older women\u2019s skin now bright pink. As I dried off and left, the daughters were still at work. The place wasn\u2019t anything special, which is why it seemed so special indeed.", "Ask a young Korean woman what beauty routine she follows and she will probably tell you that she is a bad person to ask, that she doesn\u2019t buy into the national quest for self-beautification. O.K., she sometimes goes for a treatment in which her face is kneaded and pinched, supposedly making it tighter and slimmer. She gets her eyeliner tattooed on every few months, she will admit. To lose weight and tighten up, she buys 10-packs of sessions in which her lower body is pummeled in ways that are supposed to make it firmer. She uses BB cream (a supercharged tinted moisturizer), three kinds of cleanser on her skin and another moisturizer made with snail mucus for its healing and anti-aging properties. Her scalp dries out in winter, so she goes for treatments with aestheticians who track its moisture level with magnified images, like X-rays at the dentist. But really, she will tell you, that\u2019s nothing compared with what her girlfriends do.", "In the American ideal, beauty is supposed to look effortless, a sun-kissed woman without a hint of makeup glowing on a California beach. But in Korea, like so much else in a country that lifted itself from poverty to prosperity in a few exhausting decades, beauty is associated with hard work. When the beauty magnate Helena Rubenstein decreed that \u201cthere are no ugly women, only lazy ones,\u201d she could have been peddling stem-cell cream at one of Korea\u2019s massive department stores. One morning in Seoul, I showed up for a manicure at a nail place in Gangnam, the flush neighborhood made famous by the Psy song, lined with luxury cars and ritzy salons. The proprietor took one look at my nails, which were nowhere near a personal low, and gasped in apparent horror.", "Before my trip, I had heard about the sheer fun of shopping in Korea, and once I started browsing the beauty stores, I understood what everyone had meant. The beautifully packaged products could keep you busy for weeks fixing problems you never knew you had: \u201cshiny foot super peeling liquid\u201d for dry patches, face masks in flavors from chestnut shell to charcoal, milk packs, mung packs, nose packs and body-firming patches in flavors like \u201cmountain zone.\u201d I bought a liquid eyeliner brush for $3.50 that worked better than the ones that cost four times as much at home and cunning little razors that trim eyebrows with less pain than tweezing.", "My favorite store was Etude House, a pink fever dream filled with inventive products in playful packaging, geared to teenagers and 20-somethings but owned by the Korean beauty powerhouse Amore Pacific. The idea at Etude House is that makeup is a form of play, and so every store is designed to look like a life-size doll house, filled with toylike cosmetics: hand cream in dispensers shaped like cute animals and face masks with tongue-in-cheek promises to make you look like a black-and-white film star.", "One evening, I dropped into a salon for eyelash extensions, drifting off to sleep as a woman with gentle, precise hands glued lashes on top of my own. The same service was available in New York, but it was far cheaper in Korea, and being there had gotten me into the spirit. I woke up endowed with a gift nature had never given me, amazed at what a little money and time could do.", "Since I had only one girlfriend in the entire country, I borrowed two others: Yaeri Song, the founder of the website Seoulist, and Violet Haeun Kim, a freelance writer. Both had spent their lives zigzagging between Korea and the United States, and over dinner in Hongdae, Seoul\u2019s pulsing student neighborhood, we talked about how living in Korea has changed the way they look at themselves and others.", "\u201cWhen I lived in New York, I had one lotion,\u201d Yaeri said, laughing. Now, when she meets New Yorkers in their late 20s, she tends to think at first that they are a decade older. In Seoul, \u201ceveryone just looks younger,\u201d she said.", "As they talked, I realized tourists have an advantage over Koreans when it comes to their beauty culture: We can enjoy a few adventures and purchases and then fly home, away from the punishing standards that Korean women have to live with. Even though Yaeri is married, she still sometimes flinches at the scrutiny. \u201cKorea is the first place I\u2019ve ever been told by a guy that my pores are really big,\u201d Yaeri said.", "I had passed too many plastic surgery clinics to count in Seoul, including some with revealing names (\u201cSecond Coming\u201d). Subway entrances are covered in before-and-after ads for the procedures; one shows a wedding ring in the \u201cafter\u201d picture. Some women \u201cjust get plastic surgery, so they don\u2019t have to deal with the treatments,\u201d Violet said.", "Looks are expected to be so homogeneous in Korea that many women\u2019s clothes have no sizes, explained Charlotte Cho, founder of Soko Glam, which sells Korean beauty products to American women. The same silhouettes are expected to fit everyone. Comedians and grade-schoolers get laughs for making fun of anyone who looks different, with darker skin or unusual facial features. There is no cute disheveled look in Seoul: \u201cKorean people want perfection,\u201d Ms. Cho said. Women with small faces are often told that they should be celebrities, because that feature is so prized.", "All of this brings up questions for American travelers, likely to raise their eyebrows at the Korean beauty products that offer \u201cwhitening\u201d effects, as if that was something that every woman would want or need. I asked my dinner companions a hypothetical question I had posed to others during my trip. My closest Korean-American friend back in Brooklyn is married to my husband\u2019s college roommate, who is African-American. Would my friends feel entirely comfortable in Seoul, with its jokes about anyone who doesn\u2019t conform?", "The women chose their words carefully. Korea was becoming less close-minded, they said. But they could not promise that my friends would not be subject to stares, especially outside Seoul; the country was still learning to tolerate and appreciate difference. \u201cI would hesitate to invite a friend who is overweight to visit Korea,\u201d Yaeri said.", "On my final day, I reunited with Arcadia for a trip to my favorite jimjilbang of the journey: Spa Lei, a women\u2019s-only facility with pretty robes instead of uniforms and even a little clothing shop, attended by a young woman who was taking selfies every time we passed, utterly lost in the way she looked. Signs offered herbal steam baths for women\u2019s private parts; we stuck to the jet baths. That afternoon, a colleague took me to the Dongdaemun market, where I spent a happy hour and an absurdly small amount of money on Korean costume jewelry, as cheap and appealing as the beauty products.", "My backpack was heavy with creams and potions for friends back home, most of them just for laughs. I had already been using the snail cream, which felt like a stickier version of regular face cream, and my skin really did seem softer and less battered by winter. I bought one last ridiculous-sounding product at the airport \u2014 a bottle of skin-balancing water \u2014 and boarded a Korean Air jet, looking with new eyes at the flight attendants\u2019 neat black buns and pale, dewy faces."], "https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/today-in-small-business-million-dollar-tweets/": ["", "What\u2019s affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners today?", "Social Media", "\u2022 Like it or not, employees can say what they want on social media.", "\u2022 How a start-up finds million-dollar tweets for businesses.", "Marketing", "\u2022 A national survey indicates that the \u201cbuy local\u201d message is boosting customer traffic and improving the outlook on Main Street.", "Health Care", "\u2022 The White House announces another delay in the employer mandate.", "\u2022 The Affordable Care Act is entering mainstream American life as major corporations, sports teams and others integrate it into their businesses.", "\u2022 And private health insurance exchanges have benefits for employers.", "The Economy", "\u2022 The Treasury secretary said he was taking two extraordinary measures to avoid hitting the debt limit.", "\u2022 The Conference Board Employment Index strengthened again.", "\u2022 Jim Cramer puts on his business-owner\u2019s hat to make some stock picks.", "\u2022 Shrimp prices are hurting Red Lobster.", "Management", "\u2022 Steven Mufson explains the workings of Downtonomics and says the fictional estate\u2019s troubles echo in the modern world.", "\u2022 Rhonda Abrams recommends Botox for some business owners: \u201cIn today\u2019s business world, your face is an increasingly important business asset.\u201d", "\u2022 Part of the role of an entrepreneur is to be an ideas generator, says one writer, so it\u2019s important to make time to think.", "\u2022 A business owner discusses the less glamorous side of entrepreneurship.", "\u2022 Here is a list of the most philanthropic entrepreneurs of 2013.", "\u2022 Here are three reasons you may never be super successful.", "More Bitcoin", "\u2022 Bitcoin\u2019s prices plunge as technical problems persist.", "\u2022 Microsoft adds a Bitcoin currency converter to Bing.", "Taxes", "\u2022 Kelly Spors offers a small-business tax season survival guide.", "Employees", "\u2022 Here are 11 jobs that are common only in romantic comedies.", "\u2022 Here are 37 ways to motivate employees.", "\u2022 An actor who played McGruff the Crime Dog is sentenced for pot and weapons offenses.", "\u2022 Barnes & Noble fires its Nook engineers.", "\u2022 This is why Volkswagen is helping a union organize a plant.", "Online", "\u2022 Facebook forms a small-business council.", "\u2022 Yahoo announces a partnership with Yelp on local search.", "\u2022 Sites that offer themselves up as alternatives to Google are seeing increased traffic.", "Around the Country", "\u2022 A restaurant owner in Oklahoma who doesn\u2019t want to serve gay people is surprised to find that his business is now promoted as a gay club on Yelp.", "\u2022 Exelon is considering closing nuclear power plants in the Midwest because they have become unprofitable.", "\u2022 A Philadelphia entrepreneur/activist\u2019s latest venture combines a coffee and copy shop.", "\u2022 Here are the most innovative companies in Hollywood.", "\u2022 An appearance on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d results in a \u201cfreak\u201d wave of growth for a homespun Delaware business.", "\u2022 An Oregon business owner gives some advice on how to shovel a sidewalk.", "Technology", "\u2022 New York City\u2019s police are planning to use Google Glass.", "\u2022 The data breach at Target may have started with the hacking of the store\u2019s refrigeration, heating and air-conditioning subcontractor.", "\u2022 These are the 16 most interesting things Bill Gates said in his Reddit A.M.A.", "\u2022 Marc Andreessen likes an app called Slack: \u201cI have never seen a business app go viral like this.\u201d", "Gene Marks owns the Marks Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., a consulting firm that helps clients with customer relationship management.

Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s incoming chief executive, faces some urgent questions: Does the Nokia deal still make sense? And how does Microsoft expect to survive, let alone prosper, in a cutthroat hardware market where Google is giving up?", "The basic problem for Microsoft is that most consumers have already chosen an operating system.", "\u201cGoogle has won,\u201d said Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at the Stern School of Business of New York University, and currently a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in network economics and electronic commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re in a world where the biggest market share by far is Android. And the second-biggest is Apple. Then, way behind, is Microsoft. What\u2019s in this game for Microsoft?\u201d", "From Microsoft\u2019s perspective, the answer may be that it is in a different war \u2014 one that isn\u2019t over handsets or even the operating systems embedded in them, but the ecosystem of applications and services that sit on top of them. And if that\u2019s the case, Microsoft had little choice but to double down on Nokia and its handsets, since the alternative would be worse.", "In an email to Microsoft employees on Feb. 4, his first day as chief executive, Mr. Nadella said, \u201cOur job is to ensure that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and cloud-first world.\u201d", "It\u2019s hard to imagine how Microsoft could be \u201cmobile and cloud-first\u201d without mobile.", "Microsoft\u2019s \u201cobjective is to get to the point where Windows phones would be able to use Microsoft software and applications for PCs and tablets,\u201d Professor Economides said. \u201cIf they can get there, that would be a huge win.

It was also behind both Huawei (16.6 million) and Lenovo (13.6 million).", "In its last earnings report as a handset manufacturer, Nokia said last month that the handset division it was selling to Microsoft lost 201 million euros in the fourth quarter and sales fell 29 percent. Microsoft has said it needs to sell 50 million Lumia units a year to break even, and it is nowhere near that yet.", "Google seems to have made only a halfhearted effort in its foray into handsets, but its numbers were also grim. Under Google, Motorola had operating losses of $1.1 billion in 2012 and $645 million for the first nine months of 2013.", "But analysts I interviewed said Microsoft may not have the luxury that Google did of abandoning a money-losing handset operation. \u201cMicrosoft doesn\u2019t have the same hand to play as Google,\u201d said Ken Sena, the Evercore analyst who covers Google. Unlike Microsoft, Google does not have to worry about its ecosystem since Android is the largest handset operating system by far. Android ensures access for Google\u2019s search engine, which is where Google earns the bulk of its profit. Selling Motorola to Lenovo will strengthen a growing competitor to Samsung, even as it gets Google out of a business that put it in the awkward position of competing with some of its largest customers.", "Without Nokia\u2019s commitment to Windows, Microsoft was in danger of extinction on handsets. And Microsoft does not really have to worry about competing with partners who use Windows in their handsets, since there are so few.", "And at least, the deal buys Microsoft some time. \u201cMicrosoft needs to see how Windows works on a handset,\u201d Professor Economides said. \u201cHaving a division that does it for you is very useful. Otherwise you have to beg or persuade Samsung or someone else to make a Windows device. But Samsung already sells millions of Android phones, and it doesn\u2019t care about Windows.\u201d (Samsung does offer Windows on some phones and computers.)", "Then, there is Apple, which has succeeded in wringing high margins from its handset business.

WhatsApp routes its messages over the Internet, so people had to have a mobile data plan or access to Wi-Fi to use it. They also had to have a smartphone. (SMS could work on more basic phones.) But after that cost, each message over WhatsApp required such a tiny slice of mobile bandwidth that it was basically free. If you paid AT&T $25 for a two-gigabytes-a-month data plan, each WhatsApp message might cost about two ten-thousandths of a cent, according to Gizmodo\u2019s math.

Google Fiber provides high speed Internet service, though so far only in Kansas City and Provo, Utah. (It is about to begin service in Austin, Tex.)", "But such a lucky coincidence it is. Because the Wheeler and Google announcements speak directly to the aspects of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal that many people find troubling. Even though a combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable will control 30 percent of the cable television market, cable TV is not really the issue. With more and more media consumers getting their television from sources other than their cable boxes, the cable industry suddenly has actual competition.", "But Internet broadband is a different story. If the deal goes through, the combined companies will have a nearly 40 percent share of the country\u2019s Internet connections, giving rise to legitimate worries about innovation, competition, and a free and open Internet.", "Broadband, at this point, is a vital resource, akin to what landline telephony used to be. The old landlines used to be regulated as a \u201ccommon carrier,\u201d which, under the law, gave the F.C.C. enormous regulatory powers. But even though broadband pipes have similarities with the old telephone landlines, the F.C.C. has never been willing to regulate them as a common carrier, a move that would undoubtedly create a huge storm among Republicans.", "Instead, it has classified broadband as an \u201cinformation service,\u201d which requires a lighter regulatory touch. Twice it tried to erect net neutrality rules. Both times the rules were struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, most recently a month ago, on the grounds that the regulations too closely resembled common carrier regulations. But the appeals court panel also gave the agency a glimmer of hope: It said the F.C.C. could enact regulations so long as they could be justified as promoting the expansion of the network infrastructure.", "Wheeler\u2019s announcement, then, was an acknowledgment that the agency was going to try to clutch the straw it had been handed by the courts. But it is going to be a tricky business. If the rules are too heavy-handed, they\u2019ll most likely be tossed out of court again. But if they are too light, Internet service providers will find ways around them. Among people who favor net neutrality, there is a good deal of skepticism that he can pull it off.", "Meanwhile, Comcast is committed to net neutrality until 2018. (It agreed to this date as part of its deal to purchase NBCUniversal.) It also says Time Warner Cable will be bound by the 2018 date if the latest deal goes through. But what happens after that? With its size and clout it would certainly have the ability to charge companies like Netflix, which devours enormous amounts of bandwidth, to pay to get to the front of the line. And though Netflix can afford it, what happens when new companies come along that use even more bandwidth \u2014 but can\u2019t afford the ante? That is the real fear: that if Internet service providers become a tollbooth, they will wind up stifling innovation.", "Which brings us to Google Fiber. \u201cGoogle doesn\u2019t want to find itself in the position of a gold mine operating next to a monopoly railroad,\u201d says Craig Moffett, an independent media analyst. Moffett adds that there are only two ways for Google to be sure that Comcast \u2014 or any other big Internet service provider \u2014 won\u2019t become a bottleneck for its services. It can hope that Wheeler succeeds in coming up with new net neutrality regulations. Or it can create competition for Comcast, which would result not only in ensuring net neutrality, but would also most likely lead to faster Internet speeds and lower prices. Indeed, in Austin, which Google is about to invade, Time Warner Cable announced that it would greatly increase Internet speeds for no additional cost. That\u2019s the power of competition.", "I seriously doubt that the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal will be blocked by regulators. Comcast\u2019s executives are correct when they note that the two companies don\u2019t overlap in any jurisdiction, ironic though that claim is, given the quasi-monopoly status of cable companies. And I\u2019m not at all convinced that Wheeler will succeed in coming up with regulations that will both make net neutrality the law of the land and pass muster with the courts.", "I guess it\u2019s time to root for Google."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/technology/microsoft-said-to-be-close-to-naming-satya-nadella-as-chief.html": ["SEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has spent five months looking for a new face to help the company evolve along with the mobile age.

One possibility is that Mr. Gates will step down as chairman, keep his board seat and become more involved as a strategic adviser for Mr. Nadella. The board has not made a final decision on Mr. Gates, and he could remain as chairman, one of these people said.", "The move to pick Mr. Nadella as its next chief executive \u2014 he would be only the third in the company\u2019s history of almost 40 years \u2014 is a sign that Microsoft does not intend to pursue the kind of far-reaching shake-up many people within the industry have called for.", "Companies in crisis, and even those a little off-balance like Microsoft, often recruit new leaders from the outside to bring in a fresh pair of eyes, among other things.

Donahoe, the chief executive of eBay; and Paul Maritz, a former Microsoft executive who now runs a start-up called Pivotal.", "In the end though, Microsoft gravitated to Mr. Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft employee who is fluent in Microsoft\u2019s rough-and-tumble culture and comes with the kind of strong technical skills that Mr. Gates was said to favor in a new leader.", "Bloomberg reported the possible changes on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.", "One reason Mr. Nadella, 46, emerged as the board\u2019s choice is the sheer vastness of Microsoft. The company has about 100,000 employees and will add another 32,000 through its acquisition of Nokia\u2019s mobile phone business.", "And the company is already in the process of a major reorganization. Before the current chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, announced his plans to retire from Microsoft last August, the company began a significant restructuring meant to increase responsiveness to new developments in the industry, namely mobile devices, and discourage infighting between its powerful divisions.", "The board concluded that Mr. Nadella would be able to quicken the pace of new products and innovation better than someone from the outside, who would be less familiar with the company\u2019s fractious politics, one of the people with knowledge of its deliberations said. Microsoft does not have a great track record of embracing outsiders brought into executive jobs.", "\u201cMicrosoft chews up and spits out new hires in senior roles,\u201d said Charles Fitzgerald, a former strategist at Microsoft.

And it has lost billions of dollars on its efforts to compete with Google in the search business. Many Microsoft critics say the company must become more focused, perhaps by shedding businesses like its Bing search engine and Xbox game console.", "Microsoft has also faced growing pressure to return more cash to shareholders. In August, it averted a potentially nasty public fight with an activist shareholder, ValueAct, reaching an accord that gives ValueAct the right to nominate one of its executives to the Microsoft board in the coming months.", "While it is possible that Mr. Gates could step down as chairman, it does not appear that doing so would distance him from the company. He has considered changing his role on the board to free up time to advise Mr. Nadella on product and technology issues, a person with knowledge of the discussions said. Mr. Gates plans to continue his full-time responsibilities as a philanthropist.", "A spokesman for Mr. Gates declined to comment.", "There is speculation that John W. Thompson, Microsoft\u2019s lead independent director, could assume the chairman role. He might be viewed as a more friendly ambassador to investors than Microsoft\u2019s management has been in the past.", "For all of its challenges and missteps in recent years, Microsoft is far from being in dire straits. It remains highly profitable, far more than many of its industry peers, and has tens of billions of dollars in cash. While the personal computer business is in a slump, hurting recent earnings, the company\u2019s most recent financial results showed signs that Microsoft was performing better in the market for consumer devices.", "Mr. Nadella, a native of Hyderabad, India, is a popular choice internally. Most recently, he has led the enterprise software and cloud computing businesses at Microsoft, among the strongest and fastest-growing parts of the company. He joined Microsoft in 1992 from Sun Microsystems, and he has a deeper engineering background than many of the other internal candidates who have been considered.", "Many advocates for change at Microsoft say the company\u2019s leader needs stronger technical expertise than Mr. Ballmer, who has a sales background. Mr. Nadella, however, does not have a track record in consumer businesses, which are becoming a bigger part of the company\u2019s focus through its Xbox game console and Surface tablets and the Nokia mobile unit.", "Rick Devine, chief executive of TalentSky, a firm that has recruited executives for Microsoft in the past, said he believed Microsoft already had the right strategy in place to improve its position in mobile and other markets.

When the search proves fruitless, they are left with a sour taste in their mouths, instead of an unusual wine. There are two reasons for their frustration: First, wine distribution in the United States is regulated by an irrational patchwork of laws, and second, small producers often create wines that are more intriguing and distinctive but less available. Internet tools and apps can help, but they can\u2019t solve the problem. Nonetheless, consumers can take steps to increase their odds.", "I fervently wish all drinkers could find what they want. I sympathize with those who can\u2019t. But the simple solution \u2014 choosing only wines that are easy to find \u2014 is worse than the problem.", "If only it weren\u2019t so complicated. While the readership of The New York Times is global, wine distribution in the United States is splintered into 50 different systems, one for every state. Importers and distributors who do business in, say, New York and New Jersey, may not work in Ohio or Missouri. Or they may sell wine in great New York City shops like Chambers Street Wines, Flatiron Wines & Spirits or Crush Wine & Spirits, but not in shops in northern New Jersey. In Pennsylvania, a state wine board selects the bottles that stores may sell. And in many states, big chains like Costco or Safeway dominate wine sales.", "As a result, every state, maybe every municipality, offers a different selection. Factor in that wine shops have many different rationales for how they put together their inventories, and you have a complicated Venn diagram with scores of different circles and few points of intersection.", "Savio Soares, an importer whose company, Savio Soares Selections, works with many small European family estates, said it\u2019s impossible to distribute nationally the small amount of wines he receives. So he restricts his work to seven states.", "\u201cEven this way, I cannot offer the same producer in all states,\u201d he said.", "Readers have suggested solutions. \u201cCan\u2019t you publish a short list with local sources?\u201d one asked. But local for whom? Somebody who lives in the Chicago suburbs may find it reasonable to drive 30 minutes to a particular wine shop. But some Upper West Siders become upset if they can\u2019t find the bottle within walking distance on Broadway.", "Many readers suggest that I write more about wines that are widely available nationally. Such wines abound; for the most part as big, well-known brands, mass-produced and marketed by corporations. But concentrating on these big-brand wines is also a compromise that I don\u2019t wish to make.", "In December, I wrote about the trend of Champagnes made in the extra-brut style. I recommended 10 bottles based on a tasting by the Dining section\u2019s wine panel. Those wines all turned out to be somewhat obscure. We had three extra-brut Champagnes that were far more widely distributed than our favorites, but we didn\u2019t like those bottles nearly as well. Should we have included them at the expense of wines that were more distinctive and original?", "My answer is a qualified no. Perhaps it would have been useful to mention these big brands (Laurent-Perrier, Pol Roger and Ayala) so curious readers could sample the style if they wished. But consumers want our favorite wines, not the also-rans. And small-production wines, often made by family estates or the equivalent, are generally far more interesting.", "I love the way good wine is so different from other beverages. Its production is limited by the agricultural cycle. The variations each year in weather and other conditions make each vintage unique. A good wine is alive, and must be stored and handled carefully to preserve its life. It changes over time, in the glass as it is exposed to air and in the bottle as it ages. While we have learned much about the science of wine in the last century, much is still not understood. Great small producers embrace this sense of mystery. They are not after consistency but instead want their wines to reflect the nuances that make each year, even each moment, singular.", "Mass-produced wines, for the most part, reflect a vastly different agenda. Their goal is often sameness. Vintage variations are ironed out and wines stabilized so that they can be handled and stored with minimal risk. Many people value this sort of consistency, just as they may prefer to stop at a familiar franchise restaurant rather than seek out an unknown cafe. To each his own.", "\u201cI want my customers to seek out small-production wines made with integrity, from both imported and domestic producers,\u201d said Jill Bernheimer, a proprietor of Domaine LA, an excellent shop in Los Angeles. \u201cI love when they come in looking for something that is made on a human scale, even if I don\u2019t have it, as it displays a consciousness for wine that is finally coming closer to our understanding of food, the nonindustrial versus the industrial.\u201d ", "My goal is to explore what I think makes wine so thrilling. I\u2019m seeking wines that inspire, with stories to tell and mysteries, perhaps, to conceal. Sometimes deliciousness is enough. But often, the flavors and aromas are only part of what a wine conveys. It\u2019s the rest of the message that\u2019s so fascinating.

The same is true of books or art that can be reproduced.", "Restaurants are a more apt comparison. When a good restaurant is reviewed, who is actually able to eat there? El Bulli was one of the world\u2019s top restaurants before it closed. Anybody who was interested in food wanted to know what a meal there was like. But access was limited.

A new customer is worth about $2,000 over a lifetime to Country Club, and to get that customer, the company normally spends about $3,000 to $4,000 a week on Google advertising. On Blend, however, Mr. Glasgow does not pay to advertise \u2014 he just provides discounted products. \u201cYou\u2019re getting in front of the most coveted and difficult-to-reach demographic, and they are self-selecting to shop at your store,\u201d he said. \u201cSo instead of us going out and putting up ads on Google or Facebook, trying to draw people to us, these people see us and come to us.

He convened a conference call at 6 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 21, and won agreement to cut the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate 0.75 percentage point, the largest cut in more than two decades.", "\u201cThe risk of a severe recession and credit crisis is unacceptably high,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at the meeting.", "Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said this week that the decision was an awakening. \u201cIf maybe we were a little slow to recognize what was happening, Martin Luther King weekend in January 2008 was a decisive point in terms of interest rate policy,\u201d he said.", "By early March, the Fed was moving to replace investors as a source of funding for Wall Street.", "Financial firms, particularly in the mortgage business, were beginning to fail because they could not borrow money. Investors had lost confidence in their ability to predict which loans would be repaid. Countrywide Financial, the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lender, sold itself for a relative pittance to Bank of America. Bear Stearns, one of the largest packagers and sellers of mortgage-backed securities, was teetering toward collapse.", "On March 7, the Fed offered companies up to $200 billion in funding. Three days later, Mr. Bernanke secured the Fed policy-making committee\u2019s approval to double that amount to $400 billion, telling his colleagues, \u201cWe live in a very special time.\u201d", "Finally, on March 16, the Fed effectively removed any limit on Wall Street funding even as it arranged the Bear Stearns rescue.", "And then the Fed paused. By the end of April, it had cut short-term rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent the previous September \u2014 one of the fastest falls in Fed history \u2014 and officials said they had done enough to shore up the financial system. They predicted that the economy would narrowly avoid a recession.", "\u201cI think it is very possible that we will look back and say, particularly after the Bear Stearns episode, that we have turned the corner in terms of the financial disruption that we have just experienced,\u201d Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, said during a meeting at the end of April.", "The summer passed relatively quietly. Officials began to fret about inflation. The transcripts include long conversations about when the Fed should start to raise interest rates.", "\u201cWe saw growth of about 2 percent in the second quarter, which suggests a campaign slogan for the Republicans, \u2018The Economy: It Could Be Worse,\u201d Mr. Bernanke joked in early August.", "But it was only the eye of the storm.

It would allow the authorities, without a court order, to block web pages under the guise of protecting personal privacy, and to collect users\u2019 browsing histories.", "Even before Mr. Gul acted, Turkey already had tough laws blocking thousands of websites, including gay dating sites and news portals considered favorable to Kurdish militants.

In the first six months of 2013, Google was asked to delete more than 12,000 items, making Turkey the No. 1 country seeking to excise Google content.", "The new law is a transparent effort to prevent social media and other sites from reporting on a corruption scandal that reportedly involves bid-rigging and money laundering.

After more than a decade in power, Mr. Erdogan has become more authoritarian and, as a result, increasingly embattled. The legislature has done little to stop him. Last Saturday, the Parliament, in a 20-hour session that involved a bloody fistfight, approved a bill that would tighten the government\u2019s grip on the judiciary. On Thursday, Reuters reported that Mr. Erdogan had drafted a new law that would expand powers for his intelligence agency, including eavesdropping.", "Freedom House, a human rights group, has warned that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government is increasingly employing \u201ca variety of strong-arm tactics to suppress the media\u2019s proper role as a check on power,\u201d including buying off media moguls and forcing the firing of journalists whose coverage is viewed as unfavorable. Turkey has more journalists in jail than Iran or China, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.", "The European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have spoken out against these developments. The United States has also weighed in but not strongly enough. President Obama, who once had a close relationship with Mr. Erdogan, finally spoke to him on Wednesday after months of indirect communication. It was unclear from a White House statement, however, whether Mr. Obama had explicitly pointed out the perilous course Mr. Erdogan is on, a message he needs to hear. His Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party\u2019s vision of inclusive democratic governance, which once found favor in the West and among his people, has largely evaporated \u2014 imperiling Turkey\u2019s stability and economic growth and its compact with NATO.", "After he signed the Internet law, Mr. Gul reportedly lost tens of thousands of followers on Twitter, while the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party appealed to the Constitutional Court to overturn the law.

The town of almost 11,000 in the eastern Hungarian plains was my destination for the weekend, but I had chosen it quite at random, with a simple goal: to find out what was there. I knew what was not there: any notable tourist attraction, a hotel or restaurant with even a single TripAdvisor review, a concentration of English speakers. But first I had to use the bathroom, and that was presenting a problem, since the stick-figure-free signs read \u201cFERFI WC\u201d and \u201cNOI WC.\u201d", "I gave a befuddled look to the only other soul in the waiting room, a bundled-up elderly woman. She pointed. Ferfi it was.", "On my way back to Budapest from more tourist-friendly Transylvania, I had decided to spend my final weekend in a place utterly unknown to me \u2014 and, it seemed to any tourists \u2014 just to see what would happen.", "I\u2019d shown up with similar intentions in other places \u2014 a weeklong stop in a small town in Mexico, a day in a pistachio-farming village in Turkey, two days in a small Chinese city along the Yangtze. But those were easier missions for various reasons: I speak Spanish, the Turkish are notoriously hospitable to strangers, and in China, well, as the only foreigner in town, lots of people wanted to meet me (or at least trail me at a safe distance).", "Small-town Hungary seemed a bigger challenge: Hungarians are supposedly reserved and formal; I certainly don\u2019t speak their Finno-Ugric tongue; and my looks don\u2019t attract attention. (As usual, I would not reveal I was a journalist.)", "So the last thing I expected when I stepped out of the station, on the outskirts of town, was a big touristy map of the town, with attractions numbered and indexed. Then again, it was in three languages, none of which I speak: Hungarian, German and oddly enough, a Slavic language I did not recognize. I\u2019d have to get to the bottom of that, but more important right now, I spotted a \u201cszallo,\u201d which I knew meant hotel, in the center of town.", "Off I trudged, in the predawn half-light, past a Cargill warehouse and a scrap metal heap, through pleasant residential neighborhoods and finally into the center of town. It looked promising. There were a few restaurants, a few stores, an ornate old town hall and, even lovelier, a more subdued neo-Classical building, the Bereny Szallo. I headed through the arched doorway, only to find a hallway without a reception desk. I did, however, find two young men drinking beers, a somewhat notable activity considering it was not yet 7 a.m. They spoke English, and sought out an employee who helped me arrange a room; the cost per night was 3,500 forints, an absurdly low $14.75 at 236 forints to the dollar.", "To my surprise, the men were visitors like me. \u201cWe\u2019re from Budapest,\u201d one said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to go to a pig killing.\u201d", "I had been in town a half-hour, and already I was invited to a pig killing?

Sure enough, when I wheeled my luggage around the corner for the staff to store, they took off.", "A bit depressed at the missed opportunity, I headed across the street to a small bakery, where I drowned my sorrows with a coffee and a kakaos csiga, a snail-shaped chocolate pastry that cost 140 forints. I then set off to wander. (And if I happened to run across a certain pig-killing, all the better.)", "The town turned out to be a subtle charmer. Tidy houses \u2014 some looking a century old or more \u2014 lined streets that were quiet but for the occasional fenced-in dog. A notable number of gray-haired locals were out on bicycles, which, even on a drizzly day, were more common than cars.", "FOR SOME REASON, I felt euphoric. Perhaps it the utter randomness of where I was, or perhaps it was because I had literally no idea what I would find on the next block.

They nodded. They did not speak English. I pointed to my camera, I pointed inside, they waved me in. The barrels were full of fermenting grape juice; they were producing the Hungarian fruit brandy known as palinka. The older man showed me the tangle of pipes and copper stills and other contraptions. Using my phone to translate, I asked a few questions. How much did they produce? (Three hundred liters a day.) Why were they working Saturday? (Shrugs.) Could I buy some? (No.)", "\u201cThey must either sell it wholesale, or customers have to bring empty bottles,\u201d I wrote in my notebook.

I headed in, startling a young, wispy-bearded man named Zsolt, who was not expecting any visitors. (I was the first in three weeks, he said, and possibly the first foreigner ever.) Waiving the entrance fee, he took me on a tour, past the embroidery work of the town\u2019s own Kiszely Janosne and a crazy old contraption of gears and chains and pedals to carbonate water.", "More interesting were rooms full of colorful traditional furniture and household goods. It was traditional Slovak design, he said. Slovak? He then revealed the mystery of the trilingual sign: Mezobereny had been destroyed several times over the years; during its most recent rebirth, in the 18th and 19th centuries, a mix of Hungarians, Germans and Slovaks were brought in to repopulate it. Also in the museum was a memorial to the Jews of Mezobereny who had been taken away (and presumably killed) during World War II. Zsolt told me he didn\u2019t know of any Jews living in town these days.", "It was a reminder that even small towns off the tourist radar can have fascinating, and sometimes difficult histories.", "MY HOTEL ROOM would be ready by now, and after settling in with a quick nap, I headed for what I figured would be an easy way to meet people: Roman Catholic Mass.", "In the entryway to the church, I joined a small group that had congregated to chat: two older women, the priest and a young blond woman named Eszter, who briefly helped translate and then disappeared upstairs. Turned out she was the organist.", "Attendance was sparse, and mostly in the non-English-speaking, elderly woman demographic. But one family group stood out: a middle-aged couple and three young adults. \u201cWe heard about you!\u201d the father told me. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for accommodations!\u201d That was the misinterpretation of the pre-Mass chat circle, but they quickly grasped what I was doing in town. When I told them about my experience in the szeszfozde, the son, Balazs Doczy (who attends an English-language university in Budapest) said his godfather, Istvan Csavas, made the best palinka in town. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we should go knock on his door and see if he has some for you to try,\u201d he said.", "Funny, I was thinking that too. We walked a couple of blocks to his house, and his wife, Zsuzsi, answered, looking a bit tired. There was a flurry of conversation in Hungarian, and Balazs translated for her: \u201cShe says to pardon her appearance. She was at a pig-killing today.\u201d", "Could there have been two pig-killings the same day? Possibly, but not this time: I learned that the young, beer-swilling men from Budapest were part of a group of doctors who had been invited out for the event.", "Istvan was not there, but we were able to sample his palinka, in elegant shot glasses with teacup-style handles. The pear variety was my favorite, smooth and rich and redolent of fruit; it knocked the socks off some commercial palinka I had tried the week before in Budapest. And I was welcome back the next day to buy some.", "After downing the palinka, I needed some food in my stomach. Everyone I had met had recommended the same restaurant, Topart Vendeglo. Though it was a pleasant place \u2014 more banquet hall than restaurant in appearance \u2014 I had a rather unmemorable dinner of pork croquettes (a house specialty) and vegetable soup with noodles that looked like maggots (but tasted fine). It turned out that the restaurant was also a guesthouse with three upstairs rooms, each with a themed d\u00e9cor: German, Hungarian and Slovak. Dinner was 3,100 forints, bringing my total for the day (including lodging) to about $32. Small towns were not only fascinating, they were cheap.", "Balazs and family had suggested that I take the bus the next day to Gyula, a town 20 miles away, to try out its relatively famous bathhouse; I did, and it was fine, but I was eager to get back and buy my palinka.", "When I showed up, Istvan was expecting me; both he and Zsuzsi were very affable despite the language gap. Soon, their English-speaking son, also named Istvan, arrived with his wife and young daughter, and things picked up, with his translations and freely poured palinka as conversational lubricants. I answered Zsuzsi\u2019s questions about American education (she was a retired schoolteacher) and offered my own about how they got outside news before the fall of Communism. (The Voice of America, among other sources.)", "They also resolved one final mystery for me. Istvan didn\u2019t distill the palinka himself; he brought the fermented fruit juice to the very szeszfozde I had visited for distillation (explaining why I had come away empty-handed).", "Two hours later, I had new friends, two bottles of palinka to go (2,500 forints each), and a rapidly encroaching headache. Before I left, they invited me to ... a Monday morning pig killing. I was due on the 5:30 a.m. to Budapest and had a flight to catch. Perhaps the next time I was in Mezobereny."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/technology/personaltech/t-mobile-turns-an-industry-on-its-ear-in-a-fight-for-its-life.html": ["A rash of consumer-friendliness has broken out across the mobile data industry. Over the last year, the four major carriers \u2014 AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile \u2014 have cut prices and offered greater flexibility in how they sell their voice, text and broadband services. The industry could be on the verge of an all-out price war.", "Who is responsible for this blessed state of affairs?", "Credit must go to the United States government.", "In 2011, officials at the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department moved to block AT&T\u2019s proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile. That kept the struggling, fourth-place carrier alive as an independent firm. And it led John J. Legere, T-Mobile\u2019s flamboyant, foul-mouthed chief executive, to brand his company the \u201cuncarrier,\u201d and inaugurate a string of measures that have turned every accepted practice in the mobile business on its head.", "T-Mobile\u2019s resurgence, and the effect it has had on the larger market for cellular service, may hold important lessons for regulators who will soon sit in judgment over the latest enormous broadband proposal, Comcast\u2019s deal to gobble up Time Warner Cable.", "While T-Mobile executives are reluctant to credit the failed merger with AT&T as the source of the firm\u2019s aggressive new pricing strategy, they admit that they see themselves as disrupters in the market. \u201cWe want to identify every pain point for consumers in this industry and eliminate them all,\u201d said Michael Katz, T-Mobile\u2019s vice president for marketing.", "In the last year, T-Mobile has dropped the traditional two-year contract from its lineup; now its plans come without customer lock-in. It has also dropped early termination fees, overage charges and other extra strings that carriers apply to keep you in line. The carrier now allows customers to text and use the Web while traveling in 100 countries at no extra charge. T-Mobile has also offered to pay off the early-termination fees its new customers might incur with their old carriers when switching. Most important, it has unbundled the price of a phone from the price of wireless service. Now, you can pay a separate amount for each piece. This means that if you decide against immediately upgrading when you finish paying off your phone, your monthly bill might \u2014 astonishingly \u2014 go down.", "Former F.C.C. officials say this is exactly what the agency hoped for when, in 2011, it weighed in against AT&T\u2019s plan to purchase T-Mobile. As the agency\u2019s staff explained in a lengthy report, regulators feared that shrinking the four major carriers to three would give providers an incentive to raise prices. Instead, regulators saw an elegant escape hatch for T-Mobile. If AT&T was forced to call off the deal, it would owe T-Mobile a breakup fee worth at least $3 billion in cash, plus an additional $1 billion in rights to wireless spectrum. The money and spectrum would allow T-Mobile to build out its network infrastructure, making it more attractive to new users. Given the right leadership, regulators hoped the fourth-place carrier could play a spoiler\u2019s role in the marketplace. By aggressively courting new users, T-Mobile would act as an agitator prompting change across the industry.", "And that\u2019s what has happened. After the merger fell apart, T-Mobile began to invest heavily in its network; its LTE broadband area now reaches 200 million people and its access speeds have been found to be faster than those of its larger rivals. The firm\u2019s real innovation began last March, though, when it announced its Simple Choice plan, which offered two unusual features. First, there was no contract lock-in; if you found a better deal on some other network a few months after signing up, you were free to leave. Second, the advertised prices were for network access alone, and did not include a smartphone. If you wanted a smartphone, T-Mobile would sell you one at full price, splitting the payments over two years. A top-of-the-line phone, like the iPhone 5S, sells for about $650, which is about $27 a month for 24 months.", "What\u2019s the benefit of paying for the plan and the phone separately rather than as one big bundle? At first glance, it might not seem as if you\u2019re saving that much. If you buy an iPhone 5S and a 2.5-gigabyte plan from T-Mobile, you\u2019ll be out $87 a month \u2014 that\u2019s $60 for the service, and $27 for the phone. That\u2019s only slightly less than the $95 a month AT&T charges for its 2 GB, two-year contract plan, which includes a subsidized phone. This plan was once AT&T\u2019s primary offering. (If you bought a high-end phone, AT&T would also charge $199 when you signed up.)", "But the real benefit of T-Mobile\u2019s unbundled pricing is its flexibility. Separating the phone from the service lets you jump off what Jeff Bezos once called the \u201cupgrade treadmill\u201d \u2014 the pressure to constantly purchase the latest and greatest device even when you don\u2019t really need it. After two years with T-Mobile, your $27-a-month device payment shrinks to $0, and then, if you\u2019re still managing just fine with your pretty good phone, you\u2019ll pay just $60 a month for network access. A contract plan doesn\u2019t work that way; after you\u2019ve paid off your phone, your payments remain the same. So even if you don\u2019t need another phone, it makes financial sense to upgrade \u2014 and, in the process, lock yourself in for another two years because otherwise, you were just giving extra money to your carrier. Unbundled plans are also attractive for those who want to purchase low-cost unlocked phones \u2014 devices that can work on multiple carriers, like Google\u2019s fantastic $349 Nexus 5. If you buy that device from Google, you can pay T-Mobile just for network access.", "T-Mobile\u2019s plans were so blindingly sensible that its competitors have been forced to respond.", "In December, AT&T updated its plans to include a contract-free option. In February, Verizon offered a new set of plans that include similar options, though Verizon\u2019s plans are far more costly and less flexible. The larger carriers have also copied other T-Mobile ideas. After T-Mobile introduced its early upgrade program, Jump, which lets you pay an optional fee for the privilege of getting a new phone more frequently than every two years, AT&T, Verizon and Sprint followed suit.", "T-Mobile\u2019s bold pricing efforts have helped it attract four million new customers over the last year. But the company\u2019s cuts have come at a cost; in its earnings report this week, T-Mobile reported a loss of $20 million in the fourth quarter, up from $8 million last year, a decline the company attributed to the sums it has spent on promotions. Privately, its rivals say that T-Mobile\u2019s spending is unsustainable, and that if larger competitors match all of its efforts, the company won\u2019t be able to invest in its network. Many analysts also say they believe T-Mobile is bent on adding customers to make itself more attractive for an eventual sale to Sprint. That will be difficult, because the very fact that T-Mobile has been so disruptive as an independent company has made officials wary of approving more consolidation in the industry.", "The upshot: Nobody knows if T-Mobile\u2019s aggressive pricing will lead to a permanent change in the way cellular service is sold. But I, for one, am happy to see it die trying."], "https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/qa-with-a-man-who-knows-his-apps/": ["Some people have a friend that can recommend the hottest new music album or latest and greatest upcoming television show.

How would someone know which ones were worth the money and time?", "This is the biggest initial hurdle in setting up a coaching relationship and why referrals play such a big role. \u201cMy biggest concern about coaching is that, like self-help books and unlike psychotherapy, it is unregulated,\u201d said Jessica Lamb-Shapiro, author of \u201cPromise Land: My Journey Through America\u2019s Self-Help Culture.\u201d \u201cWhile there are training programs, the programs themselves are largely without oversight, and there\u2019s no guarantee that any one coach would subscribe to standard best practices, if such a thing even exists.\u201d", "Mr. Goldsmith said he suggested that people ask several different coaches what their specialties were before telling one coach what they need help with.", "\u201cIf you go to a coach with a strategic question, the coach is going to say, \u2018Yes, I can do that,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d go to the coach and ask, \u2018What do you do best?\u2019 If what the coach says is not what you need, don\u2019t hire that coach.

It took all of my time to make it all work.\u201d", "Mr. Riaz, like many successful entrepreneurs who turn to coaches, wanted to do better. To some this means having more money; to others it means more family time. To still others, it could mean going to the next level in a career, starting a company or simply finding a way to be more present at work and at home.", "Mr. Goldsmith said that being coached had lost the stigma it had decades ago, of being for underperformers.

But given the success he had had, he found that people presumed he was happy with what he was doing.", "His coach, Ms. Spatafora, got him thinking more broadly. She asked him what he was passionate about. At first his only answer was his job. But as she pushed him, he said he would like to be an owner of a professional sports team or put his skills to work in public service.", "Mr. Nohra said he still hadn\u2019t found what he wanted to do next, but he was thinking differently about himself, his work and his family.", "\u201cPart of the process has made me less strident,\u201d he said. For example, he said if he were sitting on a board and the chief executive did not listen to his advice, Mr. Nohra would write him off. Ms. Spatafora pointed out the futility of that strategy. \u201cShe said: \u2018Are you really going to let someone fail? You\u2019re not the best communicator in the world.\u2019 \u201d", "Two years later, he is still weighing his options.", "This points to one of the challenges of deep coaching: It takes a lot of time in addition to costing a lot of money. Mr. Nohra said he was paying around $10,000 a month \u2014 which for two years would be a quarter of a million dollars. But he was also spending a lot of his time trying to put into practice what Ms. Spatafora made him aware of.", "Some people need such an open-ended time commitment to change their behavior, coaches say.", "Mr. Goldsmith said he generally worked with executives for 18 months and then had them evaluated by 18 different people at the end.

This happened with Mark Matson, founder and chief executive of Matson Money, which manages $5.7 billion.", "Mr. Matson has sought coaching from experts in his field, including David Booth, chief executive of Dimensional Fund Advisors; from people whose work he admired, like Eugene Fama, a winner of the Nobel in economic science; and from more traditional coaches, like Nancy Duarte, an expert on presentations.", "He said Ms. Duarte\u2019s advice helped him communicate more persuasively with clients, and he credited her with helping him bring in $700 million in new money last year.", "Now that he is in demand as a coach to financial advisers, he said, he stresses to them: \u201cYou can achieve almost anything you want, but most people won\u2019t do it because it involves change.\u201d", "Gretchen Stangier, a financial adviser in Portland, Ore., who has been coached by Mr. Matson, said the process helped her. \u201cI go too fast,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to go more slowly and I do coaching to keep me in tune.\u201d", "She said slowing herself down had allowed her to help clients manage their expectations about their portfolios and their lives more broadly. \u201cWhere we get disappointed is when our expectations aren\u2019t met,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the question is, Are our expectations realistic?

More than once, I snagged the wireless devices off my ear and shoved them into my pocket to avoid questions from the people around me. When I didn\u2019t, I got a couple of snickers or odd looks \u2014 just as I did when I tried wireless headsets several years ago.", "That much, it seems, has not changed.", "But the technology has changed a lot.

I made a few calls that sounded nice and clear, and I listened to MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program streaming on my computer. Listening to music (Blondie, Abba and some Doors) worked just fine, but seemed less satisfying playing in just one ear as opposed to both ears with my iPod plug-in headphones.", "Tim Pryde, the senior director of product management for Jawbone, said the company\u2019s goal was to enhance all of a smartphone\u2019s functions. \u201cBy putting a product on your body, we can extend the possibilities of what tech can do for you and make it even more frictionless,\u201d he said.", "A free iPhone app made changing the Era\u2019s settings easy.

It has two other buttons on the front to control things like volume and song selection. Those buttons were even smaller than the one on the Era, and I had trouble finding them without taking the headset off. And the Presence is pricier, at $179, or $199 with a computer adapter.", "Like the Era, the Presence worked well with all sorts of audio. Calls sounded clearer over all than with the Era, and seemed to corroborate what Keith Kranepool of Sennheiser told me about the company\u2019s long history of developing top-of-the-line audio products.

The volume on the Presence did seem to be a bit low at times, even when I clicked it to the maximum levels.", "The Presence did not direct me to download an iPhone app, and while I didn\u2019t discover a sexy-sounding voice, there were many other voice options. Unlike that of the Era, the documentation for the Presence did not specifically mention its ability to control Siri, though it seemed to work fine when I tried it. Mr. Kranepool said Sennheiser was not ignoring the consumer market, but he added that \u201cwhat we are trying to provide are solutions for mobile professionals who want the highest quality of sound and build.\u201d", "Among those clever solutions is the ability to pair the Presence with up to eight devices, and then have as many as two active at a time.

And these few examples notwithstanding, executive compensation is still going through the roof. Google announced this month that it paid its chairman, Eric Schmidt, $100 million in stock options and another $6 million in cash even though he was replaced as chief executive.

A few companies in distress have done it, but that\u2019s not the case at IBM. It\u2019s a great marriage of substance and symbolism, and I find it very refreshing.\u201d", "While still unusual, turning down pay may become \u201csomething of a trend,\u201d said David Eaton, vice president for proxy research at the shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis, because of increasing public awareness of executive compensation. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of public penance for poor performance.

Paying out or accepting bonuses in times of underperformance that hit the shareholders just doesn\u2019t appear right.\u201d", "That\u2019s certainly the case at IBM and Barclays. IBM may have just reported record earnings, but over the last year, IBM shares have dropped over 8 percent, and are more than 14 percent below the level reached last March.

Revenue at IBM\u2019s systems and technology unit declined a steep 26 percent and the unit lost $500 million.", "Of course, the fact that the chief executives at IBM and Barclays turned down large bonuses \u2014 not to mention all the chief executives at underperforming companies who took them \u2014 raises the question of why they were getting bonuses in the first place. As Allan McCall, a founder of the consulting firm Compensia and a researcher on executive compensation at Stanford Business School, put it, \u201cIf a company had a bad year, then what are the metrics that would lead a company to pay a bonus?\u201d", "According to IBM\u2019s most recent proxy statement, annual incentive bonuses for the chief executive and other members of top management are calculated based on a formula that looks at revenue growth, operating net income, operating earnings per share and free cash flow. Of those factors, operating net income accounts for 60 percent of the weighting in the formula. The stock price is not a factor, even though it is usually what shareholders care most about.", "IBM does not disclose specific targets, citing competitive reasons. But the bar may not be all that high. According to the company\u2019s proxy statements, IBM\u2019s chief executives received the full target bonus every year since the target bonuses were disclosed beginning in 2005, except for 2009.", "Given IBM\u2019s performance last year, Ms. Rometty presumably met or exceeded this year\u2019s targets for earnings and free cash flow. While revenue may have fallen short, that accounts for only 20 percent of the formula. While the compensation committee might have considered some discretionary factors, if Ms. Rometty exceeded the earnings and cash flow targets, she would have been in line for 80 percent of her maximum bonus, or $6.4 million, even in what was a disappointing year.", "\u201cThat suggests something is out of whack,\u201d Mr. McCall said.", "(An IBM spokesman declined to disclose the size of the bonus Ms. Rometty turned down and otherwise declined to comment beyond the company\u2019s news release.)", "Mr. Eaton of Glass Lewis said: \u201cWe\u2019ve brought this issue up as a criticism of IBM. We think with regards to the short-term incentive plan, those goals could be disclosed retrospectively. Shareholders are left in the dark when those targets aren\u2019t disclosed. Some other companies are much more transparent. It\u2019s very commonplace to disclose the short-term target and what the actual performance was.\u201d", "Still, there is little doubt that Ms. Rometty chose to leave a good deal of money on the table \u2014 a fortune to most people. Professor Sonnenfeld praised the message it sent to shareholders as IBM is making large capital investments in its new Watson development platform in the cloud. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to lead by example,\u201d he said. \u201cShe believes actions speak louder than words.\u201d", "He continued: \"It\u2019s a great struggle to turn the IBM battleship. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It\u2019s great she\u2019s done this and is willing to make big bets on the future.

It\u2019s not necessarily something that we\u2019d push for, but if the company thinks it\u2019s the right thing, after talking with the investor base, it can be an appropriate step.\u201d", "Ms. Rometty\u2019s decision also sends an important message to employees, Mr. McCall said. \u201cIt\u2019s another way to communicate to the organization that things aren\u2019t going great, we need to do better, and we\u2019ll take something out of the pockets of the executive team to set an example.\u201d", "In the Barclays case, the message may have been aimed primarily at regulators, a British public still furious over financial bailouts and even the House of Commons, which has been much more aggressive than Congress on issues of executive pay and threatened to hold hearings last year on Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s decision to award bonuses to top executives. In declining his bonus, Mr. Jenkins of Barclays spoke of \u201clegacy litigation and conduct issues,\u201d presumably referring to the scandal involving the rigging of the global benchmark interest rate Libor, which led to the ouster of his predecessor.", "Still, however laudable Ms. Rometty\u2019s and Mr. Jenkins\u2019s sacrifices, and even if turning down bonuses does become a trend, leaving a bonus to the discretion of the chief executive does not get at the larger problem that many of them are overpaid. \u201cIt may be fine for the chief executive to waive a bonus,\u201d Mr. Eaton said, \u201cbut it\u2019s really the compensation committee of the board that should be more proactive, and not give one in the first place.

Our methodology is pretty simple: We do a Google News search each weekday morning for the previous day\u2019s shootings and then list them. Most days, we have been finding between 20 and 30 shootings; on Mondays, when we also add the weekend\u2019s violence, the number is usually well over 100.", "From the start, we knew we were missing a lot more incidents than we found. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after all, says that nearly 32,000 people are killed by guns each year. Slate, the online magazine, which tried to tally every gun death in the year after the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., arrived at a number of 12,042, far higher than ours.

But it was also obvious that a Google News search was bound to miss plenty of examples; that\u2019s just the nature of the beast. Comprehensiveness was never really the point, though. Mostly we were trying to get a feel for the scale and scope of gun violence in America. A year later, it seems like a good time to take stock.", "First, the biggest surprise, especially early on, was how frequently either a child accidentally shot another child \u2014 using a loaded gun that happened to be lying around \u2014 or an adult accidentally shot a child while handling a loaded gun. I have written about this before, mainly because these incidents seem so preventable. Gun owners simply need to keep their guns locked away. Indeed, one pro-gun reader, Malcolm Smith, told me that after reading \u201cabout the death toll, especially to children\u201d in The Gun Report, he had come to believe that some gun regulation was necessary.

The reason was not that we were biased against crime prevention; it was that it didn\u2019t happen very often. (When we found such examples, we put them in The Gun Report.)

Sadly, cases like the recent shooting in a Florida movie theater \u2014 when one man killed someone who was texting during the previews \u2014 are not all that uncommon.", "Third, gang shootings are everywhere. You see it in the big cities, like Chicago, Detroit and Miami, and you see it in smaller cities in economic decline like Flint, Mich., and Fort Wayne, Ind.

As often as gang members shoot each other, they kill innocent victims, often children who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.", "Among the readers who post daily comments to The Gun Report are a number of gun rights advocates.

But why should that make them any less lamentable, or preventable?", "There are an estimated 300 million guns in America, and that\u2019s not going to change anytime soon. But to read The Gun Report is to be struck anew at the reality that most of the people who die from guns would still be alive if we just had fewer of them. The guys in the movie theater would have had a fistfight instead of a shooting. The momentary flush of anger would pass. The suicidal person might have taken a pause if taking one\u2019s life were more difficult. And on, and on.

(This year, it was certainly the biggest day for television with a record average audience of 112.2 million viewers.) What follows are answers to questions about some spots in Super Bowl XLVIII.", "Q. Why did advertisers like Geico, Sonos and Subway run existing commercials rather than create special ads for the game like everyone else?", "A. There was a \u201cgreat media opportunity at the last minute that fit with a 15-second spot\u201d that Geico had already produced, said Ted Ward, vice president for marketing at Geico. \u201cAnd while the creative wasn\u2019t new \u2014 the spot had been running since the end of December \u2014 it highlighted a very important mobile app feature for Geico.\u201d", "\u201cThe mobile app downloads jumped substantially in the 30 minutes after airing,\u201d he added. The spot was created by the Martin Agency, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.", "At Sonos, a maker of wireless speakers, the company had seen \u201can incredible response\u201d to a commercial that was introduced before Christmas, said a spokeswoman, Jordana Bruner, \u201cso when the opportunity came to us to bring it to a massive viewing audience, it felt like an obvious decision.\u201d", "\u201cThat, and sports without music is unthinkable to us,\u201d she added. The commercial was created by 72andSunny, part of MDC Partners.", "Subway\u2019s spot, for a new product, the Fritos chicken enchilada, represented the second consecutive year that the company had bought commercial time in the Super Bowl the weekend before the game, citing advantageous last-minute prices. The MMB agency created the spot.", "Usually, an argument against running existing commercials during a Super Bowl is that new ones outperform them in postgame polls and surveys. In the annual USA Today Ad Meter, the Subway spot fared poorly, finishing next to last, but the Geico and Sonos commercials outranked original ads from 15 or so advertisers.", "Q. Was SodaStream taken aback when its commercial featuring Scarlett Johansson was preceded by a T-Mobile spot mocking advertisers that use \u201coverpaid movie stars\u201d in their ads?", "A. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably a coincidence,\u201d said Alex Bogusky, the creative executive who worked with an agency named Humanaut on the SodaStream commercial, which generated notoriety with a version, turned down by Fox, that mocked Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to get all the spots flighted,\u201d Mr. Bogusky said, referring to scheduling the commercials throughout the game, \u201cthat I doubt they have time for things like that.\u201d", "Mr. Bogusky, a Colorado resident who is a Denver Broncos fan, said he \u201chad to turn off the game in the third quarter,\u201d before his commercial ran, because \u201cit was too hard to watch the Broncos getting crushed.\u201d", "Q. Who was that familiar voice in the commercial for Chobani Greek-style yogurt, narrating when Bob Dylan wasn\u2019t singing \u201cI Want You\u201d on the soundtrack?", "A. The narrator was Mandy Patinkin, the actor known for his work in films like \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d and television series like \u201cHomeland.\u201d Although Mr. Patinkin is also a singer, perhaps best known for the Broadway musical \u201cSunday in the Park with George,\u201d Chobani and its agency, Droga5, decided to leave the singing in the spot to Mr. Dylan.", "Q. Was the language that the villain spoke in the humorous commercial for M&M\u2019s Russian? If so, were there fears it might be construed as a comment on Russia, Vladimir Putin or the Winter Olympics in Sochi?", "A. The language in the spot was indeed Russian, and it was spoken by an actor, Rade Serbedzija, known for portraying Russian villains in movies. Some articles and blog posts about the commercial even described it as involving the \u201cRussian mafia\u201d or \u201cRussian mob.\u201d", "Seth Klugherz, senior director for M&M\u2019s Chocolate Candies at Mars Chocolate North America, said: \u201cWe did extensive testing on our commercial to try and ensure it was humorous and lighthearted, as we wanted to showcase the fact M&M\u2019s Peanut is irresistible. We realize that humor is subjective, but felt confident viewers would see the fun nature of the commercial.\u201d The commercial was created by BBDO New York, part of the Omnicom Group.", "Q. Which Super Bowl commercial finally won the YouTube Ad Blitz this year?", "A. The Ad Blitz, an annual vote by consumers for their favorite spots, is conducted by the YouTube division of Google. The winner for 2014, announced on Saturday, was no surprise: the heartwarming \u201cPuppy Love\u201d commercial for Budweiser beer. The spot, created by Anomaly, another agency owned by MDC Partners, has been watched on YouTube more than 47.6 million times.", "A commercial for Coca-Cola titled \u201cAmerica Is Beautiful,\u201d which generated some contentious comments for its salute to multiculturalism and diversity, came in second in the Ad Blitz. The spot was created by Wieden & Kennedy.", "The commercial that placed third in the Ad Blitz also featured Mr. Dylan, like the Chobani commercial, but went further into Dylanmania by featuring him speaking and appearing on camera. That commercial, for the Chrysler 200, was created by the GlobalHue agency."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/technology/republicans-are-wooing-the-wired.html": ["At an after-hours hacking event at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., Aaron Ginn approached an engineer whose face was buried in a laptop.", "Like more than a few techies, Mr. Ginn could pass for a skateboarder or a member of a boy band: As he circulated, he wore a red Reebok cap, its bill tilted high over his short dark hair, a silver and black cross around his neck and a green T-shirt printed with \u201cLincoln Labs.\u201d That\u2019s the name of the talent-scouting group he founded last year with two friends. But unlike others in this game, Mr. Ginn was in search of a rare technology-industry breed: Republicans.", "The engineer, Vinay Vyas, 28, who works at Microsoft, was fine-tuning a program designed to shrink waiting times at any state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles. Mr. Ginn struck up a conversation, leading with a sympathetic joke about an experience he had with government inefficiency while doing consulting work with a municipality south of San Francisco. Mr. Vyas followed suit by remarking how the government was wasting its time spying on people through the National Security Agency.", "Bashing the N.S.A.\u2019s activities under the Obama administration is a rallying cry for certain conservative libertarians. But concern about N.S.A. spying isn\u2019t limited to Republicans, so Mr. Ginn proceeded cautiously. \u201cCan you believe that?\u201d he said, adding, as casually as he could: \u201cThe government spent $1 billion on healthcare.gov, and for what \u2014 an insurance-company lead-generation site?\u201d", "After the 2012 elections, when Republicans and conservatives spent more than $1 billion trying and failing to unseat President Obama and win back the Senate, they concluded that they had fallen dangerously behind Democrats in the realm of technology. Now, with midterm elections just nine months away, the right is investing tens of millions of dollars to match the interactive platforms, grass-roots databases and sophisticated data analytics that allowed Democrats to identify voters, reach them with precision and persuade them to vote.", "But first, the Republicans need the talent. In an industry where partisan politics has little cachet, and where prominent Republicans \u2014 like Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard \u2014 are relatively rare, the task of finding skilled programmers and engineers has fallen to scouts like Mr. Ginn.", "Mr. Ginn, who worked on Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, describes himself as socially and fiscally conservative. But not right away. Instead, he takes a back-door approach to finding like-minded people with tech skills. He picks gently around the issues, rarely even mentioning the party name. \u201cI avoid saying \u2018Republican\u2019 so people don\u2019t think I\u2019m part of crazy right-wing stuff,\u201d Mr. Ginn said.", "He added: \u201cPeople have branding trauma. If I identify myself as this, they think I am best friends with Sarah Palin.\u201d", "Lincoln Labs organizes meet-ups and hackathons, which are programming contests and social events where technical people gather for free food and to test their skills. The events have themes. For the December event at Microsoft (the company paid for the event, and Lincoln Labs organized it), it was \u201copen government,\u201d a broad topic that gave Mr. Ginn a reason to ask how people felt about government and taxes \u2014 and N.S.A. surveillance.", "Mr. Ginn thought that Mr. Vyas\u2019s sardonic crack about the agency might indicate a conservative leaning, but after he switched gears to Obamacare, Mr. Vyas interrupted.", "\u201cActually,\u201d Mr. Vyas said, \u201cI don\u2019t really have a problem with government, except when I have to wait in line at the D.M.V.\u201d", "\u2018Got to Be Real Engineers\u2019", "In March 2013, the Republican National Committee released an autopsy of its 2012 losses, titled the \u201cGrowth and Opportunity Project.\u201d Among the conclusions: Republicans were being badly beaten in the data war. Different party institutions did a poor job of collaborating with one another and with outside allies. While Democratic campaigns increasingly used advanced analytics and data gathering to rigorously test different ways of reaching voters, Republicans still relied too much on gut and instinct. They had failed to foster a \u201cculture of data and learning,\u201d as the Democrats had, and needed to deepen the talent pool.", "One of the party\u2019s first steps in that direction was hiring Andrew Barkett, 33, a former senior engineering manager at Facebook. In June, Mr. Barkett accepted dual appointments as chief technology officer of the Republican National Committee and of Data Trust, a firm founded in 2011 by prominent former party officials and contracted to improve the party\u2019s voter file, its most prized asset.", "In recent months, Mr. Barkett has built out a pair of Silicon Valley offices for the party and for the company. Data Trust has become a kind of party-oriented engineering firm, developing a platform that will allow Republican candidates and state parties to easily swap and share data on Republican voters and create other analytic products \u2014 a capability that Democratic organizations have had for years.", "In a conference room at the San Mateo, Calif., office of Data Trust, Mr. Barkett offered a brief demonstration of the impact of technology on politics. On his MacBook Air, he opened a version of the party\u2019s voter database. It contains information on around 200 million Americans eligible to vote, can search for some 50 characteristics and can project a given voter\u2019s likely views on issues like school vouchers.", "To illustrate, Mr. Barkett ran a search in three precincts in Abington, Mass., using three criteria: registered Republicans, age 35 or younger, and strong disapproval of President Obama in a poll.", "The search clicked along for a few seconds \u2014 longer than Mr. Barkett felt was satisfactory \u2014 but then kicked out the names of about a dozen people. One was a Catholic and of Northern European background. But one data point stood out: He hadn\u2019t voted in a midterm election in years. Mr. Barkett perked up.", "\u201cMaybe we find another Catholic in his precinct to send him a message,\u201d Mr. Barkett said.", "To Mr. Barkett, these far-from-extraordinary capabilities are merely the baseline. He has more ambitious goals, including adding data sources like property values and property tax information from real estate websites like Zillow or Trulia. Volunteers could then walk the precinct and ask: Are you happy paying this much property tax? He also wants the database to let Republicans match voter files with Facebook identities \u2014 a significant Obama-campaign innovation in 2012 \u2014 to permit more targeted ads on the social networking site.", "Another goal is a working data platform, so that customers \u2014 candidates, conservative groups, state parties \u2014 can more easily access the party\u2019s voter file and swap information about contacts with voters in the field. The more customers who use the platform, the more information is added to the voter file, and the more useful the file becomes. So far, though, the platform remains in testing, and it is unclear how many state parties will agree to use it.", "Organizing such data from many sources and sorting it into quickly accessible information \u201cis a pretty elite skill,\u201d Mr. Barkett said. In fact, he rejects 80 percent of employee prospects for lack of skill, not for insufficient ideological match. He finds prospects via friends, business networks, online job postings, professional recruiters \u2014 and talent scouts like Mr. Ginn.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t need thousands of people; we need dozens,\u201d Mr. Barkett said. \u201cWe could do a lot of damage with 30 people. A lot. But they\u2019ve got to be real engineers.\u201d Of Mr. Ginn, he said: \u201cAaron gets that.\u201d", "Mr. Barkett added: \u201cWe get 20 or 30 of those people and, watch out. The Democrats will have a hard time keeping up with that.\u201d", "But attracting even that many has proved elusive, even as Democratic groups have developed a deep talent bench. Catalist, a liberal data and analytics cooperative founded in 2006 \u2014 and the acknowledged model for Data Trust \u2014 has a thousand clients and a core staff of about 50. The Democratic National Committee and Democratic state parties already have a standardized system for sharing voter information, while a generation of liberal and Democratic activists has come up through the ranks using a single data platform.", "The Republican National Committee effort is also playing catch-up among allies on the right. The political and philanthropic network overseen by David and Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialists, has financed a separate voter data initiative, known as Themis, which has been up and running for more than four years, and, with its sister company i360, employs about 50 people.", "Yet the biggest gap may be cultural. Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns were known in the tech world for giving data and analytics staff a prominent place in the campaign hierarchy. It didn\u2019t hurt that he enjoyed the personal support of some of Silicon Valley\u2019s most admired executives: No less a tech luminary than Eric E. Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, helped Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign recruit technical talent.", "Mr. Barkett must draw talent to work on behalf of the party broadly, rather than for a single candidate. And the best engineers, he said, don\u2019t see the Republican Party as the most modern place to work. \u201cThe G.O.P. has no culture of technical skill or excellence,\u201d he said. But, he pitches recruits this way: \u201cWho has a more interesting and meaningful big data problem right now? You can change the culture. You can change who the president is.\u201d Mr. Barkett himself gave up stock options worth several million dollars at Facebook to join the Republican National Committee effort because he saw an opportunity to effect change.", "Finding talent has been harder than finding money. The party has provided about $17 million, a substantial amount, to spend from October 2013 through November 2014, and Data Trust, which is privately held, has a comparable budget. (Themis had about $10 million in revenue in 2012, according to its tax returns; Catalist takes in subscriber fees of $5 million to $9 million a year, it says, and devotes more than $6 million to new research and development.) But Mr. Barkett says he has hired only about 14 people for the Republican National Committee and 12 at Data Trust, half the number he hopes to have by spring.", "Underscoring the urgency of the party\u2019s task, the Republican National Committee last week unveiled an initiative, Para Bellum Labs, intended to supercharge recruitment and innovation efforts. Para Bellum \u2014 Latin for \u201cprepare for war\u201d \u2014 is modeled on in-house incubators set up by some tech companies, including Facebook, to preserve a startup-style culture as they grow larger and less nimble. At the committee\u2019s headquarters, the effort puts the party\u2019s entire Beltway-based technology staff, from voter file programmers to digital-advertising specialists, under one roof. Mr. Barkett will report to Para Bellum.", "\u201cWe are not taking people who have worked in politics and trying to turn them into data analysts,\u201d said Chuck DeFeo, the Republican committee\u2019s deputy chief of staff and chief digital officer. \u201cWe are taking people with very specific skills sets.\u201d", "Among the recruits to Data Trust are Jason Chew, a software engineer who was Mr. Bartlett\u2019s roommate at the University of California, Berkeley, and was a colleague at Facebook, and Newton Der, 34, who until July worked at a mobile game company and heard about Mr. Barkett\u2019s efforts through the Corporate Asian American Employee Network. Mr. Der says that he\u2019s \u201cnot really into politics,\u201d but that he believes strongly in gun-owner rights.", "Mr. Barkett says he isn\u2019t looking to hire ideologues. He describes himself as a fiscal conservative and social moderate \u2014 for instance, he says he doesn\u2019t oppose same-sex marriage. He figures that there are plenty like him. In fact, when he announced that he was leaving Facebook for the Republican National Committee, he learned to his surprise that he had been working with some Republicans all along.", "\u201cThey outed themselves to me,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to tell who is gay at Facebook than who is Republican.\u201d", "Hacking for Republicans", "Mr. Ginn grew up in Arlington, Tex., the son of a first-generation Chinese immigrant father and a mother from Arizona. His political awakening came in the 10th grade. \u201cI read two books that changed my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Bible, and \u2018The Terrible Truth About Liberals,\u2019 but the Bible much more, obviously.\u201d", "He became a Southern Baptist, and he says the religion guides his beliefs, like his opposition to same-sex marriage \u2014 though he says he favors granting rights to gay domestic partners. But since moving to San Francisco in late 2011, he avoids talking about social issues to prospects because he doesn\u2019t want to be off-putting.", "Among his fans, and someone sympathetic to his tactics, is Harmeet K. Dhillon, chairwoman of the Republican Party in San Francisco and vice chairwoman of the California Republican Party. When she ran for the State Assembly in 2008, she said, she didn\u2019t even put \u201cRepublican\u201d on her billboards or signs. \u201cIn the Bay Area,\u201d she said, \u201copening a conversation with \u2018I\u2019m a conservative\u2019 is an automatic loser.\u201d", "Mr. Ginn learned that the hard way when anti-conservative sensibilities nearly scuttled Lincoln Labs\u2019 first event.", "Last June, Mr. Ginn organized a hackathon to be held at the offices of StumbleUpon, the media company where he works in downtown San Francisco. A few days before the event, several employees alerted StumbleUpon\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bartels, that the Charles Koch Institute had paid for the event. The employees wanted to know if StumbleUpon endorsed the Kochs\u2019 views.", "Mr. Bartels said the hackathon threatened to become a \u201cdistraction\u201d and asked Mr. Ginn to move it to another site. Mr. Ginn said Lincoln Labs now relies for a significant portion of its funding on a group called Generation Opportunity, which its website describes as a \u201cfreethinking, liberty-loving, national organization of young people.\u201d Generation Opportunity, in turn, receives most of its funding from Freedom Partners, a business league of conservative-leaning donors overseen by aides to the Kochs and former Koch employees.", "The Charles Koch Institute is a major force in free-market philanthropy, but the Kochs \u2014 who also help finance an array of more overtly political conservative organizations and invested heavily in trying to defeat President Obama in 2012 \u2014 are controversial in many quarters. Mr. Ginn said Lincoln Labs did not accept Charles Koch Institute money for the Microsoft event, but added that the groups have a continuing relationship, and that such an alliance is natural, \u201cbecause they\u2019re so involved in libertarian issues; it\u2019s very difficult to not run across them.\u201d", "Politics and Mexican Food", "The Microsoft meeting was kicked off by Garrett Johnson, one of Mr. Ginn\u2019s two partners at Lincoln Labs. (The other is Chris Abrams, 26, who also works at StumbleUpon.) Mr. Johnson, a Rhodes scholar, is gregarious and has a commanding physical presence; he was an N.C.A.A. shot-put champion when he was at Florida State University. In his nonpartisan introduction, he told the 40 or so engineers about the goals of the contest and introduced Lincoln Labs as a group \u201cadvancing liberty with the use of technology.\u201d", "\u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said.", "The hacking teams broke up. They ate Mexican food. Mr. Ginn made his rounds, speaking to Mr. Vyas and then approaching another table where a team was working on a project aimed at helping readers of news articles quickly identify financial contributions to politicians.", "Mr. Ginn suspected that the engineer who proposed the project was a Democrat, but wanted to find out. To test the proposition, he mentioned terms like \u201cBlackwater,\u201d which Mr. Ginn later described as liberal fodder.", "The programmer, Ian Webster, 23, didn\u2019t seem much interested. So Mr. Ginn upped the ante by mentioning that he was involved in politics and had recently been elected in California to \u201cthe state party leadership.\u201d He didn\u2019t say which party.", "Cool, Mr. Webster said. But the conversation stalled again, even after Mr. Ginn probed further by bringing up his opposition to N.S.A. surveillance.", "Then Mr. Ginn got an unexpected bite. Sitting at the same table, working on the same project, was Ronald Ning, 30, a computer scientist. He overheard the conversation and expressed sharp opposition to certain aspects of the N.S.A. surveillance effort.

All of this has made YouTube more attractive to A-listers. Hollywood studios like DreamWorks Animation and 21st Century Fox have each made substantial investments in multimedia studios to enter the YouTube market, and stars like the British comedian Ricky Gervais  and the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver have started channels.

The company\u2019s ad revenue for last year, according to eMarketer, totaled about $5.6 billion, up 51 percent from 2012.

It is especially lagging, they say, in selling ads to its two fastest-growing audiences: those coming through mobile devices and those overseas. The executives spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of angering YouTube.", " On YouTube, the average rate for pre-roll ads, those 30-second commercials that you must watch before seeing a video, is $7.60 per 1,000 ad views, down from $9.35 in 2012, according to TubeMogul, a video ad-buying software company. The same pre-roll ad on a broadcaster\u2019s site, like that of CBS or CNN, would cost more than $20 per 1,000 views.", " David Burch,  a TubeMogul spokesman, says that most YouTube video makers do not sell an ad on every view of a video. \u201cIt varies a ton, but it wouldn\u2019t usually be more than half, and for many partners it is more like two out of every 10 views will have a video ad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an advertiser\u2019s market.\u201d", " In such a situation, he said, ads for two out of every 10 views would amount to $2,000, based on a million views. And then YouTube takes 45 percent. ", "No wonder providers are protesting. \u201cYour cost of production \u2014 which would including shooting, location, lights, cameras, sounds and editing \u2014 is going to be thousands of dollars per video,\u201d said Mr. Calacanis, who stopped investing in his YouTube operation in July and turned his attention to Inside.com, a mobile news app he is developing. \u201cFor 10 \u2018advertiser friendly\u2019 videos of YouTube length, you would spend at least $25,000 to $75,000.  This means you are in deep in the red before you take into account your talent.\u201d", " Mr. Kyncl of YouTube said that aspiring content creators who looked only at the cost equation were taking the wrong approach. What YouTube offers, he said, is a chance to build a worldwide viewership that can lead to income from sources other than direct ads. As an example of a successful switchover, he points to Bassem Youssef,  a Cairo heart surgeon, who offered a show something like \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart,\u201d  won five million viewers in a few months and got a contract with an Egyptian television channel. Or there is Awesomeness TV, a network for teenagers, which was built for YouTube but now has content on Nickelodeon and intends to use YouTube as a \u201cfarm team\u201d for TV.", " \u201cThe more successful you are on YouTube,\u201d Mr. Kyncl said, \u201cthe more you should think about diversifying.\u201d", "Olga Kay grew up in rural Russia until her family ran out of money and she went to work for a circus. She learned to juggle and eventually got a visa to come to the United States to join the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus. She began to get work in commercials \u2014 for example, juggling glasses in a Smirnoff Vodka ad. In 2002, she moved to Hollywood, looking for a career in show business.", " At the time, YouTube was a burgeoning phenomenon, and Ms. Kay was sucked in. In 2006, she began a video blog about her daily life and soon had tens of thousands of followers. In 2009, she added a second channel, featuring skits with characters like Emo Girl, a self-involved, overly emotional teenager whom Ms. Kay plays by wearing a black wig and lots of black eyeliner. Her first Emo Girl video, \u201cDoctors Want to Have Sex With You,\u201d got a half-million views in about two weeks.  ", " There was \u201cno breakout moment,\u201d she says, just a constant push to expand. \u201cI am always growing through real avenues and not counting on a viral hit.\u201d", "Advertisers noticed the traffic she was attracting and began to approach her. In 2009, she said, Ford gave her a car and some gasoline for a year; in return, she had to feature the car in a video once a month. It was around then that Ms. Kay decided that she could build her channels into a full-time career.", " At the end of 2009, she started quoting a rate of $75 per thousand views to advertisers who wanted her to promote their products on her site.  In 2011, she added the video gaming channel and, a year later, the beauty channel. She says she is interested in both topics, but both also happen to be rapidly growing subgroups of YouTube.", " Currently, she says, more than one million people, generally female and 13 to 21 years old, subscribe to all her channels combined \u2014 which means they have clicked a button asking to receive notice when she posts something new.", "That kind of traffic gives her a strong base for pre-roll ads, but not enough to make up for declining rates over all. The problem is worsened by the fact that fat sponsorship deals for promoting products directly are increasingly rare \u2014 and even when they come through, they are not as lucrative as they seem.", " \u201cWe are underpaid,\u201d Ms. Kay says. \u201cWe are not only coming up with the commercial concept and tapping into a loyal audience, we are also doing marketing. We are doing all of these jobs for a relatively small fee.\u201d", " And those costs are going up as expectations rise for higher-quality videos. A year ago, Ms. Kay was among the first groups of creators to be tapped for a free fellowship at YouTube\u2019s new production studios. There, she received training in topics as diverse as copyright infringement law and how to do better lighting.", " The one requirement of the fellowship was that she produce a video with high production values. She made a psychological thriller called \u201cMy Better Half.\u201d YouTube gave her free access to its studio space and sets and camera equipment, but she had to cover the costs of crew, actors and costumes. The costs stung: \u201cYou know you have to feed them, too,\u201d she said of the crew.", " To keep up with her daily channels and improve their visual quality, she has had to hire an editor, costing $500 to $700 a week when he works full time. It all adds up.", "\u201cMy friends and I talk about it all the time,\u201d she said, \u201cBut we think if we were coming to YouTube today, it would be too hard.

Millennials, it is often said, want more than just a paycheck; they crave meaningful and fulfilling careers, maybe even a chance to change the world.", "That may explain why millennials like Breanne Thomas, 24, an aspiring entrepreneur in Brooklyn, has bounced from internship to internship. Unlike her parents\u2019 generation, it is not enough to find a steady job; she wants to follow the path of Mark Zuckerberg, or at least to get in on the ground floor of the next Facebook, the next Twitter.", "\u201c \u2018Success\u2019 doesn\u2019t always mean financial success, but doing something you\u2019re passionate about,\u201d said Ms. Thomas, who graduated with two bachelor\u2019s degrees from the University of Oregon in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my goal one day to have my own company, to be part of something that is going to do something great. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in tech.\u201d", "That kind of ambition comes with a price, however. Competition for salaried high-tech jobs is fierce, so Ms. Thomas has had to settle for internships: three, so far, including at a five-person food-delivery start-up, a beauty products site and, currently, a well-known social-networking app that she asked not to name.", "While the idea of slaving away in two, three or four quasi jobs without a clear path for advancement may seem unimaginable to an older generation, those in their 20s seem to respond to their jobless fate with a collective shrug. To them, internships are the new normal. \u201cFor some people, being an accountant, taking a safe route, is perfectly fine, but that\u2019s not where my values lie,\u201d Ms. Thomas said.", "This is especially true in more creative fields, whether it is filmmaking or publishing. \u201cIt\u2019s fashion,\u201d said Dawn Joyce, 24, when asked why she has gone through four internships since 2010. Those include unpaid stints at a major fashion magazine, where she mingled with Zooey Deschanel and Julianne Moore at photo shoots, and at a public relations firm, where she held front-row seats for late-arriving celebrities like Selena Gomez. \u201cI consider myself to be pretty jaded already.\u201d", "\u201cI have seen a lot of people beside me quit,\u201d Ms. Joyce added. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Let\u2019s see who lasts the longest.\u2019 \u201d", "As their ranks have swelled, interns are beginning to see themselves as part of a special class, albeit one with few privileges and perks. They share their own brand of gallows humor, their own pride of purpose and their own battle-hardened worldview tinged with a risk-taker\u2019s optimism.", "This intern-centric culture has spawned numerous blogs, a place at the multiplex (think of \u201cThe Internship,\u201d from last year, with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn playing a pair of 40-something Google interns) and even its own magazine.", "Intern magazine, which came out in October, grew out of the frustrations of Alec Dudson, 29, a former intern who toiled in London\u2019s publishing industry. \u201cI was working 30 hours a week at odd jobs, on top of 40 hours a week at internships, and I knew there wasn\u2019t a job at the end of it,\u201d said Mr. Dudson, who slept on friends\u2019 sofas to help make ends meet. \u201cI needed to do something of my own.\u201d", "That something turned out to be a glossy, biannual magazine that is geared for those with a design and creative bent, and looks like a fashion bible for the Black Book crowd. The feature articles provide tips and inspiration for the faceless drones who keep the style industries humming, including a first-person piece by a Spanish photographer who cut his teeth by interning for Richard Kern in New York.", "\u201cThere is a culture of internships, a situation whereby it is completely normal for young people to think that working unpaid is just part of the process,\u201d Mr. Dudson said. \u201cNobody even questions it. I wasn\u2019t the only one confused about where the boundaries lie, how much of this stuff do you have to do before someone takes you seriously.\u201d", "These days, there are no shortages of places, online and off, for interns to gather and commiserate. Groups like FindSpark, a New York jobs network for recent graduates, offer meetups and mixers with themes like \u201cFind and Follow Your Passion\u201d and \u201cYour Personal Brand\u201d that draw hundreds. Interns who tire of glad-handing their way through mixers with frozen smiles often vent their frustrations on anonymous blogs like Fashion Intern Problems, the short-lived Life of an Investment Banking Summer Slave and, for Hollywood\u2019s version of Roman galley slaves, Anonymous Production Assistant Blog and Intern-Anonymous.", "\u201cI worked 32 hours a week and was treated like a minion,\u201d one commenter wrote on Intern-Anonymous. \u201cI was then fired because they were afraid I would leak information.\u201d", "Lately, however, long-suffering interns are starting to do more than complain. They point to the Labor Department\u2019s six criteria for legal internships, which stipulate that companies that do not pay interns must provide vocational education and refrain from substituting interns for paid employees, among others. Those rules have been highly open to interpretation and their enforcement is sporadic.", "In a much-publicized lawsuit in 2011, two unpaid interns sued the filmmakers of \u201cBlack Swan\u201d alleging a violation of federal and New York State minimum wage laws. Last June, a federal judge in New York ruled in favor of the interns. (The case is on appeal.)", "\u201cIt\u2019s an institutionalized form of wage theft,\u201d said Eric Glatt, 44, one of the plaintiffs who has since helped form an Occupy-inspired group called Intern Labor Rights. Last year, the group distributed fake swag bags and buttons that read \u201cPay Your Interns\u201d outside fashion shows in New York.", "That ruling opened the floodgates to some 30 other lawsuits against companies like Warner Music Group, Elite Model Management and, perhaps most notably, Cond\u00e9 Nast. In that suit, one plaintiff, Lauren Ballinger, who interned at W while still in college, conjured visions of \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d with her stories of toiling away on menial tasks like organizing jewelry for 12-hour shifts for a stipend that she claimed broke down to $1 an hour.", "While the plaintiffs in the Cond\u00e9 Nast suit had been students at the time of their internships, such lawsuits have sent a chill through the Intern Industrial Complex, affecting undergraduates and postgraduates alike as companies scramble to adjust to the new legal landscape.", "Some, like NBC Universal, have responded by paying interns. Other former intern magnets are redefining the position (Gawker Media now calls its entry-level workers \u201ceditorial fellows\u201d).", "In some cases, however, the intern revolt may be backfiring.", "Last October, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced that it was ending the internship programs within its 25 magazines, which means that 20-something aspiring magazine editors will have one less place to get a toehold for their \u201cmeaningful\u201d careers.", " \u201cCan you hear it?\u201d one commenter wrote on a WWD article about the ending of internships. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream of a Vogue internship going straight out the window.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/business/take-the-road-less-traveled-it-may-lead-to-barbecue.html": ["I LOVE business travel.

The gentleman who suggested it said that he goes out of his way to find it every time he is in Charlotte.", "Once we landed in Charlotte, we had to rent a car to get to Greenville, so since we had wheels my sales manager and I decided to go on a little road trip to see if we could find this truck. But we couldn\u2019t even find a mention of it on Google Maps. We did find a website, which didn\u2019t provide a location, but did provide a phone number.", "I called and a gentleman named Ron actually answered.

I programmed the gas station address into our GPS unit, and we headed off to find this truck feeling hungry and adventurous. It was a long detour, about 40 minutes.", "We found the truck, and I think Ron\u2019s son was really surprised that we showed up. We got some free ribs and then paid for some others.

So this time, Facebook made it harder for its target to say no. On Wednesday, Facebook announced it would acquire WhatsApp, a text messaging application with 450 million users, for at least $16 billion in cash and stock, its largest acquisition by far and one that represents a new height in the frenzy to acquire popular technology start-ups, David Gelles and Vindu Goel write in DealBook.", "Facebook will pay $4 billion in cash and $12 billion worth of Facebook stock, with an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp employees and its founders, which would vest over the next four years and raise the cost of the deal to $19 billion.", "\u201cBy any measure, Facebook is paying a steep price for a service that is widely used internationally but is less known in the United States. WhatsApp does not sell advertising and has very little revenue. It charges users a flat fee of $1 a year to use the service, and the first year is free,\u201d Mr. Gelles and Mr. Goel write. The acquisition reflects \u201ca new strategy at Facebook: The company intends to acquire or build a family of applications instead of simply buttressing its core social network.\u201d", "\u201cBy some metrics, the cash and stock being paid for WhatsApp make it among the richest deals of all time. With 55 employees, WhatsApp is commanding a price equivalent to $344 million an employee, or about $28 a user. And it is the largest acquisition ever of a venture capital-backed start-up,\u201d they write.", "On sealing the deal: The two companies have held talks for two years, but the deal came together quickly. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, formally proposed a deal to buy WhatsApp over dinner with Jan Koum, WhatsApp\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, on Feb. 9.

Each company Facebook acquires is another hedge against the various public and private ways people choose to communicate. Instagram lets people share photos in a way Facebook\u2019s friending model wouldn\u2019t allow. WhatsApp lets people share messages in a way that\u2019s familiar to first-time feature phone and smartphone users \u2014 something Facebook can\u2019t boast.

His house had no electricity or hot water. His parents rarely talked on the phone in case it was tapped by the state. It sounds bad, but Mr. Koum still pines for the rural life he once lived, and it\u2019s one of the main reasons he\u2019s so vehemently against the hurly-burly of advertising.\u201d", "", "WHATSAPP, FROM THE ARCHIVES  |  From The Wall Street Journal, in December: \u201cWhatsApp has \u2018no plans to sell, I.P.O., exit, get new funding,\u2019 Mr. Koum said. \u2018Despite the fact that we\u2019re able to monetize today, we\u2019re not focused on monetization,\u2019 Mr. Koum said. \u2018We view monetization as five, 10 years down the road. We\u2019re trying to build a sustainable company that\u2019s here for the next 100 years.\u2019\u201d", "From The Guardian, in November: \u201cWhen mobile messaging apps such as WhatsApp first emerged in 2009, they looked like a threat to mobile carriers. Everyone from Vodafone to Dutch operator KPN was mentioning them in sales calls. Mobile operators are estimated to have lost $23bn in SMS revenue in 2012 due to messaging apps, which host free instant messages through a phone\u2019s data connection, which these days is often unlimited. Now these apps are becoming a threat to established social networks too.\u201d", "\u201cThe future for these messaging apps is still uncertain. Some in the industry expect buyouts from big Internet companies like Google, which was rumoured to have flirted with WhatsApp earlier this year. Facebook already has its own popular Messenger service, while Apple has iMessage \u2013 both are popular, but lack the gaming ambitions of Asian chat apps. Still, it is hard to imagine these players consolidating to create a global social network as big as Facebook.\u201d", "From the co-founder of WhatsApp Brian Acton\u2019s Twitter, in 2009: \u201cFacebook turned me down.

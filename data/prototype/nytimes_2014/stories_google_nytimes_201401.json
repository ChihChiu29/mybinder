Somewhat smaller gains arise from revenue-neutral corporate tax base broadening, specifically cutting the corporate tax rate to 9 percent and eliminating all corporate tax loopholes.

Elsewhere, I have proposed eliminating the corporate income tax, but making shareholders pay income taxes on their companies\u2019 profits as they accrue.

What do think about paying to advertise on Facebook?", "A: I think Facebook advertising works particularly well for retail businesses and businesses looking to use Facebook to drive online sales and bring new customers into their store. It also works well for content-driven businesses, like Huffington Post and Upworthy. But I think audiences exist elsewhere, too, and for the same time and effort, they would probably convert at a higher rate on other platforms.", "Q: Several small-business owners told us Facebook advertising was crucial for acquiring customers.", "A: I\u2019m generally hesitant to recommend Facebook because of their rules of engagement. To get into the game requires a greater investment of time and money than for other sites. To get significant traction, it\u2019s not just $5, it\u2019s at least $5 for every post. And even if you pay for lots of exposure, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re very good at messaging or have a good product or a compelling call to action. You could spend enough on Facebook to reach 100 percent of your audience and 300 percent beyond your audience. But if you send something to your email marketing list, you know you will reach 100 percent of that list without investing any money. There may be a billion people on Facebook but no business needs to reach a billion people. And every site you use has enough people on it to make a business double in size. If you\u2019re a restaurant, and you reach 200 people in a way that engages them, that\u2019s all you need to make a big difference in your business.", "Q: Is there a scenario where you think Facebook advertising can be useful?", "A: I think it\u2019s very good at raising visibility \u2014 letting the world know a business exists. That can generate positive R.O.I. in the short term. It\u2019s also effective if you\u2019re  trying to get those already in the mindset of purchasing to convert to purchasing, as long as you have the right messaging and the right product targeted at the right people.", "Q: What are some alternatives to Facebook for social media advertising?", "A: Depending on the type of business, there are often better places to build long-term loyalty. For restaurants, for example, it\u2019s all about Yelp reviews and word-of-mouth. The best marketing isn\u2019t a Facebook post about the restaurant; their best bet is to build their email list. For advertising, a better place for a restaurant is Foursquare.

With an elegant and easy-to-use interface, the messaging app attracted 50 million users within a year, and over the next two years reached nearly 300 million users worldwide.", "Weixin, technology experts say, has what every Internet company executive dreams about: stickiness.

But if Silk Road were scalable, that era was over. Or at least imperiled.

It could also be a coincidence that neither man nor pseudonym seemed motivated by greed. Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s lifestyle was one notch above that of urban couch surfer.

With aching sincerity, they both really wanted to help.", "Roads Closed?", "The success of Silk Road raised the prospect that the thuggish street drug dealer, the stock character of countless police procedurals, could be replaced by a geek in a coffee shop with a laptop.

Once Bitcoins are converted to another currency, the government can subpoena the records of the exchange where the transaction took place and harvest all the information it needs. \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t really a \u2018coin\u2019 as much as a distributed, public balance ledger,\u201d Mr. Weaver added, \u201cwith every balance and transaction recorded.\u201d", "Hence Bitcoin\u2019s wry new nickname in legal circles: \u201cProsecution Futures.\u201d The government has begun making arrests: Olivia Bolles, a Delaware doctor, was charged in November with selling oxycodone, Xanax and other drugs on Silk Road, stuffing Sour Patch and Jolly Rancher candy in the packages to thwart detection.", "But the limits of technology are only part of the reason that another Silk Road is unlikely anytime soon. To function, such a site needs a leader who is dedicated to the point of fanaticism, and, more important, has a strange kind of integrity.

It was the year when two of the most expensive and exquisite tasting-menu temples in the city, Per Se and Masa, opened their gilded doors on the fourth floor of a shopping mall. It was the year when a young chef named David Chang debuted a place called Momofuku Noodle Bar and gradually (after some false starts) began wowing the throngs with bowls of ramen and slabs of pork belly on fluffy steamed buns.", "Shall we go on? In 2004, the chef April Bloomfield and the music-business refugee Ken Friedman introduced New York to its first British-style gastropub, the Spotted Pig.

Suddenly it was not unreasonable to travel all the way up to Westchester County to experience hyper-local, farm-to-table gastronomy at its most fastidious in the warrens of Blue Hill at Stone Barns.", "Oh, and Danny Meyer, the restaurateur behind Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, made the crazy decision to open a burger stand.", "Before long, of course, Shake Shack would evolve into a growing national chain \u2014 and a paragon of the trend toward elevated fast food. Momofuku would turn into an international brand and Mr. Chang an empire-building star.

Which meant that deftly executed cooking might manifest itself in places that previously would have been dismissed as dives. \u201cI think that Freemans and Spotted Pig and Noodle Bar really, to me, speak to a driving interest in doing something different, something refreshing and something that\u2019s sort of invigorating,\u201d he said. \u201cFreemans \u2014 it\u2019s a restaurant down an alley with a bunch of taxidermy on the wall, a restaurant that\u2019s essentially like a ski lodge down an alley on the Lower East Side.

Though they have long been done with poetry \u2014 from Shakespeare to George Ella Lyon \u2014 the idea of using newspaper reporting was new to us, as was Mr. Vogelsinger\u2019s Google-Doc-based collaborative method. We also love his imaginative choice of a Times article to pair with a literary classic.", "Rationale", "Student writers crave mentor texts. They find them naturally. Students tend to write in the style of whatever authors capture their imagination, so chances are there is a tribe of writers in your classroom who, when given free rein in their Writer\u2019s Notebooks, will craft stories that sound a lot like Suzanne Collins or John Green wrote them as teenagers.", "And that\u2019s O.K.", "These students haven\u2019t found their own voices, so they are learning from the voices of writers who have. They adopt their structure and style. Anne Lamott, in her classic writing guide, \u201cBird by Bird,\u201d goes so far as to say that \u201cit is natural to take on someone else\u2019s style, that it\u2019s a prop you use for a while until you have to give it back. And it just might lead you to the thing that\u2019s not on loan \u2026 your own voice.\u201d", "Traditionally, however, most students encounter argument and analysis writing for their major assignments in any course, and without a nudge, students are unlikely to turn to articles, essays and editorials to help them stylistically with their academic writing. In the age of Common Core and an increased focus on nonfiction reading and writing, how can teachers employ mentor texts to train student writers in the more sophisticated structures, patterns and conventions of published nonfiction articles? Copy-change collaborations are one way.", "How to Set Up a Copy-Change Collaboration", "1. To employ this technique, start by finding an article with a structure and style that will help your students to write about the novel you are reading as a class. This could be an article with a related topic, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. In the example below, students write about the trial in \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d using as inspiration a New York Times article about viral news stories. If you want your students thinking about the central conflict in \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d don\u2019t settle for an article about gang warfare, find an article about conflict over elephant poaching in Kenya\u2019s wildlife preserves.", "2. Next, copy and paste the entire article into a Google Document. Cite your source with a link back to the original article, setting a good example for your students. Break the text into several two- or three-paragraph sections and insert a 1\u00d71 table underneath each section, creating a text box.", "3. Use the \u201cShare\u201d feature in the upper right corner of the screen on your Google Document to give editing rights to anyone with the link to your document, and then share that link with your class. This will allow all students with the link access to write on this document. I usually pair students for this activity, so there are two students to one computer in our school\u2019s computer lab.", "Here\u2019s where the fun begins.", "4. Have the students read the article all the way through, thinking about connections they might observe between the article and the book you are studying. Tell students that together, as a class, they will be writing an article about the chapters they just finished reading in their novel.", "5. Assign each pair of students to one section of the text. In the text box beneath that section of the article, they may begin reporting about their novel following the same structural patterns as the author of the original article. For example, if the paragraph in their assigned section begins with a quote from an eyewitness, then the students begin their paragraph with a quote from an eyewitness in the novel. When the article shifts into two sentences of imagery that tug at the readers\u2019 emotions, the students do likewise.", "Notes and Reflections", "The miracle of Google Drive is that it shows the work of all writers on the same document in real time. So a pair of students working to parallel the text in the lead can scroll down and watch how their friends are doing creating a parallel paragraph for the conclusion of the article. Not only do they have the model of the journalist\u2019s article, they also have the model of their classmates, a real-time glimpse inside each other\u2019s notebooks.", "Students are often proud to observe how easy it becomes to elevate their style of writing line by line as they give increased attention to the structural and stylistic choices the journalist uses to convey ideas. Moreover, once all students have completed their work, there is an excellent follow-up lesson waiting for you the next day. Since so many students had their hands in the draft as they paralleled the mentor text, there may have been information repeated or presented out of chronological order. By printing out the students\u2019 collaborative article the next day, the class can now examine how to revise for cohesion and logical development. What a valuable built-in lesson on revision!", "NOTE: Typically, we work with this activity in a computer lab at school; however, the collaboration is just as easy from home if students each know their assigned portion of the text. One accountability tip: Be aware of how the sharing features of Google Drive work. If students will be working from home, it may be best to invite them via their Google accounts to edit the document. This will allow you to see exactly who types or removes what on the document. If you are using the broader editing rights I describe above when I am working with my students in school, I often reset the document to \u201cView Only\u201d at the end of the school day so that students cannot go back in and make changes to our document after hours.", "How It Turned Out", "Below, the first few paragraphs from Mr. Vogelsinger\u2019s class collaboration that turned the Times article by Ravi Somaiya and Leslie Kaufman, \u201cIf a Story Is Viral, Truth May Be Taking a Beating,\u201d into a class-written piece, \u201cIf a Lie Is Accepted, Justice Takes a Beating.\u201d", "The original paragraph is printed first; then, indented below it, the class\u2019s version of each.", "To see the full piece, visit the original Google Doc.", "Times Article: Truth has never been an essential ingredient of viral content on the Internet.

But to the media outlets that published them, they represented the lightning-in-a-bottle brew of emotion and entertainment that attracts readers and brings in lucrative advertising dollars.", "Student Version: Recently many stories floating around town turned out to be a hoax. A tale of a feud between Miss Atkinson and Miss Maudie was later found to be a rumor started by Miss Maudie; a letter from Scout to Santa that detailed exactly where to find her gift using coordinates was written by Walter Cunningham; and an essay on roll-the-tire-down-the-street game caused many to donate thousands to help the children affected by injuries from the game was revealed to be a way to get money quick by Dill and Jem. Lately, a feud between Tom Robinson and Mayella Ewell has been attracting a lot of attention.", "Some stories, the writers say, should be taken as gossip or practical jokes, but the townsfolk that spread them say that the emotion and conflict attracts attention to pressing problems.", "Times Article: When the tales turned out to be phony, the modest hand-wringing that ensued was accompanied by an admission that viral trumps verified \u2014 and that little will be done about it as long as the clicks keep coming. \u201cYou are seeing news organizations say, \u2018If it is happening on the Internet that\u2019s our beat,\u2019 \u201d said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard. \u201cThe next step of figuring out whether it happened in real life is up to someone else.\u201d", "The difference seems to be that the news organizations that published the recent pieces \u2014 Gawker, BuzzFeed, The Huffington Post and Mashable among them \u2014 do not see invented viral tales as being completely at odds with the serious new content they publish alongside them.

Of course, websites like these are not the only news organizations to be seduced by stories that are too good to be true.

They\u2019ve done it before, and they will do it again,\u201d said Atticus Finch, a respected lawyer in Maycomb County, Alabama. \u201cThe next step to serving justice is to make sure the truth is recovered from the lies.\u201d", "The difference seems to be that the juries that have convicted men in recent trials \u2014 Walter Cunningham and other men from the Old Sarum among them \u2014 do not see deceptive testimonies for what they truly are against legitimate events told by a black man.

It\u2019s less about drifting down the stream, absorbing what you can while you float, and more about trying to make the flashiest raft to float on, gathering fans and accolades as you go.", "How did this happen?", "A theory: The psychology of crowd dynamics may work differently on Twitter than it does on other social networks and systems. As a longtime user of the service with a sizable audience, I think the number of followers you have is often irrelevant. What does matter, however, is how many people notice you, either through retweets, favorites or the holy grail, a retweet by someone extremely well known, like a celebrity. That validation that your contribution is important, interesting or worthy is enough social proof to encourage repetition. Many times, that results in one-upmanship, straining to be the loudest or the most retweeted and referred to as the person who captured the splashiest event of the day in the pithiest way.", "As a result, recency trumps relevancy, which is how a single, relatively insignificant news event can exasperate much of an entire community over the course of a day.

We\u2019re sold on the idea that if we\u2019re good enough, it could be our ticket to success, landing us a fleeting spot in a round-up on BuzzFeed or The Huffington Post, or at best, a writing gig.

Increasingly, I\u2019ve found myself retreating to smaller groups, where the stakes are lower and people are more honest and less determined to prove a point, freer to joke and experiment, more trusting in one other and open to real conversation.", "Twitter once felt more like an electric news wire, with reports coming in from all over the globe, of places and things, experiences and people, and I still want it to be that same place. It can still feel like that, particularly during major news events that are developing in real-time. That\u2019s when Twitter shines as a new medium, when we are all sharing and devouring each new tidbit offered up by sources on the ground, news anchors, rogue eye-witnesses, wry commentators. But the exhilaration of those times may have conditioned us to treat even the smallest incident as one worth dissecting, regurgitating and examining to death.

Is it not able to handle the complexity of the many threads of conversation happening at once across the system? Perhaps.

The company is experimenting with accounts that highlight tweets or accounts that people in your network have recently started following. In the new version of the mobile application, Twitter also serves up notifications when people you follow start chatting about a particular topic, like a television show or sporting event, an informative and useful development.

By Election Day, the leadership committee would raise $30 million, its biggest two-year haul ever.", "The bulk of that money went into a carefully laid assault on Democratic lawmakers in 19 states, planned in tandem with efforts by the Republican Governors Association. In some states, the groups handed cash directly to state parties or candidates. Elsewhere, they spent millions on hard-to-track radio and television advertisements.", "The leadership committee\u2019s nationwide base of donors lent candidates distance from the source of the money benefiting them, and allowed the committee to maneuver around varying rules that apply to campaign spending in different states. Instead of spending money where it was raised, the Republican State Leadership Committee could allocate checks to affiliates in other states. Other checks could be pooled into a central fund in Washington and then distributed in large chunks to state Republican Parties, to candidates or to campaigns by independent groups.", "Alabama was an obvious target. Long after its voters had become overwhelmingly Republican, Alabama retained Democratic majorities in the Legislature. Mr. Hubbard, himself a state representative, and officials at the leadership committee believed just one well-organized push would send the Democrats into permanent minority status.", "Yet state law prohibited corporations from giving more than $500. And other potential donors were unwilling to give to the party at all, in case the takeover effort failed. \u201cThere were a lot of people and companies who didn\u2019t want to give to us directly because they feared the Democrats,\u201d Mr. Hubbard said.", "Many of those donors were willing, however, to give to a Republican group in Washington. After meeting with leadership committee officials, Mr. Hubbard, along with his finance chairman, State Senator Del Marsh, began raising money for the group. If they did well enough, Mr. Hubbard believed, the leadership committee would make a similar investment in Alabama.", "\u201cWe had to become players for them,\u201d said Mr. Hubbard. \u201cTheir job is to flip legislatures, and we wanted them to help us flip Alabama.\u201d", "During the 2010 cycle, the leadership committee took in close to a million dollars from Alabama donors. And over the same period, the group directed about $1.4 million into an Alabama-registered political action committee, all of it from out-of-state corporations. Because the state allowed unlimited transfers between political action committees and parties \u2014 a loophole long exploited by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 the leadership committee could shuffle all of that money to the state party and a pair of committees controlled by Mr. Hubbard and his team.", "The arrangement also offered donors a way to help Mr. Hubbard without their checks showing up on the Alabama party\u2019s public filings. One such supporter was the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, which operates several large casinos on tribal land in Alabama.", "The tribe was wary of the rapid expansion of non-Indian gambling in the state, particularly the proliferation of small bingo parlors competing with their resort casinos, and stood to benefit if antigambling Republicans took control of the Legislature. But precisely because they opposed gambling, few Republican state lawmakers or candidates would accept the tribe\u2019s contributions.", "After meeting with Mr. Marsh and other Republicans, said Robert R. McGhee, director of government affairs for the tribe, the tribe chose a different approach: It donated $350,000 to the leadership committee. When the contributions were later disclosed, critics accused Mr. Hubbard of using the Washington group to launder the money by exchanging it with other contributions.", "A spokesman for the leadership committee said that the Poarch Creek contributions had been allocated to the group\u2019s administrative account, to pay for overhead and other expenses, and that the staff members involved in arranging the checks no longer worked at the organization. Mr. Hubbard said there had been no agreement to directly swap cash.", "\u201cThe conversation was, \u2018I\u2019ve got some people in Alabama who are very interested in giving money to help elect Republicans to state legislatures, and I would hope that if we help raise money for you, you will help us win in Alabama,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Hubbard said.", "Swap or no swap, public records suggest that many of the contributions the leadership committee raised in Alabama made their way to races in other states.", "About $260,000 from Alabama donors, for example, was assigned to a Pennsylvania account originally set up to collect checks from federal political action committees. (Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that allow such contributions to be spent directly on state races.) But none of the money raised was spent in Pennsylvania. Instead, the Alabama contributions were pooled with hundreds of thousands of dollars in political action committee checks and individual contributions from around the country. Beginning in August 2010, the leadership committee transferred $860,000 from the Pennsylvania account to the Republican Party in Iowa to assist its candidates.", "The Republican Governors Association made similar transfers. In Michigan, for example, a political action committee set up by the governors association raised $8.4 million. Virtually all of it came from a roster of elite donors outside Michigan, such as Bob Perry, the Texas homebuilder, and David Koch, the billionaire industrialist. Most of that money was transferred to the Michigan Republican Party.", "While out-of-state donors were funneling millions of dollars into Michigan, Republicans were sending millions of dollars back out to the governors association in Washington. All told, Michigan donors contributed $8.5 million to the association. That is roughly as much as the group spent on independent advertisements to help elect the Republican candidate for governor, Rick Snyder, on top of the money transferred directly for the Michigan party.", "Rich Robinson, the head of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, a watchdog group, said he believed the transactions were designed in part to allow Michigan businesses, which could not give directly to Mr. Snyder, to exchange their contributions for money from out-of-state individual donors, who could legally donate. \u201cIt appeared to be a currency swap to obfuscate the actual sources of money,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cI had never seen anything like this before, particularly at this scale.\u201d", "More than $5 million of the Michigan money raised by the governors association, for example, was a corporate money from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce. Two million dollars of that went to association affiliates in Maine and Florida, where corporate contributions are legal.", "A spokesman for the governors association, Jon Thompson, said that all of its contributions had been disclosed in campaign filings and that the association made sure its transfer stayed within each state\u2019s restrictions on the size and source of contributions. \u201cThe R.G.A. raises funds to elect and support Republican governors,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, \u201cand we invest that money in full compliance of the law wherever we see any opportunity to make a difference in accomplishing our objective.\u201d", "Only when the dust from the 2010 elections settled did the full scale of the Republicans\u2019 success become clear.", "The governors association spent $99 million and ended with Republican control of 29 governorships, up from 23, the highest number for either party in a decade. Republicans controlled 25 legislatures around the country, up from 14, including in pivotal swing states such as North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In Alabama, Republicans won supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature. Mr. Hubbard\u2019s colleagues elected him speaker of the Assembly, while Mr. Marsh became Senate leader.", "The Alabama Republican Party\u2019s finances during that period have since come under scrutiny: Some of the party\u2019s records have been subpoenaed by the Alabama attorney general, Luther Strange, a Republican, though the scope of his office\u2019s inquiry is unclear, and Mr. Hubbard has denied any wrongdoing.", "But the impact of Republican governance in Alabama has been undeniable. In the party\u2019s first year in control, the Legislature passed \u2014 and the governor signed \u2014 more than 30 major pieces of legislation, including new tax breaks for businesses, ethics overhauls and restrictions on abortion and union organizing.", "The Gay-Rights Battle", "In May 2012, a former congressional aide named Kirk Fordham stood at the front of a packed ballroom in the basement of the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington, a few blocks from the Jefferson Memorial. Before him sat more than a hundred of the country\u2019s leading gay donors and advocates, all of whom had pledged to keep the proceedings confidential.", "It was the third day of an annual conference known as OutGiving, organized by the Gill Action Fund, a Denver-based group, and Mr. Fordham, the group\u2019s executive director, was clicking through a presentation known as \u201cpunishing the wicked.\u201d As the donors watched, Mr. Fordham scrolled through names, pictures and, in some cases, videos of state lawmakers and other elected officials, each one an opponent of gay-rights legislation. All would be targeted for defeat.", "Founded by a press-shy software entrepreneur named Tim Gill, the fund had racked up a string of wins in state races, helping elect dozens of lawmakers who supported gay rights \u2014 or unseating their opponents \u2014 in Iowa, Colorado and New York. In 2012, Mr. Fordham\u2019s presentation showed, Minnesota was rich with potential targets.", "Two years earlier, Republicans had won an upset victory there, taking control of the State Senate and the State House for the first time in nearly four decades. The new Republican majorities had sought to enact a wave of conservative or pro-business policies, battling with the new Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, over tax cuts, education spending and a measure to rein in unions.", "One bill in particular had the Gill Action Fund\u2019s attention. Minnesota already had a law on the books banning same-sex marriage. But over Mr. Dayton\u2019s objections, Republican lawmakers had put a question on the November ballot asking voters to enshrine that ban in the State Constitution, making it less vulnerable to repeal.", "Other deep-pocketed gay-rights groups, both in Minnesota and around the country, were already mobilizing to defeat the marriage initiative. The Gill group had a complementary goal: helping Democrats win back the Legislature, so that Republicans would not get a second chance.", "By the spring of 2012, two strategists for the group had already spent weeks in Minnesota, traveling to swing legislative districts, sorting through turnout data and gauging the quality of the candidates Democrats were recruiting. But the state has some of the lowest donation limits in the country. A candidate for State Assembly could accept only up to $500 from individuals, unions or political action committees.", "So instead of cutting a few big checks, the fund picked a handful of candidates and then organized a blizzard of small contributions to them from dozens of donors. As Election Day neared, out-of-state contributions began to flow into the campaign accounts of seven Democratic candidates for the Minnesota Legislature. The checks came from Philadelphia, from Los Angeles and San Francisco, from New York City and the Hudson Valley \u2014 at least 200 contributions in all from at least 50 donors around the country, each one at or under the state\u2019s limit.", "Kevin Dahle, a Democratic candidate for Senate facing an uphill campaign in a mostly rural part of Minnesota, raised almost a fifth of his campaign chest from out-of-state gay-rights supporters. Paul Rosenthal, running in a House district in suburban Minneapolis, received about a quarter of his contributions from the same list of donors.", "While Mr. Gill\u2019s team organized contributions directly to candidates, it was also joining up with one of the most successful state-based political operations anywhere in the country: a liberal nonprofit group called the Alliance for a Better Minnesota.", "Two years earlier, the alliance had played a pivotal role in helping make Mr. Dayton governor, in part by persuading an array of outside interests \u2014 unions, abortion-rights supporters and environmental groups \u2014 to pool money and coordinate their political spending.", "A handful of big in-state donors anchored the alliance\u2019s fund-raising, led by Minnesota labor unions and Alida Messinger, a wealthy philanthropist and Rockefeller heiress formerly married to Mr. Dayton. The commitments by in-state donors, and the prospect of giving Democrats control of state government, in turn helped draw out-of-state money for 2012. While the state Democratic Party paid for direct mail and radio ads, the alliance organized a major campaign of television and Internet advertising.", "Because the Alliance for a Better Minnesota is a nonprofit organization, not a campaign committee, it is not required to disclose a full roster of its donors. But state law requires the group to disclose sources of funding for its political spending, providing a glimpse of how the 2012 effort was financed.", "Ms. Messinger contributed a total of $1.3 million, both directly and through two other fund-raising committees set up to manage donations. An additional $937,000 \u2014 about a quarter of the total raised \u2014 came from out-of-state donors, among them the National Education Association, the teachers union, and a Washington-based organization called America Votes. Three donors affiliated with the Gill Fund provided $90,000.", "The fund and other national gay-rights groups also raised millions of dollars from out of state for efforts to defeat the anti-gay-marriage initiative. Separately, another Washington-based group, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, contributed $400,000 to help finance a joint polling and research effort for the alliance and the Democratic Party. The committee, which raises money from unions, wealthy individuals and corporations to help elect Democratic state lawmakers, also contributed $700,000 directly to the state party to help elect legislative candidates, making it one of the party\u2019s largest donors.", "By Election Day, Democratic candidates and committees had amassed a nearly unprecedented cash advantage over the Republicans. The alliance poured an additional $2.5 million in advertising into 32 races. Democrats won all but six, picking up majorities in both chambers of the Legislature.", "In May 2013, Minnesota became the 12th state to legalize same-sex marriage.

North Carolina, a state won by Mr. Obama in 2008, has since become one of the country\u2019s foremost laboratories of aggressive conservative policy making.", "In Colorado, a state where voters outlawed same-sex marriage a half-decade ago and Republican voters outnumber Democrats, Democrats swept to full control of state government in 2012. Over the last year, they have enacted sweeping changes on gun control, marijuana legalization and civil unions. Some of the legislation has provoked a fierce reaction from voters: Two Democratic state senators who supported the gun-control bill were ousted in recall elections in September, while a third recently resigned to avoid being forced into a recall vote.", "\u201cThere\u2019s undoubtedly more interest in what\u2019s happening in the states right now,\u201d said Michael Sargeant, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which raised significantly more money in 2012 than in any previous cycle since its founding. \u201cThere is less of a knee-jerk need among some donors that their contributions need to stay in their state.\u201d", "This year, Republicans are targeting states like West Virginia.

Last spring, the Democracy Alliance began a $10 million State Initiatives Fund, aimed at building liberal organizations and winning back legislative seats in 12 states, including North Carolina and Florida. In Maine, a consortium of progressive groups financed by the hedge fund billionaire S. Donald Sussman, an alliance member, is looking to unseat Gov. Paul R.

The Circle is a social networking firm with an Edenic campus and a totalitarian grip on its employees\u2019 lives; it forces them to socialize online at a dizzying pace, constantly messaging, friending, liking and answering surveys. In this novel, 21st-century capitalism has gone far beyond \u201cMetropolis\u201d and \u201cModern Times.\u201d The digital masters turn even personal lives into hard labor, and so all hours are suddenly working hours. Private space disappears as people make themselves \u201ctransparent,\u201d recording and posting their lives for thousands, even millions, of \u201cfriends.\u201d", "In Eggers\u2019s hellish future world, anyone who\u2019s anyone measures her self-worth through the easily quantified markers supplied by social media networks: How many hits, how many thumbs-up, did you get today? Some of us are already living in this world, at least a good part of the time.

Making your way through a long, realist novel means taking a journey with another self; you look into people\u2019s inner lives as you could never do by watching a three-minute iPhone video.", "The Circle works as a powerful warning to our culture. True, Eggers can\u2019t seem to create convincing characters, but this seems somehow right for his theme. Two things are missing in his novel: the private self and books.

You have to wield the truth with care.\u201d He eventually shared the story with her, and later his book. Her response: \u201cIt\u2019s the best gift you could ever have given me. It\u2019s the truth, and for 40 years I\u2019ve had questions that I was afraid to ask.\u201d", "Unlike Mr. Hainey, Emma Brockes knew that her mother was harboring a secret. As a girl growing up in London, Ms. Brockes listened to her mother tell elaborate, often violent tales about her upbringing in South Africa. One featured element: a pistol.

Her grandfather was a convicted murderer and an active child molester whom her mother had gotten arrested and taken to court. After a lurid public trial, he escaped the charges, and her mother fled to London to escape him. As for the gun, Ms. Brockes said: \u201cMy mother, very classic, had been glib and jaunty about it. She\u2019d not told me the real reason she had it, which was to protect herself from that maniac of a father.\u201d Ms. Brockes\u2019s mother even used the gun on one occasion to shoot him. \u201cBut she was absolutely useless at the task,\u201d her daughter recalled. \u201cShe fired it five or six times and failed to kill him.\u201d (He declined to press charges.)", "Ms. Brockes, who chronicled this story in a memoir, \u201cShe Left Me the Gun,\u201d which was also published last year, said she was grateful her mother shielded her from the truth. \u201cI had an incredibly normal childhood,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother\u2019s aim, always, was to keep me from incorporating any of the noxious stuff in her background into my identity.\u201d Family, she added, will always be a bastion of secrecy. \u201cWe might tell the world everything about ourselves, but we won\u2019t tell our parents or our children.\u201d", "Selena Roberts learned a similar lesson recently from her mother.

Those are where the secrets lie.\u201d", "In Ms. Roberts\u2019s case, it\u2019s clear her mother wanted to keep certain things secret but also wanted her children to find out after she died.

After his mother died, Mr. Goldberg wanted to track down the identities of the women in the fraying photograph. The records of Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Israel, had just been made available online, and Mr. Goldberg typed in his father\u2019s name. He found a note handwritten by his father in the early 1950s as well as a second account written by another person unknown to him that documented the death of a woman named Chaya Holzberg Goldberg and her two daughters.

He was an extremely strong person. Very quiet, very loving. It\u2019s not a weird thing for survivors to say: \u2018We went through so much pain. I don\u2019t want my kids to know.\u2019 \u201d", "Yet he did want his family to know in the end. He understood, as so many secret-keepers seem to do, that certain truths deserved to be shared, even if the sharer can\u2019t do it directly. Maybe that is one legacy of this age of no more secrets: Whereas once these secrets may have been buried in the grave, now they keep speaking even after the grave has been sealed.", "And sometimes those secrets, long feared as too painful, bring comfort to those who learn them.

But the genius of Trove is how it decides what to put in that topic feed.", "At its most basic, the app highlights recent stories from 15,000 sources that have been ranked for both their authority and popularity by Trove\u2019s half-dozen human editors, led by Sandy Sugawara, a former assistant managing editor at The Post. Its algorithm can also give a lift to topics that are popular among your Facebook friends and Twitter connections if you give it permission to tap into your social networks.", "But Trove really counts on its users to help it find the best content to pop to the top of the feed. Users are encouraged to create their own troves by curating the best stories on any topic that interests them. Anyone can follow those troves, benefiting from the perspective of the curator, and those picks also filter into other troves curated by others on the same topic.", "\u201cYou can do a better job picking the one or two stories that are important than a computer can,\u201d said Vijay Ravindran, the chief digital officer of Graham Holdings and chief executive of Trove. \u201cThe goal of Trove is connecting people who have an interest in topics with the best people who are curating that topic.\u201d", "The app will feature troves curated by various celebrities. For example, Spike Mendelsohn, a former \u201cTop Chef\u201d contestant, is managing the trove \u201cFarm To Table.\u201d And Vivek Wadhwa, an academic and tech entrepreneur, is overseeing one on technology.", "But Trove makes it simple for anyone to become a curator. First, name your topic, write a brief description and describe what search terms you want Trove to use to suggest stories for it. Then as the stories come in, you pick the ones to add to the trove, adding a short comment if you choose. You can also share your finds and comments on Twitter and Facebook at the same time.", "It took me just a couple of minutes on Monday to start troves on three companies I follow \u2014 Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo. Trove\u2019s algorithms quickly pulled in recent articles and blog posts about all three, and with a few clicks, I curated several stories for each trove. When I checked back in the next day, there were more stories on each topic for me to look through and curate.", "I was surprised at both the high quality of the articles the algorithm put forward for my consideration as well as how recently they had been posted. In essence, Trove offered me something close to the speed of Twitter but with precise targeting by topic so I didn\u2019t have to wade through hundreds of off-topic tweets.", "Mr. Ravindran envisions that there will be competing troves on the same topic \u2014 say, Exxon and the Sierra Club curating articles about hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas. \u201cThey would have very different angles on the topic,\u201d he said. Readers could look at the news through whatever lens appealed to them, or switch curators the way they switch news channels or sites now.", "Trove is hardly alone in the field of curation apps. But despite much innovation, no one has yet created one with the holy trinity: ease of use, quality and flexibility.", "Flipboard, the most popular, pulls in articles from various news source and blogs chosen by each user, along with their Twitter and Facebook feeds, but its equivalent of curated troves, which it calls magazines, are harder for other users to discover.", "Another app, Prismatic, which was overhauled in December, trawls through various news sources for content but tends to be less timely and lacks the curation element.", "And N3twork, a nascent service that I wrote about last month, has similar goals to Trove but relies on users to do all the work. There is no good feed from which to start picking things to share.", "Trove also differs from the mass social networks like Twitter and Facebook, which are generally sorted by who is posting, not by topic.", "Rob Malda, a co-founder of Slashdot, the pioneering website for curating tech news, is head of product at Trove, and he says the app allows people to choose the right audience to share each of their passions.", "\u201cI am a bottomless pit of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 news,\u201d he said. He curates a trove of news about the movie franchise, which he doesn\u2019t necessarily want to share with all of his Twitter followers. Nor do fellow \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans want to see his trove about the Detroit Tigers.", "The Trove app, which will be available for Apple devices and on the web, replaces the old Social Reader app from The Post and will start with an instant base of the one million or so monthly users of Social Reader, who will be switched over to Trove accounts.", "Trove says that most news sites and blogs in its service are pulled up in such a way that the original sites get credit for the page views and ads seen by visitors. The company does get a share of advertising revenue from about 100 partners whose content is syndicated on the web version. But revenue is not a top priority right now.", "At the moment, Trove is being funded by the deep pockets of Graham Holdings. Mr. Graham, the chairman and chief executive of the family controlled company, has been very supportive of the project, Mr. Ravindran said.", "Trove\u2019s success will depend on the ability of users to easily find relevant troves (how do you sort through 150 different \u201cStar Wars\u201d troves?) as well as their willingness to help pick the best material out of the flow. Also, if the app is going to become a big tool for people who are already influential curators, the company will have to figure out how to better import and export content from websites and social networks so that curators can maintain their own independent online personas while also contributing to Trove."], "https://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/today-in-small-business-anticipatory-shipping/": ["", "What\u2019s affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners today.", "Today\u2019s Best Read", "Amazon", "Start-Up", "Employees", "The Economy", "Cash Flow", "Marketing", "Around the Country", "Around the World", "Technology", "Gene Marks owns the Marks Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., a consulting firm that helps clients with customer relationship management.

Other investors had no luck; they bid up Citic 21CN\u2019s shares about 370 percent in a single day.", "People speculated that the rise was because Alibaba\u2019s investment in the company was a \u201cbackdoor listing.\u201d", "In a public filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Citic 21N stated that the acquisition \u201cmay involve the possible injection of certain complimentary businesses by\u201d Alibaba. This may have also spurred the backdoor I.P.O. speculation.", "Frankly, if this is why people bid up Alibaba\u2019s stock fourfold, it seems a silly assumption.", "Some have been speculating that Alibaba may want a backdoor I.P.O. because the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has refused to waive its \u201cone share, one vote\u201d rules. Such a waiver would allow Alibaba to complete an I.P.O. on the exchange with a structure that would keep control with its founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, and a handful of top people at the company. It has been intimated by people close to Alibaba that it may move its I.P.O. to the United States or another location with more permissive rules.", "Talk of Alibaba\u2019s possible move to the United States has apparently prompted the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to show signs that it may waiver from its opposition. Recent reports are that the exchange is considering a public debate on whether to keep these rules.", "But if the Hong Kong Stock Exchange doesn\u2019t cave to pressure, does anyone think that Alibaba could surreptitiously shove billions of assets into Citic 21CN without the Hong Kong Stock Exchange saying something? The same rules barring Alibaba\u2019s share structure would apply to Citic 21CN if Alibaba tried to use it as a backdoor listing.", "The rationale for this frenzy seems overblown, but the fact that it happened highlights perhaps a bigger issue. Alibaba\u2019s acquisition was structured in a manner as if it were intended to incite speculation, which only heightens concerns over how this company will be run after its I.P.O. if it remains controlled by Mr. Ma and his colleagues.", "Alibaba did not solely purchase this stake in Citic 21CN. Alibaba\u2019s partner was Yunfeng Capital, a private equity firm also co-founded by Mr. Ma. Yunfeng is focused on investing in Chinese telecommunications, technology and health care companies. When the purchase clears Chinese regulatory authorities, Yunfeng will own 16.2 percent and Alibaba 38.1 percent of Citic 21CN.", "Why would Alibaba acquire control of Citic 21CN with Mr. Ma\u2019s private equity firm instead of going it alone? Certainly, it had the capital. If Alibaba, which underwent an $8 billion debt refinancing last year, can\u2019t afford a $171 million purchase, then it has bigger problems.", "When the transaction was announced, Alibaba did not explain why it acquired this stake with Yunfeng.", "When asked for comment, a representative of Alibaba directed me to the initial news release announcing the transaction.", "In the absence of a compelling reason, the acquisition raised the question of whether Mr. Ma was benefiting from his ties to Alibaba. The e-commerce company is providing capital and expertise to Citic 21CN, and to the extent Alibaba uses its huge network in China to help the company, then Mr. Ma\u2019s private equity fund firm will also benefit.", "Mr. Ma has announced that his profits from Yunfeng will be donated to charity to benefit the Chinese environment, but the private equity firm will still benefit from the deal.", "It is hard to think how this would play out if Alibaba were listed in the United States. In 2007, when Google Ventures invested about $3.9 million in 23andMe, the company founded by Sergey Brin\u2019s wife at the time, Anne Wojcicki, Google was criticized for investing in a start-up of a founder\u2019s wife. That was only a few million dollars.", "The bigger question may be why Alibaba would acquire such a sleepy company.", "In a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Citic 21CN states that Alibaba\u2019s intention is to develop Citic\u2019s \u201cdomestic drug data platform as well as to develop a data standard for medical and health care products.\u201d", "Perhaps this business has promise, but it is not even Citic 21CN\u2019s biggest. Drugs are a new area for the company and accounted for about 3 percent of its revenue of $63 million in its last fiscal year.", "You might think that paying a huge amount for a company with little revenue is par for the course for an Internet giant. But Citic 21CN was not known for having a particularly compelling technology or vision. (It doesn\u2019t even have an active website.) Indeed, if Citic 21CN were such a great company, you would have thought that Alibaba would have paid a premium to buy it. Alternatively, why not just buy the drug business itself rather than paying for the other businesses, too? Or spend $171 million to build a drug business yourself?", "This leaves the Citic 21CN investment as puzzling.", "This all may be well and good, because Alibaba is a private company now. Once it is public, however, Alibaba\u2019s practices may fall under more scrutiny. If Mr. Ma and his colleagues keep control of the company, one has to wonder what this means for public shareholders. Will Alibaba continue to enter into deals with affiliates of Mr. Ma, and if it does, will it be for companies like this?", "To be fair, hype around the next big company tends to cause frenzied speculation. We saw this with the Facebook I.P.O. Alibaba may also be prone to be more open about its dealings once it has public shareholders. It has already moved to resemble the corporate structure of a Western company and is a model in China for corporate governance.", "But the scrutiny is only going to get worse for Alibaba as it heads toward a public listing. Once Alibaba does go public, it no longer has the luxury of being coy about its actions, no matter how small. That\u2019s the price you pay for being in the limelight, up among the technology giants of the world."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/science/the-brain-in-exquisite-detail.html": ["ST.

They are more than a third of the way through collecting information. Then comes the processing of data, incorporating it into a three-dimensional, interactive map of the healthy human brain showing structure and function, with detail to one and a half cubic millimeters, or less than 0.0001 cubic inches.", "Dr. Barch is explaining the dimensions of the task, and the reasons for undertaking it, as she stands in a small room, where multiple monitors are set in front of a window that looks onto an adjoining room with an M.R.I. machine, in the psychology building. She asks a research assistant to bring up an image. \u201cIt\u2019s all there,\u201d she says, reassuring a reporter who has just emerged from the machine, and whose brain is on display.", "And so it is, as far as the parts are concerned: cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and all the other regions and subregions, where memories, fear, speech and calculation occur. But this is just a first go-round. It is a static image, in black and white. There are hours of scans and tests yet to do, though the reporter is doing only a demonstration and not completing the full routine.", "Each of the 1,200 subjects whose brain data will form the final database will spend a good 10 hours over two days being scanned and doing other tests. The scientists and technicians will then spend at least another 10 hours analyzing and storing each person\u2019s data to build something that neuroscience does not yet have: a baseline database for structure and activity in a healthy brain that can be cross-referenced with personality traits, cognitive skills and genetics. And it will be online, in an interactive map available to all.", "Dr. Helen Mayberg, a doctor and researcher at the Emory University School of Medicine, who has used M.R.I. research to guide her development of a treatment for depression with deep brain stimulation, a technique that involves surgery to implant a pacemaker-like device in the brain, is one of the many scientists who could use this sort of database to guide her research. With it, she said, she can ask, \u201chow is this really critical node connected\u201d to other parts of the brain, information that will inform future research and surgery.", "The database and brain map are a part of the Human Connectome Project, a roughly $40 million five-year effort supported by the National Institutes of Health. It consists of two consortiums: a collaboration among researchers at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, which moved last year to the University of Southern California from U.C.L.A., to improve M.R.I. technology and the $30 million project Dr. Barch is part of, involving Washington University, the University of Minnesota and the University of Oxford.", "Dr. Barch is a psychologist by training and inclination who has concentrated on neuroscience because of the desire to understand severe mental illness. Her role in the project has been in putting together the battery of cognitive and psychological tests that go along with the scans, and overseeing their administration. This is the information that will give depth and significance to the images.", "She said the central question the data might help answer was, \u201cHow do differences between you and me, and how our brains are wired up, relate to differences in our behaviors, our thoughts, our emotions, our feelings, our experiences?\u201d", "And, she added, \u201cDoes that help us understand how disorders of connectivity, or disorders of wiring, contribute to or cause neurological problems and psychiatric problems?\u201d", "The Human Connectome Project is one of a growing number of large, collaborative information-gathering efforts that signal a new level of excitement in neuroscience, as rapid technological advances seem to be bringing the dream of figuring out the human brain into the realm of reality.", "Worldwide Study", "In Europe, the Human Brain Project has been promised $1 billion for computer modeling of the human brain. In the United States last year, President Obama announced an initiative to push brain research forward by concentrating first on developing new technologies. This so-called Grand Challenge has been promised $100 million of financing for the first year of what is anticipated to be a decade-long push. The money appears to be real, but it may come from existing budgets, and not from any increase for the federal agencies involved.", "A vast amount of research is already going on \u2014 so much that the neuroscience landscape is almost as difficult to encompass as the brain itself. The National Institutes of Health alone spends $5.5 billion a year on neuroscience, much of it directed toward research on diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.", "A variety of private institutes emphasize basic research that may not have any immediate payoff. For instance, at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Janelia Farm in Virginia, part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and at numerous universities, researchers are trying to understand how neurons compute \u2014 what the brains of mice, flies and human beings do with their information. The Allen Institute is now spending $60 million a year and Janelia Farm about $30 million a year on brain research. The Kavli Foundation has committed $4 million a year for 10 years, and the Salk Institute in San Diego plans to spend a total of $28 million on new neuroscience research.

The 1990s were anointed the decade of the brain by President George H. W. Bush. Strides were made, but many aspects of the brain have remained mysterious.", "There is, however, a good reason for the current excitement, and that is accelerating technological change that the most sanguine of brain mappers compare to the growing ability to sequence DNA that led to the Human Genome Project.", "Optogenetics is one new technique that has been transformative. It uses light to turn on different parts of the brain in laboratory animals to open and shut modified genes. Powerful developments in microscopy made possible movies of brain activity in living animals.

Much was unknown or mislabeled. \u201cNow our characterizations are more like an 18th-century map.\u201d", "The continents, mountain ranges and rivers are getting more clearly defined. His hope, he said, is that the Human Connectome Project will be a step toward vaulting through the 19th and 20th centuries and reaching something more like Google Maps, which is interactive and has many layers.", "Researchers may not be looking for the best sushi restaurants or how to get from one side of Los Angeles to the other while avoiding traffic, but they will eventually be looking for traffic flow, particularly popular routes for information, and matching traffic patterns to the tasks the brain is doing. They will also be asking how differences in the construction of the pathways that make up the brain\u2019s roads relate to differences in behavior, intelligence, emotion and genetics.", "The power of computers and mathematical tools devised for analyzing vast amounts of data made such maps possible. The gathering tool of choice at Washington University is an M.R.I. machine customized at the University of Minnesota.", "An M.R.I. machine creates a magnetic field surrounding the body part to be scanned, and sends radio waves into the body. Unlike X-rays, which are known to pose some dangers, M.R.I. scans are considered to be safe. It is one of the few methods of noninvasive scanning that can survey a whole human brain.", "There are a variety of ways to gather and interpret information in an M.R.I. machine. And different types of scans can show both basic structure and activity. When a volunteer is trying to solve a memory problem, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex are all going to be involved. An M.R.I. machine can detect the direction of information flow, in a technique called diffusion imaging. In that kind of scan, the movement of water molecules shows not only activity, but which way the traffic is headed.", "A Path to Research", "For Dr. Barch, 48, another kind of interest in the human brain put her on the path to Washington University. \u201cI always knew I wanted to be a psychologist,\u201d she said \u2014 specifically, a school psychologist. But as an undergraduate at Northwestern, she excelled in an abnormal psychology class, and the professor recruited her to do research.", "\u201cWhen I graduated from college, I decided to become a case manager for the chronically mentally ill for a year to kind of suss out, \u2018Do I want to do more clinical work or research?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThat was a great experience, but it really made me realize that research is the only way you\u2019re going to have an impact on many lives, rather than sort of individual lives.\u201d", "She obtained her Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. but then did postdoctoral study in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Her years in graduate school in the 1990s coincided with the development and use of the so-called functional M.R.I., which can show not just static structure, but the brain in action.", "\u201cI got into the field when functional imaging was just at its very beginning, so I was able to learn on the ground floor,\u201d she said.", "She moved to Washington University after her postdoctoral research partly because of the number of people there working on imaging, including Dr. Marcus E. Raichle, a pioneer in developing ways of watching the brain at work.", "As a professor at Washington University and a leader of one of five teams there working on the Human Connectome Project, Dr. Barch focuses her research on the way individual differences in the brains of healthy people are related to differences in personality or thinking.", "For instance she said, people doing memory tasks in the M.R.I. machine may differ in competitiveness and commitment to doing well. That ought to show up in activity in the parts of the brain that involve emotion, like the amygdala. However, she points out that the object of the Connectome Project is not to find the answers to these questions, but to provide the database for others to try to do so.", "\u2018Pretty Close\u2019", "The project at Washington University requires exhaustive scans of 1,200 healthy people, age 22 to 35, each of whom spends about four hours over two days lying in the noisy, claustrophobia-inducing cylinder of a customized M.R.I. machine. Sometimes they stare at one spot, curl their toes or move their fingers. They might play gambling games, or try memory tests that can flummox even the sharpest minds.", "\u201cIn an ideal world, we would have enough tasks to activate every part of the brain,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got pretty close.

The results are confidential, as are all the test results.", "So far almost 500 subjects have gone through the full range of tests, which amounts to about 5,000 hours of work for Dr. Barch and others in the program.", "So far, data has been released for 238 subjects, and it is available to everyone for free through a web-based database and software program called Workbench.", "The sharing of data is characteristic of most of the new brain research efforts, and particularly important to Dr. Barch.", "\u201cThe amount of time and energy we\u2019re spending collecting this data, there\u2019s no possible way any one research group could ever use it to the extent that justifies the cost,\u201d she said. \u201cBut letting everybody use it \u2014 great!\u201d", "The Elusive Brain", "No one expects the brain to yield its secrets quickly or easily.

In return, it gets a pat on the head and the dubious pleasure of being called a success story.", "This is why, in the end, the austerity program has not succeeded even in its basic aim of bringing down Ireland\u2019s sovereign debt, which actually rose sharply over the last five years. In 2009, it was 64 percent of G.D.P. Last year, it peaked at 125 percent.

But a gate and sign \u2014 \u201cPrivate Beach\u201d \u2014 stopped me. I was confused: How can a private beach be connected to a public park? But ever since a farmer in Arkansas scolded me for stepping onto his property to take an Instagram photo of some bales of hay, I\u2019ve been averse to even seemingly harmless property rights violations. So I headed off-road, thrashing into the bramble that lay inside the park, catching my pants on thorns and wishing I had a machete.", "Soon, though, I hit a trail, which looped around lovely Inlet Pond and, on several occasions, spurs that led right onto the beach. (So much for private.) Perhaps the walk would have been more traditionally lovely in the spring, but I quite liked the skeletal trees and windblown marsh grasses that gave it barren and blustery look. I came out at the trailhead Google Maps should have led me to in the first place, at a red house on Route 48 used by the North Fork Audubon Society.", "From there, it was an easy walk to Kontokosta Winery, just north of downtown Greenport on a bluff over the Sound.

I\u2019ll defer judgment on the wines to a more educated palate, but the servers were quite pleasant and the tasting (along with a walk out to the bluff) was certainly worth $10.", "It was not as good a deal, however, as the spot where I ended the trip after wandering through galleries and shops in town. North Fork tastings are not all about wine: at the Greenport Harbor Brewing Company, $8 gets you three ounces of each of seven beers \u2014 for a total of more than an English pint.

Instead of presenting images that create a canon of European and Latin American photography, or a historical narrative of colonialism, the curators, Eduardo Cadava and Gabriela Nouzeilles, state in the catalog that they would like to show how photography \u201cresists being fixed in a single place and time\u201d and is instead \u201cmigratory.\u201d", "The challenge is how to demonstrate photography\u2019s shifting nature in a static setting like the museum. Mr. Cadava and Ms. Nouzeilles have tried to do this by dividing the work into sections highlighting movement and change: the \u201cwandering\u201d camera of street photography; the upheaval of political revolutions; the circulation of images through institutions and collections; and radical changes within photography itself during the digital age.", "In most cases, what the curators have done here is reconfigure traditional categories to emphasize the \u201citinerant\u201d theme in the exhibition\u2019s title. Street photography, which usually treats the city as a site for everyday theater and historical events, is dominated by \u201citinerant subjects\u201d: people moving through urban space, as they do in Jos\u00e9 Medeiros\u2019s 1960 aerial photograph of people in a courtyard in Rio de Janeiro, Joan Colom\u2019s close-ups of different people on the street in Barcelona in the 1950s and \u201960s, or Nacho L\u00f3pez\u2019s wonderfully comedic \u201cLa Venus Se Fue de Juerga por los Barrios Bajos (Venus Went Partying in the Poor Neighborhoods)\u201d (1953), a pair of photographs of a man carrying a mannequin from a poor district in Mexico City to a boutique in a richer neighborhood.", "\u201cItinerant Revolutions\u201d includes sections devoted to the Mexican Revolution in the early 20th century, with many works that would traditionally fall under the rubric of social documentary. Among these are \u201cSoldaderas on a Train Platform in the Buenavista Station, Mexico City\u201d (April 1912), thought to have been taken by Ger\u00f3nimo Hern\u00e1ndez. The photograph, which first appeared on the front page of the newspaper Nueva Era and shows women on a train going to help revolutionary soldiers, has been circulated widely.", "Another version of revolution is represented in the section titled \u201cThe Modernist Revolution.\u201d Here the emphasis is on aesthetic rather than social or political upheavals, as you can see in the innovative camera angles, exposures, cropping and framing by photographers like Paul Strand and Henri Cartier-Bresson working in Mexico in the \u201930s and Ms. Modotti. But there are also photographers like Enrique Metinides and Manuel Alvarez Bravo, who \u2014 like Weegee in the United States \u2014 mixed formal innovation with shocking documentary of crime, disasters and political events.", "\u201cItinerant Archives\u201d looks at how photographs are cataloged and used for various purposes \u2014 often, in recent years, repurposed as artworks. A poignant example is Marcelo Brodsky\u2019s \u201cLa Camiseta (The Undershirt)\u201d (1979), a photograph of a hand holding the last known image of Fernando Brodsky, the artist\u2019s brother, who was kidnapped, tortured and killed under the military dictatorship in Argentina from 1976 to 1983. The photograph within Mr. Brodsky\u2019s photograph was smuggled out of a detention camp and later retrieved from legal files of prosecutors during trials for human rights violations.", "The images in the \u201cItinerant Photographs\u201d section are drawn from two collections. One, at the National Library of Brazil, was assembled by the 19th-century Brazilian emperor Dom Pedro II, and the other is a collection of early Brazilian photographs at the Instituto Moreira Salles in Rio de Janeiro. Here are images of the world seen through the Brazilian lens \u2014 the emperor visiting the pyramids in Egypt or a view of Pompeii in Italy \u2014 and early views of Brazil being explored and colonized.", "But the most itinerantly conceived photograph in the exhibition may be the one hanging at the entrance, by Mr. Fontcuberta. To make \u201cGooglegram: Ni\u00e9pce\u201d (2005), Mr. Fontcuberta typed the words \u201cphoto\u201d and \u201cfoto\u201d into Google and then, using software, recreated with hundreds of tiny images retrieved in the search Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce\u2019s \u201cView From the Window at Le Gras,\u201d from around 1826, one of the first photographic images. Mr. Fontcuberta\u2019s work, while fairly basic in its conception and design, demonstrates rather nicely the way that images circulate through time and space \u2014 including not only art history, but also contemporary art and cyberspace.", "These are ambitious ideas, and while \u201cThe Itinerant Languages of Photography\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily accomplish everything it might set out to do, the exhibition signals a larger shift in photography theory and scholarship. At a conference in November scheduled at Princeton in conjunction with the show, scholars like Ariella Azoulay, Thomas Keenan and Geoffrey Batchen (as well as Mr. Fontcuberta) discussed how they have applied similar ideas to studying photographs from the 19th century or archives in places outside the Spanish and Portuguese diaspora. Mr. Batchen encouraged the audience to imagine a history of photography \u201cfreed from the tyranny of the photograph\u201d as an object \u2014 which seems nearly impossible to most critics and scholars \u2014 arguing that we should think instead of how images are reproduced and disseminated.", "It is an alluring prospect in the age of digitization, a way to get out of the conundrum of photography in the \u201cpost-photography\u201d age. And though this exhibition keeps within rather traditional bounds, through its own itinerant platforms \u2014 including the exhibition, the conference and the catalog \u2014 it suggests a different way of thinking about photography, history and migration, and how these might be presented in museums in the future."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/travel/google-tools-for-globetrotters.html": ["\u201cO.K., Glass,\u201d I said, peering at a photo of a Spanish street sign through Google Glass, the lens-less augmented-reality \u201cglasses.\u201d \u201cTranslate this.\u201d I gently tapped, then swiped my pointer finger along a narrow touch pad on the side of the Glass frame as if scrolling through the contact list on my iPhone \u2014 only I was scrolling through the names of romance languages, each of which appeared on a tiny virtual screen in the distance, in line with my right eye.

Rather, it references a dictionary stored inside Glass (about 100,000 words for each language) so you don\u2019t need Wi-Fi or a data plan. Some smartphone users may already be familiar with Word Lens, which has an app for iPhones and Androids that costs $4.99 a language pair (like Spanish and English) and works by holding a smartphone camera over the words you wish to translate.", "During a demonstration at Basecamp of how Word Lens for Glass works, the app did a good job of translating street signs into English, as I described earlier.

The biggest issue I encountered is that I couldn\u2019t wear my prescription glasses with Glass. This is particularly problematic if, like me, your right eye is weak; that\u2019s the eye above which the virtual Glass screen appears.

The party was one of many events surrounding the World Economic Forum, the famous networking blitz for the global power elite, whose annual edition wraps up here this weekend.", "As he stood sipping schnapps, Mr. Johnson, a sometime Davos detractor, said he had become a fan. \u201cI have made more money for London at Davos than virtually anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cPounds, not zlotys,\u201d he added. Just then, a woman passed around a plate of blinis topped with what she insisted was sustainable caviar from sturgeon farmed in Italy.", "Although the forum still has lofty aims \u2014 this year\u2019s theme is \u201cReshaping the World\u201d \u2014 it has become over the years something of a parody of itself.

It\u2019s about the times that he\u2019s drawing upon that goes into his writing.\u201d The study, which used 20th-century fiction and nonfiction books, was published Wednesday by the Public Library of Science\u2019s journal PLOS One.", "Dr. Bentley acknowledged that some people learning of these results \u201cwould say, \u2018no duh,\u2019 \u201d but, he said, \u201cTo me it confirms that we do have a collective memory that conditions the way we write, and that economics is a very important driver of that.\u201d", "Authors and other literary figures reacted with some amusement to the findings, noting that books take years to write, so they naturally reflect earlier times.", "\u201cI admit, I am laughing,\u201d Jane Smiley, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992 for \u201cA Thousand Acres,\u201d wrote in an email. In a telephone interview, she said: \u201cWe think we\u2019re all unique, and we think every novel is individual, and it is. So when they reduce us all to a bunch of data about words, I guess you have to laugh.\u201d", "Chang-rae Lee, another novelist, said, \u201cMy impression is, of course there\u2019s a lag\u201d between economic conditions and their reflection in literature. \u201cFor fiction writers, you have to be able to ingest and digest this stuff.\u201d", "Kimberly Neuendorf, a communications professor at Cleveland State University who studies content analysis, said that using powerful search tools to analyze a serious subject like literature was \u201ca welcome alternative to the pop application of big data to analyze Twitter trends and Google search popularity.\u201d", "She added: \u201cAnyone with a computer can pull this big data together and find out what the current mood is of Kanye West, but this is much bigger. It makes me think how important our economy seems to be to our culture.\u201d She cited a few earlier studies melding science and art. A 1990 study, for example, found that depressing lyrics in Top 40 songs predicted economic pessimism about two years later. A 1999 study found that when social and economic conditions were bad, movie actresses with \u201cmature facial features\u201d \u2014 small eyes, thin cheeks, large chins \u2014 were popular, but when conditions were good, the public liked actresses with childlike features.", "In the new study, researchers also analyzed 650,000 German books and found the same misery correlation. Still, the practice of applying data-sorting algorithms to art can only go so far. For one thing, the lists of emotion words, created by other researchers and used for years, include some surprising choices: words like \u201csmug\u201d and \u201cwallow\u201d were among 224 words on the \u201cjoy\u201d list; potentially neutral adjectives like \u201cdark\u201d and \u201clow\u201d were among 115 words on the \u201csadness\u201d list.", "What about authors who produced work over several decades? Is the mood of each book really influenced by the economy of the previous 10 years, or have they developed a style based on other factors?", "Lorin Stein, editor of The Paris Review, said that Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cGoodbye, Columbus,\u201d published in 1959, may have had echoes of the prosperous economy during the previous decade, but the economy could not explain later works like \u201cAmerican Pastoral,\u201d published in 1997. \u201cThe tricky thing is that people get older and no one stays cheerful forever,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cLook at Roth. His later works included unrelenting misery. Yes, America happened to be a much richer country in \u2018Goodbye, Columbus,\u2019 but he was also young.\u201d", "Many personal factors likely influence writers before economic developments would, Mr. Stein said. With John Cheever, for example, \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with someone who\u2019s wrestling with alcoholism and latent homosexuality \u2014 every writer I know has some version of that,\u201d he said, adding that it was difficult to conceive of having \u201cso much data that you can factor out everybody\u2019s drinking problem, everybody\u2019s prostate cancer, everybody\u2019s lumpectomy.\u201d", "Anne Bernays, who has written 10 novels, said most novels were not \u201chappy books\u201d anyway. \u201cThey\u2019re about conflict and tension and about misery.\u201d", "Her first book, \u201cShort Pleasures,\u201d published in 1962, did not reflect the positive economy of the 1950s, she pointed out. Among its lines are: \u201cIt was hopeless. I began to cry.\u201d And her newest book, \u201cThe Man on The Third Floor,\u201d was published in 2012, but takes place in the 1950s.", "Some writers could cite a book or two that tracked with the study\u2019s results. Ms. Smiley\u2019s \u201cHorse Heaven,\u201d published in 2000, reflected 1990s prosperity, focusing on horse racing culture, she said. But most of her other works developed because she was \u201cdriven by a particular subject, and you write about it no matter what.\u201d", "Mr. Lee\u2019s just-published novel, \u201cOn Such a Full Sea,\u201d is a dystopian futuristic tale woven around three stratified social classes. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly an anxiety that I\u2019ve been mulling over, my sense that there\u2019s a sort of skewing of income equality,\u201d he said.", "But with his 1995 novel \u201cNative Speaker,\u201d about a Korean-American immigrant\u2019s experience, Mr. Lee said he did not see a connection to the previous decade\u2019s economy. \u201cIn 1985 I was in college, in my little cocoon,\u201d he said.

Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other. And when 98 percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create even more jobs. We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d (Applause.)", "Listen, China and Europe aren\u2019t standing on the sidelines; and neither, neither should we. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot surrender. Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones. And that\u2019s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year\u2019s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery.

And let\u2019s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly and needless litigation. (Applause.)", "Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy. The \u201call the above\u201d energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades. (Applause.)", "One of the reasons why is natural gas. If extracted safely, it\u2019s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change. (Applause.) Businesses plan to invest almost a hundred billion dollars in new factories that use natural gas. I\u2019ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built and put folks to work, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas. (Applause.)", "Meanwhile, my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and jobs growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, our communities. And while we\u2019re at it, I\u2019ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations. (Applause.)", "Now, it\u2019s not just oil and natural gas production that\u2019s booming; we\u2019re becoming a global leader in solar too.", "Every four minutes another American home or business goes solar, every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can\u2019t be outsourced. Let\u2019s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don\u2019t need it so we can invest more in fuels of the future that do. (Cheers, applause.)", "And even as we\u2019ve increased energy production, we\u2019ve partnered with businesses, builders and local communities to reduce the energy we consume. When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. In the coming months I\u2019ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump.", "And taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet. Over the past eight years the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. (Applause.)", "But we have to act with more urgency because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods. That\u2019s why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.", "The shift \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the shift to a cleaner energy economy won\u2019t happen overnight, and it will require some tough choices along the way.", "But the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact. (Applause.) And when our children\u2019s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did. (Cheers, applause.)", "Finally, if we\u2019re serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, law enforcement \u2014 and fix our broken immigration system. (Cheers, applause.) Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted, and I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades. And for good reason: When people come here to fulfill their dreams \u2014 to study, invent, contribute to our culture \u2014 they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody. So let\u2019s get immigration reform done this year. (Cheers, applause.) Let\u2019s get it done. It\u2019s time.", "The ideas I\u2019ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs. But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs.", "The good news is, we know how to do it. Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit. She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make those parts. She just needed the workforce. So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center; places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or a better job. She was flooded with new workers, and today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees. And what Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker.", "So tonight, I\u2019ve asked Vice President Biden to lead an across- the-board reform of America\u2019s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now. (Cheers, applause.) That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life. It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs. And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.", "I\u2019m also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it\u2019s more effective in today\u2019s economy. But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people. (Cheers, applause.)", "Let me tell you why.", "Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She\u2019d been steadily employed since she was a teenager, put herself through college. She\u2019d never collected unemployment benefits, but she\u2019s been paying taxes.", "In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home. A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved. Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter, the kind I get every day. \u201cWe are the face of the unemployment crisis,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not dependent on the government. Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society, care about our neighbors. I am confident that in time I will find a job, I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love. Please give us this chance.\u201d", "Congress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance. (Cheers, applause.) Give them that chance. Give them the chance. They need our help right now, but more important, this country needs them in the game. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at new jobs, a new chance to support their families. And in fact, this week many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.", "Tonight I ask every business leader in America to join us and do the same because we are stronger when America fields a full team. (Applause.)", "Of course, it\u2019s not enough to train today\u2019s workforce. We also have to prepare tomorrow\u2019s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. (Applause.)", "Estiven Rodriguez couldn\u2019t speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age 9. But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications. And this son of a factory worker just found out he\u2019s going to college this fall. (Applause.)", "Five years ago we set out to change the odds for all our kids. We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today more young people are earning college degrees than ever before. Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance. Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D.C., are making big strides in preparing students with the skills for the new economy \u2014 problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, math.", "Now, some of this change is hard.", "It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test. But it is worth it \u2014 and it is working.", "The problem is we\u2019re still not reaching enough kids, and we\u2019re not reaching them in time, and that has to change.", "Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child\u2019s life is high-quality early education. (Applause.) Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every 4-year-old. And as a parent as well as a president, I repeat that request tonight.", "But in the meantime, 30 states have raised pre-k funding on their own. They know we can\u2019t wait. So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year we\u2019ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children. And as Congress decides what it\u2019s going to do, I\u2019m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K that they need. (Applause.) It is right for America. We need to get this done.", "Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years. Tonight I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we\u2019ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit. (Cheers, applause.)", "We\u2019re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career. We\u2019re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle- class kid is priced out of a college education. We\u2019re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to 10 percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.

It is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a \u201cMad Men\u201d episode. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) This year let\u2019s all come together, Congress, the White House, businesses from Wall Street to Main Street, to give every woman the opportunity she deserves, because I believe when women succeed, America succeeds. (Cheers, applause.)", "Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs, but they\u2019re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages. Americans understand that some people will earn more money than others, and we don\u2019t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success. That\u2019s what America\u2019s all about. But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. (Applause.)", "In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.", "Many businesses have done it on their own. Nick Chute is here today with his boss, John Soranno. John\u2019s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough. (Laughter.) Only now he makes more of it. (Laughter.) John just gave his employees a raise to 10 bucks an hour, and that\u2019s a decision that has eased their financial stress and boosted their morale.", "Tonight I ask more of America\u2019s business leaders to follow John\u2019s lead. Do what you can to raise your employees\u2019 wages. (Applause.) It\u2019s good for the economy; it\u2019s good for America. (Sustained applause.)", "To every mayor, governor, state legislator in America, I say, you don\u2019t have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on. And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too. In the coming weeks I will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour because if you cook \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 our troops\u2019 meals or wash their dishes, you should not have to live in poverty. (Sustained applause.)", "Of course, to reach millions more, Congress does need to get on board.", "Today the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here. And Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10. It\u2019s easy to remember: 10.10. This will help families. It will give businesses customers with more money to spend. It does not involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise. (Cheers, applause.) Give \u2018em a raise.", "There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit. Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point. Think about that. It helps about half of all parents in America at some point in their lives.", "But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn\u2019t do enough for single workers who don\u2019t have kids. So let\u2019s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, help more Americans get ahead.", "Let\u2019s do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today most workers don\u2019t have a pension. A Social Security check often isn\u2019t enough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn\u2019t help folks who don\u2019t have 401(k)s. That\u2019s why tomorrow I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.", "MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little or nothing for middle-class Americans, offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everybody in this chamber can.", "And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations. (Applause.)", "One last point on financial security. For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system. And in case you haven\u2019t heard, we\u2019re in the process of fixing that. (Scattered laughter, applause.)", "Now -- a pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician\u2019s assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn\u2019t get health insurance. But on January 1st, she got covered. (Applause.) On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain. On January 6th, she had emergency surgery. Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would\u2019ve meant bankruptcy. That\u2019s what health insurance reform is all about, the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don\u2019t have to lose everything.", "Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents\u2019 plans. (Applause.)", "More than 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage \u2014 9 million. (Applause.)", "And here\u2019s another number: zero. Because of this law, no American, none, zero, can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a pre-existing condition like asthma or back pain or cancer. (Cheers, applause.) No woman can ever be charged more just because she\u2019s a woman. (Cheers, applause.) And we did all this while adding years to Medicare\u2019s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors.", "Now, I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law. (Laughter.) (Chuckles.) (Laughter.) But I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles. So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, increase choice, tell America what you\u2019d do differently. Let\u2019s see if the numbers add up. (Applause.) But let\u2019s not have another 40- something votes to repeal a law that\u2019s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.", "(Cheers, applause.) The first 40 were plenty. We all owe it to the American people to say what we\u2019re for, not just what we\u2019re against.", "And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who\u2019s here tonight. Now, Kentucky\u2019s not the most liberal part of the country. That\u2019s not where I got my highest vote totals. (Laughter.) But he\u2019s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth\u2019s families. They\u2019re our neighbors and our friends, he said. They\u2019re people we shop and go to church with -- farmers out on the tractor, grocery clerks. They\u2019re people who go to work every morning praying they don\u2019t get sick. No one deserves to live that way.", "Steve\u2019s right. That\u2019s why tonight I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st. Help them get covered. (Applause.) Moms, get on your kids to sign up. Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application. It\u2019ll give her some peace of mind, and plus, she\u2019ll appreciate hearing from you. (Laughter.)", "After all, that \u2014 that\u2019s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.", "It\u2019s the spirit of citizenship, the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well.", "Citizenship means standing up for everyone\u2019s right to vote. (Applause.) Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened, but conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it. And the bipartisan commission I appointed, chaired by my campaign lawyer and Governor Romney\u2019s campaign lawyer, came together and have offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half-hour to vote. Let\u2019s support these efforts. It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy. (Cheers, applause.)", "Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day. I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say \u201cwe are not afraid,\u201d and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters and our shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook. (Applause.)", "Citizenship demands a sense of common purpose; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.", "And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States armed forces. (Extended applause.) Thank you.", "Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure. When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq. More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan. With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America\u2019s longest war will finally be over. (Applause.)", "After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.", "If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of Al Qaeda. For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country. (Applause.)", "The fact is that danger remains. While we\u2019ve put Al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved as Al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we\u2019ll support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at home, we\u2019ll keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyberattacks. And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions. (Applause.)", "We have to remain vigilant.", "But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone. As commander in chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office. But I will not send our troops into harm\u2019s way unless it is truly necessary, nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts. We must fight the battles \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us \u2014 large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.", "So even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks, through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners, America must move off a permanent war footing. (Applause.) That\u2019s why I\u2019ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones, for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.", "That\u2019s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that privacy of ordinary people is not being violated. (Applause.) And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay \u2014 (applause) \u2014 because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world.", "You see, in a world of complex threats, our security, our leadership depends on all elements of our power \u2014 including strong and principled diplomacy. American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.", "American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria\u2019s chemical weapons are being eliminated. (Applause.) And we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve \u2014 a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear.", "As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in the difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the state of Israel \u2014 a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side. (Applause.)", "And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 and rolled back parts of that program \u2014 for the very first time in a decade. As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.", "It\u2019s not installing advanced centrifuges. Unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that Iran is not building a bomb. And with our allies and partners, we\u2019re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. (Applause.)", "These negotiations will be difficult; they may not succeed. We are cleareyed about Iran\u2019s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and we\u2019re clear about the mistrust between our nations, mistrust that cannot be wished away. But these negotiations don\u2019t rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb. If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today. (Applause.)", "The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible. But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it. (Applause.) For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.", "(Applause.) If Iran\u2019s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon. But if Iran\u2019s leaders do seize the chance \u2014 and we\u2019ll know soon enough \u2014 then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war.", "And finally, let\u2019s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe, to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want. And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America.", "Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known. From Tunisia to Burma, we\u2019re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy. In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and to have a say in their country\u2019s future. Across Africa, we\u2019re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty. In the Americas, we\u2019re building new ties of commerce, but we\u2019re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.", "And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster, as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, \u201cWe will never forget your kindness\u201d and \u201cGod bless America.\u201d", "We do these things because they help promote our long-term security. And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation. And next week the world will see one expression of that commitment when Team USA marches the red, white and blue into the Olympic stadium and brings home the gold. (Cheers, applause.)", "My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do. On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them.", "No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform. As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life. We\u2019ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they\u2019ve earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care -- including the mental health care -- that they need. (Applause.) We\u2019ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home, and we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.", "Let me tell you about one of those families I\u2019ve come to know.", "I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day. Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program, the ceremony. He was a strong, impressive young man, had an easy manner. He was sharp as a tack. And we joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.", "A few months later, on his 10th deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.", "For months, he lay in a coma. And the next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn\u2019t speak; he could barely move. Over the years, he\u2019s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, hours of grueling rehab every day.", "Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye. He still struggles on his left side. But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. Day by day, he\u2019s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again, and he\u2019s working toward the day when he can serve his country again.", "\u201cMy recovery has not been easy,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing in life that\u2019s worth anything is easy.\u201d", "Cory is here tonight. And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit. (Cheers, applause.) Cory. (Extended cheers and applause.)", "My fellow Americans \u2014 my fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy. Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy. Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.", "But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress: to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.", "The America we want for our kids \u2014 a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us \u2014 none of it is easy. But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow, I know it\u2019s within our reach.", "Believe it.", "God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

This period was \u201call about power systems to augment human muscle,\u201d explained McAfee in an interview, \u201cand each successive invention in that age delivered more and more power.

In many cases today artificially intelligent machines can make better decisions than humans.\u201d So humans and software-driven machines may increasingly be substitutes, not complements.

They suggest that we consider lowering taxes on human labor to make it cheaper relative to digital labor, that we reinvent education so more people can \u201crace with machines\u201d not against them, that we do much more to foster the entrepreneurship that invents new industries and jobs, and even consider guaranteeing every American a basic income.

To demonstrate the rarefied nature of his work, he removed a timepiece valued at 650,000 Swiss francs, or $720,000, that was adorning his wrist \u2014 the 2005 Sonnerie Souveraine, a grand-strike clockwatch and minute repeater that, for many watch aficionados, represents a pinnacle of mechanical watchmaking \u2014 and said that in the eight years since its introduction, his atelier had produced just 30 examples of the model.", "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the world\u2019s most expensive steel watch,\u201d said the translator, Jean-Louis Bilbault. He said Mr. Journe had chosen the everyday metal to encase the luxurious timepiece because the sound made by the intricate chiming mechanism was much better in steel than in gold or platinum.", "At a journalist\u2019s prompting, the conversation turned to smartwatches, the burgeoning category of digital wristwatches that can send emails, snap photos and serve as a platform for third-party apps.

At first glance, the timepiece, which comes in a 46-millimeter, or 1.8-inch, grade 5 titanium case, looks conventional. In place of the dial, however, it has a high-resolution color display protected by tactile sapphire glass and a circular touch-sensitive bezel.

He worked in partnership with Safe Host, a Swiss company that provides Crossbow users with access to secure data storage in the cloud. The model is available for purchase online.", "\u201cWe want to break some barriers,\u201d Mr. Kapshitzer said. \u201cInstead of thinking about what a watch could be, most companies are just thinking about how to do what they know in a different way.\u201d", "It is a common critique of the Swiss watch industry: that all the true innovation in mechanical watchmaking took place between the tail ends of the 18th and 19th centuries, and inventors of the 20th century merely perfected the art of industrialization \u2014 and imitation.", "But some of the industry\u2019s most avant-garde makers are challenging the received wisdom.

Take Tissot, a 161-year-old brand owned by the Swatch Group. The company has been associated with wearable technology since 1999, when it introduced the T-Touch, a watch with touch-sensitive glass and the ability to display altimeter, chronograph, alarm, compass, weather and temperature readings.", "Numerous iterations of the model followed \u2014 including the High T, the result of a 2004 collaboration with Microsoft, which beamed data to the watch through its MSN Web portal.

We knew there was not so much urgency; the traditional market is not going to collapse tomorrow. But it\u2019s a big change of mind-set. We\u2019re not panicking at all. But we are making reports. If it works and we think it\u2019s good, then we will access the technology.\u201d", "Mr. Linder\u2019s inquisitive yet dispassionate approach to the digital competition is a reminder of just how much has changed in 40 years. The luxury watch industry has been challenged by technology in the past, only to grow into a $24 billion market. Why should the smartwatch era be any different?", "Put another way: Might wearable technology actually prove beneficial to analog makers? To the industry\u2019s optimists, the answer is an unequivocal yes.", "\u201cIf young people start to wear information watches like the iWatch,\u201d said Jean-Claude Biver, chief executive of Hublot, \u201cthen at least it prepares them for the day when they find an expensive watch with culture and tradition.\u201d"], "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/travel/how-to-choose-an-air-travel-search-site.html": ["Which airline booking sites offer the cheapest airfares?", "If your answer was Expedia \u2014 or any of the other dozens of online travel agencies \u2014 you\u2019re wrong.

Each has different strengths offered through different interfaces that use different functions and produce different results. But where to go for what? Even for people like me who live on these sites, it\u2019s not always clear.", "So I designed a test \u2014 from Europe, as it turned out, where I was reporting on the road. I selected 15 online travel agencies, from the old stalwarts like Travelocity to an excellent (and increasingly robust) group of upstarts like Routehappy, which are more likely to take into account niche specifics like seat pitch. Then I put them through the wringer, shopping for six itineraries, from basic domestic to overseas-only to elaborately multicity: Miami-Chicago, Louisville-Portland, Los Angeles-Paris, Dallas-Singapore, Shanghai-Chengdu in China and, finally, New York-Guadalajara-Bogot\u00e1-Charlotte (presumably a Mexican-Colombian-American visiting family and the Nascar Hall of Fame).", "I should note that I couldn\u2019t include every site in my tests, and left out a popular one I couldn\u2019t figure out how to use abroad: Bing Travel. As I learned too late from a spokeswoman, it only works in the United States. There\u2019s a workaround \u2014 you can switch settings to \u201ctailor\u201d your search to \u201cthe United States \u2014 English,\u201d But that\u2019s one extra hassle I wasn\u2019t willing to take on.", "That said, the results? For one, my eyes hurt. But more important, I created what I hope is a useful (though not definitive) guide to which sites work best under which circumstances.", "If Cheap Is All That Matters", "The sites you\u2019ve certainly heard of \u2014 Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak, Orbitz \u2014 were all dependably similar, their lowest offerings rarely differing more than a few dollars. But the upstarts occasionally beat them. For that Miami-Chicago flight, the old guard circled around $378. But Routehappy found one for $361, and I followed it through to just before the final click, and it was legit. (Momondo gets an honorable mention at $364.)", "So the best technique here is to check one of the traditional sites, and then play around with the new guys and see if they can pull an upset. Then, before you book, check the airline\u2019s own website to make sure it\u2019s not even cheaper there. (And don\u2019t forget that Southwest \u2014 by its own choice \u2014 doesn\u2019t show up on most sites.) And as long as you\u2019ve popped over, it\u2019s almost always a good idea to do the actual booking from the airline\u2019s site: It\u2019s often easier \u2014 and rarely harder \u2014 to take care of the minutiae (entering your awards number, choosing seats and paying for extra luggage, as well as changing your reservation down the line if necessary).", "When You Want Cheap \u2014 Within Limits", "Sometimes the sites think more like soulless machines than like humans. On occasion they\u2019ll list a $400 flight with a 12-hour layover before a $401 flight with a 90-minute layover \u2014 not a choice most travelers would make. Just ask it to sort by trip length, you say? Then that $401 flight might disappear under an avalanche of $9,999 flights with 89-minute layovers. O.K., that\u2019s an exaggeration, but it\u2019s a real issue: Even cheapskates will sometimes pay $50 to shave six hours off a layover.", "That\u2019s when you turn to sites like Hipmunk, where the default setting orders the flights by \u201cagony,\u201d dropping flights with long layovers or sky-high prices down the list. This worked especially well with that Dallas-Singapore route, where, after a great deal of sorting on Expedia and Travelocity, I finally decided the cheapest tolerable flight was $1,174, with a total trip time of 25 hours, 10 minutes out and 23 hours, 42 minutes back. When I tried the same search on Hipmunk, it put that precise itinerary right at the top. Routehappy\u2019s algorithm includes other factors you might be willing to pay more for, including seat space and electrical outlets; their top choice (without changing the default preferences) was a $1,555 Korean Air itinerary with an extra three inches and three fewer hours. Worth it? That\u2019s up to you.", "If You\u2019re Booking a Domestic Route on Short Notice", "Priceline\u2019s opaque bidding system works well with hotels \u2014 I\u2019ve often saved 30 to 50 percent on hotels by placing an absurdly low bid and allowing the site to charge my card before it told me exactly which hotel I was paying for. Savings are less and more rare on flights, but do exist, particularly on domestic flights booked just a few days in advance. Savings top out at about 40 percent, so try bidding 10 or 20 percent below the cheapest standard fare. If your bid fails, no problem: Book through Priceline\u2019s regular service, which fared as well as other big-name sites on my tests. Two caveats: You can choose the date but not the departure time of your flight (or the airline), and you might be stuck with an annoying layover. But other than advance planning, I don\u2019t know a better way to shave dollars off a standard domestic ticket.", "When Your Dates or Destination Are Flexible", "Most of the bigger sites (notable exception: Expedia) offer to find you cheaper flights if you\u2019re willing to fly one to three days earlier or later. That was a nice innovation in 2010, but these days their systems seem inflexible, and the resulting grids dizzying. Much better are the far more intuitive bar graphs you get on Momondo and Google Flight Explorer. There\u2019s also GetGoing, which will give you a discount if you give it two destinations you like and let it pick one. And at Adioso, one of the newer sites in my survey, you start by just typing in your starting point and destination, and mold preferences from there. That won\u2019t work for Thanksgiving visits to family, though, and the results can be hit or miss. (The company is promising lots of improvements in 2014.)", "If You Have Commitment Issues", "For a few bucks, Options Away will hold your reservation for between a day and a few weeks. That\u2019s great if, for example, you need to coordinate plans with others. Two problems: It only works on domestic flights within a limited list of cities, and its base rates are not always competitive.

When you do so, you both embed your intentions firmly in memory (which reduces forgetting) and make it harder to postpone good behavior, since doing so requires breaking an explicit commitment to yourself. In an experiment reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers (including one of us) contacted thousands of individuals who needed flu shots. Those individuals who were prompted to privately write down a plan specifying the date and time they would visit a clinic got shots at a 13 percent higher rate than members of a control group, who were also reminded about clinics but were not prompted to form a plan. This strategy, as the same team reported in the journal Preventive Medicine, also improved turnout for colonoscopies.", "Second, put something you value on the line. In an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a team of researchers (including one of us) reported that over the course of a 16-week study, individuals who were given the opportunity to set aside money for forfeiture if they failed to lose weight lost 14 pounds more than those in a control group. Similarly, an experiment in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics found that smokers hoping to quit were more likely to succeed if offered an opportunity to deposit funds in an account for six months that they would lose if they failed a urine test for nicotine and cotinine. You can arrange to forfeit money if you don\u2019t achieve your goals at stickK.com, a website founded by behavioral economists. But putting money on the line isn\u2019t your only option: Making an appointment to exercise with a friend may be effective, too, because you are much less likely to cancel on a friend than on yourself.", "Third, bundle your temptations. This is one of our favorite strategies for tackling health goals, which we tested in an experiment described in a forthcoming paper in Management Science. The idea is best illustrated with a scenario: Imagine you want to exercise more but struggle to drag yourself to the gym. Imagine you also have a fondness for trashy novels but feel guilty wasting your time reading them. The solution is simple: Allow yourself to read those novels only while exercising at the gym. Our research demonstrates that when you leave your copy of \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d (or such) at the gym, you exercise 56 percent more often (and 61 percent of people will even pay the gym to hold their book so it is only available when exercising).", "Fourth, seek social support. You can achieve more by pursuing goals with the help of a mentor. In a study co-authored by one of us and reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine, patients with poorly controlled diabetes were paired with patients who previously had poorly controlled diabetes but had since achieved mastery over their disease. The improvements in glycemic control achieved by those mentored in this study were larger than those produced by many leading drugs.", "What if, despite our tips, you nonetheless fail to achieve your New Year\u2019s resolutions? Fortunately, you will have plenty of other chances.

Or perhaps that person had somehow missed the report that Mr. Madoff had been arrested on Dec. 11, 2008. That would not have been easy. In the month after the arrest, The New York Times printed 15 front-page articles on the Madoff fraud, and it received exhaustive coverage everywhere else as well.", "Another highlight is that on June 15, 2007, JPMorgan\u2019s chief risk officer refused to increase the bank\u2019s exposure to Mr. Madoff\u2019s fund \u2014 more than $100 million at the time \u2014 to $1 billion.

They just feared it. In October 2008, they filed a \u201csuspicious activity report\u201d with British regulators, saying there might be a Ponzi scheme going on. But they did not bother to mention those fears to the bankers handling the Madoff bank account in the United States, and no similar report was filed with United States regulators.", "As a result of those timely redemptions, JPMorgan Chase was able to book a loss of only $40 million after the Ponzi scheme collapsed, well below the $250 million loss it would have otherwise faced. Of course, the $2.6 billion it will now pay dwarfs those savings. That figure counts a series of settlements announced this week, in addition to the $1.7 billion penalty it is paying to the Justice Department under the deferred prosecution agreement.", "No Ponzi scheme can operate without a bank willing to take the money in and pay it out without noticing that it is not paying for the investments promised by the schemer. It is worth noting that the only time the charges say JPMorgan should have filed a suspicious activity report was in October 2008, two months before the Ponzi scheme collapsed \u2014 and many years after it began. The prosecutors also say JPMorgan\u2019s internal controls regarding money laundering were woefully inadequate.", "It is encouraging that JPMorgan Chase is admitting its failures but a bit disappointing that prosecutors did not say it should have noticed that a fraud was going on long before it collapsed. There is little here to inspire other banks to be more vigilant in assuring they are not the bankers to a Ponzi scheme.", "It seems unlikely that anything would be radically different had that suspicious activity report been filed in October 2008. JPMorgan says it files more than 100,000 such reports a year, and most of them do not result in legal action.", "Most of the facts laid out in this week\u2019s deferred prosecution agreement have been known for years. What seems to be new is that prosecutors decided to find criminal behavior in actions that regulators had previously viewed more charitably.

With unemployment seemingly stalled out at around 7 percent in the aftermath of the Great Recession, with the leak of thousands of National Security Agency documents making news almost daily, with the continuing stories about the erosion of privacy in the digital economy, \u201cWho Owns the Future?\u201d puts forth a kind of universal theory that ties all these things together. It also puts forth some provocative, unconventional ideas for ensuring that the inevitable dominance of software in every corner of society will be healthy instead of harmful.", "Lanier has an unusual authority to criticize the digital economy: He was there, more or less, at the creation. Among (many) other things, he founded the first company to sell virtual reality products. Another of his start-ups was sold to Google. As a consultant, he has had assignments with \u201cWal-Mart, Fannie Mae, major banks and hedge funds,\u201d as he notes in \u201cWho Owns the Future?\u201d But unlike most of his fellow technologists, he eventually came to feel that the rise of digital networks was no panacea.", "On the contrary: \u201cWhat I came away with from having access to these varied worlds was a realization that they were all remarkably similar,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe big players often gained benefits from digital networks to an amazing degree, but they were also constrained, even imprisoned, by the same dynamics.\u201d", "Over time, the same network efficiencies that had given them their great advantages would become the instrument of their failures. In the financial services industry, it led to the financial crisis. In the case of Wal-Mart, its adoption of technology to manage its supply chain at first reaped great benefits, but over time it cost competitors and suppliers hundreds of thousands of jobs, thus \u201cgradually impoverishing its own customer base,\u201d as Lanier put it to me.", "The N.S.A.? It developed computer technology that could monitor the entire world \u2014 and, in the process, lost control of the contractors it employed. As for Facebook, Google, Twitter, Amazon et al., well, in Lanier\u2019s view, it\u2019s only a matter of time before their advantages, too, disintegrate.", "There are two additional components to Lanier\u2019s thesis. The first is that the digital economy has done as much as any single thing to hollow out the middle class. (When I asked him about the effect of globalization, he said that globalization was \u201cjust one form of network efficiency.\u201d See what I mean about a universal theory?) His great example here is Kodak and Instagram. At its height, writes Lanier \u201cKodak employed more than 140,000 people.\u201d Yes, Kodak made plenty of mistakes, but look at what is replacing it: \u201cWhen Instagram was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars in 2012, it employed only 13 people.\u201d", "Which leads nicely to Lanier\u2019s final big point: that the value of these new companies comes from us. \u201cInstagram isn\u2019t worth a billion dollars just because those 13 employees are extraordinary,\u201d he writes. \u201cInstead, its value comes from the millions of users who contribute to the network without being paid for it.\u201d He adds, \u201cNetworks need a great number of people to participate in them to generate significant value. But when they have them, only a small number of people get paid. This has the net effect of centralizing wealth and limiting overall economic growth.\u201d Thus, in Lanier\u2019s view, is income inequality also partly a consequence of the digital economy.", "It is Lanier\u2019s radical idea that people should get paid whenever their information is used. He envisions a different kind of digital economy, in which creators of content \u2014 whether a blog post or a Facebook photograph \u2014 would receive micropayments whenever that content was used. A digital economy that appears to give things away for free \u2014 in return for being able to invade the privacy of its customers for commercial gain \u2014 isn\u2019t free at all, he argues.", "Lanier\u2019s ideas raise as many questions as they answer, and he makes no pretense to having it all figured out. \u201cI know some of this will turn out to be wrong,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t know which part.\u201d", "Still his ideas about reformulating the economy \u2014 creating what he calls a \u201chumanistic economy\u201d \u2014 offer much food for thought. Lanier wants to create a dynamic where digital networks expand the pie rather than shrink it, and rebuild the middle class instead of destroying it.", "\u201cIf Google and Facebook were smart,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would want to enrich their own customers.\u201d So far, he adds, Silicon Valley has made \u201cthe stupid choice\u201d \u2014 to grow their businesses at the expense of their own customers.", "Lanier\u2019s message is that it can\u2019t last.

Whether you are a content provider or a subscriber, as long as you pay your bill, it shouldn\u2019t matter whether you use them to send email or connect to Netflix or YouTube.", "That, however, may change, thanks to a circuit court ruling this week in the case of Verizon v. the Federal Communications Commission. The decision deferred to an old F.C.C. determination that telecom cables, the primary conduit for Internet access, are not utilities, and cannot be regulated as such, leaving American businesses unprotected from the depredations of a handful of giant Internet access providers.", "Service providers can now strike a deal with YouTube to get faster delivery speeds to customers, and Comcast, which owns sizable content assets itself, can use its control of the cables to get an edge over rival content providers.", "But rather than despair, this is a moment of opportunity. The court didn\u2019t make its decision because it was opposed to net neutrality, but because the F.C.C. had painted itself into a regulatory corner, having developed a convoluted, contradictory set of rules regarding Internet access over the last decade.", "The decision now forces the commission to go back to square one and reverse the industry-compromised decisions that set it on this path in the first place and that have long undermined its authority over this crucial infrastructure.", "The problem began in 2002, when Michael K. Powell, the F.C.C. chairman who now heads the cable industry\u2019s trade association, decided to exempt high-speed Internet access from so-called common carriage regulation. Those rules, applied most notably to phone service, bar providers from discriminatory service \u2014 everyone who pays a phone bill gets the same quality of service.", "But Mr. Powell reasoned that Internet access was an information service, distinct from the traditional communications infrastructure, and that competition would be better than oversight at protecting Americans from any abuses by access providers.", "It\u2019s a good thing the F.C.C. is staffed by so many lawyers, because it was soon faced with complaints by consumer groups and Internet content providers alleging that companies like Comcast, far from being checked by competition, were using the lack of competition in local Internet service, combined with the lack of oversight, to favor their own commercial interests.", "After it was revealed in 2008 that Comcast had interfered with access to certain file-sharing networking applications, the commission performed an about-face, ordering the company to adhere to a new approach for managing bandwidth demand.", "This put the commission in a logical bind. It claimed, somehow, that it both repudiated the need for \u201ccommon carriage\u201d rules and, at the same time, had the power to prevent discrimination by service providers.", "Comcast, Verizon and other Internet service providers quickly filed suit. Though the commission fought a valiant fight, defending this contradiction was always a losing battle. The commission first lost following a challenge by Comcast in 2010, after which it recast its net neutrality stance, mandating that service providers not choose winners and losers among providers of online content or require them to pay fees as a condition of carriage.", "Verizon then challenged that mandate, and the result was this week\u2019s court ruling. Unlike the 2010 decision, this time the circuit court left little room for the commission to revise its rules yet again.", "The court did, however, offer a way forward, if the commission was willing to take it. The agency must revisit and reverse Mr. Powell\u2019s 2002 decision, relabeling high-speed Internet access a common carriage service.", "That has always been the obvious solution. But for years the commission has refused to do so, because its jury-rigged, contradictory stance worked well enough. Now it has no choice.", "And it must act, soon. Otherwise, we will have an Internet in which, say, Google can pay extra to give Gmail users faster access to their email than Hotmail users.

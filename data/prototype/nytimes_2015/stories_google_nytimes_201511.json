Like African-American soldiers in the same war, they are expected to risk their lives for a \u201clibert\u00e9\u201d that remains cruelly theoretical, and for a nation that oppresses them.

Hemmed in on one side by the indifference of the state (embodied, as is customary in French cinema, by school and the police), and on the other by traditional male authority (embodied by her older brother), Marieme finds a measure of freedom in the company of her friends and a release in popular music.

How long can this last?", "The haves are armed with dual-class structures that give voting control to their founding shareholders or the private equity firm that bought them. These are companies like CBS, Ford Motor, Facebook, Google, News Corporation and Viacom, where the shareholders often have one vote or none per share and the founders 10 votes (The New York Times Company also has dual-class voting). These companies are largely free from challenge by any of their other shareholders, and control is centered with the founders, who have largely unfettered authority to hire and fire the board and the executives.", "The have-nots lack this dual class structure and instead have no controlling shareholder. Instead, these companies have one vote for each share. In these companies, institutional investors like mutual funds and pension funds wield great control and the ability to influence, if not outright direct, the company\u2019s actions.", "The difference is stark \u2014 the haves can function largely free of worry from challenge. The have-nots are on the run, living in fear of activist hedge funds. And it\u2019s not just the hedge funds. These companies are also buffeted by increasingly vocal institutional investors that pressure the companies to adopt good corporate governance. The problem is that even the shareholders cannot agree on what exactly is good corporate governance, and one result is that companies can be pushed in one direction or another based on the flavor of the month.", "Debated off and on since the 1980s, this situation exists because of a quirk in the legal rules. Back in the 1980s, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that prevented companies from having anything other than one vote per share of stock. The S.E.C. was responding to a challenge led by General Motors, which wanted to have dual-class stock for a subsidiary, Electronic Data Systems, that it was about to take public.", "The S.E.C. acted in the name of shareholder democracy. It wanted to prevent a situation in which a powerful shareholder could control the votes in a company without having much economic stake. That might encourage the shareholder to press the company\u2019s directors to cater to that shareholder\u2019s needs rather than do what was best for the company as a whole.", "For example, in the last three years CBS and Viacom have each paid more than $10 million a year to the 92-year-old chairman of both companies, Sumner Redstone, who owns only 10 percent of each company but controls the votes. Did he get this pay because he earned it or because he had control?", "Many defend dual-class stock because it may insulate a company from pressure to take short-term actions at the behest of shareholders. It also allows the founders to take a long-term approach and invest in the company in a way that may not produce immediate results. And finally, defenders point out that institutional investors are often conflicted in their desires, and that dual-class stock allows more deliberate consideration of shareholder issues.", "The S.E.C. rule would have given all companies the same voting structure. But it was struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which held that the S.E.C. did not have the power to require all companies to have the same voting rights. In the decision\u2019s wake, both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq adopted rules that prohibited companies that were already listed from adopting dual-class shares, but that permitted a company to adopt dual-class stock in an initial public offering. The idea was that all shareholders would agree to this structure by buying their shares at the conception of the public company.", "A great divide thus sprang up: existing companies with one share, one vote and at the mercy of the markets versus companies with dual-class stock.", "Still, many thought an I.P.O. of a company with dual-class stock would be harder for shareholders to swallow. Few companies adopted the structure. That changed when Google chose to adopt the mechanism, giving control to its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Today, dual-class stock is all the rage, and the majority of initial public offerings have it. It\u2019s not just technology companies like Facebook and Zillow. Shake Shack and Fairway, both decidedly nontech firms, also have a dual-class mechanism.", "More than 13.5 percent of the 133 companies listing shares on United States exchanges in 2015 have set up a dual-class structure, according to the data provider Dealogic. That compares with 12 percent last year and just 1 percent in 2005.", "About half the companies choosing the structure were in the technology industry.", "Some big institutional investors have come out against this trend. Calpers, the California pension fund, has taken the position that it will not invest in I.P.O.s with dual-class stock. And yet, this seems like a finger in the dike. Dual-class initial offerings keep coming as other shareholders keep buying. It\u2019s an odd state of affairs. The same shareholders who repeatedly assert that they care about corporate governance and are for a shareholder voice do not seem to care about that voice at the initial offering stage.", "Perhaps this says a lot about how much shareholders value their vote, and it may be very little. Certainly institutional investors talk a good game and are increasingly taking steps to influence companies. But when push comes to shove, they seem ready to drop the vote for a good I.P.O. deal.", "Perhaps the time has come to decide whether dual-class stock makes continued sense and for either all companies or no companies to be able to adopt it. Or perhaps the conversation should include other possible mechanisms that are more accommodating to shareholders.", "For example, France has adopted a tenure voting structure for its public companies under the so-called Florange law. In companies with tenure voting, shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold shares. In France it is two votes after a year, but the number of votes over a period can really be any number. France adopted the law to cement the power of the French state against activists, but tenure voting is an intriguing idea. If votes really do matter, why not reward shareholders for holding shares? And this would result in others besides the founders having a say.", "Alternatively, why not require a sunset provision on dual-class shares? It might make sense for a founder to have control at the beginning, but years later the founder may not have the same interests or desires at stake.", "And finally, it may be that certain types of shareholders like index funds should have no vote at all. After all, they have no choice in their ownership. They also hold shares forever.", "All of this is to say that perhaps it is time that some hard thinking be given to the shareholder vote, how shareholders value that vote and whether empowering founders over shareholders is a good or bad idea.

He had already drawn a backlash for portraying Bryce Dallas Howard\u2019s character as a cold career woman running away from dinosaurs in high heels. \u2018\u2018Would I have been chosen to direct \u2018Jurassic World\u2019 if I was a female filmmaker who had made one small film?\u2019\u2019 Trevorrow mused in an email to Slashfilm.com. \u2018\u2018I have no idea.\u2019\u2019", "Every woman who has ever had a film at Sundance has an idea, because they have watched male peers at the festival vault with ease across the chasm to Hollywood studios, agents, financing and big paychecks. \u2018\u2018If they make a $150 million movie with women directing or starring, and it bombs, they take it a little harder,\u2019\u2019 says the director Adam McKay, who is Will Ferrell\u2019s writing and producing partner. \u2018\u2018You can trace that to the old-school guys in the boardrooms.\u2019\u2019", "Leslye Headland is a 34-year-old writer and director who was in the same 2012 Sundance class as Trevorrow, with the movie version of her scorching Off Broadway play, \u2018\u2018Bachelorette.\u2019\u2019 She bristles with ambition to do everything he is doing.

From 2007 through 2014, according to Smith\u2019s research, women made up only 30.2 percent of speaking or named characters in the 100 top-grossing fictional films.", "But the most wildly lopsided numbers have to do with who is behind the lens. In both 2013 and 2014, women were only 1.9 percent of the directors for the 100 top-grossing films. Excluding their art-house divisions, the six major studios released only three movies last year with a female director. It\u2019s hard to believe the number could drop to zero, but the statistics suggest female directors are slipping backward. Prof. Martha Lauzen of San Diego State University reports that in 2014, 95 percent of cinematographers, 89 percent of screenwriters, 82 percent of editors, 81 percent of executive producers and 77 percent of producers were men.", "\u2018\u2018It\u2019s kind of like the church,\u2019\u2019 notes the actress Anjelica Huston, whose father, John Huston, helped set the template for macho directors. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t want us to be priests. They want us to be obedient nuns.\u2019\u2019", "Hollywood\u2019s toxic brew of fear and sexism has kept women even more confined than those in legendary male bastions like Silicon Valley, where 10.8 percent of executive officers are women; corporate America, where about 16 percent of executive officers at S.&P. 100 companies are women; and Congress, where 20 percent of the House and Senate are women.", "But a series of events over the past year finally put the issue in the spotlight and gave a cascade of women the courage to talk about it. First, there was the Sony Pictures hack, which revealed the crazy fact that Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams received less money than Jeremy Renner for \u2018\u2018American Hustle.\u2019\u2019 Below the level of the studio head Amy Pascal, it turned out that the top executives at Sony were nearly all white and male. After the hack, Manohla Dargis, co-chief film critic for The New York Times, wrote a three-part series on the plight of female directors, calling the imbalance \u2018\u2018immoral, maybe illegal.\u2019\u2019 And in May, the A.C.L.U. in Los Angeles and the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Women\u2019s Rights Project in New York petitioned state and federal agencies to look into the matter, which spurred the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to open an investigation.", "There had long been a strange sort of omert\u00e0 on talking about the gender disparity.

I talked to more than 100 women and men at all levels of Hollywood. What I heard was an avalanche of previously pent-up fears, regrets, recriminations and recommendations. Beyond the bad numbers were a lot of raw emotions.", "Even though I grew up in the shadow of the Washington Monument, the jutting symbol of a capital under male dominion, I knew long before Sheryl Sandberg that women could lean in. I learned it from film-noir vixens with guns in their purses, who never worried about being called bossy and never hesitated to pursue happiness \u2014 in all directions. At their best, movies can be instructions in how to live and how not to live, and can help us invent the verbal and visual vocabulary with which we engage the world.", "When my older brother took me to the American Film Institute to see old movies with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck and Ida Lupino \u2014 the first actor to write, produce and direct her own films \u2014 my imagination was fired by smart, powerful women.

The dictatorial and crass Hollywood moguls actually cared about art. They would take all the literary best sellers, throw starlets into them and make prestige movies.", "Although the pioneers\u2019 names have been forgotten in modern Hollywood, female filmmakers started out with gusto. Alice Guy Blach\u00e9, who worked as a secretary to L\u00e9on Gaumont, a Frenchman who sold cameras and film, picked up a camera in 1896 and helped invent narrative filmmaking in France and Hollywood. \u2018\u2018It is true that I passed for a phenomenon,\u2019\u2019 she wrote in her memoir, adding that she knew it was an \u2018\u2018unfeminine\u2019\u2019 career but didn\u2019t care. In 1910, she became the first woman to found and run her own film studio, along with her husband and a partner. Over her career, she would oversee nearly 750 films, including cross-dressing comedies, movies playing with the gender roles in marriage and action films featuring heroines.", "In 1914, Lois Weber, who was mentored by Guy Blach\u00e9, became the first American woman to direct a full-length feature, \u2018\u2018The Merchant of Venice,\u2019\u2019 in which she also starred as Portia. Infused with the conviction that film could change culture, she made movies about contraception, capital punishment and poverty. She ran a production company with her husband\u2019s help, but he often deferred to her judgment. She had great taste and said her ideal picture entertainment was \u2018\u2018a well-assorted shelf of books come to life.\u2019\u2019", "Dorothy Arzner, a screenwriter and director who worked in Hollywood from 1922 to 1943, had her technicians rig a microphone to a fishing pole, essentially inventing the boom mike. She helped Katharine Hepburn get her start and still has the largest body of work by a woman director. \u2018\u2018No one gave me trouble because I was a woman,\u2019\u2019 she said in 1974. \u2018\u2018Men were more helpful than women.\u2019\u2019 The veteran director Allison Anders tells boom operators on her projects that their jobs were created by a woman.", "So given such remarkable trailblazers, how did women in Hollywood start reeling backward?", "The more I talked to people, the clearer it became that if the luminous Hollywood of my childhood was obliterated for good, it all started with \u2018\u2018Jaws\u2019\u2019 in the summer of 1975, which would devour half a billion dollars at the box office. America fell in love with the blockbuster, and Hollywood got hooked on the cohort of 15-year-old boys. It has never wavered in this obsession, even though girls and women buy half the movie tickets and watch more TV series, and even though teenage boys are increasingly fixated on gaming.", "In the \u201980s, the paradigm that \u2018\u2018Jaws\u2019\u2019 helped create shifted yet again. Studios began being swallowed by conglomerates, and as Norma Desmond predicted, the picture business became small. Box-office revenues would eventually go from 70-30 domestic/international to 30-70, which meant foreign markets were calling the shots. Dialogue and women who weren\u2019t in leather cat suits became superfluous. Crunching data, foreign sales companies started providing the presale estimates for the value of a movie and its stars outside the United States, and producers would borrow money against those estimates. They often want the male players attached before the female ones because men tend to have more value in foreign sales. \u2018\u2018The moment you mention it\u2019s a female director to foreign companies, you can see the eyes roll,\u2019\u2019 said one woman leading a studio. \u2018\u2018Buyers want action films, and they don\u2019t see women as action directors.\u2019\u2019", "Over a gin martini, asparagus, foie gras and gluten-free bread at dinner in Boston, where he was directing a reboot of \u2018\u2018Ghostbusters\u2019\u2019 with actresses, Paul Feig talked about trying to break through all the macho myths that suck up creative oxygen.

Even the comedies are sophomoric. They remake things that are lying there while the people who have done it already are still alive. I\u2019ve read and seen horrible stuff.

But Hollywood continues to treat those successes as anomalies.", "\u2018\u2018The world of movies is fascinating to me because everyone has amnesia all the time,\u2019\u2019 Rhimes told me. \u2018\u2018Every time a female-driven project is made and succeeds, somehow it\u2019s a fluke. Instead of just saying \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 is popular among young women, they say it only made money because Jennifer Lawrence was luminous and amazing. I mean, you go get yours, girl. But seriously, that\u2019s ridiculous. There\u2019s a very hungry audience of young women dying to see some movies. They came out for \u2018Titanic\u2019 and \u2018Twilight,\u2019 14-year-old girls going back to see those movies every day. I find it fascinating that this audience is not being respected. In the absence of water, people drink sand. And that is sad.

Islamic State militants used Telegram two weeks ago to claim responsibility for the crash of the Russian jet in the Sinai Peninsula that killed 224 people, and used it again last week, in Arabic, English and French, to broadcast responsibility for the Paris carnage. It is not yet clear whether they also used Telegram\u2019s secret-messaging service to encrypt their private conversations.", "Nonetheless, such \u201cend-to-end\u201d encryption technology is now so widespread that the attack has revived vitriolic arguments between American intelligence officials and Silicon Valley. Only weeks ago, the matter appeared settled, at least temporarily, with a decision by President Obama that it would be fruitless for the government to try to compel the technology companies to provide the keys to protected conversations and data.", "Apple has already made encryption technology a standard part of its iMessage service, and Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D.

Mr. Cook argues that investigators have ways to obtain crucial clues from the available \u201cmetadata\u201d about who is talking to whom by phone, from information in the Internet cloud \u2014 or, security experts have said, by hacking a target\u2019s device.", "But the speed of the encryption wave has touched off alarm among law enforcement and intelligence officials, who say it significantly increases the chances that they will miss evidence of an impending attack. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain threatened late last year to ban such technologies, although he soon backed down.

He rejected the argument of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, that the United States should require any company that provides encrypted software and hardware to engineer a way for the government, armed with a court order, to get access. That decision came after a year of study led by the White House counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, and the head of the White House cybersecurity office, Michael Daniel.", "The White House ultimately adopted a view put forth by 14 of the world\u2019s top cryptographers and computer security experts who wrote, in a white paper, that weakening the encryption of American technology sold by companies like Apple, Google and Facebook would only render confidential data and critical infrastructure more vulnerable to criminals and national adversaries, and push terrorists to adopt encrypted services sold overseas. As a result, when companies like Apple and Facebook are issued court orders to help governments monitor their customers\u2019 messages, all they can do is turn over a stream of unintelligible code.", "That has inflamed law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey and William J.

Vaccines may be needed only at some future day, in tiny quantities \u2014 or, hopefully, not at all.", "\u201cEverybody realizes there is no market for the industry,\u201d said Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general of the World Health Organization for Health Systems and Innovation. \u201cYou can\u2019t just rely on the private sector to invest \u2014 there is no revenue for them. You need a coalition of the willing \u2014 philanthropists, but this is mainly the responsibility of governments.\u201d", "Outbreak pathogens include Ebola; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which caused 774 deaths 12 years ago; and its cousin, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. They hold the world\u2019s attention while they rage \u2014 and then are quickly forgotten.   \u201cThere were many vaccines in development for SARS, and after it ended they all stopped,\u201d said David Heymann, head of the Center on Global Health Security at Chatham House. \u201cIf they had continued, now we would have a vaccine platform into which you could put a related virus\u201d \u2014 like MERS, which has killed some 600 people and is not yet extinguished.", "Another obstacle: Medicine\u2019s standard of evidence is the Phase 3 clinical trial, which divides thousands of patients at random into vaccinated or vaccinated-with-placebo groups, and then counts how many get sick in each. But for that, you need a big outbreak.", "Ebola was plenty big \u2013 at first. By the time a vaccine was ready to test, it wasn\u2019t. A Phase 3 clinical trial began in Liberia last February, seeking to enroll 27,000 people to test the effectiveness of two top single-dose vaccine candidates. But less than three weeks later, new cases halted. Now only isolated outbreaks continue. It has been great news for the world \u2014 but bad news for testing a vaccine.", "The Liberia trial could start so rapidly because, after September 2014, all the steps necessary to bring a vaccine to human trials were put on emergency footing by an alphabet soup of agencies, national governments, funders and research groups. \u201cThere was a clear decision that there was no choice \u2014 there must absolutely be acceleration of research and development even if we might be too late,\u201d said Kieny. \u201cThere was enormous good will in all involved stakeholders \u2014 industry to make it, clinical investigators to drop all other clinical trials and liberate their centers to do this particular trial. Regulators and ethics review boards allowed the protocols to jump the queue.\u201d", "\u201cThe main thing that moved it forward was partnerships,\u201d said Swati Gupta, Executive Director for Public Health and Scientific Affairs at Merck Vaccines. \u201cThere was unprecedented multinational collaboration.\u201d", "Two vaccines were tested beginning in September and October in Phase 1 trials \u2014 small trials for safety and immunogenicity (whether the vaccine provokes an immune response) in volunteers at multiple sites. One was developed by the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline, and another by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics and then Merck.", "A third, two-dose vaccine followed in December: a two-stage vaccine whose development was funded by the United States National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority \u2014 the bio-threat agency Hill was describing. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen Pharmaceuticals holds the license.", "While researchers were working, logistics experts in affected countries built a chain of super-cold facilities using batteries and solar power, since both vaccines need to be held at around -80 degrees Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit) in countries without reliable electricity.", "Meanwhile, researchers were getting financing. Hill, who led Oxford studies of the GSK vaccine, said that his application for funding to the Wellcome Trust, a British biomedical research foundation, was turned around in 12 days.", "All this came together to enable the Phase 3 clinical trial of the Merck and GSK vaccines in Liberia \u2014 which very quickly fizzled out. The measure of a vaccine is whether it prevents infection in people exposed to a disease. With Ebola fading, how could that be tested?", "", "Researchers turned to ring vaccination \u2014 vaccination of everyone in contact with a sick person, and the contacts of those contacts. It had been used once before, to complete the eradication of smallpox, but never to test a vaccine.", "Researchers in Guinea started ring vaccination with Merck\u2019s vaccine in late March. To test effectiveness, contacts were vaccinated in 48 Ebola cases. In a control group of 42 other cases, contacts of the sick had to wait three weeks before getting vaccine.", "In the control group, 16 people developed Ebola. But of those who were vaccinated, after the few days necessary for the vaccine to take effect, no one got sick. In other words, the vaccination needed 6 days to take effect, and after that conferred 100 percent protection against Ebola. On July 24, the trial was stopped and all participants were vaccinated right away.", "The other two vaccines never underwent Phase 3 trials, because Ebola cases had run out.", "One potential problem with the Merck vaccine is its side effects: fever and arthritis pain that are temporary, but annoying. Another is that it might confer only very short-term protection. As with all new vaccines, we don\u2019t know how long protection lasts; to find out if a vaccine lasts 10 years, you have to wait 10 years.", "Nevertheless, the Merck vaccine does stop the transmission of Ebola. It is now being offered to contacts of the new patients in Liberia, according to the national allergy and infectious diseases institute.", "The Janssen vaccine could be longer-lasting, because it consists of a prime vaccine and then a different vaccine as a booster shot. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer and worldwide chairman for pharmaceuticals at Johnson & Johnson, said that nine months into a trial, the vaccine was still working in those first vaccinated. A short-acting vaccine is adequate for emergencies, but a long-acting vaccine would best protect health care and burial worker.", "Ebola lingers in another way. While the next pathogen to hit might be a disease we\u2019ve never seen, it\u2019s more likely to be a strain of Ebola. The virus lives in wild animals, and so can never be eradicated. There have been two dozen outbreaks in Africa since Ebola was discovered in 1976: last year, one in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, unrelated to the West Africa epidemic, killed 49 people while the world wasn\u2019t looking.", "Ebola is one of 15 outbreak pathogens that have emerged in the last 15 years, Hill said. All, like Ebola before last year, have potential vaccines available that have worked in animals \u2014 some better than others.", "Kieny is convening meetings of researchers, funders and officials to draw up a global get-ready plan, which will begin with an attempt to identify the threats most likely to emerge, and plan for research and development.", "Before being used in an outbreak, vaccine candidates must have already completed animal tests and Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, so we know they are safe and can provoke an immune system response. They then must be manufactured to the highest standards and stockpiled in a large enough quantity for emergency use. Regulators in developed countries and countries likely to be hit must grant clearance to use the vaccine. And for all of this, there must be sustained money and attention \u2014 \u201cin peacetime,\u201d as Kieny puts it.", "In an outbreak, a vaccine could be used as part of a clinical trial, either a standard trial or a ring vaccination trial. But there are also other ways. Luciana Borio, acting chief scientist of the United States Food and Drug Administration, said some vaccines had been licensed based on strong safety and immunogenicity data alone, without any trials of effectiveness in humans; one example is the flu vaccine, which every year covers new strains.", "Another challenge is persuading pharmaceutical companies to manufacture these vaccines on a large scale. Stoffels said that Johnson & Johnson put $200 million into developing its Ebola vaccine candidate, with no guarantees of repayment. Pharmaceutical companies take risks with every drug, but these vaccines are particularly bad financial risks, and Janssen made 800,000 doses of its vaccine before knowing if it would be approved. \u201cWe can do that \u2014 once,\u201d Stoffels said. \u201cTo do this many times, to get to a systematic response, there has to be an incentive.\u201d He said that one option could be to give pharmaceutical companies accelerated regulatory review of another of their drugs.", "\u201cThese do not look like difficult vaccines to make,\u201d said Hill. \u201cEbola worked the first time.   We can do 10 in a similar fashion and they\u2019re likely to work. It will cost tens of millions of dollars to make a small stockpile \u2014 a hundred million for a licensed product.

In the 1950s, Thomas J. Watson Jr., then the company\u2019s chief executive, brought on Eliot Noyes, a distinguished architect and industrial designer, to guide a design program at IBM. And Noyes, in turn, tapped others including Paul Rand, Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen in helping design everything from corporate buildings to the eight-bar corporate logo to the IBM Selectric typewriter with its golf-ball-shaped head.", "At that time, and for many years, design meant creating eye-pleasing, functional products.

This was motivated partly by a shift in how businesses were buying technology. As more purchased software as a service over the Internet, buying decisions were often being made by workers in functional departments \u2014 human relations, sales, marketing and data analytics \u2014 rather than by a central corporate information technology office.

They are embedded in IBM product teams and work alongside customers in the field or at one of 24 design studios around the world.", "IBM has hired designers from top schools like Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, the Rhode Island School of Design and Parsons School of Design.

When Mr. Gilbert first showed up at the graduate design school at Stanford, he was greeted with skepticism. \u201cThese are millennials in Silicon Valley \u2014 they think Google is an old company,\u201d Mr. Burnett said, recalling their first impression. \u201cTo them, IBM was a historical relic.\u201d", "The recruiting pitch made by Mr. Gilbert and his colleagues has been essentially twofold: First, you can make a difference in socially important fields because IBM\u2019s technology plays a crucial role in health care, energy, transportation, water and even agriculture. Second, you can be part of a groundbreaking effort to apply design thinking in business.", "At Stanford, the prevailing view of working for IBM, Mr. Burnett said, has shifted from \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d to \u201cThis is a pretty interesting opportunity.\u201d", "Joe Kendall thinks so. Mr. Kendall, 28, finished a two-year graduate design program at Stanford and joined IBM in June. He chose IBM over Apple, where he would have worked in its iPhone business. At Apple, he figured, his opportunity would be to help make a great product a little bit better. At IBM, Mr. Kendall sees a different opportunity. \u201cNo one is using design thinking to solve problems on this scale,\u201d he said, adding that he could be part of \u201cchanging the future of this giant entity.\u201d", "IBM\u2019s senior managers have all been through design training. Ms. Rometty and her executive team were among the first. The training varies, with executives getting one-day sessions; product managers, a week; and new designers, three-month programs. In all, about 8,000 IBM employees so far have had some in-person training in design thinking. It\u2019s an impressive number, but it\u2019s also only 2 percent of the work force.", "How broadly design thinking is being embraced across IBM is hard to say. It is a new, unfamiliar ingredient in the corporate mix.

Getting clients into the free-form work space, Mr. Gilbert said, can help \u201cfundamentally change their relationship with IBM.\u201d", "That proved to be the case for GameStop, a video game and electronics retailer. Jeff Donaldson, a GameStop technology executive, recalled that IBM\u2019s reputation at the company\u2019s suburban Dallas headquarters was as a slow-moving corporate bureaucracy, dominated by a sales culture offering expensive hardware and software.

In just one year, Bluemix went from an idea to a software platform that has attracted many developers, who are making apps used in industries as varied as consumer banking and wine retailing. In the past, building that kind of technology ecosystem would have taken years.", "Software developers are just as important as customers to IBM, since both groups create markets. \u201cWe wanted to redefine IBM for developers,\u201d said Damion Heredia, an IBM vice president who leads the Bluemix operation.", "Like most of IBM\u2019s new units, Bluemix is run much like a start-up, at arm\u2019s length from the corporate bureaucracy. Mr. Heredia, who worked closely with Mr. Gilbert for years, is steeped in design-thinking methods. His team studied how young programmers built cloud apps. Tarun Gangwani, a manager in the Bluemix unit, recalled traveling to all-night \u201chackathons\u201d to watch developers as they worked, step by step. Guided by what they learned, the Bluemix team built prototype software, tested it with users, and modified and refined it.", "When a free test version of Bluemix was offered in February 2014, Mr. Heredia figured it might attract 2,000 developers in the first few months. It reached that number within a week, and a commercial version was introduced that July. Today, Bluemix is signing up 10,000 new users a week.", "As software becomes more an online service, analysts say, the big corporate contracts that have sustained IBM\u2019s software business will become less frequent. \u201cFor IBM, the dollars are going to have to come from sharply expanding its customer base so that developers at all kinds of companies, including start-ups, see IBM as a place to go to build new things,\u201d said Frank Gens, chief analyst of the market research firm IDC. \u201cThat\u2019s not been IBM\u2019s reputation, and that\u2019s the challenge Bluemix faces.\u201d", "IBM has an impressive track record of corporate evolution over its 104-year history. At different times, the minicomputer, the personal computer and the Internet were seen as threats to its survival. IBM\u2019s deepest crisis \u2014 and revival \u2014 came in the 1990s after the collapsing economics of the mainframe business sent it into a tailspin.

As you can see, five of his fellow commenters recommended what he had to say:", "Next, you might invite students to move to more formal analysis of rhetorical strategies and fallacies by having them read and annotate Times Op-Ed pieces. Framing their opinions as annotations of specific statements or facts can remind them that our arguments should be grounded in actual evidence. And allowing students to express their opinions in the margins of the web, and helping them become responsible and thoughtful as they do it, is a huge part of what it means to be literate both on online and in democratic society generally.", "Students could be asked simply to respond to the reading with their thoughts, as in a dialectical reading journal, or to employ specific cultural or persuasive strategies in their rhetorical intervention. For instance, they might annotate to identify the use of logos, ethos and pathos.", "Annotation can also serve as a kind of \u201crehearsal space\u201d for formal writing. As your students practice \u201ctalking back\u201d to Opinion pieces in The Times, they might consider it preparation for their own argumentative essays, perhaps to submit to our annual contest, which we\u2019ll feature again in Feb., 2016.", "As with all the ideas in this post, this can be done independently or collaboratively. Done independently, students can compare their articles and discuss how different authors establish their authority or commit common fallacies. Focused on a suite of articles relating to a specific topic, students might be asked to note patterns of expression.", "Another idea: Ask students to fact-check a claim made in an article. This can be especially powerful in the case of political speeches or Op-Ed pieces. Annotations should be based on related research and should evaluate the truthfulness of the original claim using predetermined criteria.

Instead of having students note specific words and passages, they are, instead, simply tagging a series of texts on a particular topic in order to collect, categorize and organize them.", "Direct students to find articles relating to a topic they will be researching.

And you can follow their work as they go. If you are using Hypothesis, each user\u2019s annotations are streamed on their public \u201cMy Annotations\u201d page, and teachers can monitor student work like a portfolio rather than on individual texts if so desired. (You can click on a user name attached to an annotation or search the Hypothesis stream for a user name to locate this page. Here, for instance, is Jeremy Dean\u2019s, and you can see he\u2019s been annotating everything from a Times article on the new Quentin Tarantino movie to a recent Supreme Court decision.)", "Many of the exercises above presume that students are annotating together on a shared course text. But the nature of web annotation is that we can see the notes of others even if we are not reading the same text. In this way, we can attend to annotations as texts themselves.

At the wheel was Matthew Shaw, a 32-year-old architectural designer; with him was a fellow designer, William Trossell, 30, and a small team of laser-\u00adscanner operators. All were skilled in their technical fields, but their goal was art. What they hoped to scan was not just the shape of the city streets but the inner life of the autonomous cars that may soon come to dominate them.", "Shaw and Trossell have been fascinated by 3-D scanning since they met in architecture school. There, they investigated how laser scanners perceive the built environment, including the biases, blind spots and peculiar insights any such technology must encompass. In 2010, they started ScanLAB Projects, a London design studio, to widen that investigation. As they already knew, laser-\u00adscanning equipment could easily be fooled by applying it in inappropriate conditions or simply misusing the gear. Solid objects, whether architectural ruins, geological forms or commercial buildings in the heart of London, are particularly amenable to scanning. Fog banks, mist and afternoon drizzle, not so much. Yet Trossell and Shaw\u2019s early work was devoted precisely to this: pushing the technology into unexpected realms where things, by definition, could not go as planned. Setting up their laser scanner deep in the woods, they captured low rolling clouds of mist as digital blurs haunting the landscape; moving ice floes scanned from a ship north of the Arctic Circle took shape in their hard drives as overlapping labyrinths on the verge of illegibility, as if the horizon of the world itself had begun to buckle. These first projects, commissioned by organizations like the BBC and Greenpeace, have since blossomed into a new approach: mapping London through the robot eyes of a self-\u00addriving car.", "One of the most significant uses of 3-D scanning in the years to come will not be by humans at all but by autonomous vehicles. Cars are already learning to drive themselves, by way of scanner-\u00adassisted braking, pedestrian-\u00addetection sensors, parallel-\u00adparking support, lane-\u00addeparture warnings and other complex driver-\u00adassistance systems, and full autonomy is on the horizon. Google\u2019s self-\u00addriving cars have logged more than a million miles on public roads; Elon Musk of Tesla says he\u2019ll probably have a driverless passenger car by 2018; and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers says autonomous vehicles \u2018\u2018will account for up to 75 percent of cars on the road by the year 2040.\u2019\u2019 Driver-\u00adcontrolled cars remade the world in the last century, and there is good reason to expect that driverless cars will remake it again in the century to come: Gridlock could become extinct as cars steer themselves along a cooperatively evolving lacework of alternative routes, like information traversing the Internet. With competing robot cars just a smartphone \u00adtap away, the need for street parking could evaporate, freeing up as much as a third of the entire surface area of some major American cities. And as distracted drivers are replaced by unblinking machines, roads could become safer for everyone.", "But all of that depends on cars being able to navigate the built environment. The cars now being tested by Google, BMW, Ford and others all see by way of a particular kind of scanning system called lidar (a portmanteau of \u2018\u2018light\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018radar\u2019\u2019). A lidar scanner sends out tiny bursts of illumination invisible to the human eye, almost a million every second, that bounce off every building, object and person in the area. This undetectable machine-\u00adflicker is \u2018\u2018capturing\u2019\u2019 extremely detailed, millimeter-\u00adscale measurements of the surrounding environment, far more accurate than anything achievable by the human eye. Capturing resembles photography, but it operates volumetrically, producing a complete three-\u00addimensional model of a scene. The extreme accuracy of lidar lends it an air of infallible objectivity; a clean scan of a stationary structure can be so precise that nonprofit organizations like CyArk have been using lidar as a tool for archaeological preservation in conflict zones, hoping to capture at-\u00adrisk sites of historical significance before they are destroyed.", "Lidar, however, has its own flaws and vulnerabilities. It can be thrown off by reflective surfaces or inclement weather, by mirrored glass or the raindrops of a morning thunderstorm. As the first wave of autonomous vehicles emerges, engineers are struggling with the complex, even absurd, circumstances that constitute everyday street life. Consider the cyclist in Austin, Tex., who found himself caught in a bizarre standoff with one of Google\u2019s self-\u00addriving cars. Having arrived at a four-\u00adway stop just seconds after the car, the cyclist ceded his right of way. Rather than coming to a complete halt, however, he performed a track stand, inching back and forth without putting his feet on the ground. Paralyzed with indecision, the car mirrored the cyclist\u2019s own movements \u2014 jerking forward and stopping, jerking forward and stopping \u2014 unsure if the cyclist was about to enter the intersection. As the cyclist later wrote in an online forum, \u2018\u2018two guys inside were laughing and punching stuff into a laptop, I guess trying to modify some code to \u2018teach\u2019 the car something about how to deal with the situation.\u2019\u2019", "Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University and author of the book \u2018\u2018Robot Futures,\u2019\u2019 uses the metaphor of the perfect storm to describe an event so strange that no amount of programming or image-\u00adrecognition technology can be expected to understand it. Imagine someone wearing a T-\u00adshirt with a stop sign printed on it, he told me. \u2018\u2018If they\u2019re outside walking, and the sun is at just the right glare level, and there\u2019s a mirrored truck stopped next to you, and the sun bounces off that truck and hits the guy so that you can\u2019t see his face anymore \u2014 well, now your car just sees a stop sign. The chances of all that happening are diminishingly small \u2014 it\u2019s very, very unlikely \u2014 but the problem is we will have millions of these cars. The very unlikely will happen all the time.\u2019\u2019", "The sensory limitations of these vehicles must be accounted for, Nourbakhsh explained, especially in an urban world filled with complex architectural forms, reflective surfaces, unpredictable weather and temporary construction sites. This means that cities may have to be redesigned, or may simply mutate over time, to accommodate a car\u2019s peculiar way of experiencing the built environment. The flip side of this example is that, in these brief moments of misinterpretation, a different version of the urban world exists: a parallel landscape seen only by machine-\u00adsensing technology in which objects and signs invisible to human beings nevertheless have real effects in the operation of the city. If we can learn from human misperception, perhaps we can also learn something from the delusions and hallucinations of sensing machines. But what?", "All of the glares, reflections and misunderstood signs that Nourbakhsh warned about are exactly what ScanLAB now seeks to capture. Their goal, Shaw said, is to explore \u2018\u2018the peripheral vision of driverless vehicles,\u2019\u2019 or what he calls \u2018\u2018the sideline stuff,\u2019\u2019 the overlooked edges of the city that autonomous cars and their unblinking scanners will \u2018\u2018perpetually, accidentally see.\u2019\u2019 By deliberately disabling certain aspects of their scanner\u2019s sensors, ScanLAB discovered that they could tweak the equipment into revealing its overlooked artistic potential. While a self-\u00addriving car would normally use corrective algorithms to account for things like long periods stuck in traffic, Trossell and Shaw instead let those flaws accumulate. Moments of inadvertent information density become part of the resulting aesthetic.", "The London that their work reveals is a landscape of aging monuments and ornate buildings, but also one haunted by duplications and digital ghosts. The city\u2019s double-\u00addecker buses, scanned over and over again, become time-\u00adstretched into featureless mega-\u00adstructures blocking whole streets at a time. Other buildings seem to repeat and stutter, a riot of Houses of Parliament jostling shoulder to shoulder with themselves in the distance. Workers setting out for a lunchtime stroll become spectral silhouettes popping up as aberrations on the edge of the image. Glass towers unravel into the sky like smoke. Trossell calls these \u2018\u2018mad machine hallucinations,\u2019\u2019 as if he and Shaw had woken up some sort of Frankenstein\u2019s monster asleep inside the automotive industry\u2019s most advanced imaging technology.", "ScanLAB\u2019s project suggests that humans are not the only things now sensing and experiencing the modern landscape \u2014 that something else is here, with an altogether different, and fundamentally inhuman, perspective on the built environment. If the conceptual premise of the Romantic Movement can somewhat hastily be described as the experience and documentation of extreme landscapes \u2014 as an art of remote mountain peaks, abyssal river valleys and vast tracts of uninhabited land \u2014 then ScanLAB is suggesting that a new kind of Romanticism is emerging through the sensing packages of autonomous machines. While artists once traveled great distances to see sights of sublimity and grandeur, equally wondrous and unsettling scenes can now be found within the means of travel itself. As we peer into the algorithmic dreams of these vehicles, we are perhaps also being given the first glimpse of what\u2019s to come when they awake."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/opinion/betraying-ourselves.html": ["Desperate refugees flee persecution and war, but American politicians \u2014 worried about security risks \u2014 refuse to accept them.", "That\u2019s the situation today, but it\u2019s also the shameful way we responded as Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

To stay out of the shot, the filmmaker has to set up his camera rig, begin recording and then run and hide, peering from behind a haystack or a trash bin and hoping that the action unfolds the way he imagined.

The site is a lot of different things \u2014 a fast-\u00adgrowing online community, an interactive TV universe, a Wild West of frenzied entrepreneurialism \u2014 but at its core, it\u2019s a place where people watch other people play video games. If you don\u2019t understand why anyone would want to do that, you\u2019re not alone, but there are tens of millions of young people who would rather spend two hours on Twitch than endure two minutes of an N.F.L. game or \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory.\u2019\u2019 Only four years old, Twitch already has 100 million viewers who consume 20 billion minutes of gaming every month.

(Amazon bought Twitch in 2014 for about $1 billion, all of it cash.) And there is money in it for the gamers themselves, called \u2018\u2018streamers\u2019\u2019: Fans can subscribe to channels for extra access, or they can send donations of any amount. Streamers with modest followings can make respectable incomes \u2014 hundreds or thousands of dollars a month \u2014 and the very top streamers are getting rich.", "A friend told Janet about Twitch in 2013, and she decided to try. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s addicting,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018I love it.\u2019\u2019 She could play games she liked with friends and build a following. Once she got up to 10,000 followers or so, she could pay for books for college, and food, and candles \u2014 she had an obsession at one point with candles. She loved the way Twitch enlarged her world. \u2018\u2018I love the community,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018You get to hear about them and their life. And you get to share things with them and share funny moments with them. And they become a part of your life, too.

But when Obnoxious started targeting women, around August 2013, it was clear that he was something different, more frightening. It began with a persistent glitch that drove many streamers offline for hours at a time. They would be streaming some game \u2014 say, League of Legends, the most popular PC game, a sprawling battle world with about 30 million daily players \u2014 and their Internet connection would slow to a crawl. The cause didn\u2019t become clear until the women received private Twitch messages from Obnoxious, saying he was responsible: I\u2019m DDoSing you right now. \u2018\u2018DDoS\u2019\u2019 stands for \u2018\u2018distributed denial of service,\u2019\u2019 a type of attack that is difficult to defend against and straightforward to execute. It requires only a moderate level of technical ability and the I.P. address \u2014 the unique network identity \u2014 of the target. And there are websites called \u2018\u2018Skype resolvers\u2019\u2019 on which anyone can type in a Skype user name and find its I.P. address. Once the I.P. address is known, the attacker swamps it with traffic, and the connection goes down.", "The women targeted by these attacks were mostly like Janet, college students in their late teens and early 20s. The attacks were eating into their viewer bases, costing them money. If you want it to stop, Obnoxious typed, add me on Skype, and we can talk about it. When the women did as they were asked, they realized that they were dealing with a teenager \u2014 a strange, depressive 16-year-old. He told part of his story to one streamer. Growing up in Canada somewhere, his father had abused him and beat him. When he turned 18, he said, he was going to kill himself. The streamer felt sorry for him and urged him not to go through with it. Another streamer took notes on his likes and dislikes. \u2018\u2018Plays Runescape,\u2019\u2019 she wrote. \u2018\u2018Periodically watches cartoon pornography. Runs game servers. Has a Taylor Swift fetish.\u2019\u2019", "At first, Obnoxious seemed content with just having women to talk to. \u2018\u2018He wanted friends,\u2019\u2019 says K., a 22-year-old streamer in Florida. (Most of the women interviewed for this article did not want their full names used, fearing future harassment.) Then he started asking for \u2018\u2018fan signs\u2019\u2019: selfies of the women holding pieces of paper with \u2018\u2018Obnoxious\u2019\u2019 written on them. Some women granted this request \u2014 no big deal. Then he demanded nude pictures. He had a foot fetish.

Their chats filled with abuse from multiple screen names:", "\u2018\u2018Dox\u2019\u2019 is a scary word. It\u2019s a document of your private information posted online for anyone to see and exploit. Doxing makes you vulnerable to all sorts of mischief, from phone harassment to credit-\u00adcard fraud or worse. Obnoxious was able to obtain this sort of information for dozens of women. He mainly did it by cold-\u00adcalling Internet companies and duping customer-\u00adservice representatives over the phone. He would use one small piece of public information, a birthday or a favorite pet, to get yet another from one company, and then he would use the new piece to get more information from a different company. He had a con man\u2019s gift for deception. Sometimes he was even able to take over a woman\u2019s account. \u2018\u2018He loved to tell me how he did it,\u2019\u2019 Janet says. \u2018\u2018He told me that he would call customer service at Amazon, say that he forgot my password but he knows my birthday, and the Amazon people, they just give it. And if they wouldn\u2019t, he would just call again.\u2019\u2019 (Amazon did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)", "When the women stopped responding to him, he escalated his attacks. He told a transgender streamer named Alexa Walk that he had her medical records and knew her birth name. Then he posted her birth name on Twitter. He posted nude pictures of some women on Twitter as well. He once posted a nude shot of a 14-year-old girl and later bragged that he was a pedophile. Women reported the abuse to Twitter, but whenever Twitter banned him, he would just make a new account and continue as before.", "Online abuse began to cross over into the physical world.

A string of deliverymen climbed the stairs to K.\u2019s apartment in Florida, carrying unappetizing pies: deep-dish pizza with no cheese, pizza with anchovies and jalape\u00f1os, double bacon and double pepperoni. He called their cellphones repeatedly and sent \u2018\u2018text bombs\u2019\u2019 of hundreds of messages at a time. If all else failed and Obnoxious couldn\u2019t get a hold of a woman, he would start threatening to dispatch a SWAT team to her house, or her parents\u2019 house, or her college \u2014 a kind of intrusion that couldn\u2019t be ignored. When Janet wouldn\u2019t respond to his texts, he reached out to one of her friends and asked the friend to convey a message:", "The SWAT team grew from the tumult of the 1960s. In Philadelphia, a string of armed robberies prompted a \u2018\u2018stakeout\u2019\u2019 unit of officers who received extra weapons training; in Los Angeles, after the Watts riots of 1965, an ambitious police commander, Daryl Gates, who later became the chief of police, argued that the city needed elite officers with rifles, shotguns and armored cars, trained in military-\u00adstyle tactics. Gates explained to The Los Angeles Times in 1968 that during the unrest, \u2018\u2018suddenly we found ourselves with almost a guerrilla warfare without weaponry. ... I felt the frustration of being almost helpless.\u2019\u2019", "At first, the SWAT idea struck some officers as strange \u2014 wouldn\u2019t the units scare residents and damage relationships with communities? \u2014 but lax gun regulations and strict national drug laws encouraged cities and towns to invest in bigger weaponry. The \u2018\u2018war on drugs\u2019\u2019 in particular pressured officers to conduct militarized drug enforcement. (Mother Jones recently analyzed 465 police requests for armored tactical vehicles that resemble small tanks, and more requests said the vehicles would be used for drug enforcement than any other reason.) And the grim logic of mass shootings and hostage situations, where seconds and minutes can matter, pushed communities to form local SWAT teams instead of relying on teams from farther away that took longer to arrive. (A recent study led by a professor at Texas State University analyzed 84 \u2018\u2018active shooter\u2019\u2019 incidents from 2000 to 2010, and about half the time, the shootings were over by the time any officers arrived at the scene.) \u2018\u2018We want to keep the community safe,\u2019\u2019 says the tactical commander of a SWAT team in Georgia. \u2018\u2018And if responding in a very short time period saves lives, that\u2019s what we want to do. And we can do that by having a team readily available. We do.\u2019\u2019", "Through the 1990s and 2000s, SWAT teams started cropping up in smaller American towns, even in places where violent crime is fairly uncommon. According to research done by Peter Kraska, a criminologist at Eastern Kentucky University, by the mid-2000s, 80 percent of law-enforcement agencies in towns with populations of 25,000 to 50,000 had a military-\u00adstyle unit, compared with just 20 percent in the mid-1980s. In the last decade, the \u2018\u2018war on terror\u2019\u2019 has helped local law-\u00adenforcement agencies acquire unprecedented firepower. One Pentagon program has sent at least $5.6 billion in equipment to police departments, including 625 armored tactical vehicles, more than 200 grenade launchers and around 80,000 assault rifles. Many people had no idea that SWAT teams owned gear like this until the protests in Ferguson, Mo., last summer, when images spread around the world of white officers confronting black protesters with tear gas and a type of armored truck called a BearCat. People all along the political spectrum expressed horror at these pictures; Senator Rand Paul wrote that \u2018\u2018the images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\u2019\u2019", "Ferguson renewed a debate about the legitimacy of SWAT tools and strategies that is still being argued. Critics say SWAT teams have become like occupying forces, deploying for purposes beyond their core mission (Radley Balko, the author of \u2018\u2018Rise of the Warrior Cop,\u2019\u2019 found instances of military-\u00adstyle raids on nonviolent offenders like poker players and pot growers); the police say they need the teams and the weapons as deterrents and as bulwarks against the unknown.", "But the unknown is where swatters step in. They exploit the ubiquity of SWAT teams and the readiness of the police to respond. The Georgia tactical commander, a veteran of the Marines, says that for planned raids, when he and his team are considering whether to deploy, they use a \u2018\u2018matrix\u2019\u2019 of risk factors to decide if a SWAT response is justified: Does the suspect have a history of violence? Does the suspect have weapons? Has the suspect made threats to law enforcement? For a situation in progress, though \u2014 an emergency call \u2014 there is no time to go through all of that, and from a police point of view, it\u2019s better to \u2018\u2018respond high and then downgrade\u2019\u2019 than it is to show up unprepared. So when a situation arises with a possible active shooter, especially one who says he is heavily armed and will kill officers, dispatch sends a text to team members\u2019 cellphones to respond to a certain address, and the police are ready for confrontation.", "And when the police \u2018\u2018respond high,\u2019\u2019 residents can become disoriented. Maybe they assume they are being robbed. Maybe they pick up a gun. In 2011, a former Marine and Iraq war veteran named Jose Guerena was awakened by his wife, who thought she saw intruders outside their home in Arizona. Guerena picked up his AR-15 rifle, with the safety on, to protect his wife and family. SWAT officers entered the house, saw the gun and shot Guerena dozens of times, killing him. They were conducting a drug investigation. In 2010, during a military-\u00adstyle raid on a home in east Detroit, a police officer looking for a murder suspect accidentally shot and killed a 7-year-old girl while she slept.", "Swatting isn\u2019t new; law enforcement encountered a ring of swatters in the mid-2000s. But the phenomenon is touching more and more lives in more serious ways. (The F.B.I. doesn\u2019t keep statistics on swatting incidents; a bureau spokeswoman says it is still working out which part of the F.B.I. should handle swatting investigations, because the crime \u2018\u2018crosses so many of our delineated thresholds for who handles what.\u2019\u2019) Activists and political operatives on the right and the left have been swatted. Reporters writing about computer security have been swatted. Celebrities have been swatted: Ashton Kutcher, Justin Timberlake, Rihanna. Politicians trying to pass anti-\u00adswatting bills, including a state senator in California and a state assemblyman in New Jersey, have been swatted at their homes. Video gamers, male and female, have been swatted.", "While a swatting hoax is often preceded by other kinds of Internet attacks (Twitter threats, the public posting of a home address or phone number), swatting is the most troubling manifestation of online harassment, because it\u2019s not online at all \u2014 it\u2019s actual weapons and confusion, showing up at your door.", "What a lot of the victims remember is a sense of unreality, a feeling like they were watching a movie. K. says she opened the door of her Florida apartment one evening to find a dozen SWAT officers lined up on the stairs with riot shields and black guns pointed at her. She froze and thought of the metal belt buckle she happened to be clutching in her left hand. They\u2019re going to think I have a weapon in my hand. They\u2019re going to shoot me.", "Obnoxious often sent a text to his target telling her that the SWAT team was on its way \u2014 too late to stop it \u2014 just so she would know it was him. Sometimes victims received phone calls from the police before the SWAT team arrived. A Canadian Twitch streamer named Maple Ong got a call one night in January 2014, telling her to leave her house with her hands up, along with her panicked father and younger brother, so the police could search it for bombs that Obnoxious had told them were placed there. Allison Henderson, a 26-year-old artist and streamer who lived with two other streamers in Costa Mesa, Calif., received a phone call one night from a woman with the Police Department, asking her how many people were in her apartment and what she was wearing. Allison and her roommates had recently been DDoSed and harassed by Obnoxious. The policewoman told Allison to step outside with her hands above her head.", "\u2018\u2018I held my breath and slowly opened the door to the sight of rifles pointed at me from every direction,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018It was the most terrifying experience of my life.\u2019\u2019 When officers questioned her, she couldn\u2019t make them understand. \u2018\u2018They were completely lost on the idea of a stranger harassing us over the Internet,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a feeling like you\u2019re drowning, and the person doesn\u2019t understand what water is.\u2019\u2019", "A few months after Obnoxious swatted Janet and her family, he swatted them again. The officers who showed up this time seemed irritated at Janet, \u2018\u2018like it was my fault that I got swatted, because I do what I do, because I play video games.\u2019\u2019 She says one told her, \u2018\u2018Just pick up a book.\u2019\u2019 The officers who responded to these calls did a professional job \u2014 in the sense that they assessed the situation, de-\u00adescalated it and didn\u2019t fire their weapons. At the same time, they misjudged what they were seeing. They didn\u2019t grasp that each swatting was merely a spike in a long-\u00adrunning pattern of abuse that would continue when they drove away. \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t want to dwell on it,\u2019\u2019 says K., the Florida streamer. \u2018\u2018You just want to go back to doing what you love. But it isn\u2019t that simple. Because everything\u2019s changed. As he was attacking us, we couldn\u2019t be the same anymore.\u2019\u2019 Some of Obnoxious\u2019s swatting victims took long breaks from streaming, even though it was a major social outlet and an income source for them. \u2018\u2018I just wanted to be alone,\u2019\u2019 says Alexa Walk, who was swatted by Obnoxious at her apartment in North Carolina. \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t want people to see me upset.\u2019\u2019", "After being attacked, several victims reached out to Twitch, asking for information that they could give to detectives or for advice on how to protect themselves from further abuse. In early January 2014, one victim wrote to Twitch, saying that she and \u2018\u2018a lot of other female streamers have been severely harassed and attacked by a \u2018hacker\u2019 named Obnoxious and his friends.\u2019\u2019 She continued: \u2018\u2018It has gotten to the point that he is calling SWAT teams into houses. I just dealt with the SWAT team at my house.\u2019\u2019 A Twitch representative replied that he was aware of Obnoxious and the swattings \u2014 he had seen one victim\u2019s anguished Facebook post \u2014 but that \u2018\u2018in some cases, there is not a lot we can do when things happen off of our site.\u2019\u2019 Another Twitch representative told Jamie Lynn Greenwood, 32, a streamer who was swatted in Montana while playing Minecraft (not by Obnoxious but by someone else) and was ordered from her home at gunpoint along with her husband, \u2018\u2018I sympathize for you going through that \u2014 best of luck to the police to catch the perpetrator!\u2019\u2019", "(Twitch\u2019s initial response to questions emailed by this magazine was brief. A company spokesman called swatting \u2018\u2018an age-old stunt far from unique to Twitch\u2019\u2019 and claimed that swattings of Twitch broadcasters are \u2018\u2018infrequent.\u2019\u2019 Later, after being told of the magnitude of the Obnoxious case, he wrote, \u2018\u2018We are adding info about swatting as part of our Education portal, which will also have info on protection from DDoS and other common ways of being harassed.\u2019\u2019)", "B.A. Finley, a detective sergeant with the Johns Creek Police Department outside Atlanta, had heard about swatting but never really understood it until Jan. 16, 2014. That afternoon, a man called a police line in Alpharetta, Ga., and said he had killed three people in a home in nearby Johns Creek and was holding a girl hostage. \u2018\u2018If you send any cops here, I swear to God I\u2019ll shoot their ass.\u2019\u2019 The dispatcher tried to get information as the man stammered and cursed at her. \u2018\u2018I got the little girl right here.\u2019\u2019 He said he needed $30,000 or he would kill the girl, too.", "Officers \u2014 including Finley \u2014 raced to the address with rifles and shotguns, unholstering loaded pistols at the scene, only to find that there was no hostage-\u00adtaker, no dead family, no emergency. There was only chaos: close to 40 responders and their vehicles, gawking neighbors, traumatized victims, everyone trying to figure out what had happened.", "The hoax made the news, and the Johns Creek mayor expressed his anger publicly. Then, nine days later, the police got a second call of an emergency at the same address, this time from a different-\u00adsounding man. \u2018\u2018Hey, yo,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m at one of my old buddies\u2019 house. He stole, like, ten grand from me.\u2019\u2019 And then: \u2018\u2018I planted four bombs in his house.\u2019\u2019 It was another swatting hoax.", "The police chief asked Finley to make the case his top priority, to take whatever time he needed to catch the perpetrator \u2014 a mandate that detectives, especially those looking into swatting cases, don\u2019t often enjoy.", "Finley is a tall, big-\u00adtorsoed man with a thick drawl. At that time, he didn\u2019t have any \u2018\u2018cyber\u2019\u2019 experience, in the charming archaism often used by law enforcement. But he possessed unusual patience, and this was an investigation that required a great deal of it. Neither of the caller-\u00adID numbers attached to the two hoax calls belonged to an individual. They had to be traced through a laby\u00adrinth of companies that buy blocks of numbers and resell them to voice-\u00adover-\u00adIP providers; the only way to do this was to subpoena the companies, wait for records to come back (it could take a week), analyze the records and send out more subpoenas, court orders and search warrants \u2014 75 of them by the end. It was all very analog; when Finley needed to update his commander on the investigation, he would print out photos of his white board on sheets of 8\u00bd-by-11 paper and tape the pages together.", "By April, he had filled a conference room with stacks of documents. He asked the cleaning crew not to touch the room. He was getting somewhere. The first swatting seemed to be a one-off; it pointed to a suspect in New York. (The suspect has yet to be charged.) But the second swatting led to a bigger world of crimes. After weeks of slogging through paper, Finley linked the call to a Skype account that had also called 10 other police agencies across the United States and Canada in the same month. Finley got in touch with these agencies, and sure enough, they had received hoax emergency calls on those dates. Finley compared the recordings of some of those calls with the Georgia call. It was obviously the same suspect; he hadn\u2019t bothered to alter his voice. He had a vocal tic that Finley kept trying to place, some slight cold-\u00adweather quirk, as if he were from way up north, Wisconsin, maybe Canada.", "It wasn\u2019t easy to pinpoint the swatter\u2019s location, in part because he had masked his I.P. address by using virtual private networks. The VPNs flung the swatter\u2019s traffic back and forth from Russia to the Netherlands and other places. \u2018\u2018These things can make your head spin,\u2019\u2019 Finley says. He spent a lot of time staring at the conference-room wall and asking computer analysts questions on the phone. Using an email address associated with the Skype account to pry out more records, he eventually discovered what looked like the swatter\u2019s personal website, listing his name as \u2018\u2018Obnoxious.\u2019\u2019 He also found a page on Pastebin that purported to reveal Obnoxious\u2019s true name, along with his birth date and hometown. Apparently, one of his online enemies had doxed him. According to the dox, the swatter was a minor living in Coquitlam, a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia.", "This news, if true, was unpromising; Finley obviously couldn\u2019t just fly to another country and put a juvenile in handcuffs. But he kept pulling threads. Finley called the police in Coquitlam, and while they wouldn\u2019t give him the swatter\u2019s name, they confirmed that they knew all about him. He had been arrested earlier that year, in fact, and released on bail on the condition that he not access the Internet or use a computer without supervision. The authorities would arrest him again in the fall \u2014 only to release him on bail yet again.", "Now Finley had a suspect. The problem was how to make the arrest. Swatting isn\u2019t an easy crime to charge; law enforcement is still developing a language for it. Is it a type of fraud? Identity theft? Cyberterrorism? Is it a prank? Three federal lawmakers, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representatives Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts and Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania, recently introduced bills to increase penalties for swatting, but right now, many swatters, if charged at all, are charged with misdemeanors. Finley knew that Obnoxious was causing real harm, but he didn\u2019t seem to have good options; even if he could persuade a prosecutor in Georgia to take an interest in the case, they would never be able to extradite an underage suspect from Canada. The swatter seemed keenly aware of this reality. \u2018\u2018UNTOUCHABLE,\u2019\u2019 Finley saw him tweet once. \u2018\u2018UNEXTRADITEABLE.\u2019\u2019", "At the same time that Finley was researching Obnoxious, his victims were undertaking their own investigation. The police couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t help, they assumed, and the Internet companies were useless. If they wanted to protect themselves and others, they had to organize.", "In private and on Facebook, they began to network and gather evidence, and soon they had a pool of screen shots and chat logs, as well as a zip file that appeared to contain the swatter\u2019s \u2018\u2018hit list\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a folder of text files with private information about 99 female gamers, obtained by a woman who had been harassed by Obnoxious and who found it on Doxbin. They also found the same dox that Finley found, the one that listed the swatter\u2019s hometown and real name. A few victims had been assigned local detectives who asked them to send along any relevant information, and the women now shared what they had.", "Obnoxious must have felt exposed by the doxing, because around this time he went on Twitter and apologized to some of his victims, saying he was going to stop swatting people. But his attacks only intensified over that spring and into summer. \u2018\u2018We knew he wasn\u2019t going to stop doing it,\u2019\u2019 Alexa Walk says. \u2018\u2018He was going really hard on it this time.\u2019\u2019", "He started skipping the intermediate step of pizza and went straight to swatting. He also broadened his list of targets. In June, in the California city of Ontario, 35 miles east of Los Angeles, the police got a call that a local man was doing dope, had shot and killed his father with an AR-15 and was thinking about killing his mother. They sent 32 units to the address, representing 90 percent of its available law-\u00adenforcement resources \u2014 three supervisors, throngs of squad cars, an armored BearCat, a helicopter, a canine unit \u2014 only to find three people, a mother, her boyfriend and her son, inside the home and perfectly safe. The son was a League of Legends gamer who had angered Obnoxious by defending one of his female victims online.", "The ordeal cost the taxpayers of Ontario $6,500, yet it was sometimes difficult for the Ontario detective assigned to the case to justify spending time on it. \u2018\u2018I have felony cases sitting on my lap,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018Why would I take this cyber case, tracking down all these records, trying to find a guy who\u2019s in another country?\u2019\u2019", "Finley understood that sentiment, one echoed by many other officers. But the swatter enraged him. He knew, from talking to victims, that people were hurting and struggling. \u2018\u2018Do you just say, Oh, sorry, he\u2019s a teenage boy, and he lives in Canada, and there\u2019s nothing we can do? I do not like telling people there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u2019\u2019", "By August 2014, Finley had reached out to the F.B.I.\u2019s Atlanta field office, asking if the bureau could help with a swatting case in which the suspect was a minor. He was told the swatter would have to be \u2018\u2018prolific.\u2019\u2019 Finley asked what that meant. He knew the swatter had made hoax calls to 11 police departments in that one January alone. How many swattings is prolific? No one Finley spoke to at the bureau could say. But Finley kept tracking Obnoxious, kept calling the F.B.I. with updates \u2014 he could connect the guy to 20 swatting calls, then 30 calls. When he got past 40 about a month later, he finally found a special agent named Andrew Young. Forty was definitely prolific.", "Young met with Finley and looked at all he had gathered. The swatter \u2018\u2018was very brazen in his activity,\u2019\u2019 Young says, \u2018\u2018very mean\u00adspirited and destructive.\u2019\u2019 Young thought the best strategy was to persuade Canada to make the arrest, given that there was little chance of extradition. He could open a parallel F.B.I. case, help Finley package up his research \u2018\u2018nice and neatly\u2019\u2019 and get it into the right Canadian hands.", "In September and October last year, Obnoxious launched new attacks. He swatted a girl\u2019s high school in Fort Meade, Fla., saying he would drive there \u2018\u2018in a black Jeep Cherokee and shoot everyone with an AK-47\u2019\u2019\u2014 a threat that sent the school into lockdown for hours. According to the Polk County Sheriff\u2019s Office, he swatted the same school again a month later, then swatted the student at her family\u2019s home in nearby Winter Haven. He swatted a female Twitch streamer in \u00adTucson, where she was attending the University of Arizona, then swatted her again five days later while her mother was visiting; at the exact moment, he also swatted the family homestead back in Phoenix, with the streamer\u2019s brother and father in the house at the time, removed by the police at gunpoint.", "Over the next month, the mother watched her daughter\u2019s sleep pattern change. She lost the ability to keep up at college and decided to withdraw for the semester. Obnoxious broke into her Twitter feed and started posting abuse from it. \u2018\u2018He just ripped her life apart,\u2019\u2019 the mother says. \u2018\u2018And ours, too.\u2019\u2019", "Still, Canada couldn\u2019t make the arrest. They told the United States authorities that they didn\u2019t have enough evidence to get a warrant to search the swatter\u2019s home.", "By late 2014, there were still women on Twitch who didn\u2019t know about Obnoxious and his swatting, who continued streaming their games and building their channels. One was Hayli Metter, age 23, a journalism major at Arizona State. She had played games since she was 6, when her father introduced her to Doom; after her parents went through a difficult divorce, she sought refuge in a \u2018\u2018Harry Potter\u2019\u2019 fan site called MuggleNet, where she wrote and shared fan fiction. When she discovered Twitch, \u2018\u2018I just fell in love with it,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018Best thing in the world.\u2019\u2019 In six months, she had amassed 5,000 or 6,000 followers and was thinking seriously about a professional life in video games. The most important thing to her was creating a welcoming community: \u2018\u2018People come, and they want to feel that they have a home. It\u2019s a family.\u2019\u2019", "The first she heard of Obnoxious was on the night of Nov. 30, when he donated $1 to her channel while she was streaming. Thanks, she thought. Then he started abusing her via chat. He doxed her, posting her address and apartment number, which he had filched from her Internet provider, Cox Communications, by pretending to be a company technician. (Cox says that \u2018\u2018we regret that this incident occurred\u2019\u2019 and that it is constantly updating its security protocols.) Hayli\u2019s moderators tried to ban him, but he kept reappearing under new names. \u2018\u2018Hayli,\u2019\u2019 he typed, \u2018\u2018if your mods don\u2019t stop banning me, I swear to God I\u2019m going to swat you.\u2019\u2019", "Private messages from friends started pouring in, telling Hayli to call the police. She called 911 and tried to explain that someone was threatening to swat her. Minutes later, Obnoxious called the Tempe police, pretended that he was afraid he was going to be swatted and asked if they could send a squad car. He gave Hayli\u2019s address. \u2018\u2018Can I tell you something?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If I see any police officers, I\u2019m shooting them.\u2019\u2019", "Confused but cautious, the Tempe police sent a few officers to Hayli\u2019s apartment to make sure she was O.K. Obnoxious kept sending threats while Hayli was speaking to them; they took photos of her screen with their phones.", "At some point after midnight on Dec. 1, Obnoxious started broadcasting his crimes on multiple sites. When one site would ban him, he would switch to another. The stream showed everything but his face. His voice was audible, and sometimes the voices of five or six other male teenagers, egging him on. Incredibly, in full view of anyone who wanted to watch (he posted links to the streams on Twitter), he made two hoax emergency calls to two American police departments: St. Paul and Grove City, Ohio. Grove City sent officers with tactical rifles to surround a house in a residential neighborhood, surprising a woman\u2019s husband when he opened the door.", "Obnoxious\u2019s stream continued for more than eight hours and 40 minutes, enough time for many of his victims to realize what he was doing and frantically email their police contacts: He is swatting people right now, in front of an audience. Hayli saw the stream and couldn\u2019t believe it. Finley was watching it, too. The mother of the University of Arizona victim tipped him off. He emailed a link to his contacts in Canada and told them to tune in.", "The Canadian police arrested the suspect on Dec. 5, four days after he tried to swat Hayli. Much of the case against him had been shipped up from Georgia. Prosecutors eventually charged him with 46 counts, including criminal harassment, public mischief and extortion; he pleaded guilty to 23 counts. (His Vancouver lawyer didn\u2019t return phone calls.) He was interviewed at length by a social worker, a psychiatrist and a psychologist, who confirmed that the swatter\u2019s childhood had been tragic, marred by an abusive father and a mentally ill mother. The psychiatric report noted that he had essentially no remorse: \u2018\u2018His description of the pleasure he gets from causing humiliation and harm ... is suggestive of quite significant emerging psychopathic traits.\u2019\u2019 At a court appearance in May, he wore a sweatsuit, ankles shackled together; a local reporter observed him smiling occasionally and flicking his brown hair. In July, a judge sentenced him to 16 months in youth jail, with credit for time served while awaiting trial. He is scheduled to be released in March, at age 18.", "Finley estimates that he spent 1,000 hours on the case, an incredible amount of effort to catch one teenager. But the kid was exploiting an obvious flaw in the system. When he called the police in Ontario, Calif., in June 2014 and said he had killed his father with an AR-15 and had taken his mother hostage and would shoot any officers who showed up, \u2018\u2018Guys are thinking: This is it. This is what we\u2019ve been trained for,\u2019\u2019 the Ontario detective says. \u2018\u2018This is why we get this tactical equipment. This is why we have a BearCat. This is why we have armor and rifles.\u2019\u2019 In the United States, law enforcement and the public are still grappling with what SWAT teams are for and how they should be used, but the swatter knew exactly how to use them.", "Some of Obnoxious\u2019s victims were initially wary of talking about him or their cases. They eventually did so in hopes that it would make it easier for future victims of swatting, doxing and online harassment to explain what they were enduring. \u2018\u2018This means that more people will take it seriously,\u2019\u2019 one victim says. \u2018\u2018This means that it\u2019s a crime.\u2019\u2019 The women have proved resilient: Hayli says she returned to Twitch almost immediately after her swatting because \u2018\u2018I didn\u2019t want him to win,\u2019\u2019 and she now has 58,000 followers and 1.8 million views. Janet now makes a living streaming full-time. \u2018\u2018I try to focus on the good parts and the good people of the Twitch community,\u2019\u2019 she says.", "Many, though, are still worried about the swatter and what he will be like when he is released. (One victim says, \u2018\u2018I just hope he leaves me alone, forever, ever, ever.\u2019\u2019) They wonder, too, about the others: the swatter\u2019s friends and fans, the ones who cheered, the ones who might decide to try it for themselves. \u2018\u2018It was never really him that I was really afraid of,\u2019\u2019 Hayli says. \u2018\u2018It was all the other people who I had no idea who they were.\u2019\u2019 There\u2019s nothing stopping them from doing everything Obnoxious did.

What would you add?", "", "Before Reading", "1. Activate Prior Knowledge", "Your students will have opinions and at least some background knowledge about nearly any topic you plan to teach. Sometimes, as in the case of viral news stories where the facts are not yet all known, they may also have misinformation. We often pose questions that are designed to help a class build context before they read.", "News Q\u2019s Example Before reading about President Obama\u2019s recent call for limits on standardized testing, we asked students: \u201cHow much standardized testing have you experienced? How has it benefited you and your teachers?

Pose a Question or Problem That Stirs the Imagination", "Not everything we cover in News Q\u2019s is about a serious topic like gun violence or North Korea.

Invite Students to Make Predictions or Suggest Theories", "Sometimes asking students to anticipate what they\u2019re about to read by making guesses or advancing theories about the topic can give them a real stake in finding answers.

Make Connections", "Whether it\u2019s the migration crisis in Europe or the Twitter feud between Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift, students can make connections between what they are reading about the world today and the academic subjects they are studying in school, including history, literature, science, art and even math.", "News Q\u2019s Example: After students read an article about the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, we asked them to make connections between the challenges of documenting that climactic event to the challenges of documenting climate change for scientists today.", "News Q\u2019s Example: For an article about a South Carolina police officer who dragged a student out of her desk, we asked students to consider the discipline policies at their own schools and whether they think they create equity and a positive climate.", "2. Investigate Further", "Articles about interesting topics, whether roller coasters, a hitchhiking robot, the role of \u201cbig soda\u201d in their lives or fantasy sports, should make students want to know more. We often try to help by suggesting ways to dig deeper \u2014 whether via additional reading, or through doing research of their own.", "News Q\u2019s Example: For an article about ghost hunting in Norway, we asked students to poll or interview a group, such as their class or family, about whether they believe in ghosts, and why.", "News Q\u2019s Example After reading about Google\u2019s driverless cars, we asked students to \u201cimagine that Google hired you to make its driverless cars a little more \u2018human.\u2019 Observe human drivers on the road, and make a list of 10 ways that humans don\u2019t always follow the letter of the law.\u201d", "3.

Last month, Nevada regulators said fantasy sports games are forms of gambling, not games of skill, and ordered the companies to suspend operations until they received gaming licenses. The United States attorney in Manhattan has also begun an investigation.", "Traditionally, fantasy sports are games played among friends over several months.

In late September, a DraftKings employee accidentally disclosed internal data about athletes picked in fantasy football games. That employee won $350,000 playing on FanDuel. Though the companies say the employee did not benefit from the data, the incident shows that these businesses cannot police themselves. Regulators should require basic measures, including procedures that prevent the misuse of betting data.", "Lawmakers should also be concerned about the effect daily fantasy games have on the bettors. The National Council on Problem Gambling, an advocacy group, recently said people who play these games \u201care at high risk to, and do, develop gambling problems.\u201d Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office said these games are dangerous because they can be played rapidly and involve big prizes, and because of the perception that anybody can win.", "Gambling in all its forms has always been enticing, and subject to strict regulations.

But he said the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s recent net neutrality decision might paradoxically make that less likely, if it\u2019s interpreted to mean networks must share infrastructure as well as offer equal access to bandwidth. This would result in the cost-saving practice of threading new fiber optic cable through the same conduits and running them up the same poles as existing lines. Google has argued for that right in communications with the F.C.C.", "The trouble is that cables running in a single licorice-like twist are easier to disable in one quick cut.

Simpson was a member of the board and audit committee of Infinity Broadcasting.", "It is a different world today. Now, the focus is on engagement. Boards have more meetings and more required work, largely because of changes starting with the Sarbanes-Oxley law of 2002. The average board now meets eight times a year, according to the consulting firm Spencer Stuart. There is not just more work, but also a higher likelihood of being sued if things go wrong.", "More work and more liability exposure has made it harder to get the right kinds of people for boards, as top executives prefer to concentrate on their day jobs.", "In their pursuit of good director nominees, hedge funds are now even paying directors a cut of their profits, an arrangement known as a golden leash. Golden leashes have been used by activist hedge funds in proxy contests involving Agrium, General Motors and Hess. In each of those contests, directors stood to make millions if the hedge fund did; the compensation was meant in part to attract the best candidates.", "Compared with the golden leash arrangements, the Facebook directors are a bargain.", "An argument could be made that board pay should, indeed, be higher and that the Facebook director compensation is a pittance. Of course, on the other side, why should any public company pay one cent more than it has to \u2014 particularly when the compensation is voted on by the directors themselves?", "The irony is that in many cases the compensation figure is completely meaningless, while in other cases it means way too much.", "Does it make sense that Mr. Andreessen, Mr. Hastings and Mr. Thiel, all billionaires, are on the Facebook board for money? More likely they, like many other directors, are there for the prestige of being labeled a \u201cFacebook director.\u201d", "But other directors probably care way too much about the money. Take the Square board, for example. It has Ruth Simmons on it, the former president of Brown University who resigned from the Goldman Sachs board after the financial crisis. She received an option to buy 38,000 shares of Square to join the board, far less than Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, who received an option to buy almost 1.1 million shares. In both cases, though, these are significant sums when measured against their net worth. The Square directors, who include Magic Johnson, have almost no banking experience, by the way.", "It all means that director compensation, no matter how high the figure goes, often simply doesn\u2019t make sense. In many cases it has no bearing on the experience brought to the table. In other cases, directors may be too beholden to the nice paycheck and unwilling to challenge management.", "And there is no evidence that paying directors more actually improves company performance.", "In fact, director pay is one area in which pay for performance may not even be the best idea. It could give directors incentive to encourage a company to take outsize risks. Since directors are usually protected from the downside and unlikely to be held liable, missteps might end up hurting shareholders. The directors can just continue in their regular jobs. Compare this to chief executives who have their whole career and reputation staked in the company.", "Which brings us back to Facebook.", "It would be a mistake to get too excited about the possibility that this court case is going to strike a blow against director compensation.

Other companies pay more, including Google and Salesforce.com, which each paid directors around $650,000 in 2013. Facebook even dropped its director compensation to about $370,000 last year.", "And so, the Facebook case shows, perhaps, that when it comes to director pay, there is no clear answer.

The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s five-year-old whistle-blower program has been a sobering tonic against the seemingly endless series of corporate scandals. The agency recently announced it had received a record number of tips (3,929) from whistle-blowers and paid out record sums (more than $37 million) in fiscal 2015.", "But it\u2019s no secret that being a corporate whistle-blower isn\u2019t always easy or glamorous, even though the program allows people to report anonymously, offers robust employment protections and pays significant monetary awards. As we documented in a recent survey of the financial services industry, some employers are deploying countermeasures to discourage employees from reporting wrongdoing, such as the abuse of highly restrictive confidentiality agreements to silence corporate whistle-blowers. Potential whistle-blowers often are afraid that their anonymity will be compromised and they will be the subject of retaliation, blacklisting or other unwanted scrutiny. Others are uncertain whether a significant violation has occurred or whether they will be believed by law enforcement and regulatory authorities.", "So how should a corporate whistle-blower navigate the potential pitfalls? Here are five things to know.", "Think about what, how and when to report.", "What: So you\u2019ve seen something that doesn\u2019t seem right \u2014 should you report it? This is a difficult question, especially in the financial services industry, which is overseen by numerous state and federal regulators including the Federal Reserve, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the S.E.C. Figuring out whether a violation of the law may have occurred \u2014 and whether you may also have potential liability for the wrongdoing \u2014 is critical. We are sometimes contacted by potential whistle-blowers who were involved in misconduct and worry the regulators will come after them. Although that\u2019s rarely the case, especially in situations where someone was following a superior\u2019s direction and had a limited role, this risk should be carefully considered before reporting.", "How: Will you go to your boss, the authorities or both simultaneously? There are many factors to consider: Does the company offer you a trustworthy way to report internally, while remaining anonymous? If not, does your organization genuinely encourage employees to speak up and how have other whistle-blowers been treated? Many of my clients have reported internally first \u2014 some more formally than others. That can increase your eventual award, but you need to carefully weigh the potential risk of retaliation against the need to protect investors and opportunity to receive a larger whistle-blower award. Ultimately, you do not need to report internally first to receive the incentives and protections of the S.E.C.\u2018s whistle-blower program.", "When: If you plan to report to the S.E.C., don\u2019t delay. Sometimes there are multiple whistle-blowers and the first to report may be given greater weight when it comes time for an award. It might even make sense to make a cursory submission and provide a more detailed supplemental submission later. The bottom line is that timing matters and the program is intended to reward early reporting.", "Mum\u2019s the word.", "Remaining anonymous is extremely important to most corporate whistle-blowers.", "Whether you want to be anonymous or not, you should avoid actions that could reveal your intentions or status as a whistle-blower such as conspicuously downloading documents or telling co-workers, even trusted ones. Be particularly careful with electronic communications, do not Google \u201cwhistle-blower award\u201d or \u201cwhistle-blower attorney\u201d from your work computer or mobile device (Believe me, it happens.) Also, you don\u2019t have to be Sherlock Holmes, interrogating suspected wrongdoers and taking photos of everything in the office. Let the S.E.C. do its job once it gets the tip from you.", "Keep careful records and gather evidence. Legally.", "Whether you report internally or externally, it is important that you keep accurate and detailed records. Organizing and maintaining information such as a reliable timeline and the whereabouts of crucial evidence, and detailing your assistance to the S.E.C., can assist regulators greatly and form the basis for your future application for award. Reporting possible violations without direct evidence is permissible. However, providing more corroborating evidence with your initial tip will increase the likelihood that the S.E.C. will investigate your tip and the probability the agency will bring a successful enforcement action based upon it. That being said, there are limits as to what evidence you can collect and how you can collect such evidence. For instance, employees in New York have a greater ability to record potentially incriminating conversations than some other states. So, if you are not sure about the law in this area, you are encouraged to consult with a lawyer.", "Play it cool.", "While the whistle-blower\u2019s workplace can feel like a pressure cooker, before and after reporting to the S.E.C., it\u2019s important to behave professionally from start to finish. Try to adopt a Zen-like attitude. Smart whistle-blowers avoid making threats or ultimatums, sending panicked emails, speaking out publicly through traditional or social media or engaging in other actions that can needlessly put an employer on the defensive or out themselves. Remember investigations can take time, and it\u2019s important not to get frustrated or impatient. The good guys generally win in the end.", "Know that you are not alone.", "While those who stand up against wrongdoing can feel isolated, whistle-blowers are most certainly not alone.

A group of political scientists used this exact technique to poll the 2012 presidential election using data collected from Xbox.", "But this heavy-handed technique isn\u2019t as useful in a primary.

Not to Mr. Seroussi. \u201cWhat are the odds that at 10:30 at night, a guy suddenly has a vision that I\u2019m reading his email?\u201d he said. \u201cThey must know something that I don\u2019t.\u201d", "It turned out that the start-up executive had planted a tracking mechanism into his message to Mr. Seroussi, a trend that is increasingly afflicting all of our email. Trackers, which come in many forms including a single invisible pixel inserted into an email or the hyperlinks embedded inside a message, are frequently being used to detect when someone opens a message and even where that person is when the email is opened. By some estimates, trackers are now used in as much as 60 percent of all sent emails.", "The trackers are traditionally offered by email marketing services like GetResponse and MailChimp. They have a legitimate use: to help commercial entities send messages tailored for specific types of customers. The New York Times, too, uses email trackers in its newsletters. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights, estimates that practically every marketing email now contains some form of a tracker.", "Yet, the prevalence of these trackers raises consumer questions. Because trackers are invisible, many people are unaware of them and have no inkling of how to dodge them. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a privacy concern,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a technologist and privacy advocate for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cThere\u2019s no mechanism for people to opt out.\u201d", "A basic method for thwarting some email trackers involves disabling emails from automatically loading images, including invisible tracking pixels. But that doesn\u2019t defeat all trackers, which are also hiding in other places like fonts and web links.", "I recently put a handful of free email tracking services and tracker detectors to the test to assess whether there was a viable method for identifying and removing the invisible snoopers. I tried the trackers and detectors on the most popular email service, Gmail.", "My conclusions aren\u2019t heartening. I found that the available solutions for combating trackers were far from ideal. Some failed to ferret out many trackers, while others required major trade-offs.", "I began by testing the email trackers themselves. One was MailTrack, which is a plug-in for Google\u2019s Chrome browser that can quickly insert a hidden tracking pixel into a message. Setting it up is simple. You install the plug-in and enable a Google mail account to use the service. After typing an email, you hit a double check mark icon to embed the invisible tracker. When the recipient opens the email, you receive a notification and an email alerting you that the message has been opened.", "I also tried a better-known email marketing service, MailChimp, which includes tracking as part of a suite of features. The service is tailored for small businesses to compose and send email campaigns for their products. The company says its trackers can see when specific recipients open email and also pull data on where they are and what devices they are using.", "\u201cPeople want to be spoken to as a snowflake, an individual,\u201d Eric Muntz, MailChimp\u2019s vice president for product, said in an interview. \u201cOur tools help our users talk to their customers in a very specific way.\u201d", "In my experiment, I was able to create an email newsletter on MailChimp in 10 minutes with trackers embedded into the email itself, as well as inside buttons for sharing on social media and buying an item. After I sent the newsletter to myself, MailChimp showed when I opened the email and that I clicked on all the buttons. It also showed that I opened the message in the United States, though it could not pinpoint my precise location.", "I then tried two tracking detectors that aim to help people identify whether the trackers have invaded your messages. One is called Ugly Email and the other is Trackbuster, a company that Mr. Seroussi founded last year after receiving the suspiciously well-timed email from the start-up.", "Ugly Email works as a Gmail plug-in. When a tracker is detected, it shows the icon of an eyeball in the subject line to alert you that a tracker is hidden inside the email. The software notified me about some marketing emails containing trackers, including trackers from MailChimp. But after I sent myself test emails with trackers using MailTrack, Ugly Email failed to flag those.", "Sonny Tulyaganov, the web engineer who created Ugly Email, said he manually added different email tracking pixels to a list for his detector to look for them. He added MailTrack after I shared my test results. But Mr. Tulyaganov said Ugly Email was a hobby project and was not a fully staffed organization with the resources to catch every new mail tracker.", "Trackbuster was more thorough, though it also wasn\u2019t ideal. The service, which works with Gmail, connects with your inbox, scans all your messages for trackers in a temporary folder and purges trackers before spitting the scrubbed messages back into your inbox. Trackbuster also sends weekly reports on the number of emails it found to have trackers.", "In testing the service over two weeks on my work email account, I learned that about 280 of my 1,400 emails, or 20 percent \u2014 including many from public relations professionals pitching me their products \u2014 contained hidden trackers. (I deleted their emails without opening them.)", "But there is a major trade-off with Trackbuster. You have to grant the app access to your messages. The start-up\u2019s privacy policy says it won\u2019t store your emails and it won\u2019t read them except in cases where a user requests technical support or to comply with laws. But that is a big leap of faith for a consumer to take, especially for a young and relatively unknown company.", "What responsibility do email providers like Alphabet\u2019s Google have in all of this? In a statement, Google said that for two years, it has taken steps to prevent users from having their locations, browsers, devices or apps tracked through emails.", "For example, when you read email on Gmail.com or the official Google Mail apps for iPhone or Android, images are intercepted and rewritten on a server between the sender and the recipient. That makes it impossible for the sender to receive detailed information like the recipient\u2019s location, device or app used.", "\u201cSince we launched Gmail we\u2019ve worked to make it the most secure email service available,\u201d the company said in a statement.", "Some privacy advocates have gotten enterprising about circumventing email trackers. Mr. Quintin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation says he sets up his devices to dodge the trackers in two ways. Inside Gmail.com, there is a setting that requires Gmail to ask for your permission before displaying images in an email. Clicking \u201cno\u201d to that request will prevent images, including invisible tracking pixels, from loading.", "For another, he sets up his email apps \u2014 the desktop client Thunderbird and the Android app K-9 Mail \u2014 to disable HTML, the standard web language that trackers use to ping external servers. That can prevent the loading of other components, like fonts, that contain tracking code, according to Mr. Quintin.", "Those two solutions combined aren\u2019t foolproof against trackers. If you visit any web links inside an email, chances are that they will still detect that you clicked on them. Taking these steps also makes it likely that your emails end up looking ugly.", "I opted to disable Trackbuster because of the sensitivity of my work emails. I also turned off Ugly Email because it did not appear to detect many trackers. Then I heeded some of Mr. Quintin\u2019s advice and configured Gmail to ask for permission before loading an image, and I also set up the iPhone\u2019s built-in mail app to prevent images from loading automatically.", "It\u2019s not perfect, but it was the best I could do without ruining my email experience."], "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/science/breakthrough-prize-science-awards.html": ["MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 Movie stars.

Chief among them: Why, if there were confirmed Islamic State targets that could be hit without killing civilians, were they not hit more heavily long ago? And what, in fact, was being hit?", "More broadly, the Raqqa airstrikes are renewing a debate about how effective such attacks can be in defeating or containing the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, without more commitment to measures like drying up its financial support, combating its ideology or \u2014 what outside forces on all sides so far appear to have ruled out \u2014 conducting a ground assault.", "Several people in Lebanon, Syria and Turkey who have been able to make contact with relatives in Raqqa say the recent French airstrikes \u2014 a barrage of about 30 on Sunday night and seven more on Monday \u2014 did not kill any civilians.

Adelphi specializes in what others overlook, bringing together underappreciated literary titans like Robert Walser alongside fantasy novels, Tibetan religious texts and popular books on animal behavior. How a publishing house can unite such disparate things, and not go bankrupt, is the subject of Mr. Calasso\u2019s new memoir, \u201cThe Art of the Publisher,\u201d which comes out this week in Britain and the United States. By phone from Milan, Mr. Calasso said that Adelphi\u2019s interests have long stumped its critics. \u201cAt the beginning,\u201d he said, \u201cwe were considered rather eccentric and aristocratic. Then, when we started to have remarkable commercial successes, we were accused of being too populist. That was curious because we were publishing exactly the same books.\u201d", "Q. Where does the idea of publishing as an art form come from?", "A. It starts with the greatest of publishers and printers, Aldus Manutius, who lived in the Renaissance. He was the first one who considered how books should be presented. He invented the form of the paperback. He called it libelli portatiles, a portable book. In the 20th century, the best example may be Kurt Wolff. He\u2019s famous now because he was the first publisher of Kafka. But he published totally unknown writers who were very different from each other but who belonged, in some way, to the same literary landscape.", "Q. Starting in the 1970s, Adelphi championed a lot of Mitteleuropean authors like Joseph Roth and Arthur Schnitzler. Is it surprising to see how they have infiltrated popular culture?", "A. We had no idea these people would become so popular. At the time some were not even in print in Germany. The reason why we published them was not about a kind of geographical inclination. You cannot do without Vienna in a way. From Joseph Roth to Wittgenstein from Adolf Loos to Schiele, they are all essential figures of the 20th century. I remember, when I myself was translating Karl Kraus\u2019s aphorisms, I met Erich Linder, who was maybe the greatest literary agent of those years. He told me, \u201cYa, that\u2019s good that you\u2019re doing Kraus. You\u2019ll sell 20 copies.\u201d By now Kraus is near his 20th printing.

Not the simple fact of digitization, which I\u2019m not scared of, but that in the mind of some people, these two terms conflate. But they are opposites, sometimes.", "Q. Do you worry that Adelphi won\u2019t find a new generation of Italian readers?", "A. One is never quite sure about that. Last year, we published \u201cSeven Brief Lessons on Physics,\u201d a book by a brilliant Italian physicist, Carlo Rovelli, which now has sold 300,000 copies. That is astonishing not only in Italy but anywhere. It\u2019s a book by an author who is unknown to the general public, on physics which is not the easiest subject, and it obviously reached a huge public by only its pure force. So that is a very good sign.", "Q. Do you think publishers who follow your example are guaranteed some measure of commercial success?", "A. There are no guarantees at all. You can do very good things and go bankrupt. And you can do the same things or similar things and have success. One of the fascinating things about publishing is the risk is immensely high and you\u2019re never sure of anything.

He swears he\u2019s in love with Laura, although Anika is still very attached, suddenly pregnant \u2014 was it that ridiculous post-kidnapping tryst? \u2014 and very determined to keep the baby. Hakeem\u2019s dueling relationship woes are fusing into a suspense thriller subplot with Anika as predatory jilted ex losing touch with reality and Laura as unwitting mark. I have clamored for a story for Anika in this space before, but her character\u2019s path from fearless, educated businesswoman to psychotic, vengeful baby mama with a secret Hakeem shrine in her home is disheartening. Even in defeat, Empire\u2019s male villains get to keep their self-respect. Can we have the same for the women?", "Our arch male villain Lucious continued his drive to reunite the family this week. He\u2019s entrusted Andre, the son he long neglected as a powerless pawn, with handling the particulars in the thrust to push Empire into the streaming music business on a whim, as he assisted Jamal in pulling together his Pepsi ad campaign. Before long the eldest Lyon will come calling on Hakeem to return to the fold, too, and it\u2019s getting increasingly tricky to discern whether the patriarch is acting as a hip-hop King Lear looking to cede the reins of the kingdom to worthy successors or a tyrant taking stock of his puppets. Chances are, with Lucious, it\u2019s a bit of both.", "Here are three guest stars of interest from episode 9:", "\u2022 \u201cEmpire\u201d creator Lee Daniels appeared on his own show this week, as himself of course. He shows up briefly as the director of Jamal\u2019s Pepsi commercial and an inspiration for Lucious charging full bore into the streaming music biz. Daniels didn\u2019t need to establish himself as a force larger than his own characters in his appearance here. Imagine Shonda Rhimes popping in on \u201cScandal\u201d as royalty for a sense of how absurd it was.", "\u2022 Rosie O\u2019Donnell appeared as Cookie\u2019s jail buddy Pepper, a smart, tough chef who parlays a penitentiary cook position into a lucrative Philadelphia pastry business. Pepper is instrumental in helping Cookie and Candace locate a strung out Carol, and there is the sense that she is selling more than cupcakes and pies, as Cookie peeks into her kitchen and sees a towering goon without the slightest predilection for the sugary arts. It\u2019s not clear what role Pepper might have in the show beyond the cameo, as most of this season\u2019s action takes place in New York, not Philly, but Rosie\u2019s quick turn already ranks among season two\u2019s better guest spots.", "\u2022 Alicia Keys starred this week as Skye Summers, a pop star grown weary of her own propensity for \u201cgirl power\u201d anthems who has come to Lucious and Jamal to dirty up her sound. Jamal, a self-professed \u201csuperfan\u201d feels he has just the song for her, and throughout the episode they craft a duet called \u201cPowerful,\u201d which, hilariously, scans at surface level as more of the same sound she\u2019s eager to escape. Regardless, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a creative chemistry present between Jamal and Skye, but the episode ends by complicating that with a passionate kiss. Jamal identifies as gay, but it\u2019s fine for him to be more fluid than advertised. Sexuality is capricious and often surprising. But \u201cEmpire\u201d has played mad scientist with Jamal\u2019s love life all season with very little to show for it. He, and we, deserve better."]}
